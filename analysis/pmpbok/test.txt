      The outcomes of these projects were the result of leaders and managers applying project management practices,
   principles, processes, tools, and techniques to their work. The managers of these projects used a set of key skills and





   applied knowledge to satisfy their customers and other people involved in and affected by the project. By the mid-20th
   century, project managers began the work of seeking recognition for project management as a profession. One aspect
   of this work involved obtaining agreement on the content of the body of knowledge (BOK) called project management.
   This BOK became known as the Project Management Body of Knowledge (PMBOK). The Project Management Institute
   (PMI) produced a baseline of charts and glossaries for the PMBOK. Project managers soon realized that no single book
   could contain the entire PMBOK. Therefore, PMI developed and published A Guide to the Project Management Body of
   Knowledge (PMBOK(R) Guide).
      PMI defines the project management body of knowledge (PMBOK) as a term that describes the knowledge within the
   profession of project management. The project management body of knowledge includes proven traditional practices
   that are widely applied as well as innovative practices that are emerging in the profession.




                                                                                                                        1
  The body of knowledge (BOK) includes both published and unpublished materials. This body of knowledge is
constantly evolving. This PMBOK(R) Guide identifies a subset of the project management body of knowledge that is
generally recognized as good practice.
     Generally recognized means the knowledge and practices described are applicable to most projects most of the
    uu
       time, and there is consensus about their value and usefulness.
     Good practice means there is general agreement that the application of the knowledge, skills, tools, and techniques
    uu
       to project management processes can enhance the chance of success over many projects in delivering the
       expected business values and results.
   The project manager works with the project team and other stakeholders to determine and use the appropriate
generally recognized good practices for each project. Determining the appropriate combination of processes, inputs,
tools, techniques, outputs and life cycle phases to manage a project is referred to as "tailoring" the application of the
knowledge described in this guide.
   This PMBOK(R) Guide is different from a methodology. A methodology is a system of practices, techniques,
procedures, and rules used by those who work in a discipline. This PMBOK(R) Guide is a foundation upon which
organizations can build methodologies, policies, procedures, rules, tools and techniques, and life cycle phases
needed to practice project management.



1.1.1 THE STANDARD FOR PROJECT MANAGEMENT
   This guide is based on The Standard for Project Management [1]. A standard is a document established by an authority,
custom, or general consent as a model or example. As an American National Standards Institute (ANSI) standard, The
Standard for Project Management was developed using a process based on the concepts of consensus, openness, due
process, and balance. The Standard for Project Management is a foundational reference for PMI's project management
professional development programs and the practice of project management. Because project management needs to
be tailored to fit the needs of the project, the standard and the guide are both based on descriptive practices, rather
than prescriptive practices. Therefore, the standard identifies the processes that are considered good practices on most
projects, most of the time. The standard also identifies the inputs and outputs that are usually associated with those
processes. The standard does not require that any particular process or practice be performed. The Standard for Project
Management is included as Part II of A Guide to the Project Management Body of Knowledge (PMBOK(R) Guide).
  The PMBOK(R) Guide provides more detail about key concepts, emerging trends, considerations for tailoring the project
management processes, and information on how tools and techniques are applied to projects. Project managers may
use one or more methodologies to implement the project management processes outlined in the standard.




                                                                                                          Part 1 - Guide

   The scope of this guide is limited to the discipline of project management, rather than the full spectrum of portfolios,
programs, and projects. Portfolios and programs will be addressed only to the degree they interact with projects. PMI
publishes two other standards that address the management of portfolios and programs:
    The Standard for Portfolio Management [2], and
   uu

    The Standard for Program Management [3].
   uu



1.1.2 COMMON VOCABULARY
   A common vocabulary is an essential element of a professional discipline. The PMI Lexicon of Project Management
Terms [4] provides the foundational professional vocabulary that can be consistently used by organizations, portfolio,
program, and project managers and other project stakeholders. The Lexicon will continue to evolve over time. The
glossary to this guide includes the vocabulary in the Lexicon along with additional definitions. There may be other
industry-specific terms used in projects that are defined by that industry's literature.



1.1.3 CODE OF ETHICS AND PROFESSIONAL CONDUCT
   PMI publishes the Code of Ethics and Professional Conduct [5] to instill confidence in the project management
profession and to help an individual in making wise decisions, particularly when faced with difficult situations where the
individual may be asked to compromise his or her integrity or values. The values that the global project management
community defined as most important were responsibility, respect, fairness, and honesty. The Code of Ethics and
Professional Conduct affirms these four values as its foundation.
   The Code of Ethics and Professional Conduct includes both aspirational standards and mandatory standards. The
aspirational standards describe the conduct that practitioners, who are also PMI members, certification holders, or
volunteers, strive to uphold. Although adherence to the aspirational standards is not easily measured, conduct in
accordance with these is an expectation for those who consider themselves to be professionals--it is not optional. The
mandatory standards establish firm requirements and, in some cases, limit or prohibit practitioner behavior. Practitioners
who are also PMI members, certification holders, or volunteers and who do not conduct themselves in accordance with
these standards will be subject to disciplinary procedures before PMI's Ethics Review Committee.




                                                                                                                         3
1.2 FOUNDATIONAL ELEMENTS
  This section describes foundational elements necessary for working in and understanding the discipline of project
management.


1.2.1 PROJECTS
    A project is a temporary endeavor undertaken to create a unique product, service, or result.
     Unique product, service, or result. Projects are undertaken to fulfill objectives by producing deliverables.
    uu
        An objective is defined as an outcome toward which work is to be directed, a strategic position to be attained,
        a purpose to be achieved, a result to be obtained, a product to be produced, or a service to be performed.
        A deliverable is defined as any unique and verifiable product, result, or capability to perform a service that is
        required to be produced to complete a process, phase, or project. Deliverables may be tangible or intangible.
        Fulfillment of project objectives may produce one or more of the following deliverables:
        nuA  unique product that can be either a component of another item, an enhancement or correction to an item,
           or a new end item in itself (e.g., the correction of a defect in an end item);
        nuA  unique service or a capability to perform a service (e.g., a business function that supports production
           or distribution);
        nuA unique result, such as an outcome or document (e.g., a research project that develops knowledge that can
           be used to determine whether a trend exists or a new process will benefit society); and
        nuA unique combination of one or more products, services, or results (e.g., a software application, its associated
           documentation, and help desk services).
        Repetitive elements may be present in some project deliverables and activities. This repetition does not change
        the fundamental and unique characteristics of the project work. For example, office buildings can be constructed
        with the same or similar materials and by the same or different teams. However, each building project remains
        unique in key characteristics (e.g., location, design, environment, situation, people involved).
        Projects are undertaken at all organizational levels. A project can involve a single individual or a group. A project
        can involve a single organizational unit or multiple organizational units from multiple organizations.




                                                                                                              Part 1 - Guide

      Examples of projects include but are not limited to:
      nuDeveloping a new pharmaceutical compound for market,
      nuExpanding a tour guide service,
      nuMerging two organizations,
      nuImproving a business process within an organization,
      nuAcquiring and installing a new computer hardware system for use in an organization,
      nuExploring for oil in a region,
      nuModifying a computer software program used in an organization,
      nuConducting research to develop a new manufacturing process, and
      nuConstructing a building.

    Temporary endeavor. The temporary nature of projects indicates that a project has a definite beginning and end.
   uu
      Temporary does not necessarily mean a project has a short duration. The end of the project is reached when one
      or more of the following is true:
      nuThe project's objectives have been achieved;
      nuThe objectives will not or cannot be met;
      nuFunding is exhausted or no longer available for allocation to the project;
      nuThe need for the project no longer exists (e.g., the customer no longer wants the project completed, a change
         in strategy or priority ends the project, the organizational management provides direction to end the project);
      nuThe human or physical resources are no longer available; or
      nuThe project is terminated for legal cause or convenience.

      Projects are temporary, but their deliverables may exist beyond the end of the project. Projects may produce
      deliverables of a social, economic, material, or environmental nature. For example, a project to build a national
      monument will create a deliverable expected to last for centuries.






                                                                                                                      5
     Projects drive change. Projects drive change in organizations. From a business perspective, a project is aimed
    uu
       at moving an organization from one state to another state in order to achieve a specific objective (see Figure 1-1).
       Before the project begins, the organization is commonly referred to as being in the current state. The desired
       result of the change driven by the project is described as the future state.
       For some projects, this may involve creating a transition state where multiple steps are made along a continuum
       to achieve the future state. The successful completion of a project results in the organization moving to the
       future state and achieving the specific objective. For more information on project management and change, see
       Managing Change in Organizations: A Practice Guide [6].

 Projects enable business value creation. PMI defines business value as the net quantifiable benefit derived
uu
   from a business endeavor. The benefit may be tangible, intangible, or both. In business analysis, business value is
   considered the return, in the form of elements such as time, money, goods, or intangibles in return for something
   exchanged (see Business Analysis for Practitioners: A Practice Guide, p. 185 [7]).
   Business value in projects refers to the benefit that the results of a specific project provide to its stakeholders.
   The benefit from projects may be tangible, intangible, or both.
   Examples of tangible elements include:
   nuMonetary assets,
   nuStockholder equity,
   nuUtility,
   nuFixtures,
   nuTools, and
   nuMarket share.

   Examples of intangible elements include:
   nuGoodwill,
   nuBrand recognition,
   nuPublic benefit,
   nuTrademarks,
   nuStrategic alignment, and
   nuReputation.

 Project Initiation Context. Organizational leaders initiate projects in response to factors acting upon their
uu
   organizations. There are four fundamental categories for these factors, which illustrate the context of a project
   (see Figure 1-2):
   nuMeet regulatory, legal, or social requirements;
   nuSatisfy stakeholder requests or needs;
   nuImplement or change business or technological strategies; and
   nuCreate, improve, or fix products, processes, or services.




                                                                                                                     7

                           or Fix Products,                                             Change Business
                            Processes, or                                               or Technological
                               Services                                                     Strategies




                                              Figure 1-2. Project Initiation Context



   These factors influence an organization's ongoing operations and business strategies. Leaders respond to these
factors in order to keep the organization viable. Projects provide the means for organizations to successfully make the
changes necessary to deal with these factors. These factors ultimately should link to the strategic objectives of the
organization and the business value of each project.
    Table 1-1 illustrates how example factors could align with one or more of the fundamental factor categories.

   1.2.2 THE IMPORTANCE OF PROJECT MANAGEMENT
      Project management is the application of knowledge, skills, tools, and techniques to project activities to meet the
   project requirements. Project management is accomplished through the appropriate application and integration of the
   project management processes identified for the project. Project management enables organizations to execute projects
   effectively and efficiently.
        Effective project management helps individuals, groups, and public and private organizations to:
         Meet business objectives;
        uu

         Satisfy stakeholder expectations;
        uu

         Be more predictable;
        uu

         Increase chances of success;
        uu

         Deliver the right products at the right time;
        uu

         Resolve problems and issues;
        uu

         Respond to risks in a timely manner;
        uu

         Optimize the use of organizational resources;
        uu

         Identify, recover, or terminate failing projects;
        uu

         Manage constraints (e.g., scope, quality, schedule, costs, resources);
        uu

         Balance the influence of constraints on the project (e.g., increased scope may increase cost or schedule); and
        uu

         Manage change in a better manner.
        uu

        Poorly managed projects or the absence of project management may result in:
         Missed deadlines,
        uu

         Cost overruns,
        uu

         Poor quality,
        uu

         Rework,
        uu





         Uncontrolled expansion of the project,
        uu





         Loss of reputation for the organization,
        uu

         Unsatisfied stakeholders, and
        uu

         Failure in achieving the objectives for which the project was undertaken.
        uu

      Projects are a key way to create value and benefits in organizations. In today's business environment, organizational
   leaders need to be able to manage with tighter budgets, shorter timelines, scarcity of resources, and rapidly changing
   technology. The business environment is dynamic with an accelerating rate of change. To remain competitive in the
   world economy, companies are embracing project management to consistently deliver business value.




                                                                                                            Part 1 - Guide

      Effective and efficient project management should be considered a strategic competency within organizations. It enables
   organizations to:
       Tie project results to business goals,
      uu

       Compete more effectively in their markets,
      uu

       Sustain the organization, and
      uu

       Respond to the impact of business environment changes on projects by appropriately adjusting project
      uu
          management plans (see Section 4.2).


   1.2.3 RELATIONSHIP OF PROJECT, PROGRAM, PORTFOLIO, AND OPERATIONS MANAGEMENT

   1.2.3.1 OVERVIEW

      Using project management processes, tools, and techniques puts in place a sound foundation for organizations to
   achieve their goals and objectives. A project may be managed in three separate scenarios: as a stand-alone project
   (outside of a portfolio or program), within a program, or within a portfolio. Project managers interact with portfolio and
   program managers when a project is within a program or portfolio. For example, multiple projects may be needed to
   accomplish a set of goals and objectives for an organization. In those situations, projects may be grouped together into
   a program. A program is defined as a group of related projects, subsidiary programs, and program activities managed in
   a coordinated manner to obtain benefits not available from managing them individually. Programs are not large projects.
   A very large project may be referred to as a megaproject. As a guideline, megaprojects cost US$1billion or more, affect
   1 million or more people, and run for years.
      Some organizations may employ the use of a project portfolio to effectively manage multiple programs and projects
   that are underway at any given time. A portfolio is defined as projects, programs, subsidiary portfolios, and operations
   managed as a group to achieve strategic objectives. Figure 1-3 illustrates an example of how portfolios, programs,
   projects, and operations are related in a specific situation.
      Program management and portfolio management differ from project management in their life cycles, activities,
   objectives, focus, and benefits. However, portfolios, programs, projects, and operations often engage with the same
   stakeholders and may need to use the same resources (see Figure 1-3), which may result in a conflict in the organization.





   This type of a situation increases the need for coordination within the organization through the use of portfolio, program,





   and project management to achieve a workable balance in the organization.




                                                                                                                           11
   Figure 1-3 illustrates a sample portfolio structure indicating relationships between the programs, projects, shared
resources, and stakeholders. The portfolio components are grouped together in order to facilitate the effective governance
and management of the work that helps to achieve organizational strategies and priorities. Organizational and portfolio
planning impact the components by means of prioritization based on risk, funding, and other considerations. The
portfolio view allows organizations to see how the strategic goals are reflected in the portfolio. This portfolio view
also enables the implementation and coordination of appropriate portfolio, program, and project governance. This
coordinated governance allows authorized allocation of human, financial, and physical resources based on expected
performance and benefits.

   1.2.3.2 PROGRAM MANAGEMENT

      Program management is defined as the application of knowledge, skills, and principles to a program to achieve the
   program objectives and to obtain benefits and control not available by managing program components individually.
   A program component refers to projects and other programs within a program. Project management focuses on
   interdependencies within a project to determine the optimal approach for managing the project. Program management
   focuses on the interdependencies between projects and between projects and the program level to determine the
   optimal approach for managing them. Actions related to these program and project-level interdependencies may include:
         Aligning with the organizational or strategic direction that affects program and project goals and objectives;
        uu

         Allocating the program scope into program components;
        uu

         Managing interdependencies among the components of the program to best serve the program;
        uu

         Managing program risks that may impact multiple projects in the program;
        uu

         Resolving constraints and conflicts that affect multiple projects within the program;
        uu

         Resolving issues between component projects and the program level;
        uu

         Managing change requests within a shared governance framework;

         Allocating budgets across multiple projects within the program; and
        uu

         Assuring benefits realization from the program and component projects.

      An example of a program is a new communications satellite system with projects for the design and construction of
   the satellite and the ground stations, the launch of the satellite, and the integration of the system.

      Portfolio management is defined as the centralized management of one or more portfolios to achieve strategic
   objectives. The programs or projects of the portfolio may not necessarily be interdependent or directly related.
     The aim of portfolio management is to:

     Portfolio management also confirms that the portfolio is consistent with and aligned with organizational strategies.
      Maximizing the value of the portfolio requires careful examination of the components that comprise the portfolio.
   Components are prioritized so that those contributing the most to the organization's strategic objectives have the
   required financial, team, and physical resources.
      For example, an infrastructure organization that has the strategic objective of maximizing the return on its investments
   may put together a portfolio that includes a mix of projects in oil and gas, power, water, roads, rail, and airports. From
   this mix, the organization may choose to manage related projects as one portfolio. All of the power projects may be
   grouped together as a power portfolio. Similarly, all of the water projects may be grouped together as a water portfolio.
   However, when the organization has projects in designing and constructing a power plant and then operates the power
   plant to generate energy, those related projects can be grouped in one program. Thus, the power program and similar
   water program become integral components of the portfolio of the infrastructure organization.
     For more information on portfolio management, see The Standard for Portfolio Management [2].

1.2.3.4 OPERATIONS MANAGEMENT

     Operations management is an area that is outside the scope of formal project management as described in this guide.
  Operations management is concerned with the ongoing production of goods and/or services. It ensures that business
operations continue efficiently by using the optimal resources needed to meet customer demands. It is concerned with
managing processes that transform inputs (e.g., materials, components, energy, and labor) into outputs (e.g., products,
goods, and/or services).

1.2.3.5 OPERATIONS AND PROJECT MANAGEMENT

  Changes in business or organizational operations may be the focus of a project--especially when there are substantial
changes to business operations as a result of a new product or service delivery. Ongoing operations are outside of the
scope of a project; however, there are intersecting points where the two areas cross.
     Projects can intersect with operations at various points during the product life cycle, such as;
      When developing a new product, upgrading a product, or expanding outputs;
     uu

      While improving operations or the product development process;
     uu

      At the end of the product life cycle; and
     uu

      At each closeout phase.
     uu

   At each point, deliverables and knowledge are transferred between the project and operations for implementation of
the delivered work. This implementation occurs through a transfer of project resources or knowledge to operations or
through a transfer of operational resources to the project.

1.2.3.6 ORGANIZATIONAL PROJECT MANAGEMENT (OPM) AND STRATEGIES

  Portfolios, programs, and projects are aligned with or driven by organizational strategies and differ in the way each
contributes to the achievement of strategic goals:
      Portfolio management aligns portfolios with organizational strategies by selecting the right programs or projects,
     uu
         prioritizing the work, and providing the needed resources.
      Program management harmonizes its program components and controls interdependencies in order to realize
     uu
         specified benefits.
      Project management enables the achievement of organizational goals and objectives.
     uu




                                                                                                         Part 1 - Guide
16
      Within portfolios or programs, projects are a means of achieving organizational goals and objectives. This is often
   accomplished in the context of a strategic plan that is the primary factor guiding investments in projects. Alignment
   with the organization's strategic business goals can be achieved through the systematic management of portfolios,
   programs, and projects through the application of organizational project management (OPM). OPM is defined as a
   framework in which portfolio, program, and project management are integrated with organizational enablers in order to
   achieve strategic objectives.
      The purpose of OPM is to ensure that the organization undertakes the right projects and allocates critical resources
   appropriately. OPM also helps to ensure that all levels in the organization understand the strategic vision, the initiatives
   that support the vision, the objectives, and the deliverables. Figure 1-4 shows the organizational environment where
   strategy, portfolio, programs, projects, and operations interact.
     For more information on OPM, refer to Implementing Organizational Project Management: A Practice Guide [8].

   1.2.4 COMPONENTS OF THE GUIDE
      Projects comprise several key components that, when effectively managed, result in their successful completion.
   This guide identifies and explains these components. The various components interrelate to one another during the
   management of a project.
      The key components are described briefly in Table 1-3. These components are more fully explained in the sections
   that follow the table.




                                                                                                                            17

1.2.4.1 PROJECT AND DEVELOPMENT LIFE CYCLES

   A project life cycle is the series of phases that a project passes through from its start to its completion. It provides
the basic framework for managing the project. This basic framework applies regardless of the specific project work
involved. The phases may be sequential, iterative, or overlapping. All projects can be mapped to the generic life cycle
shown in Figure 1-5.
   Project life cycles can be predictive or adaptive. Within a project life cycle, there are generally one or more phases
that are associated with the development of the product, service, or result. These are called a development life cycle.
Development life cycles can be predictive, iterative, incremental, adaptive, or a hybrid model:
    In a predictive life cycle, the project scope, time, and cost are determined in the early phases of the life cycle. Any
   uu
       changes to the scope are carefully managed. Predictive life cycles may also be referred to as waterfall life cycles.
    In an iterative life cycle, the project scope is generally determined early in the project life cycle, but time
   uu
       and cost estimates are routinely modified as the project team's understanding of the product increases.
       Iterations develop the product through a series of repeated cycles, while increments successively add to the
       functionality of the product.
    In an incremental life cycle, the deliverable is produced through a series of iterations that successively add
   uu
       functionality within a predetermined time frame. The deliverable contains the necessary and sufficient capability
       to be considered complete only after the final iteration.
    Adaptive life cycles are agile, iterative, or incremental. The detailed scope is defined and approved before the start
   uu
       of an iteration. Adaptive life cycles are also referred to as agile or change-driven life cycles. See Appendix X3.
    A hybrid life cycle is a combination of a predictive and an adaptive life cycle. Those elements of the project that
   uu
       are well known or have fixed requirements follow a predictive development life cycle, and those elements that
       are still evolving follow an adaptive development life cycle.
  It is up to the project management team to determine the best life cycle for each project. The project life cycle
needs to be flexible enough to deal with the variety of factors included in the project. Life cycle flexibility may be
accomplished by:
    Identifying the process or processes needed to be performed in each phase,
   uu

    Performing the process or processes identified in the appropriate phase,
   uu

    Adjusting the various attributes of a phase (e.g., name, duration, exit criteria, and entrance criteria).
   uu

    Project life cycles are independent of product life cycles, which may be produced by a project. A product life cycle
is the series of phases that represent the evolution of a product, from concept through delivery, growth, maturity, and
to retirement.




                                                                                                                            19
1.2.4.2 PROJECT PHASE

   A project phase is a collection of logically related project activities that culminates in the completion of one or more
deliverables. The phases in a life cycle can be described by a variety of attributes. Attributes may be measurable and
unique to a specific phase. Attributes may include but are not limited to:
      Name (e.g., Phase A, Phase B, Phase 1, Phase 2, proposal phase),
     uu

      Number (e.g., three phases in the project, five phases in the project),
     uu

      Duration (e.g., 1 week, 1 month, 1 quarter),
     uu

      Resource requirements (e.g., people, buildings, equipment),
     uu

      Entrance criteria for a project to move into that phase (e.g., specified approvals documented, specified documents
     uu
        completed), and
      Exit criteria for a project to complete a phase (e.g., documented approvals, completed documents, completed
     uu
        deliverables).
   Projects may be separated into distinct phases or subcomponents. These phases or subcomponents are generally
given names that indicate the type of work done in that phase. Examples of phase names include but are not limited to:
      Concept development,
     uu

      Feasibility study,
     uu

      Customer requirements,
     uu

      Solution development,
     uu

      Design,
     uu

      Prototype,
     uu

      Build,
     uu

      Test,
     uu

      Transition,
     uu

      Commissioning,
     uu

      Milestone review, and
     uu

      Lessons learned.
     uu




                                                                                                            Part 1 - Guide
20
  The project phases may be established based on various factors including, but not limited to:
    Management needs;
   uu

    Nature of the project;
   uu

    Unique characteristics of the organization, industry, or technology;
   uu

    Project elements including, but not limited to, technology, engineering, business, process, or legal; and
   uu

    Decision points (e.g., funding, project go/no-go, and milestone review).
   uu

   Using multiple phases may provide better insight to managing the project. It also provides an opportunity to assess
the project performance and take necessary corrective or preventive actions in subsequent phases. A key component
used with project phases is the phase review (see Section 1.2.4.3).

1.2.4.3 PHASE GATE

  A phase gate, is held at the end of a phase. The project's performance and progress are compared to project and
business documents including but not limited to:
    Project business case (see Section 1.2.6.1),
   uu

    Project charter (see Section 4.1),
   uu

    Project management plan (see Section 4.2), and
   uu

    Benefits management plan (see Section 1.2.6.2).
   uu

  A decision (e.g., go/no-go decision) is made as a result of this comparison to:
    Continue to the next phase,
   uu

    Continue to the next phase with modification,
   uu

    End the project,
   uu

    Remain in the phase, or
   uu

    Repeat the phase or elements of it.
   uu

   Depending on the organization, industry, or type of work, phase gates may be referred to by other terms such as,
phase review, stage gate, kill point, and phase entrance or phase exit. Organizations may use these reviews to examine
other pertinent items which are beyond the scope of this guide, such as product-related documents or models.




                                                                                                                   21
1.2.4.4 PROJECT MANAGEMENT PROCESSES

   The project life cycle is managed by executing a series of project management activities known as project
management processes. Every project management process produces one or more outputs from one or more inputs by
using appropriate project management tools and techniques. The output can be a deliverable or an outcome. Outcomes
are an end result of a process. Project management processes apply globally across industries.
   Project management processes are logically linked by the outputs they produce. Processes may contain overlapping
activities that occur throughout the project. The output of one process generally results in either:
      An input to another process, or
     uu

      A deliverable of the project or project phase.
     uu

  Figure 1-6 shows an example of how inputs, tools and techniques, and outputs relate to each other within a process,
and with other processes.

                             Inputs                  Tools & Techniques                  Outputs

                     .1 Input H                      .1 Technique A               .1 Project Output A
                     .2 Input J                      .2 Tool C                    .2 Project Output B




                                  Figure 1-6. Example Process: Inputs, Tools & Techniques, and Outputs



   The number of process iterations and interactions between processes varies based on the needs of the project.
Processes generally fall into one of three categories:
      Processes used once or at predefined points in the project. The processes Develop Project Charter and Close
     uu
        Project or Phase are examples.
      Processes that are performed periodically as needed. The process Acquire Resources is performed as
     uu
        resources are needed. The process Conduct Procurements is performed prior to needing the procured item.
      Processes that are performed continuously throughout the project. The process Define Activities may
     uu
        occur throughout the project life cycle, especially if the project uses rolling wave planning or an adaptive
        development approach. Many of the monitoring and control processes are ongoing from the start of the
        project, until it is closed out.
   Project management is accomplished through the appropriate application and integration of logically grouped project
management processes. While there are different ways of grouping processes, the PMBOK(R) Guide groups processes
into five categories called Process Groups.




                                                                                                         Part 1 - Guide
22
   1.2.4.5 PROJECT MANAGEMENT PROCESS GROUPS

      A Project Management Process Group is a logical grouping of project management processes to achieve specific
   project objectives. Process Groups are independent of project phases. Project management processes are grouped into
   the following five Project Management Process Groups:
       Initiating Process Group. Those processes performed to define a new project or a new phase of an existing
      uu
         project by obtaining authorization to start the project or phase.
       Planning Process Group. Those processes required to establish the scope of the project, refine the objectives,
      uu
         and define the course of action required to attain the objectives that the project was undertaken to achieve.
       Executing Process Group. Those processes performed to complete the work defined in the project management
      uu
         plan to satisfy the project requirements.
       Monitoring and Controlling Process Group. Those processes required to track, review, and regulate the
      uu
         progress and performance of the project; identify any areas in which changes to the plan are required; and
         initiate the corresponding changes.
       Closing Process Group. Those processes performed to formally complete or close the project, phase, or contract.
      uu

      Process flow diagrams are used throughout this guide. The project management processes are linked by
   specific inputs and outputs where the result or outcome of one process may become the input to another process
   that is not necessarily in the same Process Group. Note that Process Groups are not the same as project phases
   (see Section 1.2.4.2).

   1.2.4.6 PROJECT MANAGEMENT KNOWLEDGE AREAS

      In addition to Process Groups, processes are also categorized by Knowledge Areas. A Knowledge Area is an identified
   area of project management defined by its knowledge requirements and described in terms of its component processes,
   practices, inputs, outputs, tools, and techniques.
     Although the Knowledge Areas are interrelated, they are defined separately from the project management perspective.
   The ten Knowledge Areas identified in this guide are used in most projects most of the time. The ten Knowledge Areas
   described in this guide are:





       Project Integration Management. Includes the processes and activities to identify, define, combine, unify,
      uu
         and coordinate the various processes and project management activities within the Project Management





         Process Groups.
       Project Scope Management. Includes the processes required to ensure the project includes all the work
      uu
         required, and only the work required, to complete the project successfully.




                                                                                                                         23
      Project Schedule Management. Includes the processes required to manage the timely completion of the project.
     uu

      Project Cost Management. Includes the processes involved in planning, estimating, budgeting, financing,

1.2.4.7 PROJECT MANAGEMENT DATA AND INFORMATION

   Throughout the life cycle of a project, a significant amount of data is collected, analyzed, and transformed. Project
data are collected as a result of various processes and are shared within the project team. The collected data
are analyzed in context, aggregated, and transformed to become project information during various processes.
Information is communicated verbally or stored and distributed in various formats as reports. See Section 4.3 for
more detail on this topic.
  Project data are regularly collected and analyzed throughout the project life cycle. The following definitions identify
key terminology regarding project data and information:
      Work performance data. The raw observations and measurements identified during activities performed to
     uu
         carry out the project work. Examples include reported percent of work physically completed, quality and technical
         performance measures, start and finish dates of schedule activities, number of change requests, number of
         defects, actual costs, actual durations, etc. Project data are usually recorded in a Project Management Information
         System (PMIS) (see Section 4.3.2.2) and in project documents.
      Work performance information. The performance data collected from various controlling processes, analyzed
     uu
         in context and integrated based on relationships across areas. Examples of performance information are status
         of deliverables, implementation status for change requests, and forecast estimates to complete.
      Work performance reports. The physical or electronic representation of work performance information
     uu
         compiled in project documents, which is intended to generate decisions or raise issues, actions, or
         awareness. Examples include status reports, memos, justifications, information notes, electronic dashboards,
         recommendations, and updates.
     Figure 1-7 shows the flow of project information across the various processes used in managing the project.

   1.2.5 TAILORING
      Usually, project managers apply a project management methodology to their work. A methodology is a system of
   practices, techniques, procedures, and rules used by those who work in a discipline. This definition makes it clear that
   this guide itself is not a methodology.
      This guide and The Standard for Project Management [1] are recommended references for tailoring, because these
   standard documents identify the subset of the project management body of knowledge that is generally recognized as
   good practice. "Good practice" does not mean that the knowledge described should always be applied uniformly to all
   projects. Specific methodology recommendations are outside the scope of this guide.
        Project management methodologies may be:
         Developed by experts within the organization,
        uu

         Purchased from vendors,
        uu

         Obtained from professional associations, or
        uu

         Acquired from government agencies.
        uu

       The appropriate project management processes, inputs, tools, techniques, outputs, and life cycle phases should be
   selected to manage a project. This selection activity is known as tailoring project management to the project. The project
   manager collaborates with the project team, sponsor, organizational management, or some combination thereof, in the
   tailoring. In some cases, the organization may require specific project management methodologies be used.
      Tailoring is necessary because each project is unique; not every process, tool, technique, input, or output identified
   in the PMBOK(R) Guide is required on every project. Tailoring should address the competing constraints of scope,
   schedule, cost, resources, quality, and risk. The importance of each constraint is different for each project, and the
   project manager tailors the approach for managing these constraints based on the project environment, organizational
   culture, stakeholder needs, and other variables.
      In tailoring project management, the project manager should also consider the varying levels of governance that may
   be required and within which the project will operate, as well as considering the culture of the organization. In addition,
   consideration of whether the customer of the project is internal or external to the organization may affect project
   management tailoring decisions.





      Sound project management methodologies take into account the unique nature of projects and allow tailoring,
   to some extent, by the project manager. However, the tailoring that is included in the methodology may still require





   additional tailoring for a given project.




                                                                                                               Part 1 - Guide

   1.2.6 PROJECT MANAGEMENT BUSINESS DOCUMENTS
     The project manager needs to ensure that the project management approach captures the intent of business
   documents. These documents are defined in Table 1-5. These two documents are interdependent and iteratively
   developed and maintained throughout the life cycle of the project.

                                                Table 1-5. Project Business Documents

               Project Business Documents                                               Definition

             Project business case                  A documented economic feasibility study used to establish the validity of the benefits
                                                    of a selected component lacking sufficient definition and that is used as a basis for
                                                    the authorization of further project management activities.

             Project benefits management plan       The documented explanation defining the processes for creating, maximizing, and
                                                    sustaining the benefits provided by a project.



      The project sponsor is generally accountable for the development and maintenance of the project business case
   document. The project manager is responsible for providing recommendations and oversight to keep the project
   business case, project management plan, project charter, and project benefits management plan success measures in
   alignment with one another and with the goals and objectives of the organization.
      Project managers should appropriately tailor the noted project management documents for their projects. In some
   organizations, the business case and benefits management plan are maintained at the program level. Project managers
   should work with the appropriate program managers to ensure the project management documents are aligned with
   the program documents. Figure 1-8 illustrates the interrelationship of these critical project management business
   documents and the needs assessment. Figure 1-8 shows an approximation of the life cycle of these various documents
   against the project life cycle.

   The project business case is a documented economic feasibility study used to establish the validity of the benefits
of a selected component lacking sufficient definition and that is used as a basis for the authorization of further project
management activities. The business case lists the objectives and reasons for project initiation. It helps measure the
project success at the end of the project against the project objectives. The business case is a project business document
that is used throughout the project life cycle. The business case may be used before the project initiation and may result
in a go/no-go decision for the project.
  A needs assessment often precedes the business case. The needs assessment involves understanding business
goals and objectives, issues, and opportunities and recommending proposals to address them. The results of the needs
assessment may be summarized in the business case document.




                                                                                                               Part 1 - Guide

   The process of defining the business need, analyzing the situation, making recommendations, and defining evaluation
criteria is applicable to any organization's projects. A business case may include but is not limited to documenting
the following:
    Business needs:
   uu

      nuDetermination of what is prompting the need for action;
      nuSituational   statement documenting the business problem or opportunity to be addressed including the value
          to be delivered to the organization;
      nuIdentification of stakeholders affected; and
      nuIdentification of the scope.

    Analysis of the situation:
   uu

      nuIdentification of organizational strategies, goals, and objectives;
      nuIdentification of root cause(s) of the problem or main contributors of an opportunity;
      nuGap analysis of capabilities needed for the project versus existing capabilities of the organization;
      nuIdentification of known risks;
      nuIdentification of critical success factors;
      nuIdentification of decision criteria by which the various courses of action may be assessed;

      Examples of criteria categories used for analysis of a situation are:
          muRequired. This   is a criterion that is "required" to be fulfilled to address the problem or opportunity.
          muDesired. This   is a criterion that is "desired" to be fulfilled to address the problem or opportunity.
          muOptional.This is a criterion that is not essential. Fulfillment of this criterion may become a differentiator
             between alternative courses of action.
      nuIdentification of a set of options to be considered for addressing the business problem or opportunity. Options
          are alternative courses of action that may be taken by the organization. Options may also be described as
          business scenarios. For example, a business case could present the following three options:
          muDo nothing. This is also referred to as the "business as usual" option. Selection of this option results in the
             project not being authorized.
          muDo   the minimum work possible to address the problem or opportunity. The minimum may be established
             by identifying the set of documented criteria that are key in addressing the problem or opportunity.
          muDo  more than the minimum work possible to address the problem or opportunity. This option meets the
             minimum set of criteria and some or all of the other documented criteria. There may be more than one of
             these options documented in the business case.




                                                                                                                        31
      Recommendation:
     uu

       nuA statement of the recommended option to pursue in the project;
       nuItems to include in the statement may include but are not limited to:
          muAnalysis   results for the potential option;
          muConstraints, assumptions, risks, and    dependencies for the potential options;
              and
          muSuccess    measures (see Section 1.2.6.4).
       nuAn implementation approach that may include but is not limited to:
          muMilestones,

          muDependencies, and

          muRoles   and responsibilities.
      Evaluation:
     uu

       nuStatement describing the plan for measuring benefits the project will deliver. This should include any ongoing
          operational aspects of the recommended option beyond initial implementation.
   The business case document provides the basis to measure success and progress throughout the project life cycle
by comparing the results with the objectives and the identified success criteria. See Business Analysis for Practitioners:
A Practice Guide [7].




                                                                                                           Part 1 - Guide

   1.2.6.2 PROJECT BENEFITS MANAGEMENT PLAN

      The project benefits management plan is the document that describes how and when the benefits of the project
   will be delivered, and describes the mechanisms that should be in place to measure those benefits. A project benefit
   is defined as an outcome of actions, behaviors, products, services, or results that provide value to the sponsoring
   organization as well as to the project's intended beneficiaries. Development of the benefits management plan begins
   early in the project life cycle with the definition of the target benefits to be realized. The benefits management plan
   describes key elements of the benefits and may include but is not limited to documenting the following:
       Target benefits (e.g., the expected tangible and intangible value to be gained by the implementation of the
      uu
          project; financial value is expressed as net present value);
       Strategic alignment (e.g., how well the project benefits align to the business strategies of the organization);
      uu

       Timeframe for realizing benefits (e.g., benefits by phase, short-term, long-term, and ongoing);
      uu

       Benefits owner (e.g., the accountable person to monitor, record, and report realized benefits throughout the
      uu
          timeframe established in the plan);
       Metrics (e.g., the measures to be used to show benefits realized, direct measures, and indirect measures);
      uu

       Assumptions (e.g., factors expected to be in place or to be in evidence); and
      uu

       Risks (e.g., risks for realization of benefits).
      uu

      Developing the benefits management plan makes use of the data and information documented in the business case
   and needs assessment. For example, the cost-benefit analyses recorded in the documents illustrate the estimate of
   costs compared to the value of the benefits realized by the project. The benefits management plan and the project
   management plan include a description of how the business value resulting from the project becomes part of the
   organization's ongoing operations, including the metrics to be used. The metrics provide verification of the business
   value and validation of the project's success.
      Development and maintenance of the project benefits management plan is an iterative activity. This document
   complements the business case, project charter, and project management plan. The project manager works with the
   sponsor to ensure that the project charter, project management plan, and the benefits management plan remain in
   alignment throughout the life cycle of the project. See Business Analysis for Practitioners: A Practice Guide [7], The
   Standard for Program Management [3], and The Standard for Portfolio Management [2].






                                                                                                                         33
1.2.6.3 PROJECT CHARTER AND PROJECT MANAGEMENT PLAN

   The project charter is defined as a document issued by the project sponsor that formally authorizes the existence
of a project and provides the project manager with the authority to apply organizational resources to project activities.
  The project management plan is defined as the document that describes how the project will be executed, monitored,
and controlled.
  See Section 4 on Project Integration Management for more information on the project charter and the project
management plan.

1.2.6.4 PROJECT SUCCESS MEASURES

     One of the most common challenges in project management is determining whether or not a project is successful.
   Traditionally, the project management metrics of time, cost, scope, and quality have been the most important factors
in defining the success of a project. More recently, practitioners and scholars have determined that project success
should also be measured with consideration toward achievement of the project objectives.
   Project stakeholders may have different ideas as to what the successful completion of a project will look like and
which factors are the most important. It is critical to clearly document the project objectives and to select objectives that
are measurable. Three questions that the key stakeholders and the project manager should answer are:
      What does success look like for this project?
     uu

      How will success be measured?
     uu

      What factors may impact success?
     uu

  The answer to these questions should be documented and agreed upon by the key stakeholders and the
project manager.
   Project success may include additional criteria linked to the organizational strategy and to the delivery of business
results. These project objectives may include but are not limited to:
      Completing the project benefits management plan;
     uu

      Meeting the agreed-upon financial measures documented in the business case. These financial measures may
     uu
         include but are not limited to:
         nuNet present value (NPV),
         nuReturn on investment (ROI),
         nuInternal rate of return (IRR),
         nuPayback period (PBP), and
         nuBenefit-cost ratio (BCR).




                                                                                                             Part 1 - Guide
34
       Meeting business case nonfinancial objectives;
      uu

       Completing movement of an organization from its current state to the desired future state;
      uu

       Fulfilling contract terms and conditions;
      uu

       Meeting organizational strategy, goals, and objectives;
      uu

       Achieving stakeholder satisfaction;
      uu

       Acceptable customer/end-user adoption;
      uu

       Integration of deliverables into the organization's operating environment;
      uu

       Achieving agreed-upon quality of delivery;
      uu

       Meeting governance criteria; and
      uu

       Achieving other agreed-upon success measures or criteria (e.g., process throughput).
      uu

     The project team needs to be able to assess the project situation, balance the demands, and maintain proactive
   communication with stakeholders in order to deliver a successful project.
      When the business alignment for a project is constant, the chance for project success greatly increases because the
   project remains aligned with the strategic direction of the organization.
      It is possible for a project to be successful from a scope/schedule/budget viewpoint, and to be unsuccessful from a
   business viewpoint. This can occur when there is a change in the business needs or the market environment before the
   project is completed.

    THE EN V IRO NMENT I N WHI C H P ROJEC TS OP ERATE


   2.1 OVERVIEW
      Projects exist and operate in environments that may have an influence on them. These influences can have a favorable
   or unfavorable impact on the project. Two major categories of influences are enterprise environmental factors (EEFs) and
   organizational process assets (OPAs).
     EEFs originate from the environment outside of the project and often outside of the enterprise. EEFs may have an
   impact at the organizational, portfolio, program, or project level. See Section 2.2 for additional information on EEFs.
      OPAs are internal to the organization. These may arise from the organization itself, a portfolio, a program, another
   project, or a combination of these. Figure 2-1 shows the breakdown of project influences into EEFs and OPAs. See
   Section 2.3 for additional information on OPAs.




                                                             Influences




                                         EEFs                                             Internal
                                                                                            OPAs






                                                                           Processes,                Corporate
                             External             Internal                Policies, and              Knowledge
                                                                           Procedures                  Base




                                                   Figure 2-1. Project Influences



      In addition to EEFs and OPAs, organizational systems play a significant role in the life cycle of the project. System
   factors that impact the power, influence, interests, competencies, and political capabilities of the people to act within the
   organizational system are discussed further in the section on organizational systems (see Section 2.4).



                                                                                                                             37
2.2 ENTERPRISE ENVIRONMENTAL FACTORS
    Enterprise environmental factors (EEFs) refer to conditions, not under the control of the project team, that influence,
constrain, or direct the project. These conditions can be internal and/or external to the organization. EEFs are
considered as inputs to many project management processes, specifically for most planning processes. These factors
may enhance or constrain project management options. In addition, these factors may have a positive or negative
influence on the outcome.
  EEFs vary widely in type or nature. These factors need to be considered if the project is to be effective. EEFs include
but are not limited to the factors described in Sections 2.2.1 and 2.2.2.



2.2.1 EEFS INTERNAL TO THE ORGANIZATION
     The following EEFs are internal to the organization:
      Organizational culture, structure, and governance. Examples include vision, mission, values, beliefs, cultural
     uu
         norms, leadership style, hierarchy and authority relationships, organizational style, ethics, and code of conduct.
      Geographic distribution of facilities and resources. Examples include factory locations, virtual teams, shared
     uu
         systems, and cloud computing.
      Infrastructure. Examples include existing facilities, equipment, organizational telecommunications channels,
     uu
         information technology hardware, availability, and capacity.
      Information technology software. Examples include scheduling software tools, configuration management
     uu
         systems, web interfaces to other online automated systems, and work authorization systems.
      Resource availability. Examples include contracting and purchasing constraints, approved providers and
     uu
         subcontractors, and collaboration agreements.
      Employee capability. Examples include existing human resources expertise, skills, competencies, and
     uu
         specialized knowledge.




                                                                                                             Part 1 - Guide
38
   2.2.2 EEFS EXTERNAL TO THE ORGANIZATION
     The following EEFs are external to the organization.
       Marketplace conditions. Examples include competitors, market share brand recognition, and trademarks.
      uu

       Social and cultural influences and issues. Examples include political climate, codes of conduct, ethics,
      uu
          and perceptions.
       Legal restrictions. Examples include country or local laws and regulations related to security, data protection,
      uu
          business conduct, employment, and procurement.
       Commercial databases. Examples include benchmarking results, standardized cost estimating data, industry
      uu
          risk study information, and risk databases.
       Academic research. Examples include industry studies, publications, and benchmarking results.
      uu

       Government or industry standards. Examples include regulatory agency regulations and standards related to
      uu
          products, production, environment, quality, and workmanship.
       Financial considerations. Examples include currency exchange rates, interest rates, inflation rates, tariffs, and
      uu
          geographic location.
       Physical environmental elements. Examples include working conditions, weather, and constraints.
      uu



   2.3 ORGANIZATIONAL PROCESS ASSETS
     Organizational process assets (OPAs) are the plans, processes, policies, procedures, and knowledge bases specific to
   and used by the performing organization. These assets influence the management of the project.
      OPAs include any artifact, practice, or knowledge from any or all of the performing organizations involved in the
   project that can be used to execute or govern the project. The OPAs also include the organization's lessons learned from
   previous projects and historical information. OPAs may include completed schedules, risk data, and earned value data.
   OPAs are inputs to many project management processes. Since OPAs are internal to the organization, the project team
   members may be able to update and add to the organizational process assets as necessary throughout the project. They
   may be grouped into two categories:





       Processes, policies, and procedures; and
      uu





       Organizational knowledge bases.
      uu




                                                                                                                        39
   Generally, the assets in the first category are not updated as part of the project work. Processes, policies, and
procedures are usually established by the project management office (PMO) or another function outside of the project.
These can be updated only by following the appropriate organizational policies associated with updating processes,
policies, or procedures. Some organizations encourage the team to tailor templates, life cycles, and checklists for the
project. In these instances, the project management team should tailor those assets to meet the needs of the project.
   The assets in the second category are updated throughout the project with project information. For example,
information on financial performance, lessons learned, performance metrics and issues, and defects are continually
updated throughout the project.



2.3.1 PROCESSES, POLICIES, AND PROCEDURES
     The organization's processes and procedures for conducting project work include but are not limited to:
      Initiating and Planning:
     uu

         nuGuidelines and criteria for tailoring the organization's set of standard processes and procedures to satisfy the
            specific needs of the project;
         nuSpecific organizational standards such as policies (e.g., human resources policies, health and safety policies,
            security and confidentiality policies, quality policies, procurement policies, and environmental policies);
         nuProduct    and project life cycles, and methods and procedures (e.g., project management methods,
            estimation metrics, process audits, improvement targets, checklists, and standardized process definitions
            for use in the organization);
         nuTemplates   (e.g., project management plans, project documents, project registers, report formats, contract
            templates, risk categories, risk statement templates, probability and impact definitions, probability and
            impact matrices, and stakeholder register templates); and
         nuPreapproved supplier lists and various types of contractual agreements (e.g., fixed-price, cost-reimbursable,
            and time and material contracts).
      Executing, Monitoring, and Controlling:
     uu

         nuChange control procedures, including the steps by which performing organization standards, policies, plans, and
            procedures or any project documents will be modified, and how any changes will be approved and validated;
         nuTraceability   matrices;
         nuFinancial controls procedures (e.g., time reporting, required expenditure and disbursement reviews,
            accounting codes, and standard contract provisions);




                                                                                                             Part 1 - Guide
40
        nuIssue and defect management procedures (e.g., defining issue and defect controls, identifying and resolving
            issues and defects, and tracking action items);
        nuResource    availability control and assignment management;
        nuOrganizational communication requirements (e.g., specific communication technology available, authorized
            communication media, record retention policies, videoconferencing, collaborative tools, and security
            requirements);
        nuProcedures      for prioritizing, approving, and issuing work authorizations;
        nuTemplates      (e.g., risk register, issue log, and change log);
        nuStandardized      guidelines, work instructions, proposal evaluation criteria, and performance measurement
            criteria; and
        nuProduct, service, or    result verification and validation procedures.
      Closing. Project closure guidelines or requirements (e.g., final project audits, project evaluations, deliverable
     uu
        acceptance, contract closure, resource reassignment, and knowledge transfer to production and/or operations).


   2.3.2 ORGANIZATIONAL KNOWLEDGE REPOSITORIES
    The organizational knowledge repositories for storing and retrieving information include but are not limited to:
      Configuration management knowledge repositories containing the versions of software and hardware components and
     uu
        baselines of all performing organization standards, policies, procedures, and any project documents;
      Financial data repositories containing information such as labor hours, incurred costs, budgets, and any project
     uu
        cost overruns;
      Historical information and lessons learned knowledge repositories (e.g., project records and documents, all project
     uu
        closure information and documentation, information regarding both the results of previous project selection decisions
        and previous project performance information, and information from risk management activities);
      Issue and defect management data repositories containing issue and defect status, control information, issue and
     uu
        defect resolution, and action item results;
      Data repositories for metrics used to collect and make available measurement data on processes and
     uu





        products; and





      Project files from previous projects (e.g., scope, cost, schedule, and performance measurement baselines, project
     uu
        calendars, project schedule network diagrams, risk registers, risk reports, and stakeholder registers).




                                                                                                                          41
2.4 ORGANIZATIONAL SYSTEMS

2.4.1 OVERVIEW
   Projects operate within the constraints imposed by the organization through their structure and governance framework.
To operate effectively and efficiently, the project manager needs to understand where responsibility, accountability, and
authority reside within the organization. This understanding will help the project manager effectively use his or her
power, influence, competence, leadership, and political capabilities to successfully complete the project.
   The interaction of multiple factors within an individual organization creates a unique system that impacts the project
operating in that system. The resulting organizational system determines the power, influence, interests, competence,
and political capabilities of the people who are able to act within the system. The system factors include but are not
limited to:
      Management elements,
     uu

      Governance frameworks, and
     uu

      Organizational structure types.
     uu

   The complete information and explanation of the organizational system factors and how the combination of
these factors impacts a project are beyond the scope of this guide. There are disciplines with associated literature,
methodologies, and practices that address these factors in more depth than is possible within this guide. This section
provides an overview of these factors and their interrelationship.
   This overview begins by discussing systems in general. A system is a collection of various components that together
can produce results not obtainable by the individual components alone. A component is an identifiable element within
the project or organization that provides a particular function or group of related functions. The interaction of the various
system components creates the organizational culture and capabilities. There are several principles regarding systems:
      Systems are dynamic,
     uu

      Systems can be optimized,
     uu

      System components can be optimized,
     uu

      Systems and their components cannot be optimized at the same time, and
     uu

      Systems are nonlinear in responsiveness (a change in the input does not produce a predictable change in

   Multiple changes may occur within the system and between the system and its environment. When these changes
take place, adaptive behavior occurs within the components that in turn add to the system's dynamics. The system's
dynamics are defined by the interaction between the components based on the relationships and dependencies that
exist between the components.
   Systems are typically the responsibility of an organization's management. The organization's management examines
the optimization trade-offs between the components and the system in order to take the appropriate action to achieve
the best outcomes for the organization. The results of this examination will impact the project under consideration.
Therefore, it is important that the project manager take these results into account when determining how to fulfill the
project's objectives. In addition, the project manager should take into account the organization's governance framework.



2.4.2 ORGANIZATIONAL GOVERNANCE FRAMEWORKS
  Recent PMI research reveals that governance refers to organizational or structural arrangements at all levels of
an organization designed to determine and influence the behavior of the organization's members [9]. This research
suggests that the concept of governance is multidimensional and:
    Includes consideration of people, roles, structures, and policies; and
   uu

    Requires providing direction and oversight through data and feedback.
   uu


2.4.2.1 GOVERNANCE FRAMEWORK

   Governance is the framework within which authority is exercised in organizations. This framework includes but is not
limited to:
    Rules,
   uu

    Policies,
   uu

    Procedures,
   uu

    Norms,
   uu

    Relationships,
   uu

    Systems, and
   uu

    Processes.
   uu

  This framework influences how:
    Objectives of the organization are set and achieved,
   uu

    Risk is monitored and assessed, and
   uu

    Performance is optimized.
   uu




                                                                                                                     43
2.4.2.2 GOVERNANCE OF PORTFOLIOS, PROGRAMS, AND PROJECTS

   The Governance of Portfolios, Programs, and Projects: A Practice Guide [10] describes a common governance
framework aligning organizational project management (OPM) and portfolio, program, and project management.
The practice guide describes four governance domains of alignment, risk, performance, and communications.
Each domain has the following functions: oversight, control, integration, and decision making. Each function has
governance supporting processes and activities for stand-alone projects, or projects operating within the portfolio or
program environments.
   Project governance refers to the framework, functions, and processes that guide project management activities in
order to create a unique product, service, or result to meet organizational, strategic, and operational goals. There is
no one governance framework that is effective in all organizations. A governance framework should be tailored to the
organizational culture, types of projects, and the needs of the organization in order to be effective.
   For more information regarding project governance, including its implementation, see Governance of Portfolios,
Programs, and Projects: A Practice Guide [10].



2.4.3 MANAGEMENT ELEMENTS
   Management elements are the components that comprise the key functions or principles of general management in
the organization. The general management elements are allocated within the organization according to its governance
framework and the organizational structure type selected.
     The key functions or principles of management include but are not limited to:
      Division of work using specialized skills and availability to perform work;
     uu

      Authority given to perform work;
     uu

      Responsibility to perform work appropriately assigned based on such attributes as skill and experience;
     uu

      Discipline of action (e.g., respect for authority, people, and rules);
     uu

      Unity of command (e.g., only one person gives orders for any action or activity to an individual);
     uu

      Unity of direction (e.g., one plan and one head for a group of activities with the same objective);
     uu

      General goals of the organization take precedence over individual goals;
     uu

      Paid fairly for work performed;
     uu




                                                                                                            Part 1 - Guide
44
    Optimal use of resources;
   uu

    Clear communication channels;
   uu

    Right materials to the right person for the right job at the right time;
   uu

    Fair and equal treatment of people in the workplace;
   uu

    Clear security of work positions;
   uu

    Safety of people in the workplace;
   uu

    Open contribution to planning and execution by each person; and
   uu

    Optimal morale.
   uu

   Performance of these management elements are assigned to selected individuals within the organization. These
individuals may perform the noted functions within various organizational structures. For example, in a hierarchical
structure, there are horizontal and vertical levels within the organization. These hierarchical levels range from the line
management level through to the executive management level. The responsibility, accountability, and authority assigned
to the hierarchical level indicate how the individual may perform the noted function within that organizational structure.



2.4.4 ORGANIZATIONAL STRUCTURE TYPES
   Determination of the appropriate organizational structure type is a result of the study of tradeoffs between two
key variables. The variables are the organizational structure types available for use and how to optimize them for a
given organization. There is not a one-size-fits-all structure for any given organization. The final structure for a given
organization is unique due to the numerous variables to be considered. Sections 2.4.4.1 and 2.4.4.2 give examples of
some of the factors to be included when considering the two variables given. Section 2.4.4.3 discusses one organizational
structure that is prevalent in project management.

2.4.4.1 ORGANIZATIONAL STRUCTURE TYPES

  Organizational structures take many forms or types. Table 2-1 compares several types of organizational structures
and their influence on projects.




                                                                                                                       45
   2.4.4.2 FACTORS IN ORGANIZATION STRUCTURE SELECTION

      Each organization considers numerous factors for inclusion in its organizational structure. Each factor may carry
   a different level of importance in the final analysis. The combination of the factor, its value, and relative importance
   provides the organization's decision makers with the right information for inclusion in the analysis.
        Factors to consider in selecting an organizational structure include but are not limited to:
         Degree of alignment with organizational objectives,
        uu

         Specialization capabilities,
        uu

         Span of control, efficiency, and effectiveness,
        uu

         Clear path for escalation of decisions,
        uu

         Clear line and scope of authority,
        uu

         Delegation capabilities,
        uu

         Accountability assignment,
        uu

         Responsibility assignment,
        uu

         Adaptability of design,
        uu

         Simplicity of design,
        uu

         Efficiency of performance,
        uu

         Cost considerations,
        uu

         Physical locations (e.g., colocated, regional, and virtual), and
        uu

         Clear communication (e.g., policies, status of work, and organization's vision).

2.4.4.3 PROJECT MANAGEMENT OFFICE

   A project management office (PMO) is an organizational structure that standardizes the project-related governance
processes and facilitates the sharing of resources, methodologies, tools, and techniques. The responsibilities of a PMO
can range from providing project management support functions to the direct management of one or more projects.
   There are several types of PMOs in organizations. Each type varies in the degree of control and influence it has on
projects within the organization, such as:
      Supportive. Supportive PMOs provide a consultative role to projects by supplying templates, best practices,
     uu
        training, access to information, and lessons learned from other projects. This type of PMO serves as a project
        repository. The degree of control provided by the PMO is low.
      Controlling. Controlling PMOs provide support and require compliance through various means. The degree of
     uu
        control provided by the PMO is moderate. Compliance may involve:
        nuAdoption of project management frameworks or methodologies;
        nuUse of specific templates, forms, and tools; and
        nuConformance to governance frameworks.

      Directive. Directive PMOs take control of the projects by directly managing the projects. Project managers are
     uu
        assigned by and report to the PMO. The degree of control provided by the PMO is high.
   The project management office may have organization-wide responsibility. It may play a role in supporting strategic
alignment and delivering organizational value. The PMO integrates data and information from organizational strategic
projects and evaluates how higher-level strategic objectives are being fulfilled. The PMO is the natural liaison between the
organization's portfolios, programs, projects, and the organizational measurement systems (e.g., balanced scorecard).
  The projects supported or administered by the PMO may not be related other than by being managed together. The
specific form, function, and structure of a PMO are dependent upon the needs of the organization that it supports.




                                                                                                             Part 1 - Guide
48
      A PMO may have the authority to act as an integral stakeholder and a key decision maker throughout the life of each
   project in order to keep it aligned with the business objectives. The PMO may:
       Make recommendations,
      uu

       Lead knowledge transfer,
      uu

       Terminate projects, and
      uu

       Take other actions, as required.
      uu

      A primary function of a PMO is to support project managers in a variety of ways, which may include but are not
   limited to:
       Managing shared resources across all projects administered by the PMO;
      uu

       Identifying and developing project management methodology, best practices, and standards;
      uu

       Coaching, mentoring, training, and oversight;
      uu

       Monitoring compliance with project management standards, policies, procedures, and templates by means of
      uu
         project audits;
       Developing and managing project policies, procedures, templates, and other shared documentation (organizational
      uu
         process assets); and
       Coordinating communication across projects.

    THE ROL E OF THE PR OJ EC T M ANAGER


   3.1 OVERVIEW
      The project manager plays a critical role in the leadership of a project team in order to achieve the project's
   objectives. This role is clearly visible throughout the project. Many project managers become involved in a project from
   its initiation through closing. However, in some organizations, a project manager may be involved in evaluation and
   analysis activities prior to project initiation. These activities may include consulting with executive and business unit
   leaders on ideas for advancing strategic objectives, improving organizational performance, or meeting customer needs.
   In some organizational settings, the project manager may also be called upon to manage or assist in business analysis,
   business case development, and aspects of portfolio management for a project. A project manager may also be involved
   in follow-on activities related to realizing business benefits from the project. The role of a project manager may vary
   from organization to organization. Ultimately, the project management role is tailored to fit the organization in the same
   way that the project management processes are tailored to fit the project.
      A simple analogy may help in understanding the roles of a project manager for a large project by comparing them to
   the roles of a conductor for a large orchestra:
       Membership and roles. A large project and an orchestra each comprise many members, each playing a
      uu
          different role. A large orchestra may have more than 100 musicians who are led by a conductor. These musicians
          may play 25 different kinds of instruments placed into major sections, such as strings, woodwinds, brass, and
          percussion. Similarly, a large project may have more than 100 project members led by a project manager. Team
          members may fulfill many different roles, such as design, manufacturing, and facilities management. Like the
          major sections of the orchestra, they represent multiple business units or groups within an organization. The





          musicians and the project members make up each leader's team.





       Responsibility for team. The project manager and conductor are both responsible for what their teams
      uu
          produce--the project outcome or the orchestra concert, respectively. The two leaders need to take a holistic
          view of their team's products in order to plan, coordinate, and complete them. The two leaders begin by reviewing
          the vision, mission, and objectives of their respective organizations to ensure alignment with their products.
          The two leaders establish their interpretation of the vision, mission, and objectives involved in successfully
          completing their products. The leaders use their interpretation to communicate and motivate their teams toward
          the successful completion of their objectives.




                                                                                                                          51
      Knowledge and skills:
     uu

       nuThe  conductor is not expected to be able to play every instrument in the orchestra, but should possess
          musical knowledge, understanding, and experience. The conductor provides the orchestra with leadership,
          planning, and coordination through communications. The conductor provides written communication in the
          form of musical scores and practice schedules. The conductor also communicates in real time with the team
          by using a baton and other body movements.
       nuThe   project manager is not expected to perform every role on the project, but should possess project
          management knowledge, technical knowledge, understanding, and experience. The project manager provides
          the project team with leadership, planning, and coordination through communications. The project manager
          provides written communications (e.g., documented plans and schedules) and communicates in real time
          with the team using meetings and verbal or nonverbal cues.
   The remainder of this section covers the key aspects of the role of the project manager. While there are thousands
of books and articles available on the subject, this section is not intended to cover the entire spectrum of information
available. Rather, it is designed to present an overview that will provide the practitioner with a basic understanding of
the subject in preparation for a more concentrated study on the various aspects discussed.



3.2 DEFINITION OF A PROJECT MANAGER
   The role of a project manager is distinct from that of a functional manager or operations manager. Typically, the
functional manager focuses on providing management oversight for a functional or business unit. Operations managers
are responsible for ensuring that business operations are efficient. The project manager is the person assigned by the
performing organization to lead the team that is responsible for achieving the project objectives.



3.3 THE PROJECT MANAGER'S SPHERE OF INFLUENCE

3.3.1 OVERVIEW
   Project managers fulfill numerous roles within their sphere of influence. These roles reflect the project manager's
capabilities and are representative of the value and contributions of the project management profession. This section
highlights the roles of the project manager in the various spheres of influence shown in Figure 3-1.




                                                                                                          Part 1 - Guide

                                   Figure 3-1. Example of Project Manager's Sphere of Influence



   3.3.2 THE PROJECT
      The project manager leads the project team to meet the project's objectives and stakeholders' expectations. The
   project manager works to balance the competing constraints on the project with the resources available.





      The project manager also performs communication roles between the project sponsor, team members, and other





   stakeholders. This includes providing direction and presenting the vision of success for the project. The project manager
   uses soft skills (e.g., interpersonal skills and the ability to manage people) to balance the conflicting and competing
   goals of the project stakeholders in order to achieve consensus. In this context, consensus means that the relevant
   stakeholders support the project decisions and actions even when there is not 100% agreement.
      Research shows that successful project managers consistently and effectively use certain essential skills. Research
   reveals that the top 2% of project managers as designated by their bosses and team members distinguish themselves
   by demonstrating superior relationship and communication skills while displaying a positive attitude [12].




                                                                                                                         53
   The ability to communicate with stakeholders, including the team and sponsors applies across multiple aspects of
the project including, but not limited to, the following:
      Developing finely tuned skills using multiple methods (e.g., verbal, written, and nonverbal);
     uu

      Creating, maintaining, and adhering to communications plans and schedules;
     uu

      Communicating predictably and consistently;
     uu

      Seeking to understand the project stakeholders' communication needs (communication may be the only
     uu
        deliverable that some stakeholders received until the project's end product or service is completed);
      Making communications concise, clear, complete, simple, relevant, and tailored;
     uu

      Including important positive and negative news;
     uu

      Incorporating feedback channels; and
     uu

      Relationship skills involving the development of extensive networks of people throughout the project manager's
     uu
        spheres of influence. These networks include formal networks such as organizational reporting structures.
        However, the informal networks that project managers develop, maintain, and nurture are more important.
        Informal networks include the use of established relationships with individuals such as subject matter experts
        and influential leaders. Use of these formal and informal networks allows the project manager to engage multiple
        people in solving problems and navigating the bureaucracies encountered in a project.


3.3.3 THE ORGANIZATION
   The project manager proactively interacts with other project managers. Other independent projects or projects that
are part of the same program may impact a project due to but not limited to the following:
      Demands on the same resources,
     uu

      Priorities of funding,
     uu

      Receipt or distribution of deliverables, and
     uu

      Alignment of project goals and objectives with those of the organization.
     uu

   Interacting with other project managers helps to create a positive influence for fulfilling the various needs of the
project. These needs may be in the form of human, technical, or financial resources and deliverables required by the
team for project completion. The project manager seeks ways to develop relationships that assist the team in achieving
the goals and objectives of the project.




                                                                                                          Part 1 - Guide
54
   In addition, the project manager maintains a strong advocacy role within the organization. The project manager
proactively interacts with managers within the organization during the course of the project. The project manager also
works with the project sponsor to address internal political and strategic issues that may impact the team or the viability
or quality of the project.
   The project manager may work toward increasing the project management competency and capability within the
organization as a whole and is involved in both tacit and explicit knowledge transfer or integration initiatives (see
Section 4.4 on Manage Project Knowledge). The project manager also works to:
    Demonstrate the value of project management,
   uu

    Increase acceptance of project management in the organization, and
   uu

    Advance the efficacy of the PMO when one exists in the organization.
   uu

   Depending on the organizational structure, a project manager may report to a functional manager. In other cases,
a project manager may be one of several project managers who report to a PMO or a portfolio or program manager
who is ultimately responsible for one or more organization-wide projects. The project manager works closely with all
relevant managers to achieve the project objectives and to ensure the project management plan aligns with the portfolio
or program plan. The project manager also works closely and in collaboration with other roles, such as organizational
managers, subject matter experts, and those involved with business analysis. In some situations, the project manager
may be an external consultant placed in a temporary management role.



3.3.4 THE INDUSTRY
  The project manager stays informed about current industry trends. The project manager takes this information and
sees how it may impact or apply to the current projects. These trends include but are not limited to:
    Product and technology development;
   uu

    New and changing market niches;
   uu

    Standards (e.g., project management, quality management, information security management);
   uu

    Technical support tools;
   uu

    Economic forces that impact the immediate project;
   uu

    Influences affecting the project management discipline; and
   uu

    Process improvement and sustainability strategies.
   uu




                                                                                                                        55
3.3.5 PROFESSIONAL DISCIPLINE
  Continuing knowledge transfer and integration is very important for the project manager. This professional
development is ongoing in the project management profession and in other areas where the project manager maintains
subject matter expertise. This knowledge transfer and integration includes but is not limited to:
      Contribution of knowledge and expertise to others within the profession at the local, national, and global levels
     uu
        (e.g., communities of practice, international organizations); and
      Participation in training, continuing education, and development:
     uu

        nuIn the project management profession (e.g., universities, PMI);
        nuIn a related profession (e.g., systems engineering, configuration management); and
        nuIn other professions (e.g., information technology, aerospace).



3.3.6 ACROSS DISCIPLINES
   A professional project manager may choose to orient and educate other professionals regarding the value of a
project management approach to the organization. The project manager may serve as an informal ambassador by
educating the organization as to the advantages of project management with regard to timeliness, quality, innovation,
and resource management.



3.4 PROJECT MANAGER COMPETENCES

3.4.1 OVERVIEW
   Recent PMI studies applied the Project Manager Competency Development (PMCD) Framework to the skills needed
by project managers through the use of The PMI Talent Triangle(R) shown in Figure 3-2. The talent triangle focuses on
three key skill sets:
      Technical project management. The knowledge, skills, and behaviors related to specific domains of project,
     uu
        program, and portfolio management. The technical aspects of performing one's role.
      Leadership. The knowledge, skills, and behaviors needed to guide, motivate, and direct a team, to help an
     uu
        organization achieve its business goals.
      Strategic and business management. The knowledge of and expertise in the industry and organization that
     uu
        enhanced performance and better delivers business outcomes.

      While technical project management skills are core to program and project management, PMI research indicates that
   they are not enough in today's increasingly complicated and competitive global marketplace. Organizations are seeking
   added skills in leadership and business intelligence. Members of various organizations state their belief that these
   competencies can support longer-range strategic objectives that contribute to the bottom line. To be the most effective,





   project managers need to have a balance of these three skill sets.





                                                                                                                        57
3.4.2 TECHNICAL PROJECT MANAGEMENT SKILLS
   Technical project management skills are defined as the skills to effectively apply project management knowledge
to deliver the desired outcomes for programs or projects. There are numerous technical project management skills.
The Knowledge Areas in this guide describe many of these necessary project management skills. Project managers
frequently rely on expert judgment to perform well. Being aware of personal expertise and where to find others with the
needed expertise are important for success as a project manager.
   According to research. the top project managers consistently demonstrated several key skills including, but not
limited to, the ability to:
      Focus on the critical technical project management elements for each project they manage. This focus is as
     uu
        simple as having the right artifacts readily available. At the top of the list were the following:
        nuCritical success factors for the project,
        nuSchedule,
        nuSelected financial reports, and
        nuIssue log.

      Tailor both traditional and agile tools, techniques, and methods for each project.
     uu

      Make time to plan thoroughly and prioritize diligently.
     uu

      Manage project elements, including, but not limited to, schedule, cost, resources, and risks.
     uu



3.4.3 STRATEGIC AND BUSINESS MANAGEMENT SKILLS
   Strategic and business management skills involve the ability to see the high-level overview of the organization and
effectively negotiate and implement decisions and actions that support strategic alignment and innovation. This ability
may include a working knowledge of other functions such as finance, marketing, and operations. Strategic and business
management skills may also include developing and applying pertinent product and industry expertise. This business
knowledge is also known as domain knowledge. Project managers should be knowledgeable enough about the business
to be able to:
      Explain to others the essential business aspects of a project;
     uu

      Work with the project sponsor, team, and subject matter experts to develop an appropriate project delivery
     uu
        strategy; and
      Implement that strategy in a way that maximizes the business value of the project.
     uu




                                                                                                             Part 1 - Guide
58
     In order to make the best decisions regarding the successful delivery of their projects, project managers should seek
   out and consider the expertise of the operational managers who run the business in their organization. These managers
   should know the work performed in their organization and how project plans will affect that work. The more the project
   manager is able to know about the project's subject matter, the better. At a minimum, the project manager should be
   knowledgeable enough to explain to others the following aspects of the organization:
       Strategy;
      uu

       Mission;
      uu

       Goals and objectives;
      uu

       Products and services;
      uu

       Operations (e.g., location, type, technology);
      uu

       The market and the market condition, such as customers, state of the market (i.e., growing or shrinking), and
      uu
          time-to-market factors, etc.; and
       Competition (e.g., what, who, position in the market place).
      uu

     The project manager should apply the following knowledge and information about the organization to the project to
   ensure alignment:
       Strategy,
      uu

       Mission,
      uu

       Goals and objectives,
      uu

       Priority,
      uu

       Tactics, and
      uu

       Products or services (e.g., deliverables).
      uu






                                                                                                                       59
   Strategic and business skills help the project manager to determine which business factors should be considered for
their project. The project manager determines how these business and strategic factors could affect the project while
understanding the interrelationship between the project and the organization. These factors include but are not limited to:
      Risks and issues,
     uu

      Financial implications,
     uu

      Cost versus benefits analysis (e.g., net present value, return on investment), including the various options
     uu
        considered,
      Business value,
     uu

      Benefits realization expectations and strategies, and
     uu

      Scope, budget, schedule, and quality.
     uu

  Through the application of this business knowledge, a project manager has the ability to make the appropriate
decisions and recommendations for a project. As conditions change, the project manager should be continuously
working with the project sponsor to keep the business and the project strategies aligned.



3.4.4 LEADERSHIP SKILLS
   Leadership skills involve the ability to guide, motivate, and direct a team. These skills may include demonstrating
essential capabilities such as negotiation, resilience, communication, problem solving, critical thinking, and interpersonal
skills. Projects are becoming increasingly more complicated with more and more businesses executing their strategy
through projects. Project management is more than just working with numbers, templates, charts, graphs, and computing
systems. A common denominator in all projects is people. People can be counted, but they are not numbers.

3.4.4.1 DEALING WITH PEOPLE

   A large part of the project manager's role involves dealing with people. The project manager should study people's
behaviors and motivations. The project manager should strive to be a good leader, because leadership is crucial to the
success of projects in organizations. A project manager applies leadership skills and qualities when working with all
project stakeholders, including the project team, the steering team, and project sponsors.




                                                                                                             Part 1 - Guide
60
   3.4.4.2 QUALITIES AND SKILLS OF A LEADER

     Research shows that the qualities and skills of a leader include but are not limited to:
      Being a visionary (e.g., help to describe the products, goals, and objectives of the project; able to dream and
     uu
         translate those dreams for others);
      Being optimistic and positive;
     uu

      Being collaborative;
     uu

      Managing relationships and conflict by:
     uu

         nuBuilding trust;
         nuSatisfying concerns;
         nuSeeking consensus;
         nuBalancing competing and opposing goals;
         nuApplying persuasion, negotiation, compromise, and conflict resolution skills;
         nuDeveloping and nurturing personal and professional networks;
         nuTaking a long-term view that relationships are just as important as the project; and
         nuContinuously developing and applying political acumen.

      Communicating by:
     uu

         nuSpending    sufficient time communicating (research shows that top project managers spend about 90% of
            their time on a project in communicating);
         nuManaging expectations;
         nuAccepting feedback graciously;
         nuGiving feedback constructively; and
         nuAsking and listening.

      Being respectful (helping others retain their autonomy), courteous, friendly, kind, honest, trustworthy, loyal,
     uu
         and ethical;
      Exhibiting integrity and being culturally sensitive, courageous, a problem solver, and decisive;
     uu





      Giving credit to others where due;
     uu





      Being a life-long learner who is results- and action-oriented;
     uu




                                                                                                                  61
      Focusing on the important things, including:
     uu

        nuContinuously prioritizing work by reviewing and adjusting as necessary;
        nuFinding and using a prioritization method that works for them and the project;
        nuDifferentiating high-level strategic priorities, especially those related to critical success factors for the project;
        nuMaintaining vigilance on primary project constraints;
        nuRemaining flexible on tactical priorities; and
        nuBeing able to sift through massive amounts of information to obtain the most important information.

      Having a holistic and systemic view of the project, taking into account internal and external factors equally;
     uu

      Being able to apply critical thinking (e.g., application of analytical methods to reach decisions) and identify him
     uu
        or herself as a change agent.
      Being able to build effective teams, be service-oriented, and have fun and share humor effectively with
     uu
        team members.

3.4.4.3 POLITICS, POWER, AND GETTING THINGS DONE

   Leadership and management are ultimately about being able to get things done. The skills and qualities noted help
the project manager to achieve the project goals and objectives. At the root of many of these skills and qualities is the
ability to deal with politics. Politics involves influence, negotiation, autonomy, and power.
   Politics and its associated elements are not "good" or "bad," "positive" or "negative" alone. The better the project
manager understands how the organization works, the more likely he or she will be successful. The project manager
observes and collects data about the project and organizational landscapes. The data then needs to be reviewed in the
context of the project, the people involved, the organization, and the environment as a whole. This review yields the
information and knowledge necessary for the project manager to plan and implement the most appropriate action. The
project manager's action is a result of selecting the right kind of power to influence and negotiate with others. Exercise
of power also carries with it the responsibility of being sensitive to and respectful of other people. The effective action of
the project manager maintains the autonomy of those involved. The project manager's action results in the right people
performing the activities necessary to fulfill the project's objectives.




                                                                                                                Part 1 - Guide

      Power can originate with traits exhibited by the individual or the organization. Power is often supported by other
   people's perception of the leader. It is essential for project managers to be aware of their relationships with other people.
   Relationships enable project managers to get things done on the project. There are numerous forms of power at the
   disposal of project managers. Power and its use can be complex given its nature and the various factors at play in a
   project. Various forms of power include but are not limited to:
       Positional (sometimes called formal, authoritative, legitimate) (e.g., formal position granted in the organization
      uu
          or team);
       Informational (e.g., control of gathering or distribution);
      uu

       Referent (e.g., respect or admiration others hold for the individual, credibility gained);
      uu

       Situational (e.g., gained due to unique situation such as a specific crisis);
      uu

       Personal or charismatic (e.g., charm, attraction);
      uu

       Relational (e.g., participates in networking, connections, and alliances);
      uu

       Expert (e.g., skill, information possessed; experience, training, education, certification);
      uu

       Reward-oriented (e.g., ability to give praise, monetary or other desired items);
      uu

       Punitive or coercive (e.g., ability to invoke discipline or negative consequences);
      uu

       Ingratiating (e.g., application of flattery or other common ground to win favor or cooperation);
      uu

       Pressure-based (e.g., limit freedom of choice or movement for the purpose of gaining compliance to desired action);
      uu

       Guilt-based (e.g., imposition of obligation or sense of duty);
      uu

       Persuasive (e.g., ability to provide arguments that move people to a desired course of action); and
      uu

       Avoiding (e.g., refusing to participate).
      uu

      Top project managers are proactive and intentional when it comes to power. These project managers will work to
   acquire the power and authority they need within the boundaries of organizational policies, protocols, and procedures
   rather than wait for it to be granted.






                                                                                                                             63
3.4.5 COMPARISON OF LEADERSHIP AND MANAGEMENT
   The words leadership and management are often used interchangeably. However, they are not synonymous. The
word management is more closely associated with directing another person to get from one point to another using a
known set of expected behaviors. In contrast, leadership involves working with others through discussion or debate in
order to guide them from one point to another.
   The method that a project manager chooses to employ reveals a distinct difference in behavior, self-perception, and
project role. Table 3-1 compares management and leadership on several important levels.
   Project managers need to employ both leadership and management in order to be successful. The skill is in finding
the right balance for each situation. The way in which management and leadership are employed often shows up in the
project manager's leadership style.

   3.4.5.1 LEADERSHIP STYLES

      Project managers may lead their teams in many ways. The style a project manager selects may be a personal
   preference, or the result of the combination of multiple factors associated with the project. The style a project manager
   uses may change over time based on the factors in play. Major factors to consider include but are not limited to:
       Leader characteristics (e.g., attitudes, moods, needs, values, ethics);
      uu

       Team member characteristics (e.g., attitudes, moods, needs, values, ethics);
      uu

       Organizational characteristics (e.g., its purpose, structure, and type of work performed); and
      uu

       Environmental characteristics (e.g., social situation, economic state, and political elements).
      uu

     Research describes numerous leadership styles that a project manager can adopt. Some of the most common
   examples of these styles include but are not limited to:
       Laissez-faire (e.g., allowing the team to make their own decisions and establish their own goals, also referred to
      uu
          as taking a hands-off style);
       Transactional (e.g., focus on goals, feedback, and accomplishment to determine rewards; management
      uu
          by exception);
       Servant leader (e.g., demonstrates commitment to serve and put other people first; focuses on other people's
      uu
          growth, learning, development, autonomy, and well-being; concentrates on relationships, community and
          collaboration; leadership is secondary and emerges after service);
       Transformational (e.g., empowering followers through idealized attributes and behaviors, inspirational motivation,
      uu
          encouragement for innovation and creativity, and individual consideration);
       Charismatic (e.g., able to inspire; is high-energy, enthusiastic, self-confident; holds strong convictions); and
      uu

       Interactional (e.g., a combination of transactional, transformational, and charismatic).
      uu






                                                                                                                          65
3.4.5.2 PERSONALITY

  Personality refers to the individual differences in characteristic patterns of thinking, feeling, and behaving. Personality
characteristics or traits include but are not limited to:
      Authentic (e.g., accepts others for what and who they are, show open concern);
     uu

      Courteous (e.g., ability to apply appropriate behavior and etiquette);
     uu

      Creative (e.g., ability to think abstractly, to see things differently, to innovate);
     uu

      Cultural (e.g., measure of sensitivity to other cultures including values, norms, and beliefs);
     uu

      Emotional (e.g., ability to perceive emotions and the information they present and to manage them; measure of
     uu
         interpersonal skills);
      Intellectual (e.g., measure of human intelligence over multiple aptitudes);
     uu

      Managerial (e.g., measure of management practice and potential);
     uu

      Political (e.g., measure of political intelligence and making things happen);
     uu

      Service-oriented (e.g., evidence of willingness to serve other people);
     uu

      Social (e.g., ability to understand and manage people); and
     uu

      Systemic (e.g., drive to understand and build systems).
     uu

  An effective project manager will have some level of ability with each of these characteristics in order to be successful.
Each project, organization, and situation requires that the project manager emphasize different aspects of personality.



3.5 PERFORMING INTEGRATION
     The role of the project manager is twofold when performing integration on the project:
      Project managers play a key role in working with the project sponsor to understand the strategic objectives and
     uu
         ensure the alignment of the project objectives and results with those of the portfolio, program, and business
         areas. In this way, project managers contribute to the integration and execution of the strategy.
      Project managers are responsible for guiding the team to work together to focus on what is really essential at the
     uu
         project level. This is achieved through the integration of processes, knowledge, and people.
   Integration is a critical skill for project managers. Integration is covered more in depth in the Project Integration
Management Knowledge Area of this guide. Sections 3.5.1 through 3.5.4 focus on integration that takes place at
three different levels: the process, cognitive, and context levels. Section 3.5.4 concludes by addressing complexity
and integration.




                                                                                                             Part 1 - Guide
66
3.5.1 PERFORMING INTEGRATION AT THE PROCESS LEVEL
   Project management may be seen as a set of processes and activities that are undertaken to achieve the project
objectives. Some of these processes may take place once (e.g., the initial creation of the project charter), but many others
overlap and occur several times throughout the project. One example of this process overlap and multiple occurrences
is a change in a requirement that impacts scope, schedule, or budget and requires a change request. Several project
management processes such as the Control Scope process and the Perform Integrated Change Control process may
involve a change request. The Perform Integrated Change Control process occurs throughout the project for integrating
change requests.
  Although there is no stated definition on how to integrate the project processes, it is clear that a project has a small
chance of meeting its objective when the project manager fails to integrate the project processes where they interact.



3.5.2 INTEGRATION AT THE COGNITIVE LEVEL
   There are many different ways to manage a project, and the method selected typically depends on the specific
characteristics of the project including its size, how complicated the project or organization may be, and the culture of
the performing organization. It is clear that the personal skills and abilities of the project manager are closely related to
the way in which the project is managed.
   The project manager should strive to become proficient in all of the Project Management Knowledge Areas. In concert
with proficiency in these Knowledge Areas, the project manager applies experience, insight, leadership, and technical
and business management skills to the project. Finally, it is through the project manager's ability to integrate the
processes in these Knowledge Areas that makes it possible to achieve the desired project results.



3.5.3 INTEGRATION AT THE CONTEXT LEVEL
   There have been many changes in the context in which business and projects take place today compared to a
few decades ago. New technologies have been introduced. Social networks, multicultural aspects, virtual teams, and
new values are part of the new reality of projects. An example is knowledge and people integration in the context of
a large cross-functional project implementation involving multiple organizations. The project manager considers the
implications of this context in communications planning and knowledge management for guiding the project team.
   Project managers need to be cognizant of the project context and these new aspects when managing the
integration. Then project managers can decide how to best use these new elements of the environment in their
projects to achieve success.




                                                                                                                          67
3.5.4 INTEGRATION AND COMPLEXITY
  Some projects may be referred to as complex and considered difficult to manage. In simple terms, complex and
complicated are concepts often used to describe what is considered to be intricate or complicated.
  Complexity within projects is a result of the organization's system behavior, human behavior, and the uncertainty at
work in the organization or its environment. In Navigating Complexity: A Practice Guide [13], these three dimensions of
complexity are defined as:
      System behavior. The interdependencies of components and systems.
     uu

      Human behavior. The interplay between diverse individuals and groups.
     uu

      Ambiguity. Uncertainty of emerging issues and lack of understanding or confusion.
     uu

   Complexity itself is a perception of an individual based on personal experience, observation, and skill. Rather than
being complex, a project is more accurately described as containing complexity. Portfolios, programs, and projects may
contain elements of complexity.
   When approaching the integration of a project, the project manager should consider elements that are both inside and
outside of the project. The project manager should examine the characteristics or properties of the project. Complexity
as a characteristic or property of a project is typically defined as:
      Containing multiple parts,
     uu

      Possessing a number of connections between the parts,
     uu

      Exhibiting dynamic interactions between the parts, and
     uu

      Exhibiting behavior produced as a result of those interactions that cannot be explained as the simple sum of the
     uu
        parts (e.g., emergent behavior).
   Examining these various items that appear to make the project complex should help the project manager identify key
areas when planning, managing, and controlling the project to ensure integration.




                                                                                                        Part 1 - Guide

      Project Integration Management includes the processes and activities to identify, define, combine, unify, and
   coordinate the various processes and project management activities within the Project Management Process Groups. In
   the project management context, integration includes characteristics of unification, consolidation, communication, and
   interrelationship. These actions should be applied from the start of the project through completion. Project Integration
   Management includes making choices about:
       Resource allocation,
      uu

       Balancing competing demands,
      uu

       Examining any alternative approaches,
      uu

       Tailoring the processes to meet the project objectives, and
      uu

       Managing the interdependencies among the Project Management Knowledge Areas.

        The Project Integration Management processes are:
      4.1 Develop Project Charter--The process of developing a document that formally authorizes the existence of
   a project and provides the project manager with the authority to apply organizational resources to project activities.
     4.2 Develop Project Management Plan--The process of defining, preparing, and coordinating all plan components
   and consolidating them into an integrated project management plan.
     4.3 Direct and Manage Project Work--The process of leading and performing the work defined in the project
   management plan and implementing approved changes to achieve the project's objectives.
      4.4 Manage Project Knowledge--The process of using existing knowledge and creating new knowledge to achieve
   the project's objectives and contribute to organizational learning.
      4.5 Monitor and Control Project Work--The process of tracking, reviewing, and reporting overall progress to meet
   the performance objectives defined in the project management plan.
      4.6 Perform Integrated Change Control--The process of reviewing all change requests; approving changes and
   managing changes to deliverables, organizational process assets, project documents, and the project management
   plan; and communicating the decisions.
        4.7 Close Project or Phase--The process of finalizing all activities for the project, phase, or contract.
     Figure 4-1 provides an overview of the Project Integration Management processes. The Project Integration
   Management processes are presented as discrete processes with defined interfaces while, in practice, they overlap
   and interact in ways that cannot be completely detailed in the PMBOK(R) Guide.

KEY CONCEPTS FOR PROJECT INTEGRATION MANAGEMENT

   Project Integration Management is specific to project managers. Whereas other Knowledge Areas may be managed
by specialists (e.g., cost analysis, scheduling specialists, risk management experts), the accountability of Project
Integration Management cannot be delegated or transferred. The project manager is the one who combines the results
in all the other Knowledge Areas and has the overall view of the project. The project manager is ultimately responsible
for the project as a whole.
   Projects and project management are integrative by nature. For example, a cost estimate needed for a contingency
plan involves integrating the processes in the Project Cost Management, Project Schedule Management, and Project
Risk Management Knowledge Areas. When additional risks associated with various staffing alternatives are identified,
then one or more of those processes may be revisited.
   The links among the processes in the Project Management Process Groups are often iterative. For example, the
Planning Process Group provides the Executing Process Group with a documented project management plan early in the
project and then updates the project management plan if changes occur as the project progresses.
     Project Integration Management is about:
      Ensuring that the deliverable due dates of the product, service, or result; project life cycle; and the benefits
     uu
         management plan are aligned;
      Providing a project management plan to achieve the project objectives;
     uu

      Ensuring the creation and the use of the appropriate knowledge to and from the project as necessary;
     uu

      Managing the performance and changes of the activities in the project management plan;
     uu

      Making integrated decisions regarding key changes impacting the project;
     uu

      Measuring and monitoring the project's progress and taking appropriate action to meet project objectives;
     uu

      Collecting data on the results achieved, analyzing the data to obtain information, and communicating this
     uu
         information to relevant stakeholders;
      Completing all the work of the project and formally closing each phase, contract, and the project as a whole;
     uu
         and
      Managing phase transitions when necessary.
     uu

  The more complex the project and the more varied the expectations of the stakeholders, the more a sophisticated
approach to integration is needed.




                                                                                                        Part 1 - Guide

TRENDS AND EMERGING PRACTICES IN PROJECT INTEGRATION MANAGEMENT

   The Project Integration Management Knowledge Area requires combining the results from all the other Knowledge
Areas. Evolving trends in integration processes include but are not limited to:
    Use of automated tools. The volume of data and information that project managers need to integrate makes it
   uu
      necessary to use a project management information system (PMIS) and automated tools to collect, analyze, and
      use information to meet project objectives and realize project benefits.
    Use of visual management tools. Some project teams use visual management tools, rather than written plans
   uu
      and other documents, to capture and oversee critical project elements. Making key project elements visible to
      the entire team provides a real-time overview of the project status, facilitates knowledge transfer, and empowers
      team members and other stakeholders to help identify and solve issues.
    Project knowledge management. The increasingly mobile and transitory work force requires a more rigorous
   uu
      process of identifying knowledge throughout the project life cycle and transferring it to the target audience so
      that the knowledge is not lost.
    Expanding the project manager's responsibilities. Project managers are being called on to initiate and finalize
   uu
      the project, such as project business case development and benefits management. Historically, these activities
      have been the responsibility of management and the project management office, but project managers are more
      frequently collaborating with them to better meet project objectives and deliver benefits. Project managers are
      also engaging in more comprehensive identification and engagement of stakeholders. This includes managing
      the interfaces with various functional and operational departments and senior management personnel.
    Hybrid methodologies. Some project management methodologies are evolving to incorporate successfully
   uu
      applied new practices. Examples include the use of agile and other iterative practices; business analysis
      techniques for requirements management; tools for identifying complex elements in projects; and organizational
      change management methods to prepare for transitioning the project outputs into the organization.




                                                                                                                    73
TAILORING CONSIDERATIONS

   Because each project is unique, the project manager may need to tailor the way that Project Integration Management
processes are applied. Considerations for tailoring include but are not limited to:
      Project life cycle. What is an appropriate project life cycle? What phases should comprise the project life cycle?
     uu

      Development life cycle. What development life cycle and approach are appropriate for the product, service,
     uu
        or result? Is a predictive or adaptive approach appropriate? If adaptive, should the product be developed
        incrementally or iteratively? Is a hybrid approach best?
      Management approaches. What management processes are most effective based on the organizational culture
     uu
        and the complexity of the project?
      Knowledge management. How will knowledge be managed in the project to foster a collaborative working
     uu
        environment?
      Change. How will change be managed in the project?
     uu

      Governance. What control boards, committees, and other stakeholders are part of the project? What are the
     uu
        project status reporting requirements?
      Lessons learned. What information should be collected throughout and at the end of the project? How will
     uu
        historical information and lessons learned be made available to future projects?
      Benefits. When and how should benefits be reported: at the end of the project or at the end of each iteration
     uu
        or phase?

CONSIDERATIONS FOR AGILE/ADAPTIVE ENVIRONMENTS

  Iterative and agile approaches promote the engagement of team members as local domain experts in integration
management. The team members determine how plans and components should integrate.
   The expectations of the project manager as noted in the Key Concepts for Integration Management do not change in
an adaptive environment, but control of the detailed product planning and delivery is delegated to the team. The project
manager's focus is on building a collaborative decision-making environment and ensuring the team has the ability to
respond to changes. This collaborative approach can be further enhanced when team members possess a broad skill
base rather than a narrow specialization.

   4.1 DEVELOP PROJECT CHARTER
      Develop Project Charter is the process of developing a document that formally authorizes the existence of a project
   and provides the project manager with the authority to apply organizational resources to project activities. The key
   benefits of this process are that it provides a direct link between the project and the strategic objectives of the
   organization, creates a formal record of the project, and shows the organizational commitment to the project. This
   process is performed once or at predefined points in the project. The inputs, tools and techniques, and outputs of the
   process are depicted in Figure 4-2. Figure 4-3 depicts the data flow diagram for the process.

       The project charter establishes a partnership between the performing and requesting organizations. In the case
   of external projects, a formal contract is typically the preferred way to establish an agreement. A project charter may
   still be used to establish internal agreements within an organization to ensure proper delivery under the contract. The
   approved project charter formally initiates the project. A project manager is identified and assigned as early in the
   project as is feasible, preferably while the project charter is being developed and always prior to the start of planning.
   The project charter can be developed by the sponsor or the project manager in collaboration with the initiating entity.
   This collaboration allows the project manager to have a better understanding of the project purpose, objectives, and
   expected benefits. This understanding will better allow for efficient resource allocation to project activities. The project
   charter provides the project manager with the authority to plan, execute, and control the project.
      Projects are initiated by an entity external to the project such as a sponsor, program, or project management office
   (PMO), or a portfolio governing body chairperson or authorized representative. The project initiator or sponsor should
   be at a level that is appropriate to procure funding and commit resources to the project. Projects are initiated due to
   internal business needs or external influences. These needs or influences often trigger the creation of a needs analysis,
   feasibility study, business case, or description of the situation that the project will address. Chartering a project validates
   alignment of the project to the strategy and ongoing work of the organization. A project charter is not considered to be
   a contract because there is no consideration or money promised or exchanged in its creation.



   4.1.1 DEVELOP PROJECT CHARTER: INPUTS

   4.1.1.1 BUSINESS DOCUMENTS

      The business case (described in Section 1.2.6.1) and the benefits management plan (described in Section 1.2.6.2)
   are sources of information about the projects objectives and how the project will contribute to the business goals.
   Although the business documents are developed prior to the project, they are reviewed periodically.
       Business case. The approved business case, or similar, is the business document most commonly used to
      uu
          create the project charter. The business case describes the necessary information from a business standpoint to
          determine whether the expected outcomes of the project justify the required investment. It is commonly used for
          decision making by managers or executives above the project level. Typically, the business need and the cost-
          benefit analysis are contained in the business case to justify and establish boundaries for the project. For more





          information on the business case, see Section 1.2.6.1. The business case is created as a result of one or more
          of the following:





                                                                                                                               77
        nuMarket  demand (e.g., an automobile manufacturer authorizing a project to build more fuel-efficient cars in
           response to gasoline shortages),
        nuOrganizational need (e.g., due to high overhead costs, a company may combine staff functions and streamline
           processes to reduce costs),
        nuCustomer     request (e.g., an electric utility authorizing a project to build a new substation to serve a new
           industrial park),
        nuTechnological advance (e.g., an airline authorizing a new project to develop electronic tickets instead of paper
           tickets based on technological advances),
        nuLegal  requirement (e.g., a paint manufacturer authorizing a project to establish guidelines for handling
           toxic materials),
        nuEcological impacts (e.g., a company authorizing a project to lessen its environmental impact), or
        nuSocial  need (e.g., a nongovernmental organization in a developing country authorizing a project to
           provide potable water systems, latrines, and sanitation education to communities suffering from high
           rates of cholera).
  The project charter incorporates the appropriate information for the project from the business documents. The project
manager does not update or modify the business documents since they are not project documents; however, the project
manager may make recommendations.

4.1.1.2 AGREEMENTS

   Described in Section 12.2.3.2. Agreements are used to define initial intentions for a project. Agreements may take
the form of contracts, memorandums of understanding (MOUs), service level agreements (SLA), letters of agreement,
letters of intent, verbal agreements, email, or other written agreements. Typically, a contract is used when a project is
being performed for an external customer.

4.1.1.3 ENTERPRISE ENVIRONMENTAL FACTORS

   The enterprise environmental factors that can influence the Develop Project Charter process include but are not
limited to:
      Government or industry standards (e.g., product standards, quality standards, safety standards, and workmanship
     uu
        standards),
      Legal and regulatory requirements and/or constraints,
     uu

      Marketplace conditions,
     uu

      Organizational culture and political climate,
     uu

      Organizational governance framework (a structured way to provide control, direction, and coordination through
     uu
        people, policies, and processes to meet organizational strategic and operational goals), and
      Stakeholders' expectations and risk thresholds.
     uu




                                                                                                           Part 1 - Guide
78
   4.1.1.4 ORGANIZATIONAL PROCESS ASSETS

      The organizational process assets that can influence the Develop Project Charter process include but are not
   limited to:
       Organizational standard policies, processes, and procedures;
      uu

       Portfolio, program, and project governance framework (governance functions and processes to provide guidance
      uu
          and decision making);
       Monitoring and reporting methods;
      uu

       Templates (e.g., project charter template); and
      uu

       Historical information and lessons learned repository (e.g., project records and documents, information about the
      uu
          results of previous project selection decisions, and information about previous project performance).


   4.1.2 DEVELOP PROJECT CHARTER: TOOLS AND TECHNIQUES

   4.1.2.1 EXPERT JUDGMENT

      Expert judgment is defined as judgment provided based upon expertise in an application area, Knowledge Area,
   discipline, industry, etc., as appropriate for the activity being performed. Such expertise may be provided by any group
   or person with specialized education, knowledge, skill, experience, or training.
      For this process, expertise should be considered from individuals or groups with specialized knowledge of or training
   in the following topics:
       Organizational strategy,
      uu

       Benefits management,
      uu

       Technical knowledge of the industry and focus area of the project,
      uu

       Duration and budget estimation, and
      uu

       Risk identification.
      uu






                                                                                                                        79
4.1.2.2 DATA GATHERING

     Data-gathering techniques that can be used for this process include but are not limited to:
      Brainstorming. This technique is used to identify a list of ideas in a short period of time. It is conducted in a
     uu
         group environment and is led by a facilitator. Brainstorming comprises two parts: idea generation and analysis.
         Brainstorming can be used to gather data and solutions or ideas from stakeholders, subject matter experts, and
         team members when developing the project charter.
      Focus groups. Described in Section 5.2.2.2. Focus groups bring together stakeholders and subject matter
     uu
         experts to learn about the perceived project risk, success criteria, and other topics in a more conversational way
         than a one-on-one interview.
      Interviews. Described in Section 5.2.2.2. Interviews are used to obtain information on high-level requirements,
     uu
         assumptions or constraints, approval criteria, and other information from stakeholders by talking directly to them.

4.1.2.3 INTERPERSONAL AND TEAM SKILLS

     Interpersonal and team skills that can be used for this process include but are not limited to:
      Conflict management. Described in Section 9.5.2.1. Conflict management can be used to help bring
     uu
         stakeholders into alignment on the objectives, success criteria, high-level requirements, project description,
         summary milestones, and other elements of the charter.
      Facilitation. Facilitation is the ability to effectively guide a group event to a successful decision, solution,
     uu
         or conclusion. A facilitator ensures that there is effective participation, that participants achieve a mutual
         understanding, that all contributions are considered, that conclusions or results have full buy-in according to the
         decision process established for the project, and that the actions and agreements achieved are appropriately
         dealt with afterward.
      Meeting management. Described in Section 10.2.2.6. Meeting management includes preparing the agenda,
     uu
         ensuring that a representative for each key stakeholder group is invited, and preparing and sending the follow-up
         minutes and actions.

4.1.2.4 MEETINGS

   For this process, meetings are held with key stakeholders to identify the project objectives, success criteria, key
deliverables, high-level requirements, summary milestones, and other summary information.




                                                                                                             Part 1 - Guide

   4.1.3 DEVELOP PROJECT CHARTER: OUTPUTS

   4.1.3.1 PROJECT CHARTER

       The project charter is the document issued by the project initiator or sponsor that formally authorizes the existence
   of a project and provides the project manager with the authority to apply organizational resources to project activities.
   It documents the high-level information on the project and on the product, service, or result the project is intended to
   satisfy, such as:
       Project purpose;
      uu

       Measurable project objectives and related success criteria;
      uu

       High-level requirements;
      uu

       High-level project description, boundaries, and key deliverables;
      uu

       Overall project risk;
      uu

       Summary milestone schedule;
      uu

       Preapproved financial resources;
      uu

       Key stakeholder list;
      uu

       Project approval requirements (i.e., what constitutes project success, who decides the project is successful, and
      uu
          who signs off on the project);
       Project exit criteria (i.e., what are the conditions to be met in order to close or to cancel the project or phase);
      uu

       Assigned project manager, responsibility, and authority level; and
      uu

       Name and authority of the sponsor or other person(s) authorizing the project charter.
      uu

      At a high level, the project charter ensures a common understanding by the stakeholders of the key deliverables,
   milestones, and the roles and responsibilities of everyone involved in the project.

   4.1.3.2 ASSUMPTION LOG





      High-level strategic and operational assumptions and constraints are normally identified in the business case before
   the project is initiated and will flow into the project charter. Lower-level activity and task assumptions are generated





   throughout the project such as defining technical specifications, estimates, the schedule, risks, etc. The assumption log
   is used to record all assumptions and constraints throughout the project life cycle.




                                                                                                                              81
4.2 DEVELOP PROJECT MANAGEMENT PLAN
  Develop Project Management Plan is the process of defining, preparing, and coordinating all plan components and
consolidating them into an integrated project management plan. The key benefit of this process is the production of a
comprehensive document that defines the basis of all project work and how the work will be performed. This process is
performed once or at predefined points in the project. The inputs, tools and techniques, and outputs of the process are
depicted in Figure 4-4. Figure 4-5 depicts the data flow diagram for the process.

     The project management plan defines how the project is executed, monitored and controlled, and closed. The project
   management plan's content varies depending on the application area and complexity of the project.
      The project management plan may be either summary level or detailed. Each component plan is described to the
   extent required by the specific project. The project management plan should be robust enough to respond to an ever-
   changing project environment. This agility may result in more accurate information as the project progresses.
      The project management plan should be baselined; that is, it is necessary to define at least the project references
   for scope, time, and cost, so that the project execution can be measured and compared to those references and
   performance can be managed. Before the baselines are defined, the project management plan may be updated as
   many times as necessary. No formal process is required at that time. But, once it is baselined, it may only be changed
   through the Perform Integrated Change Control process. Consequently, change requests will be generated and decided
   upon whenever a change is requested. This results in a project management plan that is progressively elaborated by
   controlled and approved updates extending through project closure.
      Projects that exist in the context of a program or portfolio should develop a project management plan that is consistent
   with the program or portfolio management plan. For example, if the program management plan indicates all changes
   exceeding a specified cost need to be reviewed by the change control board (CCB), then this process and cost threshold
   need to be defined in the project management plan.



   4.2.1 DEVELOP PROJECT MANAGEMENT PLAN: INPUTS

   4.2.1.1 PROJECT CHARTER

      Described in Section 4.1.3.1. The project team uses the project charter as a starting point for initial project planning.
   The type and amount of information in the project charter varies depending on the complexity of the project and the
   information known at the time of its creation. At a minimum, the project charter should define the high-level information
   about the project that will be elaborated in the various components of the project management plan.

   4.2.1.2 OUTPUTS FROM OTHER PROCESSES

      Outputs from many of the other processes described in Sections 5 through 13 are integrated to create the project





   management plan. Subsidiary plans and baselines that are an output from other planning processes are inputs to this





   process. In addition, changes to these documents may necessitate updates to the project management plan.




                                                                                                                            83

       Determining resources and skill levels needed to perform project work;
      uu

       Defining the level of configuration management to apply on the project;
      uu

       Determining which project documents will be subject to the formal change control process; and
      uu

       Prioritizing the work on the project to ensure the project resources are allocated to the appropriate work at the
      uu
         appropriate time.

   4.2.2.2 DATA GATHERING

     Data-gathering techniques that can be used for this process include but are not limited to:
       Brainstorming. Described in Section 4.1.2.2. Brainstorming is frequently used when developing the project
      uu
         management plan to gather ideas and solutions about the project approach. Attendees include the project team
         members although other subject matter experts (SMEs) or stakeholders may also participate.
       Checklists. Described in Section 11.2.2.2. Many organizations have standardized checklists available based in
      uu
         their own experience or use checklists from the industry. A checklist may guide the project manager to develop
         the plan or may help to verify that all the required information is included in the project management plan.
       Focus groups. Described in Section 5.2.2.2. Focus groups bring together stakeholders to discuss the project
      uu





         management approach and the integration of the different components of the project management plan.





       Interviews. Described in Section 5.2.2.2. Interviews are used to obtain specific information from stakeholders to
      uu
         develop the project management plan or any component plan or project document.




                                                                                                                     85
4.2.2.3 INTERPERSONAL AND TEAM SKILLS

     The interpersonal and team skills used when developing the project management plan include:
      Conflict management. Described in Section 9.5.2.1. Conflict management may be necessary to bring diverse
     uu
         stakeholders into alignment on all aspects of the project management plan.
      Facilitation. Described in Section 4.1.2.3. Facilitation ensures that there is effective participation, that participants
     uu
         achieve a mutual understanding, that all contributions are considered, and that conclusions or results have full
         buy-in according to the decision process established for the project.
      Meeting management. Described in Section 10.2.2.6. Meeting management is necessary to ensure that the
     uu
         numerous meetings that are necessary to develop, unify, and agree on the project management plan are well run.

4.2.2.4 MEETINGS

  For this process, meetings are used to discuss the project approach, determine how work will be executed to
accomplish the project objectives, and establish the way the project will be monitored and controlled.
   The project kick-off meeting is usually associated with the end of planning and the start of executing. Its purpose is
to communicate the objectives of the project, gain the commitment of the team for the project, and explain the roles and
responsibilities of each stakeholder. The kick-off may occur at different points in time depending on the characteristics
of the project:
      For small projects, there is usually only one team that performs the planning and the execution. In this case, the
     uu
         kick-off occurs shortly after initiation, in the Planning Process Group, because the team is involved in planning.
      In large projects, a project management team normally does the majority of the planning, and the remainder of the
     uu
         project team is brought on when the initial planning is complete, at the start of the development/implementation.
         In this instance, the kick-off meeting takes place with processes in the Executing Process Group.
     Multiphase projects will typically include a kick-off meeting at the beginning of each phase.



4.2.3 DEVELOP PROJECT MANAGEMENT PLAN: OUTPUTS

4.2.3.1 PROJECT MANAGEMENT PLAN

   The project management plan is the document that describes how the project will be executed, monitored and
controlled, and closed. It integrates and consolidates all of the subsidiary management plans and baselines, and other
information necessary to manage the project. The needs of the project determine which components of the project
management plan are needed.




                                                                                                               Part 1 - Guide
86
   Project management plan components include but are not limited to:
    Subsidiary management plans:
   uu

          be structured and performed.
       nuProcurement management plan. Described in Section 12.1.3.1. Establishes how the project team will acquire
          goods and services from outside of the performing organization.
       nuStakeholder engagement plan. Described in Section 13.2.3.1. Establishes how stakeholders will be engaged
          in project decisions and execution, according to their needs, interests, and impact.
    Baselines:
   uu

       nuScope   baseline. Described in Section 5.4.3.1. The approved version of a scope statement, work breakdown
          structure (WBS), and its associated WBS dictionary, which is used as a basis for comparison.
       nuSchedule baseline. Described in Section 6.5.3.1. The approved version of the schedule model that is used as
          a basis for comparison to the actual results.





       nuCost baseline. Described in Section 7.3.3.1. The approved version of the time-phased project budget that is
          used as a basis for comparison to the actual results.





                                                                                                                 87
      Additional components. Most components of the project management plan are produced as outputs from other
     uu
        processes, though some are produced during this process. Those components developed as part of this process
        will be dependent on the project; however, they often include but are not limited to:
        nuChange    management plan. Describes how the change requests throughout the project will be formally
           authorized and incorporated.
        nuConfiguration   management plan. Describes how the information about the items of the project (and which
           items) will be recorded and updated so that the product, service, or result of the project remains consistent
           and/or operative.
        nuPerformance   measurement baseline. An integrated scope-schedule-cost plan for the project work against
           which project execution is compared to measure and manage performance.
        nuProject life cycle. Describes the series of phases that a project passes through from its initiation to its closure.
        nuDevelopment      approach. Describes the product, service, or result development approach, such as predictive,
           iterative, agile, or a hybrid model.
        nuManagement reviews. Identifies the points in the project when the project manager and relevant stakeholders
           will review the project progress to determine if performance is as expected, or if preventive or corrective
           actions are necessary.
  While the project management plan is one of the primary documents used to manage the project, other project
documents are also used. These other documents are not part of the project management plan; however, they are
necessary to manage the project effectively. Table 4-1 is a representative list of the project management plan components
and project documents.

4.3 DIRECT AND MANAGE PROJECT WORK
   Direct and Manage Project Work is the process of leading and performing the work defined in the project management
plan and implementing approved changes to achieve the project's objectives. The key benefit of this process is that it
provides overall management of the project work and deliverables, thus improving the probability of project success.
This process is performed throughout the project. The inputs, tools and techniques, and outputs of the process are
depicted in Figure 4-6. Figure 4-7 depicts the data flow diagram for the process.

   Direct and Manage Project Work involves executing the planned project activities to complete project deliverables
and accomplish established objectives. Available resources are allocated, their efficient use is managed, and changes in
project plans stemming from analyzing work performance data and information are carried out. The Direct and Manage
Project Work process is directly affected by the project application area. Deliverables are produced as outputs from
processes performed to accomplish the project work as planned and scheduled in the project management plan.
   The project manager, along with the project management team, directs the performance of the planned project
activities and manages the various technical and organizational interfaces that exist in the project. Direct and Manage
Project Work also requires review of the impact of all project changes and the implementation of approved changes:
corrective action, preventive action, and/or defect repair.
   During project execution, the work performance data is collected and communicated to the applicable controlling
processes for analysis. Work performance data analysis provides information about the completion status of deliverables
and other relevant details about project performance. The work performance data will also be used as an input to the
Monitoring and Controlling Process Group, and can be used as feedback into lessons learned to improve the performance
of future work packages.

94
4.3.2.2 PROJECT MANAGEMENT INFORMATION SYSTEM (PMIS)

   The PMIS provides access to information technology (IT) software tools, such as scheduling software tools, work
authorization systems, configuration management systems, information collection and distribution systems, as well as
interfaces to other online automated systems such as corporate knowledge base repositories. Automated gathering and
reporting on key performance indicators (KPI) can be part of this system.

4.3.2.3 MEETINGS

   Meetings are used to discuss and address pertinent topics of the project when directing and managing project work.
Attendees may include the project manager, the project team, and appropriate stakeholders involved or affected by
the topics addressed. Each attendee should have a defined role to ensure appropriate participation. Types of meetings
include but are not limited to: kick-off, technical, sprint or iteration planning, Scrum daily standups, steering group,
problem solving, progress update, and retrospective meetings.



4.3.3 DIRECT AND MANAGE PROJECT WORK: OUTPUTS

4.3.3.1 DELIVERABLES

   A deliverable is any unique and verifiable product, result, or capability to perform a service that is required to be
produced to complete a process, phase, or project. Deliverables are typically the outcomes of the project and can include
components of the project management plan.
   Change control should be applied once the first version of a deliverable has been completed. The control of the multiple
versions or editions of a deliverable (e.g., documents, software, and building blocks) is supported by configuration
management tools and procedures.

4.3.3.2 WORK PERFORMANCE DATA

   Work performance data are the raw observations and measurements identified during activities being performed
to carry out the project work. Data are often viewed as the lowest level of detail from which information is derived by
other processes. Data is gathered through work execution and passed to the controlling processes for further analysis.
   Examples of work performance data include work completed, key performance indicators (KPIs), technical performance
measures, actual start and finish dates of schedule activities, story points completed, deliverables status, schedule
progress, number of change requests, number of defects, actual costs incurred, actual durations, etc.




                                                                                                                        95
4.3.3.3 ISSUE LOG

   Throughout the life cycle of a project, the project manager will normally face problems, gaps, inconsistencies, or
conflicts that occur unexpectedly and that require some action so they do not impact the project performance. The issue
log is a project document where all the issues are recorded and tracked. Data on issues may include:
      Issue type,
     uu

      Who raised the issue and when,
     uu

      Description,
     uu

      Priority,
     uu

      Who is assigned to the issue,
     uu

      Target resolution date,
     uu

      Status, and
     uu

      Final solution.
     uu

   The issue log will help the project manager effectively track and manage issues, ensuring that they are investigated
and resolved. The issue log is created for the first time as an output of this process, although issues may happen at
any time during the project. The issue log is updated as a result of the monitoring and control activities throughout the
project's life cycle.

4.3.3.4 CHANGE REQUESTS

   A change request is a formal proposal to modify any document, deliverable, or baseline. When issues are found while
project work is being performed, change requests can be submitted, which may modify project policies or procedures,
project or product scope, project cost or budget, project schedule, or quality of the project or product results. Other
change requests cover the needed preventive or corrective actions to forestall negative impact later in the project.
Any project stakeholder may request a change. Change requests are processed for review and disposition through the
Perform Integrated Change Control process (Section 4.6). Change requests can be initiated from inside or outside the
project and they can be optional or legally/contractually mandated. Change requests may include:
      Corrective action. An intentional activity that realigns the performance of the project work with the project
     uu
        management plan.
      Preventive action. An intentional activity that ensures the future performance of the project work is aligned with
     uu
        the project management plan.
      Defect repair. An intentional activity to modify a nonconforming product or product component.
     uu

      Updates. Changes to formally controlled project documents, plans, etc., to reflect modified or additional ideas
     uu
        or content.




                                                                                                          Part 1 - Guide
96
4.3.3.5 PROJECT MANAGEMENT PLAN UPDATES

   Any change to the project management plan goes through the organization's change control process via a change
request. Any component of the project management plan may require a change request as a result of this process.

4.3.3.6 PROJECT DOCUMENTS UPDATES

  Project documents that may be updated as a result of carrying out this process include but are not limited to:
    Activity list. Described in Section 6.2.3.1. The activity list may be updated with additional or modified activities
   uu
      to be performed to complete project work.
    Assumption log. Described in Section 4.1.3.2. New assumptions and constraints may be added, and the status
   uu
      of existing assumptions and constraints may be updated or closed out.
    Lessons learned register. Described in Section 4.4.3.1. Any lessons learned that will improve performance for
   uu
      current or future projects is recorded as it is learned.
    Requirements documentation. Described in Section 5.2.3.1. New requirements may be identified during this
   uu
      process. Progress on meeting requirements can also be updated.
    Risk register. Described in Section 11.2.3.1. New risks may be identified and existing risks may be updated
   uu
      during this process. Risks are recorded in the risk register via risk management processes.
    Stakeholder register. Described in Section 13.1.3.1. Where additional information on existing or new stakeholders
   uu
      is gathered as a result of this process, it is recorded in the stakeholder register.

4.3.3.7 ORGANIZATIONAL PROCESS ASSETS UPDATES

  Any organizational process asset can be updated as a result of this process.




                                                                                                                     97
4.4 MANAGE PROJECT KNOWLEDGE
   Manage Project Knowledge is the process of using existing knowledge and creating new knowledge to achieve the
project's objectives and contribute to organizational learning. The key benefits of this process are that prior organizational
knowledge is leveraged to produce or improve the project outcomes, and knowledge created by the project is available
to support organizational operations and future projects or phases. This process is performed throughout the project.
The inputs, tools and techniques, and outputs of the process are depicted in Figure 4-8. Figure 4-9 depicts the data flow
diagram for the process.

  Knowledge is commonly split into "explicit" (knowledge that can be readily codified using words, pictures, and
numbers) and "tacit" (knowledge that is personal and difficult to express, such as beliefs, insights, experience,
and "know-how"). Knowledge management is concerned with managing both tacit and explicit knowledge for two
purposes: reusing existing knowledge and creating new knowledge. The key activities that underpin both purposes are
knowledge sharing and knowledge integration (of knowledge from different domains, contextual knowledge, and project
management knowledge).
   It is a common misconception that managing knowledge involves just documenting it so it can be shared. Another
common misconception is that managing knowledge involves just obtaining lessons learned at the end of the project,
in order to use it in the future projects. Only codified explicit knowledge can be shared in this way. But codified explicit
knowledge lacks context and is open to different interpretations, so even though it can easily be shared, it isn't always
understood or applied in the right way. Tacit knowledge has context built in but is very difficult to codify. It resides in
the minds of individual experts or in social groups and situations, and is normally shared through conversations and
interactions between people.
   From an organizational perspective, knowledge management is about making sure the skills, experience, and expertise
of the project team and other stakeholders are used before, during, and after the project. Because knowledge resides in
the minds of people and people cannot be forced to share what they know (or to pay attention to others' knowledge), the
most important part of knowledge management is creating an atmosphere of trust so that people are motivated to share
their knowledge. Even the best knowledge management tools and techniques will not work if people are not motivated
to share what they know or to pay attention to what others know. In practice, knowledge is shared using a mixture of
knowledge management tools and techniques (interactions between people) and information management tools and
techniques (in which people codify part of their explicit knowledge by documenting it so it can be shared).



4.4.1 MANAGE PROJECT KNOWLEDGE: INPUTS

4.4.1.1 PROJECT MANAGEMENT PLAN

  Described in Section 4.2.3.1. All components of the project management plan are inputs.




                                                                                                             Part 1 - Guide
100
   4.4.1.2 PROJECT DOCUMENTS

     Project documents that can be considered as inputs for this process include but are not limited to:
       Lessons learned register. Described in Section 4.4.3.1. The lessons learned register provides information on
      uu
          effective practices in knowledge management.
       Project team assignments. Described in Section 9.3.3.1. Project team assignments provide information on the
      uu
          type of competencies and experience available in the project and the knowledge that may be missing.
       Resource breakdown structure. Described in Section 9.2.3.3. The resource breakdown structure includes
      uu
          information on the composition of the team and may help to understand what knowledge is available as a group
          and what knowledge is missing.
       Stakeholder register. Described in Section 13.1.3.1. The stakeholder register contains details about the identified
      uu
          stakeholders to help understand the knowledge they may have.

   4.4.1.3 DELIVERABLES

      A deliverable is any unique and verifiable product, result, or capability to perform a service that is required to be
   produced to complete a process, phase, or project. Deliverables are typically tangible components completed to meet
   the project objectives and can include components of the project management plan.

   4.4.1.4 ENTERPRISE ENVIRONMENTAL FACTORS

      The enterprise environmental factors that can influence the Manage Project Knowledge process include but are not
   limited to:
       Organizational, stakeholder, and customer culture. The existence of trusting working relationships and a
      uu
          no-blame culture is particularly important in managing knowledge. Other factors include the value placed on
          learning and social behavioral norms.
       Geographic distribution of facilities and resources. The location of team members helps determine methods
      uu
          for gaining and sharing knowledge.
       Organizational knowledge experts. Some organizations have a team or individual that specializes in knowledge
      uu





          management.





       Legal and regulatory requirements and/or constraints. These include confidentiality of project information.
      uu




                                                                                                                       101
4.4.1.5 ORGANIZATIONAL PROCESS ASSETS

  Knowledge about project management is often embedded in processes and routines. The organizational process
assets that can influence the Manage Project Knowledge process include but are not limited to:
    Organizational standard policies, processes, and procedures. These may include: confidentiality and access
   uu
       to information; security and data protection; record retention policies; use of copyrighted information; destruction
       of classified information; format and maximum size of files; registry data and metadata; authorized technology
       and social media; etc.
    Personnel administration. These include, for example, employee development and training records, and
   uu
       competency frameworks that refer to knowledge-sharing behaviors.
    Organizational communication requirements. Formal, rigid communication requirements are good for sharing
   uu
       information. Informal communication is more effective for creating new knowledge and integrating knowledge
       across diverse stakeholder groups.
    Formal knowledge-sharing and information-sharing procedures. These include learning reviews before,
   uu
       during, and after projects and project phases; for example, identifying, capturing, and sharing lessons learned
       from the current project and other projects.


4.4.2 MANAGE PROJECT KNOWLEDGE: TOOLS AND TECHNIQUES

4.4.2.1 EXPERT JUDGMENT

   Described in Section 4.1.2.1. Expertise should be considered from individuals or groups with specialized knowledge
or training in the following topics:
    Knowledge management,
   uu

    Information management,
   uu

    Organizational learning,
   uu

    Knowledge and information management tools, and
   uu

    Relevant information from other projects.
   uu


4.4.2.2 KNOWLEDGE MANAGEMENT

   Knowledge management tools and techniques connect people so they can work together to create new knowledge,
share tacit knowledge, and integrate the knowledge of diverse team members. The tools and techniques appropriate in
a project depend on the nature of the project, especially the degree of innovation involved, the project complexity, and
the level of diversity (including diversity of disciplines) among team members.




                                                                                                            Part 1 - Guide
102
  Tools and techniques include but are not limited to:
    Networking, including informal social interaction and online social networking. Online forums where people
   uu
       can ask open questions ("What does anyone know about...?") are useful for starting knowledge-sharing
       conversations with specialists;
    Communities of practice (sometimes called communities of interest or just communities) and special
   uu
       interest groups;
    Meetings, including virtual meetings where participants can interact using communications technology;
   uu

    Work shadowing and reverse shadowing;
   uu

    Discussion forums such as focus groups;
   uu

    Knowledge-sharing events such as seminars and conferences;
   uu

    Workshops, including problem-solving sessions and learning reviews designed to identify lessons learned;
   uu

    Storytelling;
   uu

    Creativity and ideas management techniques;
   uu

    Knowledge fairs and cafes; and
   uu

    Training that involves interaction between learners.
   uu

   All of these tools and techniques can be applied face-to-face or virtually, or both. Face-to-face interaction is usually
the most effective way to build the trusting relationships that are needed to manage knowledge. Once relationships are
established, virtual interaction can be used to maintain the relationship.

4.4.2.3 INFORMATION MANAGEMENT

   Information management tools and techniques are used to create and connect people to information. They are
effective for sharing simple, unambiguous, codified explicit knowledge. They include but are not limited to:
    Methods for codifying explicit knowledge; for example, for producing lessons to be learned entries for the lessons
   uu
       learned register;
    Lessons learned register;
   uu

    Library services;
   uu

    Information gathering, for example, web searches and reading published articles; and
   uu

    Project management information system (PMIS). Described in Section 4.3.2.2. Project management information
   uu
       systems often include document management systems.
  Tools and techniques that connect people to information can be enhanced by adding an element of interaction, for
example, include a "contact me" function so users can get in touch with the originators of the lessons and ask for advice
specific to their project and context.




                                                                                                                       103
   Interaction and support also helps people find relevant information. Asking for help is generally quicker and easier
than trying to identify search terms. Search terms are often difficult to select because people may not know which
keywords or key phrases to use to access the information they need.
    Knowledge and information management tools and techniques should be connected to project processes and process
owners. Communities of practice and subject matter experts (SMEs), for example, may generate insights that lead
to improved control processes; having an internal sponsor can ensure improvements are implemented. Lessons learned
register entries may be analyzed to identify common issues that can be addressed by changes to project procedures.

4.4.2.4 INTERPERSONAL AND TEAM SKILLS

  The interpersonal and team skills used include but are not limited to:
    Active listening. Described in Section 10.2.2.6. Active listening helps reduce misunderstandings and improves
   uu
       communication and knowledge sharing.
    Facilitation. Described in Section 4.1.2.3. Facilitation helps effectively guide a group to a successful decision,
   uu
       solution, or conclusion.
    Leadership. Described in Section 3.4.4. Leadership is used to communicate the vision and inspire the project
   uu
       team to focus on the appropriate knowledge and knowledge objectives.
    Networking. Described in Section 10.2.2.6. Networking allows informal connections and relations among project
   uu
       stakeholders to be established and creates the conditions to share tacit and explicit knowledge.
    Political awareness. Described in Section 10.1.2.6. Political awareness helps the project manager to plan
   uu
       communications based on the project environment as well as the organization's political environment.


4.4.3 MANAGE PROJECT KNOWLEDGE: OUTPUTS

4.4.3.1 LESSONS LEARNED REGISTER

   The lessons learned register can include the category and description of the situation. The lessons learned register
may also include the impact, recommendations, and proposed actions associated with the situation. The lessons learned
register may record challenges, problems, realized risks and opportunities, or other content as appropriate.
   The lessons learned register is created as an output of this process early in the project. Thereafter it is used as an
input and updated as an output in many processes throughout the project. The persons or teams involved in the work are
also involved in capturing the lessons learned. Knowledge can be documented using videos, pictures, audios, or other
suitable means that ensure the efficiency of the lessons captured.
   At the end of a project or phase, the information is transferred to an organizational process asset called a lessons
learned repository.




                                                                                                          Part 1 - Guide
104
4.4.3.2 PROJECT MANAGEMENT PLAN UPDATES

   Any change to the project management plan goes through the organization's change control process via a change
request. Any component of the project management plan may be updated as a result of this process.

4.4.3.3 ORGANIZATIONAL PROCESS ASSETS UPDATES

   All projects create new knowledge. Some of this knowledge is codified, embedded in deliverables, or embedded in
improvements to processes and procedures as a result of the Manage Project Knowledge process. Existing knowledge
can also be codified or embedded for the first time as a result of this process; for example, if an existing idea for a new
procedure is piloted in the project and found to be successful.
  Any organizational process asset can be updated as a result of this process.



4.5 MONITOR AND CONTROL PROJECT WORK
   Monitor and Control Project Work is the process of tracking, reviewing, and reporting the overall progress to meet
the performance objectives defined in the project management plan. The key benefits of this process are that it allows
stakeholders to understand the current state of the project, to recognize the actions taken to address any performance
issues, and to have visibility into the future project status with cost and schedule forecasts. This process is performed
throughout the project. The inputs, tools and techniques, and outputs of the process are depicted in Figure 4-10. Figure
4-11 depicts the data flow diagram for the process.

      Monitoring is an aspect of project management performed throughout the project. Monitoring includes collecting,
   measuring, and assessing measurements and trends to effect process improvements. Continuous monitoring gives
   the project management team insight into the health of the project and identifies any areas that may require special
   attention. Control includes determining corrective or preventive actions or replanning and following up on action plans
   to determine whether the actions taken resolved the performance issue. The Monitor and Control Project Work process
   is concerned with:
       Comparing actual project performance against the project management plan;
      uu

       Assessing performance periodically to determine whether any corrective or preventive actions are indicated, and
      uu
          then recommending those actions as necessary;
       Checking the status of individual project risks;
      uu

       Maintaining an accurate, timely information base concerning the project's product(s) and their associated
      uu
          documentation through project completion;
       Providing information to support status reporting, progress measurement, and forecasting;
      uu

       Providing forecasts to update current cost and current schedule information;
      uu

       Monitoring implementation of approved changes as they occur;
      uu

       Providing appropriate reporting on project progress and status to program management when the project is part
      uu
          of an overall program; and
       Ensuring that the project stays aligned with the business needs.
      uu



   4.5.1 MONITOR AND CONTROL PROJECT WORK: INPUTS

   4.5.1.1 PROJECT MANAGEMENT PLAN

     Described in Section 4.2.3.1. Monitoring and controlling project work involves looking at all aspects of the project.
   Any component of the project management plan may be an input for this process.






                                                                                                                      107
4.5.1.2 PROJECT DOCUMENTS

  Project documents that can be considered as inputs for this process include but are not limited to:
   Assumption log. Described in Section 4.1.3.2. The assumption log contains information about assumptions and
  uu
      constraints identified as affecting the project.
   Basis of estimates. Described in Sections 6.4.3.2 and 7.2.3.2. Basis of estimates indicates how the various
  uu
      estimates were derived and can be used to make a decision on how to respond to variances.
   Cost forecasts. Described in Section 7.4.3.2. Based on the project's past performance, the cost forecasts are
  uu
      used to determine if the project is within defined tolerance ranges for budget and to identify any necessary
      change requests.
   Issue log. Described in Section 4.3.3.3. The issue log is used to document and monitor who is responsible for
  uu
      resolving specific issues by a target date.
   Lessons learned register. Described in Section 4.4.3.1. The lessons learned register may have information on
  uu
      effective responses for variances, and corrective and preventive actions.
   Milestone list. Described in Section 6.2.3.3. The milestone list shows the scheduled dates for specific milestones
  uu
      and is used to check if the planned milestones have been met.
   Quality reports. Described in Section 8.2.3.1. The quality report includes quality management issues;
  uu
      recommendations for process, project, and product improvements; corrective actions recommendations
      (includes rework, defect/bugs repair, 100% inspection, and more); and the summary of findings from the
      Control Quality process.
   Risk register. Described in Section 11.2.3.1. The risk register provides information on threats and opportunities
  uu
      that have occurred during project execution.
   Risk report. Described in Section 11.2.3.2. The risk report provides information on the overall project risks as
  uu
      well as information on specified individual risks.
   Schedule forecasts. Described in Section 6.6.3.2. Based on the project's past performance, the schedule
  uu
      forecasts are used to determine if the project is within defined tolerance ranges for schedule and to identify any
      necessary change requests.




                                                                                                         Part 1 - Guide
108
4.5.1.3 WORK PERFORMANCE INFORMATION

   Work performance data is gathered through work execution and passed to the controlling processes. To become work
performance information, the work performance data are compared with the project management plan components,
project documents, and other project variables. This comparison indicates how the project is performing.
   Specific work performance metrics for scope, schedule, budget, and quality are defined at the start of the project
as part of the project management plan. Performance data are collected during the project through the controlling
processes and compared to the plan and other variables to provide a context for work performance.
   For example, work performance data on cost may include funds that have been expended. However, to be useful, that
data has to be compared to the budget, the work that was performed, the resources used to accomplish the work, and
the funding schedule. This additional information provides the context to determine if the project is on budget or if there
is a variance. It also indicates the degree of variance from the plan, and by comparing it to the variance thresholds in
the project management plan it can indicate if preventive or corrective action is required. Interpreting work performance
data and the additional information as a whole provides a context that provides a sound foundation for project decisions.

4.5.1.4 AGREEMENTS

   Described in Section 12.2.3.2. A procurement agreement includes terms and conditions, and may incorporate other
items that the buyer specifies regarding what the seller is to perform or provide. If the project is outsourcing part of the
work, the project manager needs to oversee the contractor's work to make certain that all the agreements meet the
specific needs of the project while adhering to organizational procurement policies.

4.5.1.5 ENTERPRISE ENVIRONMENTAL FACTORS

  The enterprise environmental factors that can influence the Monitor and Control Project Work process include but are
not limited to:
    Project management information systems such as scheduling, cost, resourcing tools, performance indicators,
   uu

    Infrastructure (e.g., existing facilities and equipment, organizations telecommunications channels);
   uu

    Stakeholders' expectations and risk thresholds; and
   uu

    Government or industry standards (e.g., regulatory agency regulations, product standards, quality standards, and
   uu
       workmanship standards).




                                                                                                                        109

   uu

    Interpretation and contextualization of data,
   uu

    Techniques to estimate duration and costs,
   uu

    Trend analysis,
   uu

    Technical knowledge on the industry and focus area of the project,
   uu

    Risk management, and
   uu

    Contract management.
   uu




                                                                                                        Part 1 - Guide
110
   4.5.2.2 DATA ANALYSIS

     Data analysis techniques that can be used include but are not limited to:
       Alternatives analysis. Alternatives analysis is used to select the corrective actions or a combination of corrective
      uu
         and preventive actions to implement when a deviation occurs.
       Cost-benefit analysis. Described in Section 8.1.2.3. Cost-benefit analysis helps to determine the best corrective
      uu
         action in terms of cost in case of project deviations.
       Earned value analysis. Described in Section 7.4.2.2. Earned value provides an integrated perspective on scope,
      uu
         schedule, and cost performance.
       Root cause analysis. Described in Section 8.2.2.2. Root cause analysis focuses on identifying the main reasons
      uu
         of a problem. It can be used to identify the reasons for a deviation and the areas the project manager should focus
         on in order to achieve the objectives of the project.
       Trend analysis. Trend analysis is used to forecast future performance based on past results. It looks ahead in the
      uu
         project for expected slippages and warns the project manager ahead of time that there may be problems later in
         the schedule if established trends persist. This information is made available early enough in the project timeline
         to give the project team time to analyze and correct any anomalies. The results of trend analysis can be used to
         recommend preventive actions if necessary.
       Variance analysis. Variance analysis reviews the differences (or variance) between planned and actual
      uu
         performance. This can include duration estimates, cost estimates, resources utilization, resources rates, technical
         performance, and other metrics.
         Variance analysis may be conducted in each Knowledge Area based on its particular variables. In Monitor and
         Control Project Work, the variance analysis reviews the variances from an integrated perspective considering
         cost, time, technical, and resource variances in relation to each other to get an overall view of variance on the
         project. This allows for the appropriate preventive or corrective actions to be initiated.

   4.5.2.3 DECISION MAKING

      A decision-making technique that can be used includes but is not limited to voting. Described in Section 5.2.2.4.
   Voting can include making decisions based on unanimity, majority, or plurality.






   4.5.2.4 MEETINGS

      Meetings may be face-to-face, virtual, formal, or informal. They may include project team members and other project
   stakeholders when appropriate. Types of meetings include but are not limited to user groups and review meetings.




                                                                                                                        111
4.5.3 MONITOR AND CONTROL PROJECT WORK: OUTPUTS

4.5.3.1 WORK PERFORMANCE REPORTS

   Work performance information is combined, recorded, and distributed in a physical or electronic form in order to create
awareness and generate decisions or actions. Work performance reports are the physical or electronic representation of
work performance information intended to generate decisions, actions, or awareness. They are circulated to the project
stakeholders through the communication processes as defined in the project communications management plan.
  Examples of work performance reports include status reports and progress reports. Work performance reports can
contain earned value graphs and information, trend lines and forecasts, reserve burndown charts, defect histograms,
contract performance information, and risk summaries. They can be presented as dashboards, heat reports, stop light
charts, or other representations useful for creating awareness and generating decisions and actions.

4.5.3.2 CHANGE REQUESTS

   Described in Section 4.3.3.4. As a result of comparing planned results to actual results, change requests may
be issued to expand, adjust, or reduce project scope, product scope, or quality requirements and schedule or cost
baselines. Change requests may necessitate the collection and documentation of new requirements. Changes can
impact the project management plan, project documents, or product deliverables. Change requests are processed for
review and disposition through the Perform Integrated Change Control process (Section 4.6). Changes may include but
are not limited to:
    Corrective action. An intentional activity that realigns the performance of the project work with the project
   uu
       management plan.
    Preventive action. An intentional activity that ensures the future performance of the project work is aligned with
   uu
       the project management plan.
    Defect repair. An intentional activity that modifies a nonconforming product or product component.
   uu


4.5.3.3 PROJECT MANAGEMENT PLAN UPDATES

   Any change to the project management plan goes through the organization's change control process via a change
request. Changes identified during the Monitor and Control Project Work process may affect the overall project
management plan.




                                                                                                           Part 1 - Guide
112
   4.5.3.4 PROJECT DOCUMENTS UPDATES

     Project documents that may be updated as a result of carrying out this process include but are not limited to:
       Cost forecasts. Described in Section 7.4.3.2. Changes in cost forecasts resulting from this process are recorded
      uu
          using cost management processes.
       Issue log. Described in Section 4.3.3.3. New issues raised as a result of this process are recorded in the
      uu
          issue log.
       Lessons learned register. Described in Section 4.4.3.1. The lessons learned register is updated with effective
      uu
          responses for variances and corrective and preventive actions.
       Risk register. Described in Section 11.2.3.1. New risks identified during this process are recorded in the risk
      uu
          register and managed using the risk management processes.
       Schedule forecasts. Described in Section 6.6.3.2. Changes in schedule forecasts resulting from this process are
      uu
          recorded using schedule management processes.



   4.6 PERFORM INTEGRATED CHANGE CONTROL
      Perform Integrated Change Control is the process of reviewing all change requests; approving changes and managing
   changes to deliverables, project documents, and the project management plan; and communicating the decisions.
   This process reviews all requests for changes to project documents, deliverables, or the project management plan
   and determines the resolution of the change requests. The key benefit of this process is that it allows for documented
   changes within the project to be considered in an integrated manner while addressing overall project risk, which often
   arises from changes made without consideration of the overall project objectives or plans. This process is performed
   throughout the project. The inputs, tools and techniques, and outputs of the process are depicted in Figure 4-12. Figure

      The Perform Integrated Change Control process is conducted from project start through completion and is the
   ultimate responsibility of the project manager. Change requests can impact the project scope and the product scope,
   as well as any project management plan component or any project document. Changes may be requested by any
   stakeholder involved with the project and may occur at any time throughout the project life cycle. The applied level
   of change control is dependent upon the application area, complexity of the specific project, contract requirements,
   and the context and environment in which the project is performed.
      Before the baselines are established, changes are not required to be formally controlled by the Perform Integrated
   Change Control process. Once the project is baselined, change requests go through this process. As a general rule, each
   project's configuration management plan should define which project artifacts need to be placed under configuration
   control. Any change in a configuration element should be formally controlled and will require a change request.
      Although changes may be initiated verbally, they should be recorded in written form and entered into the change
   management and/or configuration management system. Change requests may require information on estimated
   schedule impacts and estimated cost impacts prior to approval. Whenever a change request may impact any of the
   project baselines, a formal integrated change control process is always required. Every documented change request
   needs to be either approved, deferred, or rejected by a responsible individual, usually the project sponsor or project
   manager. The responsible individual will be identified in the project management plan or by organizational procedures.
   When required, the Perform Integrated Change Control process includes a change control board (CCB), which is a
   formally chartered group responsible for reviewing, evaluating, approving, deferring, or rejecting changes to the project
   and for recording and communicating such decisions.
      Approved change requests can require new or revised cost estimates, activity sequences, schedule dates, resource
   requirements, and/or analysis of risk response alternatives. These changes can require adjustments to the project
   management plan and other project documents. Customer or sponsor approval may be required for certain change
   requests after CCB approval, unless they are part of the CCB.

4.6.1 PERFORM INTEGRATED CHANGE CONTROL: INPUTS

4.6.1.1 PROJECT MANAGEMENT PLAN

  Described in Section 4.2.3.1. Project management plan components include but are not limited to:
    Change management plan. Described in Section 4.2.3.1. The change management plan provides the direction
   uu
       for managing the change control process and documents the roles and responsibilities of the change control
       board (CCB).
    Configuration management plan. Described in Section 4.2.3.1. The configuration management plan describes
   uu
       the configurable items of the project and identifies the items that will be recorded and updated so that the
       product of the project remains consistent and operable.
    Scope baseline. Described in Section 5.4.3.1. The scope baseline provides the project and product definition.
   uu

    Schedule baseline. Described in Section 6.5.3.1. The schedule baseline is used to assess the impact of the
   uu
       changes in the project schedule.
    Cost baseline. Described in Section 7.3.3.1. The cost baseline is used to assess the impact of the changes to
   uu
       the project cost.

4.6.1.2 PROJECT DOCUMENTS

  Project documents that can be considered as inputs for this process include but are not limited to:
    Basis of estimates. Described in Section 6.4.3.2. Basis of estimates indicate how the duration, cost, and
   uu
       resources estimates were derived and can be used to calculate the impact of the change in time, budget, and
       resources.
    Requirements traceability matrix. Described in Section 5.2.3.2. The requirements traceability matrix helps
   uu
       assess the impact of the change on the project scope.
    Risk report. Described in Section 11.2.3.2. The risk report presents information on sources of overall and
   uu
       individual project risks involved by the change requested.

4.6.1.3 WORK PERFORMANCE REPORTS

   Described in Section 4.5.3.1. Work performance reports of particular interest to the Perform Integrated Change Control
process include resource availability, schedule and cost data, earned value reports, and burnup or burndown charts.




                                                                                                          Part 1 - Guide
116
4.6.1.4 CHANGE REQUESTS

   Many processes produce change requests as an output. Change requests (described in Section 4.3.3.4) may
include corrective action, preventive action, defect repairs, as well as updates to formally controlled documents or
deliverables to reflect modified or additional ideas or content. Changes may or may not impact the project baselines--
sometimes only the performance against the baseline is affected. Decisions on those changes are usually made by
the project manager.
   Change requests that have an impact on the project baselines should normally include information about the cost
of implementing the change, modifications in the scheduled dates, resource requirements, and risks. These changes
should be approved by the CCB (if it exists) and by the customer or sponsor, unless they are part of the CCB. Only
approved changes should be incorporated into a revised baseline.

4.6.1.5 ENTERPRISE ENVIRONMENTAL FACTORS

   The enterprise environmental factors that can influence the Perform Integrated Change Control process include but
are not limited to:
    Legal restrictions, such as country or local regulations;
   uu

    Government or industry standards (e.g., product standards, quality standards, safety standards, and workmanship
   uu
      standards);
    Legal and regulatory requirements and/or constraints;
   uu

    Organizational governance framework (a structured way to provide control, direction, and coordination through
   uu
      people, policies, and processes to meet organizational strategic and operational goals); and
    Contracting and purchasing constraints.
   uu


4.6.1.6 ORGANIZATIONAL PROCESS ASSETS

  The organizational process assets that can influence the Perform Integrated Change Control process include but are
not limited to:
    Change control procedures, including the steps by which organizational standards, policies, plans, procedures, or
   uu
      any project documents will be modified, and how any changes will be approved and validated;
    Procedures for approving and issuing change authorizations; and
   uu

    Configuration management knowledge base containing the versions and baselines of all official organizational
   uu
      standards, policies, procedures, and any project documents.

   In order to facilitate configuration and change management, manual or automated tools may be used. Configuration
control is focused on the specification of both the deliverables and the processes, while change control is focused on
identifying, documenting, and approving or rejecting changes to the project documents, deliverables, or baselines.
  Tool selection should be based on the needs of the project stakeholders including organizational and environmental
considerations and/or constraints. Tools should support the following configuration management activities:
    Identify configuration item. Identification and selection of a configuration item to provide the basis for which
   uu
      the product configuration is defined and verified, products and documents are labeled, changes are managed,
      and accountability is maintained.
    Record and report configuration item status. Information recording and reporting about each configuration item.
   uu

    Perform configuration item verification and audit. Configuration verification and configuration audits ensure
   uu
      that the composition of a project's configuration items is correct and that corresponding changes are registered,
      assessed, approved, tracked, and correctly implemented. This ensures that the functional requirements defined
      in the configuration documentation are met.




                                                                                                        Part 1 - Guide

     Tools should support the following change management activities as well:
       Identify changes. Identifying and selecting a change item for processes or project documents.
      uu

       Document changes. Documenting the change into a proper change request.
      uu

       Decide on changes. Reviewing the changes; approving, rejecting, deferring, or making any other decision about
      uu
         changes to the project documents, deliverables, or baselines.
       Track changes. Verifying that the changes are registered, assessed, approved, and tracked and communicating
      uu
         final results to stakeholders.
     Tools are also used to manage the change requests and the resulting decisions. Additional considerations should be
   made for communications to assist the change control board (CCB) members in their duties, as well as to distribute the
   decisions to the appropriate stakeholders.

   4.6.2.3 DATA ANALYSIS

     Data analysis techniques that can be used for this process include but are not limited to:
       Alternatives analysis. Described in Section 9.2.2.5. This technique is used to assess the requested changes and
      uu
         decide which are accepted, rejected, or need to be modified to be finally accepted.
       Cost-benefit analysis. Described in Section 8.1.2.3. This analysis helps to determine if the requested change is
      uu
         worth its associated cost.

   4.6.2.4 DECISION MAKING

     Decision-making techniques that can be used for this process include but are not limited to:
       Voting. Described in Section 5.2.2.4. Voting can take the form of unanimity, majority, or plurality to decide on
      uu
         whether to accept, defer, or reject change requests.
       Autocratic decision making. In this decision-making technique, one individual takes the responsibility for
      uu
         making the decision for the entire group.
       Multicriteria decision analysis. Described in Section 8.1.2.4. This technique uses a decision matrix to provide
      uu





         a systematic analytical approach to evaluate the requested changes according to a set of predefined criteria.





                                                                                                                     119
4.6.2.5 MEETINGS

   Change control meetings are held with a change control board (CCB) that is responsible for meeting and reviewing
the change requests and approving, rejecting, or deferring change requests. Most changes will have some sort of impact
on time, cost, resources, or risks. Assessing the impact of the changes is an essential part of the meeting. Alternatives
to the requested changes may also be discussed and proposed. Finally, the decision is communicated to the request
owner or group.
   The CCB may also review configuration management activities. The roles and responsibilities of these boards are
clearly defined and agreed upon by the appropriate stakeholders and are documented in the change management plan.
CCB decisions are documented and communicated to the stakeholders for information and follow-up actions.



4.6.3 PERFORM INTEGRATED CHANGE CONTROL: OUTPUTS

4.6.3.1 APPROVED CHANGE REQUESTS

   Change requests (described in Section 4.3.3.4) are processed according to the change management plan by the
project manager, CCB, or an assigned team member. As a result, changes may be approved, deferred, or rejected.
Approved change requests will be implemented through the Direct and Manage Project Work process. Deferred or
rejected change requests are communicated to the person or group requesting the change.
  The disposition of all change requests are recorded in the change log as a project document update.

4.6.3.2 PROJECT MANAGEMENT PLAN UPDATES

   Any formally controlled component of the project management plan may be changed as a result of this process.
Changes to baselines are only made from the last baseline forward. Past performance is not changed. This protects the
integrity of the baselines and the historical data of past performance.

4.6.3.3 PROJECT DOCUMENTS UPDATES

  Any formally controlled project document may be changed as a result of this process. A project document that is
normally updated as a result of this process is the change log. The change log is used to document changes that occur
during a project.




                                                                                                          Part 1 - Guide

   4.7 CLOSE PROJECT OR PHASE
      Close Project or Phase is the process of finalizing all activities for the project, phase, or contract. The key benefits of
   this process are the project or phase information is archived, the planned work is completed, and organizational team
   resources are released to pursue new endeavors. This process is performed once or at predefined points in the project.
   The inputs, tools and techniques, and outputs of the process are depicted in Figure 4-14. Figure 4-15 depicts the data
   flow diagram for the process.

      When closing the project, the project manager reviews the project management plan to ensure that all project work
   is completed and that the project has met its objectives. The activities necessary for the administrative closure of the
   project or phase include but are not limited to:
       Actions and activities necessary to satisfy completion or exit criteria for the phase or project such as:
      uu

          nuMaking certain that all documents and deliverables are up-to-date and that all issues are resolved;
          nuConfirming the delivery and formal acceptance of deliverables by the customer;
          nuEnsuring that all costs are charged to the project;
          nuClosing project accounts;
          nuReassigning personnel;
          nuDealing with excess project material;
          nuReallocating project facilities, equipment, and other resources; and
          nuElaborating the final project reports as required by organizational policies.

       Activities related to the completion of the contractual agreements applicable to the project or project phase
      uu
          such as:
          nuConfirming the formal acceptance of the seller's work,
          nuFinalizing open claims,
          nuUpdating records to reflect final results, and
          nuArchiving such information for future use.

       Activities needed to:
      uu

          nuCollect project or phase records,
          nuAudit project success or failure,
          nuManage knowledge sharing and transfer,
          nuIdentify lessons learned, and
          nuArchive project information for future use by the organization.

      uu





          production and/or operations.
       Collecting any suggestions for improving or updating the policies and procedures of the organization, and sending





      uu
          them to the appropriate organizational unit.
       Measuring stakeholder satisfaction.
      uu

      The Close Project or Phase process also establishes the procedures to investigate and document the reasons for
   actions taken if a project is terminated before completion. In order to successfully achieve this, the project manager
   needs to engage all the proper stakeholders in the process.




                                                                                                                       123

   4.7.2.3 MEETINGS

      Meetings are used to confirm that the deliverables have been accepted, to validate that the exit criteria have been
   met, to formalize the completion of the contracts, to evaluate the satisfaction of the stakeholders, to gather lessons
   learned, to transfer knowledge and information from the project, and to celebrate success. Attendees may include
   project team members and other stakeholders involved in or affected by the project. Meetings may be face-to-face,
   virtual, formal, or informal. Types of meetings include but are not limited to close-out reporting meetings, customer
   wrap-up meetings, lessons learned meetings, and celebration meetings.



   4.7.3 CLOSE PROJECT OR PHASE: OUTPUTS

   4.7.3.1 PROJECT DOCUMENTS UPDATES

      All project documents may be updated and marked as final versions as a result of project closure. Of particular
   interest is the lessons learned register, which is finalized to include final information on phase or project closure.
   The final lessons learned register may include information on benefits management, accuracy of the business
   case, project and development life cycles, risk and issue management, stakeholder engagement, and other project
   management processes.

   4.7.3.2 FINAL PRODUCT, SERVICE, OR RESULT TRANSITION

      A product, service, or result, once delivered by the project, may be handed over to a different group or organization
   that will operate, maintain, and support it throughout its life cycle.
      This output refers to this transition of the final product, service, or result that the project was authorized to produce
   (or in the case of phase closure, the intermediate product, service, or result of that phase) from one team to another.

   4.7.3.3 FINAL REPORT

     The final report provides a summary of the project performance. It can include information such as:
       Summary level description of the project or phase.
      uu





       Scope objectives, the criteria used to evaluate the scope, and evidence that the completion criteria were met.
      uu





       Quality objectives, the criteria used to evaluate the project and product quality, the verification and actual
      uu
          milestone delivery dates, and reasons for variances.
       Cost objectives, including the acceptable cost range, actual costs, and reasons for any variances.
      uu

       Summary of the validation information for the final product, service, or result.
      uu




                                                                                                                           127
   Schedule objectives including whether results achieved the benefits that the project was undertaken to address.
  uu
      If the benefits are not met at the close of the project, indicate the degree to which they were achieved and
      estimate for future benefits realization.
   Summary of how the final product, service, or result achieved the business needs identified in the business plan.
  uu
      If the business needs are not met at the close of the project, indicate the degree to which they were achieved and
      estimate for when the business needs will be met in the future.
   Summary of any risks or issues encountered on the project and how they were addressed.
  uu


4.7.3.4 ORGANIZATIONAL PROCESS ASSET UPDATES

  Organizational process assets that are updated include but are not limited to:
   Project documents. Documentation resulting from the project's activities; for example, project management
  uu
      plan; scope, cost, schedule, and project calendars; and change management documentation.
   Operational and support documents. Documents required for an organization to maintain, operate, and support
  uu
      the product or service delivered by the project. These may be new documents or updates to existing documents.
   Project or phase closure documents. Project or phase closure documents, consisting of formal documentation
  uu
      that indicates completion of the project or phase and the transfer of the completed project or phase deliverables
      to others, such as an operations group or to the next phase. During project closure, the project manager reviews
      prior phase documentation, customer acceptance documentation from the Validate Scope process (Section 5.5),
      and the agreement (if applicable) to ensure that all project requirements are completed prior to finalizing the
      closure of the project. If the project was terminated prior to completion, the formal documentation indicates
      why the project was terminated and formalizes the procedures for the transfer of the finished and unfinished
      deliverables of the cancelled project to others.
   Lessons learned repository. Lessons learned and knowledge gained throughout the project are transferred to
  uu
      the lessons learned repository for use by future projects.

    PROJE CT SCO PE MANA GEM ENT
      Project Scope Management includes the processes required to ensure that the project includes all the work required,
   and only the work required, to complete the project successfully. Managing the project scope is primarily concerned with
   defining and controlling what is and is not included in the project.
     The Project Scope Management processes are:
     5.1 Plan Scope Management--The process of creating a scope management plan that documents how the project
   and product scope will be defined, validated, and controlled.
      5.2 Collect Requirements--The process of determining, documenting, and managing stakeholder needs and
   requirements to meet project objectives.
     5.3 Define Scope--The process of developing a detailed description of the project and product.
     5.4 Create WBS--The process of subdividing project deliverables and project work into smaller, more manageable
   components.
     5.5 Validate Scope--The process of formalizing acceptance of the completed project deliverables.
      5.6 Control Scope--The process of monitoring the status of the project and product scope and managing changes
   to the scope baseline.
      Figure 5-1 provides an overview of the Project Scope Management processes. The Project Scope Management
   processes are presented as discrete processes with defined interfaces while, in practice, they overlap and interact in
   ways that cannot be completely detailed in the PMBOK(R) Guide.

   KEY CONCEPTS FOR PROJECT SCOPE MANAGEMENT

     In the project context, the term "scope" can refer to:
       Product scope. The features and functions that characterize a product, service, or result.
      uu

       Project scope. The work performed to deliver a product, service, or result with the specified features and
      uu
          functions. The term "project scope" is sometimes viewed as including product scope.
      Project life cycles can range along a continuum from predictive approaches at one end to adaptive or agile approaches
   at the other. In a predictive life cycle, the project deliverables are defined at the beginning of the project and any changes
   to the scope are progressively managed. In an adaptive or agile life cycle, the deliverables are developed over multiple
   iterations where a detailed scope is defined and approved for each iteration when it begins.
      Projects with adaptive life cycles are intended to respond to high levels of change and require ongoing stakeholder
   engagement. The overall scope of an adaptive project will be decomposed into a set of requirements and work to
   be performed, sometimes referred to as a product backlog. At the beginning of an iteration, the team will work to
   determine how many of the highest-priority items on the backlog list can be delivered within the next iteration. Three
   processes (Collect Requirements, Define Scope, and Create WBS) are repeated for each iteration. On the contrary, in a
   predictive project, these processes are performed toward the beginning of the project and updated as necessary, using
   the integrated change control process.
      In an adaptive or agile life cycle, the sponsor and customer representatives should be continuously engaged with the
   project to provide feedback on deliverables as they are created and to ensure that the product backlog reflects their
   current needs. Two processes (Validate Scope and Control Scope) are repeated for each iteration. On the contrary, in a
   predictive project, Validate Scope occurs with each deliverable or phase review and Control Scope is an ongoing process.
      In predictive projects, the scope baseline for the project is the approved version of the project scope statement, work
   breakdown structure (WBS), and its associated WBS dictionary. A baseline can be changed only through formal change
   control procedures and is used as a basis for comparison while performing Validate Scope and Control Scope processes
   as well as other controlling processes. Projects with adaptive life cycles use backlogs (including product requirements
   and user stories) to reflect their current needs.
       Completion of the project scope is measured against the project management plan, while completion of the product
   scope is measured against the product requirements. The term "requirement" is defined as a condition or capability that





   is required to be present in a product, service, or result to satisfy an agreement or other formally imposed specification.





      Validate Scope is the process of formalizing acceptance of the completed project deliverables. The verified deliverables
   obtained from the Control Quality process are an input to the Validate Scope process. One of the outputs of Validate
   Scope is accepted deliverables that are formally signed off and approved by the authorized stakeholder. Therefore, the
   stakeholder needs to get involved early on during planning (sometimes initiating as well) and to provide inputs about
   quality of deliverables so that Control Quality can assess the performance and recommend necessary changes.




                                                                                                                            131
   TRENDS AND EMERGING PRACTICES IN PROJECT SCOPE MANAGEMENT

      Requirements have always been a concern in project management and have continued to gain more attention in
   the profession. As the global environment becomes more complex, organizations are starting to recognize how to
   use business analysis to their competitive advantage by defining, managing, and controlling requirements activities.
   Activities of business analysis may start before a project is initiated and a project manager is assigned. According
   to Requirements Management: A Practice Guide [14], the requirements management process starts with a needs
   assessment, which may begin in portfolio planning, in program planning, or within a discrete project.
      Eliciting, documenting, and managing stakeholder requirements takes place within the Project Scope Management
   processes. Trends and emerging practices for Project Scope Management include but are not limited to a focus on
   collaborating with business analysis professionals to:
       Determine problems and identify business needs;
      uu

       Identify and recommend viable solutions for meeting those needs;
      uu

       Elicit, document, and manage stakeholder requirements in order to meet business and project objectives; and
      uu

       Facilitate the successful implementation of the product, service, or end result of the program or project [7].
      uu

      The process ends with the requirements closure, which transitions the product, service, or result to the recipient in
   order to measure, monitor, realize, and sustain benefits over time.
      The role with responsibility to conduct business analysis should be assigned to resources with sufficient business
   analysis skills and expertise. If a business analyst is assigned to a project, requirement-related activities are the
   responsibility of that role. The project manager is responsible for ensuring that requirements-related work is accounted
   for in the project management plan and that requirements-related activities are performed on time and within budget
   and deliver value.
      The relationship between a project manager and a business analyst should be a collaborative partnership. A project
   will have a higher likelihood of being successful if project managers and business analysts fully understand each other's
   roles and responsibilities to successfully achieve project objectives.

TAILORING CONSIDERATIONS

   Because each project is unique, the project manager will need to tailor the way Project Scope Management processes
are applied. Considerations for tailoring include but are not limited to:
    Knowledge and requirements management. Does the organization have formal or informal knowledge and
   uu
       requirements management systems? What guidelines should the project manager establish for requirements to
       be reused in the future?
    Validation and control. Does the organization have existing formal or informal validation and control-related
   uu
       policies, procedures, and guidelines?
    Development approach. Does the organization use agile approaches in managing projects? Is the development
   uu
       approach iterative or incremental? Is a predictive approach used? Will a hybrid approach be productive?
    Stability of requirements. Are there areas of the project with unstable requirements? Do unstable requirements
   uu
       necessitate the use of lean, agile, or other adaptive techniques until they are stable and well defined?
    Governance. Does the organization have formal or informal audit and governance policies, procedures,
   uu
       and guidelines?

CONSIDERATIONS FOR AGILE/ADAPTIVE ENVIRONMENTS

   In projects with evolving requirements, high risk, or significant uncertainty, the scope is often not understood at the
beginning of the project or it evolves during the project. Agile methods deliberately spend less time trying to define
and agree on scope in the early stage of the project and spend more time establishing the process for its ongoing
discovery and refinement. Many environments with emerging requirements find that there is often a gap between
the real business requirements and the business requirements that were originally stated. Therefore, agile methods
purposefully build and review prototypes and release versions in order to refine the requirements. As a result, scope is
defined and redefined throughout the project. In agile approaches, the requirements constitute the backlog.




                                                                                                                      133
5.1 PLAN SCOPE MANAGEMENT
    Plan Scope Management is the process of creating a scope management plan that documents how the project and
product scope will be defined, validated, and controlled. The key benefit of this process is that it provides guidance and
direction on how scope will be managed throughout the project. This process is performed once or at predefined points
in the project. The inputs, tools and techniques, and outputs of this process are depicted in Figure 5-2. Figure 5-3 depicts
the data flow diagram of the process.

      The scope management plan is a component of the project or program management plan that describes how the
   scope will be defined, developed, monitored, controlled, and validated. The development of the scope management plan
   and the detailing of the project scope begin with the analysis of information contained in the project charter (Section
   4.1.3.1), the latest approved subsidiary plans of the project management plan (Section 4.2.3.1), historical information
   contained in the organizational process assets (Section 2.3), and any other relevant enterprise environmental factors
   (Section 2.2).

   The PMBOK(R) Guide does not specifically address product requirements since those are industry specific. Note that
Business Analysis for Practitioners: A Practice Guide [7] provides more in-depth information about product requirements.
The project's success is directly influenced by active stakeholder involvement in the discovery and decomposition of
needs into project and product requirements and by the care taken in determining, documenting, and managing the
requirements of the product, service, or result of the project. Requirements include conditions or capabilities that are
required to be present in a product, service, or result to satisfy an agreement or other formally imposed specification.
Requirements include the quantified and documented needs and expectations of the sponsor, customer, and other
stakeholders. These requirements need to be elicited, analyzed, and recorded in enough detail to be included in the
scope baseline and to be measured once project execution begins. Requirements become the foundation of the WBS.
Cost, schedule, quality planning, and procurement are all based on these requirements.

     Examples of project documents that can be considered as inputs for this process include but are not limited to:
       Assumption Log. Described in Section 4.1.3.2. The assumption log identified assumptions about the product,
      uu
         project, environment, stakeholders, and other factors that can influence requirements.
       Lessons learned register. Described in Section 4.4.3.1. The lessons learned register is used to provide
      uu
         information on effective requirements collection techniques, especially for projects that are using an iterative or
         adaptive product development methodology.
       Stakeholder Register. Described in Section 13.1.3.1. The stakeholder register is used to identify stakeholders
      uu
         who can provide information on the requirements. It also captures requirements and expectations that
         stakeholders have for the project.

   5.2.1.4 BUSINESS DOCUMENTS

5.2.2 COLLECT REQUIREMENTS: TOOLS AND TECHNIQUES

5.2.2.1 EXPERT JUDGMENT

   Described in Section 4.1.2.1. Expertise should be considered from individuals or groups with specialized knowledge
or training in the following topics:
    Business analysis,
   uu

    Requirements elicitation,
   uu

    Requirements analysis,
   uu

    Requirements documentation,
   uu

    Project requirements in previous similar projects,
   uu

    Diagramming techniques,
   uu

    Facilitation, and
   uu

    Conflict management.
   uu


5.2.2.2 DATA GATHERING

  Data-gathering techniques that can be used for this process include but are not limited to:
    Brainstorming. Described in Section 4.1.2.2. Brainstorming is a technique used to generate and collect multiple
   uu
      ideas related to project and product requirements.
    Interviews. An interview is a formal or informal approach to elicit information from stakeholders by talking
   uu
      to them directly. It is typically performed by asking prepared and spontaneous questions and recording the
      responses. Interviews are often conducted on an individual basis between an interviewer and an interviewee, but
      may involve multiple interviewers and/or multiple interviewees. Interviewing experienced project participants,
      sponsors, other executives, and subject matter experts can aid in identifying and defining the features and
      functions of the desired product deliverables. Interviews are also useful for obtaining confidential information.
    Focus groups. Focus groups bring together prequalified stakeholders and subject matter experts to learn about
   uu
      their expectations and attitudes about a proposed product, service, or result. A trained moderator guides the
      group through an interactive discussion designed to be more conversational than a one-on-one interview.




                                                                                                        Part 1 - Guide
142
    Questionnaires and surveys. Questionnaires and surveys are written sets of questions designed to quickly
   uu
       accumulate information from a large number of respondents. Questionnaires and/or surveys are most appropriate
       with varied audiences, when a quick turnaround is needed, when respondents are geographically dispersed, and
       where statistical analysis could be appropriate.
    Benchmarking. Described in Section 8.1.2.2. Benchmarking involves comparing actual or planned products,
   uu
       processes, and practices to those of comparable organizations to identify best practices, generate ideas for
       improvement, and provide a basis for measuring performance. The organizations compared during benchmarking
       can be internal or external.

5.2.2.3 DATA ANALYSIS

   Described in Section 4.5.2.2. Data analysis techniques that can be used for this process include but are not limited
to document analysis. Document analysis consists of reviewing and assessing any relevant documented information.
In this process, document analysis is used to elicit requirements by analyzing existing documentation and identifying
information relevant to the requirements. There is a wide range of documents that may be analyzed to help elicit relevant
requirements. Examples of documents that may be analyzed include but are not limited to:
    Agreements;
   uu

    Business plans;
   uu

    Business process or interface documentation;
   uu

5.2.2.4 DECISION MAKING

  Decision-making techniques that can be used in the Collect Requirements process include but are not limited to:
    Voting. Voting is a collective decision-making technique and an assessment process having multiple alternatives
   uu
       with an expected outcome in the form of future actions. These techniques can be used to generate, classify, and
       prioritize product requirements. Examples of voting techniques include:
       nuUnanimity. A decision that is reached whereby everyone agrees on a single course of action.
       nuMajority. A decision that is reached with support obtained from more than 50% of the members of the group.
          Having a group size with an uneven number of participants can ensure that a decision will be reached, rather
          than resulting in a tie.
       nuPlurality.
                  A decision that is reached whereby the largest block in a group decides, even if a majority is not
          achieved. This method is generally used when the number of options nominated is more than two.
    Autocratic decision making. In this method, one individual takes responsibility for making the decision
   uu
       for the group.
    Multicriteria decision analysis. A technique that uses a decision matrix to provide a systematic analytical
   uu
       approach for establishing criteria, such as risk levels, uncertainty, and valuation, to evaluate and rank many ideas.

5.2.2.5 DATA REPRESENTATION

  Data representation techniques that can be used for this process include but are not limited to:
    Affinity diagrams. Affinity diagrams allow large numbers of ideas to be classified into groups for review and
   uu
       analysis.
    Mind mapping. Mind mapping consolidates ideas created through individual brainstorming sessions into a
   uu
       single map to reflect commonality and differences in understanding and to generate new ideas.

5.2.2.6 INTERPERSONAL AND TEAM SKILLS

   Described in Section 4.1.2.3. The interpersonal and team skills that can be used in this process include but are not
limited to:
    Nominal group technique. The nominal group technique enhances brainstorming with a voting process used
   uu
       to rank the most useful ideas for further brainstorming or for prioritization. The nominal group technique is a
       structured form of brainstorming consisting of four steps:




                                                                                                            Part 1 - Guide
144
   nuA question or problem is posed to the group. Each person silently generates and writes down their ideas.
   nuThe moderator writes down the ideas on a flip chart until all ideas are recorded.
   nuEach recorded idea is discussed until all group members have a clear understanding.
   nuIndividuals vote privately to prioritize the ideas, usually using a scale of 1 - 5, with 1 being the lowest and 5
      being the highest. Voting may take place in many rounds to reduce and focus in on ideas. After each round,
      the votes are tallied and the highest scoring ideas are selected.
 Observation/conversation. Observation and conversation provide a direct way of viewing individuals in their
uu
   environment and how they perform their jobs or tasks and carry out processes. It is particularly helpful for detailed
   processes when the people who use the product have difficulty or are reluctant to articulate their requirements.
   Observation is also known as "job shadowing." It is usually done externally by an observer viewing a business
   expert performing a job. It can also be done by a "participant observer" who actually performs a process or
   procedure to experience how it is done to uncover hidden requirements.
 Facilitation. Described in Section 4.1.2.3. Facilitation is used with focused sessions that bring key stakeholders
uu
   together to define product requirements. Workshops can be used to quickly define cross-functional
   requirements and reconcile stakeholder differences. Because of their interactive group nature, well-facilitated
   sessions can build trust, foster relationships, and improve communication among the participants, which can
   lead to increased stakeholder consensus. In addition, issues can be discovered earlier and resolved more
   quickly than in individual sessions.
   Facilitation skills are used in the following situations, but are not limited to:
   nuJoint  application design/development (JAD). JAD sessions are used in the software development industry.
      These facilitated sessions focus on bringing business subject matter experts and the development team
      together to gather requirements and improve the software development process.
   nuQuality function deployment (QFD). In the manufacturing industry, QFD is another facilitation technique that
      helps determine critical characteristics for new product development. QFD starts by collecting customer
      needs, also known as voice of the customer (VOC). These needs are then objectively sorted and prioritized,
      and goals are set for achieving them.
   nuUser   stories. User stories, which are short, textual descriptions of required functionality, are often developed
      during a requirements workshop. User stories describe the stakeholder role, who benefits from the feature
      (role), what the stakeholder needs to accomplish (goal), and the benefit to the stakeholder (motivation).




                                                                                                                   145
5.2.2.7 CONTEXT DIAGRAM

   The context diagram is an example of a scope model. Context diagrams visually depict the product scope by showing
a business system (process, equipment, computer system, etc.), and how people and other systems (actors) interact
with it (see Figure 5-6). Context diagrams show inputs to the business system, the actor(s) providing the input, the
outputs from the business system, and the actor(s) receiving the output.

   5.2.2.8 PROTOTYPES

      Prototyping is a method of obtaining early feedback on requirements by providing a model of the expected product
   before actually building it. Examples of prototypes are small-scale products, computer generated 2D and 3D models,
   mock-ups, or simulations. Prototypes allow stakeholders to experiment with a model of the final product rather than
   being limited to discussing abstract representations of their requirements. Prototypes support the concept of progressive
   elaboration in iterative cycles of mock-up creation, user experimentation, feedback generation, and prototype revision.
   When enough feedback cycles have been performed, the requirements obtained from the prototype are sufficiently
   complete to move to a design or build phase.
      Storyboarding is a prototyping technique showing sequence or navigation through a series of images or illustrations.
   Storyboards are used on a variety of projects in a variety of industries, such as film, advertising, instructional design,
   and on agile and other software development projects. In software development, storyboards use mock-ups to show
   navigation paths through web pages, screens, or other user interfaces.



   5.2.3 COLLECT REQUIREMENTS: OUTPUTS

   5.2.3.1 REQUIREMENTS DOCUMENTATION

      Requirements documentation describes how individual requirements meet the business need for the project.
   Requirements may start out at a high level and become progressively more detailed as more information about the
   requirements is known. Before being baselined, requirements need to be unambiguous (measurable and testable),
   traceable, complete, consistent, and acceptable to key stakeholders. The format of the requirements document may
   range from a simple document listing all the requirements categorized by stakeholder and priority, to more elaborate
   forms containing an executive summary, detailed descriptions, and attachments.






                                                                                                                        147
   Many organizations categorize requirements into different types, such as business and technical solutions, the
former referring to stakeholder needs and the latter as to how those needs will be implemented. Requirements can
be grouped into classifications allowing for further refinement and detail as the requirements are elaborated. These
classifications include:
    Business requirements. These describe the higher-level needs of the organization as a whole, such as the
   uu
       business issues or opportunities, and reasons why a project has been undertaken.
    Stakeholder requirements. These describe needs of a stakeholder or stakeholder group.
   uu

    Solution requirements. These describe features, functions, and characteristics of the product, service, or
   uu
       result that will meet the business and stakeholder requirements. Solution requirements are further grouped into
       functional and nonfunctional requirements:
       nuFunctional   requirements. Functional requirements describe the behaviors of the product. Examples include
          actions, processes, data, and interactions that the product should execute.
       nuNonfunctional    requirements. Nonfunctional requirements supplement functional requirements and describe
          the environmental conditions or qualities required for the product to be effective. Examples include: reliability,
          security, performance, safety, level of service, supportability, retention/purge, etc.
    Transition and readiness requirements. These describe temporary capabilities, such as data conversion and
   uu
       training requirements, needed to transition from the current as-is state to the desired future state.
    Project requirements. These describe the actions, processes, or other conditions the project needs to meet.
   uu
       Examples include milestone dates, contractual obligations, constraints, etc.
    Quality requirements. These capture any condition or criteria needed to validate the successful completion
   uu
       of a project deliverable or fulfillment of other project requirements. Examples include tests, certifications,
       validations, etc.

5.2.3.2 REQUIREMENTS TRACEABILITY MATRIX

   The requirements traceability matrix is a grid that links product requirements from their origin to the deliverables
that satisfy them. The implementation of a requirements traceability matrix helps ensure that each requirement adds
business value by linking it to the business and project objectives. It provides a means to track requirements throughout
the project life cycle, helping to ensure that requirements approved in the requirements documentation are delivered at
the end of the project. Finally, it provides a structure for managing changes to the product scope.




                                                                                                            Part 1 - Guide
148
     Tracing requirements includes but is not limited to:
       Business needs, opportunities, goals, and objectives;
      uu

       Project objectives;
      uu

       Project scope and WBS deliverables;
      uu

       Product design;
      uu

       Product development;
      uu

       Test strategy and test scenarios; and
      uu

       High-level requirements to more detailed requirements.
      uu

      Attributes associated with each requirement can be recorded in the requirements traceability matrix. These
   attributes help to define key information about the requirement. Typical attributes used in the requirements traceability
   matrix may include: a unique identifier, a textual description of the requirement, the rationale for inclusion, owner,
   source, priority, version, current status (such as active, cancelled, deferred, added, approved, assigned, completed),
   and status date. Additional attributes to ensure that the requirement has met stakeholders' satisfaction may include
   stability, complexity, and acceptance criteria. Figure 5-7 provides an example of a requirements traceability matrix
   with its associated attributes.

5.3 DEFINE SCOPE
   Define Scope is the process of developing a detailed description of the project and product. The key benefit of
this process is that it describes the product, service, or result boundaries and acceptance criteria. The inputs, tools
and techniques, and outputs of this process are depicted in Figure 5-8. Figure 5-9 depicts the data flow diagram
of the process.

      Since all the requirements identified in Collect Requirements may not be included in the project, the Define Scope
   process selects the final project requirements from the requirements documentation developed during the Collect
   Requirements process. It then develops a detailed description of the project and product, service, or result.
      The preparation of a detailed project scope statement builds upon the major deliverables, assumptions, and
   constraints that are documented during project initiation. During project planning, the project scope is defined and





   described with greater specificity as more information about the project is known. Existing risks, assumptions, and





   constraints are analyzed for completeness and added or updated as necessary. The Define Scope process can be highly
   iterative. In iterative life cycle projects, a high-level vision will be developed for the overall project, but the detailed scope
   is determined one iteration at a time, and the detailed planning for the next iteration is carried out as work progresses
   on the current project scope and deliverables.




                                                                                                                                        151

5.3.3 DEFINE SCOPE: OUTPUTS

5.3.3.1 PROJECT SCOPE STATEMENT

   The project scope statement is the description of the project scope, major deliverables, assumptions, and constraints.
The project scope statement documents the entire scope, including project and product scope. It describes the project's
deliverables in detail. It also provides a common understanding of the project scope among project stakeholders. It may
contain explicit scope exclusions that can assist in managing stakeholder expectations. It enables the project team
to perform more detailed planning, guides the project team's work during execution, and provides the baseline for
evaluating whether requests for changes or additional work are contained within or outside the project's boundaries.
  The degree and level of detail to which the project scope statement defines the work that will be performed and the
work that is excluded can help determine how well the project management team can control the overall project scope.
The detailed project scope statement, either directly or by reference to other documents, includes the following:
    Product scope description. Progressively elaborates the characteristics of the product, service, or result
   uu
       described in the project charter and requirements documentation.
    Deliverables. Any unique and verifiable product, result, or capability to perform a service that is required
   uu
       to be produced to complete a process, phase, or project. Deliverables also include ancillary results, such as
       project management reports and documentation. These deliverables may be described at a summary level
       or in great detail.
    Acceptance criteria. A set of conditions that is required to be met before deliverables are accepted.
   uu

    Project exclusions. Identifies what is excluded from the project. Explicitly stating what is out of scope for the
   uu
       project helps manage stakeholders' expectations and can reduce scope creep.
   Although the project charter and the project scope statement are sometimes perceived as containing a certain
degree of redundancy, they are different in the level of detail contained in each. The project charter contains high-
level information, while the project scope statement contains a detailed description of the scope components. These
components are progressively elaborated throughout the project. Table 5-1 describes some of the key elements for
each document.




                                                                                                          Part 1 - Guide

5.4 CREATE WBS
  Create WBS is the process of subdividing project deliverables and project work into smaller, more manageable
components. The key benefit of this process is that it provides a framework of what has to be delivered. This process is
performed once or at predefined points in the project. The inputs, tools and techniques, and outputs of this process are
depicted in Figure 5-10. Figure 5-11 depicts the data flow diagram of the process.

      The WBS is a hierarchical decomposition of the total scope of work to be carried out by the project team to accomplish
   the project objectives and create the required deliverables. The WBS organizes and defines the total scope of the project
   and represents the work specified in the current approved project scope statement.
     The planned work is contained within the lowest level of WBS components, which are called work packages. A work
   package can be used to group the activities where work is scheduled and estimated, monitored, and controlled. In the
   context of the WBS, work refers to work products or deliverables that are the result of activity and not to the activity itself.



   5.4.1 CREATE WBS: INPUTS

   5.4.1.1 PROJECT MANAGEMENT PLAN

     A project management plan component includes but is not limited to the scope management plan. Described in
   Section 5.1.3.1, the scope management plan documents how the WBS will be created from the project scope statement.

   5.4.1.2 PROJECT DOCUMENTS

      Examples of project documents that can be considered as inputs for this process include but are not limited to:
       Project scope statement. Described in Section 5.3.3.1. The project scope statement describes the work that
      uu
          will be performed and the work that is excluded.
       Requirements documentation. Described in Section 5.2.3.1. Detailed requirements describe how individual
      uu
          requirements meet the business need for the project.

   5.4.1.3 ENTERPRISE ENVIRONMENTAL FACTORS

      The enterprise environmental factors that can influence the Create WBS process include but are not limited to
   industry-specific WBS standards that are relevant to the nature of the project. These industry-specific standards may
   serve as external reference sources for creating the WBS.

   5.4.1.4 ORGANIZATIONAL PROCESS ASSETS

5.4.2.1 EXPERT JUDGMENT

  Described in Section 4.1.2.1. Expertise should be considered from individuals or groups with knowledge of or
experience with similar projects.

5.4.2.2 DECOMPOSITION

   Decomposition is a technique used for dividing and subdividing the project scope and project deliverables into
smaller, more manageable parts. The work package is the work defined at the lowest level of the WBS for which cost and
duration can be estimated and managed. The level of decomposition is often guided by the degree of control needed to
effectively manage the project. The level of detail for work packages will vary with the size and complexity of the project.
Decomposition of the total project work into work packages generally involves the following activities:
    Identifying and analyzing the deliverables and related work,
   uu

    Structuring and organizing the WBS,
   uu

    Decomposing the upper WBS levels into lower-level detailed components,
   uu

    Developing and assigning identification codes to the WBS components, and
   uu

    Verifying that the degree of decomposition of the deliverables is appropriate.
   uu

   A portion of a WBS with some branches of the WBS decomposed down through the work package level is shown in
Figure 5-12.

      A WBS structure may be created through various approaches. Some of the popular methods include the top-down
   approach, the use of organization-specific guidelines, and the use of WBS templates. A bottom-up approach can be used
   to group subcomponents. The WBS structure can be represented in a number of forms, such as:
       Using phases of the project life cycle as the second level of decomposition, with the product and project
      uu
         deliverables inserted at the third level, as shown in Figure 5-13;
       Using major deliverables as the second level of decomposition, as shown in Figure 5-14; and
      uu

       Incorporating subcomponents that may be developed by organizations outside the project team, such as
      uu
         contracted work. The seller then develops the supporting contract WBS as part of the contracted work.

                              The WBS is illustrative only. It is not intended to represent the full project scope of any specific project,

                                                  Figure 5-14. Sample WBS with Major Deliverables



   Decomposition of the upper-level WBS components requires subdividing the work for each of the deliverables or
subcomponents into its most fundamental components, where the WBS components represent verifiable products, services,
or results. If an agile approach is used, epics can be decomposed into user stories. The WBS may be structured as an
outline, an organizational chart, or other method that identifies a hierarchical breakdown. Verifying the correctness of the
decomposition requires determining that the lower-level WBS components are those that are necessary and sufficient for
completion of the corresponding higher-level deliverables. Different deliverables can have different levels of decomposition.
To arrive at a work package, the work for some deliverables needs to be decomposed only to the next level, while others need
additional levels of decomposition. As the work is decomposed to greater levels of detail, the ability to plan, manage, and
control the work is enhanced. However, excessive decomposition can lead to nonproductive management effort, inefficient
use of resources, decreased efficiency in performing the work, and difficulty aggregating data over different levels of the WBS.
  Decomposition may not be possible for a deliverable or subcomponent that will be accomplished far into the future.
The project management team usually waits until the deliverable or subcomponent is agreed on, so the details of the
WBS can be developed. This technique is sometimes referred to as rolling wave planning.




                                                                                                                                                         Part 1 - Guide

      The WBS represents all product and project work, including the project management work. The total of the work at
   the lowest levels should roll up to the higher levels so that nothing is left out and no extra work is performed. This is
   sometimes called the 100 percent rule.
      For specific information regarding the WBS, refer to the Practice Standard for Work Breakdown Structures - Second
   Edition [15]. This standard contains industry-specific examples of WBS templates that can be tailored to specific projects
   in a particular application area.



   5.4.3 CREATE WBS: OUTPUTS

   5.4.3.1 SCOPE BASELINE

      The scope baseline is the approved version of a scope statement, WBS, and its associated WBS dictionary, which can
   be changed only through formal change control procedures and is used as a basis for comparison. It is a component of
   the project management plan. Components of the scope baseline include:
       Project scope statement. The project scope statement includes the description of the project scope, major
      uu
          deliverables, assumptions, and constraints (Section 5.3.3.1).
       WBS. The WBS is a hierarchical decomposition of the total scope of work to be carried out by the project team
      uu
          to accomplish the project objectives and create the required deliverables. Each descending level of the WBS
          represents an increasingly detailed definition of the project work.
       Work package. The lowest level of the WBS is a work package with a unique identifier. These identifiers provide
      uu
          a structure for hierarchical summation of costs, schedule, and resource information and form a code of accounts.
          Each work package is part of a control account. A control account is a management control point where scope,
          budget, and schedule are integrated and compared to the earned value for performance measurement. A control
          account has two or more work packages, though each work package is associated with a single control account.
       Planning package. A control account may include one or more planning packages. A planning package is a
      uu
          work breakdown structure component below the control account and above the work package with known work
          content but without detailed schedule activities.

   WBS dictionary. The WBS dictionary is a document that provides detailed deliverable, activity, and scheduling
  uu
      information about each component in the WBS. The WBS dictionary is a document that supports the WBS. Most
      of the information included in the WBS dictionary is created by other processes and added to this document at a
      later stage. Information in the WBS dictionary may include but is not limited to:
      nuCode of account identifier,
      nuDescription of work,
      nuAssumptions and constraints,
      nuResponsible organization,
      nuSchedule milestones,
      nuAssociated schedule activities,
      nuResources required,
      nuCost estimates,
      nuQuality requirements,
      nuAcceptance criteria,
      nuTechnical references, and
      nuAgreement information.


5.4.3.2 PROJECT DOCUMENTS UPDATES

  Project documents that may be updated as a result of carrying out this process include but are not limited to:
      nuAssumption     log. Described in Section 4.1.3.2. The assumption log is updated with additional assumptions
         or constraints that were identified during the Create WBS process.
      nuRequirements documentation. Described in Section 5.2.3.1. Requirements documentation may be updated
         to include approved changes resulting from the Create WBS process.

   5.5 VALIDATE SCOPE
      Validate Scope is the process of formalizing acceptance of the completed project deliverables. The key benefit of this
   process is that it brings objectivity to the acceptance process and increases the probability of final product, service,
   or result acceptance by validating each deliverable. This process is performed periodically throughout the project as
   needed. The inputs, tools and techniques, and outputs of this process are depicted in Figure 5-15. Figure 5-16 depicts
   the data flow diagram of the process.

   The verified deliverables obtained from the Control Quality process are reviewed with the customer or sponsor to
ensure they are completed satisfactorily and have received formal acceptance of the deliverables by the customer or
sponsor. In this process, the outputs obtained as a result of the Planning processes in the Project Scope Management
Knowledge Area, such as the requirements documentation or the scope baseline, as well as the work performance data
obtained from the Execution processes in other Knowledge Areas, are the basis for performing the validation and for
final acceptance.
   The Validate Scope process differs from the Control Quality process in that the former is primarily concerned with
acceptance of the deliverables, while the latter is primarily concerned with correctness of the deliverables and meeting
the quality requirements specified for the deliverables. Control Quality is generally performed before Validate Scope,
although the two processes may be performed in parallel.

   5.5.1 VALIDATE SCOPE: INPUTS

   5.5.1.1 PROJECT MANAGEMENT PLAN

     Described in Section 4.2.3.1. Project management plan components include but are not limited to:
       Scope management plan. Described in Section 5.1.3.1. The project management plan specifies how formal
      uu
         acceptance of the completed project deliverables will be obtained.
       Requirements management plan. Described in Section 5.1.3.2. The requirements management plan describes
      uu
         how the project requirements are validated.
       Scope baseline. Described in Section 5.4.3.1. The scope baseline is compared to actual results to determine if
      uu
         a change, corrective action, or preventive action is necessary.

   5.5.1.2 PROJECT DOCUMENTS

     Project documents that can be considered as inputs for this process include but are not limited to:
       Lessons learned register: Described in Section 4.4.3.1. Lessons learned earlier in the project can be applied to
      uu
         later phases in the project to improve the efficiency and effectiveness of validating deliverables.
       Quality reports. Described in Section 8.2.3.1. The information presented in the quality report may include
      uu
         all quality assurance issues managed or escalated by the team, recommendations for improvement, and the
         summary of findings from the Control Quality process. This information is reviewed prior to product acceptance.
       Requirements documentation. Described in Section 5.2.3.1. Requirements are compared to the actual results
      uu
         to determine if a change, corrective action, or preventive action is necessary.
       Requirements traceability matrix. Described in Section 5.2.3.2. The requirements traceability matrix contains
      uu
         information about requirements, including how they will be validated.

   5.5.1.3 VERIFIED DELIVERABLES

     Verified deliverables are project deliverables that are completed and checked for correctness through the Control
   Quality process.






   5.5.1.4 WORK PERFORMANCE DATA

      Described in Section 4.3.3.2. Work performance data can include the degree of compliance with requirements, number
   of nonconformities, severity of the nonconformities, or the number of validation cycles performed in a period of time.




                                                                                                                     165
5.5.2 VALIDATE SCOPE: TOOLS AND TECHNIQUES

5.5.2.1 INSPECTION

  Described in Section 8.3.2.3. Inspection includes activities such as measuring, examining, and validating to
determine whether work and deliverables meet requirements and product acceptance criteria. Inspections are
sometimes called reviews, product reviews, and walkthroughs. In some application areas, these different terms have
unique and specific meanings.

5.5.2.2 DECISION MAKING

  Described in Section 5.2.2.4. An example of decision making that may be used in this process includes but is
not limited to voting. Voting is used to reach a conclusion when the validation is performed by the project team
and other stakeholders.



5.5.3 VALIDATE SCOPE: OUTPUTS

5.5.3.1 ACCEPTED DELIVERABLES

   Deliverables that meet the acceptance criteria are formally signed off and approved by the customer or sponsor.
Formal documentation received from the customer or sponsor acknowledging formal stakeholder acceptance of the
project's deliverables is forwarded to the Close Project or Phase process (Section 4.7).

5.5.3.2 WORK PERFORMANCE INFORMATION

  Work performance information includes information about project progress, such as which deliverables have been
accepted and which have not been accepted and the reasons why. This information is documented as described in
Section 10.3.3.1 and communicated to stakeholders.

5.5.3.3 CHANGE REQUESTS

   The completed deliverables that have not been formally accepted are documented, along with the reasons for
non-acceptance of those deliverables. Those deliverables may require a change request for defect repair. The change
requests (described in Section 4.3.3.4) are processed for review and disposition through the Perform Integrated Change
Control process (Section 4.6).




                                                                                                       Part 1 - Guide
166
5.5.3.4 PROJECT DOCUMENTS UPDATES

  Project documents that may be updated as a result of carrying out this process include but are not limited to:
    Lessons learned register. Described in Section 4.4.3.1. The lessons learned register is updated with information
   uu
       on challenges encountered and how they could have been avoided as well as approaches that worked well for
       validating deliverables.
    Requirements documentation. Described in Section 5.2.3.1. The requirements documentation may be updated
   uu
       with the actual results of validation activity. Of particular interest is when the actual results are better than the
       requirement or where a requirement was waived.
    Requirements traceability matrix. Described in Section 5.2.3.2. The requirements traceability matrix is updated
   uu
       with the results of the validation, including the method used and the outcome.



5.6 CONTROL SCOPE
   Control Scope is the process of monitoring the status of the project and product scope and managing changes to
the scope baseline. The key benefit of this process is that the scope baseline is maintained throughout the project. This
process is performed throughout the project. The inputs, tools and techniques, and outputs of this process are depicted
in Figure 5-17. Figure 5-18 depicts the data flow diagram of the process.

   Controlling the project scope ensures all requested changes and recommended corrective or preventive actions
are processed through the Perform Integrated Change Control process (see Section 4.6). Control Scope is also used
to manage the actual changes when they occur and is integrated with the other control processes. The uncontrolled
expansion to product or project scope without adjustments to time, cost, and resources is referred to as scope creep.
Change is inevitable; therefore, some type of change control process is mandatory for every project.

   5.6.1.1 PROJECT MANAGEMENT PLAN

     Described in Section 4.2.3.1. Project management plan components include but are not limited to:
       Scope management plan. Described in Section 5.1.3.1. The scope management plan documents how the
      uu
         project and product scope will be controlled.
       Requirements management plan. Described in Section 5.1.3.2. The requirements management plan describes
      uu
         how the project requirements will be managed.
       Change management plan. Described in Section 4.2.3.1. The change management plan defines the process
      uu
         for managing change on the project.
       Configuration management plan. Described in Section 4.2.3.1. The configuration management plan defines
      uu
         those items that are configurable, those items that require formal change control, and the process for controlling
         changes to such items.
       Scope baseline. Described in Section 5.4.3.1. The scope baseline is compared to actual results to determine if
      uu
         a change, corrective action, or preventive action is necessary.
       Performance measurement baseline. Described in Section 4.2.3.1. When using earned value analysis, the
      uu
         performance measurement baseline is compared to actual results to determine if a change, corrective action, or
         preventive action is necessary.

   5.6.1.2 PROJECT DOCUMENTS

     Project documents that can be considered as inputs for this process include but are not limited to:
       Lessons learned register. Described in Section 4.4.3.1. Lessons learned earlier in the project can be applied to
      uu
         later phases in the project to improve scope control.
       Requirements documentation. Described in Section 5.2.3.1. Requirements documentation is used to detect
      uu
         any deviation in the agreed-upon scope for the project or product.
       Requirements traceability matrix. Described in Section 5.2.3.2. The requirements traceability matrix helps
      uu





         to detect the impact of any change or deviation from the scope baseline on the project objectives. It may also





         provide status of requirements being controlled.

   5.6.1.3 WORK PERFORMANCE DATA

      Work performance data can include the number of change requests received, the number of requests accepted, and
   the number of deliverables verified, validated, and completed.




                                                                                                                       169
5.6.1.4 ORGANIZATIONAL PROCESS ASSETS

  The organizational process assets that can influence the Control Scope process include but are not limited to:
    Existing formal and informal scope, control-related policies, procedures, guidelines; and
   uu

    Monitoring and reporting methods and templates to be used.
   uu



5.6.2 CONTROL SCOPE: TOOLS AND TECHNIQUES

5.6.2.1 DATA ANALYSIS

  Data analysis techniques that can be used in the Control Scope process include but are not limited to:
    Variance analysis. Described in Section 4.5.2.2. Variance analysis is used to compare the baseline to the actual
   uu
       results and determine if the variance is within the threshold amount or if corrective or preventive action is
       appropriate.
    Trend analysis. Described in Section 4.5.2.2. Trend analysis examines project performance over time to
   uu
       determine if performance is improving or deteriorating.
  Important aspects of project scope control include determining the cause and degree of variance relative to the scope
baseline (Section 5.4.3.1) and deciding whether corrective or preventive action is required.



5.6.3 CONTROL SCOPE: OUTPUTS

5.6.3.1 WORK PERFORMANCE INFORMATION

   Work performance information produced includes correlated and contextualized information on how the project
and product scope are performing compared to the scope baseline. It can include the categories of the changes
received, the identified scope variances and their causes, how they impact schedule or cost, and the forecast of the
future scope performance.

5.6.3.2 CHANGE REQUESTS

  Described in Section 4.3.3.4. Analysis of project performance may result in a change request to the scope and
schedule baselines or other components of the project management plan. Change requests are processed for review
and disposition through the Perform Integrated Change Control process (Section 4.6).




                                                                                                        Part 1 - Guide
170
   5.6.3.3 PROJECT MANAGEMENT PLAN UPDATES

      Any change to the project management plan goes through the organization's change control process via a change
   request. Components that may require a change request for the project management plan include but are not limited to:
       Scope management plan. Described in Section 5.1.3.1. The scope management plan may be updated to reflect
      uu
         a change in how the scope is managed.
       Scope baseline. Described in Section 5.4.3.1. Changes to the scope baseline are incorporated in response to
      uu
         approved changes in scope, scope statement, the WBS, or the WBS dictionary. In some cases, scope variances can
         be so severe that a revised scope baseline is needed to provide a realistic basis for performance measurement.
       Schedule baseline. Described in Section 6.5.3.1. Changes to the schedule baseline are incorporated in response
      uu
         to approved changes in scope, resources, or schedule estimates. In some cases, schedule variances can be so
         severe that a revised schedule baseline is needed to provide a realistic basis for performance measurement.
       Cost baseline. Described in Section 7.3.3.1. Changes to the cost baseline are incorporated in response to
      uu
         approved changes in scope, resources, or cost estimates. In some cases, cost variances can be so severe that a
         revised cost baseline is needed to provide a realistic basis for performance measurement.
       Performance measurement baseline. Described in Section 4.2.3.1. Changes to the performance measurement
      uu
         baseline are incorporated in response to approved changes in scope, schedule performance, or cost estimates.
         In some cases, the performance variances can be so severe that a change request is put forth to revise the
         performance measurement baseline to provide a realistic basis for performance measurement.

   5.6.3.4 PROJECT DOCUMENTS UPDATES

     Project documents that may be updated as a result of carrying out this process include but are not limited to:
       Lessons learned register. Described in Section 4.4.3.1. The lessons learned register can be updated with
      uu
         techniques that are efficient and effective in controlling scope, including causes of variances and corrective
         actions chosen.
       Requirements documentation. Described in Section 5.2.3.1. Requirements documentation may be updated
      uu
         with additional or changed requirements.
       Requirements traceability matrix. Described in Section 5.2.3.2. The requirements traceability matrix may be
      uu





         updated to reflect updates in requirement documentation.

     Project Schedule Management includes the processes required to manage the timely completion of the project.
   The Project Schedule Management processes are:
      6.1 Plan Schedule Management--The process of establishing the policies, procedures, and documentation for
   planning, developing, managing, executing, and controlling the project schedule.
      6.2 Define Activities--The process of identifying and documenting the specific actions to be performed to produce
   the project deliverables.
     6.3 Sequence Activities--The process of identifying and documenting relationships among the project activities.
      6.4 Estimate Activity Durations--The process of estimating the number of work periods needed to complete
   individual activities with the estimated resources.
     6.5 Develop Schedule--The process of analyzing activity sequences, durations, resource requirements, and
   schedule constraints to create the project schedule model for project execution and monitoring and controlling.
     6.6 Control Schedule--The process of monitoring the status of the project to update the project schedule and
   manage changes to the schedule baseline.
      Figure 6-1 provides an overview of the Project Schedule Management processes. The Project Schedule Management
   processes are presented as discrete processes with defined interfaces while, in practice, they overlap and interact in
   ways that cannot be completely detailed in the PMBOK(R) Guide.

   KEY CONCEPTS FOR PROJECT SCHEDULE MANAGEMENT

      Project scheduling provides a detailed plan that represents how and when the project will deliver the products,
   services, and results defined in the project scope and serves as a tool for communication, managing stakeholders'
   expectations, and as a basis for performance reporting.
      The project management team selects a scheduling method, such as critical path or an agile approach. Then, the
   project-specific data, such as the activities, planned dates, durations, resources, dependencies, and constraints, are
   entered into a scheduling tool to create a schedule model for the project. The result is a project schedule. Figure 6-2
   provides a scheduling overview that shows how the scheduling method, scheduling tool, and outputs from the Project
   Schedule Management processes interact to create a schedule model.
      For smaller projects, defining activities, sequencing activities, estimating activity durations, and developing the
   schedule model are so tightly linked that they are viewed as a single process that can be performed by a person
   over a relatively short period of time. These processes are presented here as distinct elements because the tools and
   techniques for each process are different. Some of these processes are presented more fully in the Practice Standard
   for Scheduling [2].
      When possible, the detailed project schedule should remain flexible throughout the project to adjust for knowledge
   gained, increased understanding of the risk, and value-added activities.

TRENDS AND EMERGING PRACTICES IN PROJECT SCHEDULE MANAGEMENT

   With high levels of uncertainty and unpredictability in a fast-paced, highly competitive global marketplace where
long term scope is difficult to define, it is becoming even more important to have a contextual framework for effective
adoption and tailoring of development practices to respond to the changing needs of the environment. Adaptive
planning defines a plan but acknowledges that once work starts, the priorities may change and the plan needs to
reflect this new knowledge.
  Some of the emerging practices for project scheduling methods include but are not limited to:
    Iterative scheduling with a backlog. This is a form of rolling wave planning based on adaptive life cycles,
   uu
       such as the agile approach for product development. The requirements are documented in user stories that are
       then prioritized and refined just prior to construction, and the product features are developed using time-boxed
       periods of work. This approach is often used to deliver incremental value to the customer or when multiple
       teams can concurrently develop a large number of features that have few interconnected dependencies. This
       scheduling method is appropriate for many projects as indicated by the widespread and growing use of adaptive
       life cycles for product development. The benefit of this approach is that it welcomes changes throughout the
       development life cycle.
    On-demand scheduling. This approach, typically used in a Kanban system, is based on the theory-of-
   uu
       constraints and pull-based scheduling concepts from lean manufacturing to limit a team's work in progress
       in order to balance demand against the team's delivery throughput. On-demand scheduling does not rely
       on a schedule that was developed previously for the development of the product or product increments,
       but rather pulls work from a backlog or intermediate queue of work to be done immediately as resources
       become available. On-demand scheduling is often used for projects that evolve the product incrementally in
       operational or sustainment environments, and where tasks may be made relatively similar in size and scope
       or can be bundled by size and scope.




                                                                                                                   177
TAILORING CONSIDERATIONS

   Because each project is unique, the project manager may need to tailor the way Project Schedule Management
processes are applied. Considerations for tailoring include but are not limited to:
    Life cycle approach. What is the most appropriate life cycle approach that allows for a more detailed schedule?
   uu

    Resource availability. What are the factors influencing durations (such as the correlation between available
   uu
       resources and their productivity)?
    Project dimensions. How will the presence of project complexity, technological uncertainty, product novelty,
   uu
       pace, or progress tracking (such as earned value, percentage complete, red-yellow-green (stop light) indicators)
       impact the desired level of control?
    Technology support. Is technology used to develop, record, transmit, receive, and store project schedule model
   uu
       information and is it readily accessible?
  For more specific information regarding scheduling, refer to the Practice Standard for Scheduling [16].

CONSIDERATIONS FOR AGILE/ADAPTIVE ENVIRONMENTS

   Adaptive approaches use short cycles to undertake work, review the results, and adapt as necessary. These
cycles provide rapid feedback on the approaches and suitability of deliverables, and generally manifest as iterative
scheduling and on-demand, pull-based scheduling, as discussed in the section on Key Trends and Emerging Practices
in Project Schedule Management.
    In large organizations, there may be a mixture of small projects and large initiatives requiring long-term roadmaps
to manage the development of these programs using scaling factors (e.g., team size, geographical distribution,
regulatory compliance, organizational complexity, and technical complexity). To address the full delivery life cycle for
larger, enterprise-wide systems, a range of techniques utilizing a predictive approach, adaptive approach, or a hybrid
of both, may need to be adopted. The organization may need to combine practices from several core methods, or
adopt a method that has already done so, and adopt a few principles and practices of more traditional techniques.
   The role of the project manager does not change based on managing projects using a predictive development life
cycle or managing projects in adaptive environments. However, to be successful in using adaptive approaches, the
project manager will need to be familiar with the tools and techniques to understand how to apply them effectively.

   6.1 PLAN SCHEDULE MANAGEMENT
      Plan Schedule Management is the process of establishing the policies, procedures, and documentation for
   planning, developing, managing, executing, and controlling the project schedule. The key benefit of this process is
   that it provides guidance and direction on how the project schedule will be managed throughout the project. This
   process is performed once or at predefined points in the project. The inputs, tools and techniques, and outputs of the
   process are depicted in Figure 6-3. Figure 6-4 depicts the data flow diagram for the process.

      A data analysis technique that can be used for this process includes but is not limited to alternatives analysis.
   Alternatives analysis can include determining which schedule methodology to use, or how to combine various
   methods on the project. It can also include determining how detailed the schedule needs to be, the duration of
   waves for rolling wave planning, and how often it should be reviewed and updated. An appropriate balance between
   the level of detail needed to manage the schedule and the amount of time it takes to keep it up to date needs to be
   reached for each project.

   6.1.2.3 MEETINGS

      Project teams may hold planning meetings to develop the schedule management plan. Participants at these meetings
   may include the project manager, the project sponsor, selected project team members, selected stakeholders, anyone
   with responsibility for schedule planning or execution, and others as needed.



   6.1.3 PLAN SCHEDULE MANAGEMENT: OUTPUTS

   6.1.3.1 SCHEDULE MANAGEMENT PLAN





      The schedule management plan is a component of the project management plan that establishes the criteria





   and the activities for developing, monitoring, and controlling the schedule. The schedule management plan may be
   formal or informal, highly detailed, or broadly framed based on the needs of the project, and includes appropriate
   control thresholds.




                                                                                                                   181
  The schedule management plan can establish the following:
   Project schedule model development. The scheduling methodology and the scheduling tool to be used in the
  uu
      development of the project schedule model are specified.
   Release and iteration length. When using an adaptive life cycle, the time-boxed periods for releases, waves,
  uu
      and iterations are specified. Time-boxed periods are durations during which the team works steadily toward
      completion of a goal. Time-boxing helps to minimize scope creep as it forces the teams to process essential
      features first, then other features when time permits.
   Level of accuracy. The level of accuracy specifies the acceptable range used in determining realistic activity
  uu
      duration estimates and may include an amount for contingencies.
   Units of measure. Each unit of measurement (such as staff hours, staff days, or weeks for time measures, or
  uu
      meters, liters, tons, kilometers, or cubic yards for quantity measures) is defined for each of the resources.
   Organizational procedures links. The work breakdown structure (WBS) (Section 5.4) provides the framework
  uu
      for the schedule management plan, allowing for consistency with the estimates and resulting schedules.
   Project schedule model maintenance. The process used to update the status and record progress of the
  uu
      project in the schedule model during the execution of the project is defined.
   Control thresholds. Variance thresholds for monitoring schedule performance may be specified to indicate an
  uu
      agreed-upon amount of variation to be allowed before some action needs to be taken. Thresholds are typically
      expressed as percentage deviations from the parameters established in the baseline plan.
   Rules of performance measurement. Earned value management (EVM) rules or other physical measurement
  uu
      rules of performance measurement are set. For example, the schedule management plan may specify:
      nuRules for establishing percent complete,
      nuEVM   techniques (e.g., baselines, fixed-formula, percent complete, etc.) to be employed (for more specific
         information, refer to the Practice Standard for Earned Value Management [17]), and
      nuSchedule performance measurements such as schedule variance (SV) and schedule performance index (SPI)
         used to assess the magnitude of variation to the original schedule baseline.
   Reporting formats. The formats and frequency for the various schedule reports are defined.
  uu




                                                                                                          Part 1 - Guide

   6.2 DEFINE ACTIVITIES
      Define Activities is the process of identifying and documenting the specific actions to be performed to produce
   the project deliverables. The key benefit of this process is that it decomposes work packages into schedule activities
   that provide a basis for estimating, scheduling, executing, monitoring, and controlling the project work. This process
   is performed throughout the project. The inputs, tools and techniques, and outputs of this process are depicted in
   Figure 6-5. Figure 6-6 depicts the data flow diagram of the process.

6.2.1 DEFINE ACTIVITIES: INPUTS

6.2.1.1 PROJECT MANAGEMENT PLAN

  Described in Section 4.2.3.1. Project management plan components include but are not limited to:
    Schedule management plan. Described in Section 6.1.3.1. The schedule management plan defines the
   uu
      schedule methodology, the duration of waves for rolling wave planning, and the level of detail necessary to
      manage the work.
    Scope baseline. Described in Section 5.4.3.1. The project WBS, deliverables, constraints, and assumptions
   uu
      documented in the scope baseline are considered explicitly while defining activities.

6.2.1.2 ENTERPRISE ENVIRONMENTAL FACTORS

  Enterprise environmental factors that influence the Define Activities process include but are not limited to:
    Organizational cultures and structure,
   uu

    Published commercial information from commercial databases, and
   uu

    Project management information system (PMIS).
   uu


6.2.1.3 ORGANIZATIONAL PROCESS ASSETS

  The organizational process assets that can influence the Define Activities process include but are not limited to:
    Lessons learned repository containing historical information regarding activity lists used by previous similar projects,
   uu

    Standardized processes,
   uu

    Templates that contain a standard activity list or a portion of an activity list from a previous project, and
   uu

    Existing formal and informal activity planning-related policies, procedures, and guidelines, such as the scheduling
   uu
      methodology, that are considered in developing the activity definitions.


6.2.2 DEFINE ACTIVITIES: TOOLS AND TECHNIQUES

6.2.2.1 EXPERT JUDGMENT

   Described in Section 4.1.2.1. Expertise should be considered from individuals or groups with specialized knowledge
of similar past projects and the work being performed.




                                                                                                            Part 1 - Guide
184
6.2.2.2 DECOMPOSITION

   Described in Section 5.4.2.2. Decomposition is a technique used for dividing and subdividing the project scope and
project deliverables into smaller, more manageable parts. Activities represent the effort needed to complete a work
package. The Define Activities process defines the final outputs as activities rather than deliverables, as done in the
Create WBS process (Section 5.4).
   The activity list, WBS, and WBS dictionary can be developed either sequentially or concurrently, with the WBS and WBS
dictionary used as the basis for development of the final activity list. Each work package within the WBS is decomposed
into the activities required to produce the work package deliverables. Involving team members in the decomposition can
lead to better and more accurate results.

6.2.2.3 ROLLING WAVE PLANNING

   Rolling wave planning is an iterative planning technique in which the work to be accomplished in the near term is
planned in detail, while work further in the future is planned at a higher level. It is a form of progressive elaboration
applicable to work packages, planning packages, and release planning when using an agile or waterfall approach.
Therefore, work can exist at various levels of detail depending on where it is in the project life cycle. During early
strategic planning when information is less defined, work packages may be decomposed to the known level of detail. As
more is known about the upcoming events in the near term, work packages can be decomposed into activities.

6.2.2.4 MEETINGS

  Meetings may be face-to-face, virtual, formal, or informal. Meetings may be held with team members or subject
matter experts to define the activities needed to complete the work.



6.2.3 DEFINE ACTIVITIES: OUTPUTS

6.2.3.1 ACTIVITY LIST

   The activity list includes the schedule activities required on the project. For projects that use rolling wave planning
or agile techniques, the activity list will be updated periodically as the project progresses. The activity list includes
an activity identifier and a scope of work description for each activity in sufficient detail to ensure that project team
members understand what work is required to be completed.




                                                                                                                      185
6.2.3.2 ACTIVITY ATTRIBUTES

   Activity attributes extend the description of the activity by identifying multiple components associated with each
activity. The components for each activity evolve over time. During the initial stages of the project, they include
the unique activity identifier (ID), WBS ID, and activity label or name. When completed, they may include activity
descriptions, predecessor activities, successor activities, logical relationships, leads and lags (Section 6.3.2.3),
resource requirements, imposed dates, constraints, and assumptions. Activity attributes can be used to identify the
place where the work has to be performed, the project calendar the activity is assigned to, and the type of effort
involved. Activity attributes are used for schedule development and for selecting, ordering, and sorting the planned
schedule activities in various ways within reports

6.2.3.3 MILESTONE LIST

   A milestone is a significant point or event in a project. A milestone list identifies all project milestones and indicates
whether the milestone is mandatory, such as those required by contract, or optional, such as those based on historical
information. Milestones have zero duration because they represent a significant point or event.

6.2.3.4 CHANGE REQUESTS

   Described in Section 4.3.3.4. Once the project has been baselined, the progressive elaboration of deliverables into
activities may reveal work that was not initially part of the project baselines. This may result in a change request.
Change requests are processed for review and disposition through the Perform Integrated Change Control process
(Section 4.6).

6.2.3.5 PROJECT MANAGEMENT PLAN UPDATES

   Any change to the project management plan goes through the organization's change control process via a change
request. Components that may require a change request for the project management plan include but are not limited to:
    Schedule baseline. Described in Section 6.5.3.1. Throughout the project, work packages are progressively
   uu
       elaborated into activities. This process may reveal work that was not part of the initial schedule baseline,
       necessitating a change to delivery dates or other significant schedule milestones that are part of the
       schedule baseline.
    Cost baseline. Described in Section 7.3.3.1. Changes to the cost baseline are incorporated in response to
   uu
       approved changes in schedule activities.




                                                                                                             Part 1 - Guide

   6.3 SEQUENCE ACTIVITIES
      Sequence Activities is the process of identifying and documenting relationships among the project activities. The key
   benefit of this process is that it defines the logical sequence of work to obtain the greatest efficiency given all project
   constraints. This process is performed throughout the project. The inputs, tools and techniques, and outputs of this
   process are depicted in Figure 6-7. Figure 6-8 depicts the data flow diagram of the process.

   Every activity except the first and last should be connected to at least one predecessor and at least one successor
activity with an appropriate logical relationship. Logical relationships should be designed to create a realistic project
schedule. It may be necessary to use lead or lag time between activities to support a realistic and achievable project
schedule. Sequencing can be performed by using project management software or by using manual or automated
techniques. The Sequence Activities process concentrates on converting the project activities from a list to a diagram to
act as a first step to publish the schedule baseline.



6.3.1 SEQUENCE ACTIVITIES: INPUTS

6.3.1.1 PROJECT MANAGEMENT PLAN

  Described in Section 4.2.3.1. Project management plan components include but are not limited to:
    Schedule management plan. Described in Section 6.1.3.1. The schedule management plan defines the method
   uu
       used and the level of accuracy along with other criteria required to sequence activities.
    Scope baseline. Described in Section 5.4.3.1. The project WBS, deliverables, constraints, and assumptions
   uu
       documented in the scope baseline are considered explicitly while sequencing activities.

6.3.1.2 PROJECT DOCUMENTS

  Project documents that can be considered as inputs for this process include but are not limited to:
    Activity attributes. Described in Section 6.2.3.2. Activity attributes may describe a necessary sequence of
   uu
       events or defined predecessor or successor relationships, as well as defined lead and lag and logical relationships
       between the activities.
    Activity list. Described in Section 6.2.3.1. The activity list contains all schedule activities required on the project
   uu
       that are to be sequenced. Dependencies and other constraints for these activities can influence the sequencing
       of the activities.
    Assumption log. Described in Section 4.1.3.2. Assumptions and constraints recorded in the assumption log may
   uu
       influence the way activities are sequenced, the relationship between activities, and the need for leads and lags,
       and may give rise to individual project risks that may impact the project schedule.
    Milestone list. Described in Section 6.2.3.3. The milestone list may have scheduled dates for specific milestones,
   uu
       which may influence the way activities are sequenced.

    Existing formal and informal activity planning-related policies, procedures, and guidelines, such as the scheduling
   uu
       methodology that is considered in developing logical relationships;
    Templates that can be used to expedite the preparation of networks for project activities. Related activity attributes
   uu
       information in templates can also contain additional descriptive information useful in sequencing activities; and
    Lessons learned repository containing historical information that can help optimize the sequencing process.
   uu



6.3.2 SEQUENCE ACTIVITIES: TOOLS AND TECHNIQUES

6.3.2.1 PRECEDENCE DIAGRAMMING METHOD

   The precedence diagramming method (PDM) is a technique used for constructing a schedule model in which activities
are represented by nodes and are graphically linked by one or more logical relationships to show the sequence in which
the activities are to be performed.
  PDM includes four types of dependencies or logical relationships. A predecessor activity is an activity that logically
comes before a dependent activity in a schedule. A successor activity is a dependent activity that logically comes after
another activity in a schedule. These relationships are defined below and are illustrated in Figure 6-9:




                                                                                                                      189
    Finish-to-start (FS). A logical relationship in which a successor activity cannot start until a predecessor activity
   uu
      has finished. For example, installing the operating system on a PC (successor) cannot start until the PC hardware
      is assembled (predecessor).
    Finish-to-finish (FF). A logical relationship in which a successor activity cannot finish until a predecessor activity
   uu
      has finished. For example, writing a document (predecessor) is required to finish before editing the document
      (successor) can finish.
    Start-to-start (SS). A logical relationship in which a successor activity cannot start until a predecessor activity
   uu
      has started. For example, level concrete (successor) cannot begin until pour foundation (predecessor) begins.
    Start-to-finish (SF). A logical relationship in which a successor activity cannot finish until a predecessor activity
   uu
      has started. For example, a new accounts payable system (successor) has to start before the old accounts
      payable system can be shut down (predecessor).
    In PDM, FS is the most commonly used type of precedence relationship. The SF relationship is very rarely used, but
is included to present a complete list of the PDM relationship types.
   Two activities can have two logical relationships at the same time (for example, SS and FF). Multiple relationships
between the same activities are not recommended, so a decision has to be made to select the relationship with the
highest impact. Closed loops are also not recommended in logical relationships.

6.3.2.2 DEPENDENCY DETERMINATION AND INTEGRATION

   Dependencies may be characterized by the following attributes: mandatory or discretionary, internal or external
(as described below). Dependency has four attributes, but two can be applicable at the same time in the following
ways: mandatory external dependencies, mandatory internal dependencies, discretionary external dependencies, or
discretionary internal dependencies.
    Mandatory dependencies. Mandatory dependencies are those that are legally or contractually required or
   uu
      inherent in the nature of the work. Mandatory dependencies often involve physical limitations, such as on a
      construction project, where it is impossible to erect the superstructure until after the foundation has been built,
      or on an electronics project, where a prototype has to be built before it can be tested. Mandatory dependencies
      are sometimes referred to as hard logic or hard dependencies. Technical dependencies may not be mandatory.
      The project team determines which dependencies are mandatory during the process of sequencing the activities.
      Mandatory dependencies should not be confused with assigning schedule constraints in the scheduling tool.
    Discretionary dependencies. Discretionary dependencies are sometimes referred to as preferred logic,
   uu
      preferential logic, or soft logic. Discretionary dependencies are established based on knowledge of best
      practices within a particular application area or some unusual aspect of the project where a specific sequence
      is desired, even though there may be other acceptable sequences. For example, generally accepted best
      practices recommend that during construction, the electrical work should start after finishing the plumbing
      work. This order is not mandatory and both activities may occur at the same time (in parallel), but performing
      the activities in sequential order reduces the overall project risk. Discretionary dependencies should be fully
      documented since they can create arbitrary total float values and can limit later scheduling options. When fast
      tracking techniques are employed, these discretionary dependencies should be reviewed and considered for
      modification or removal. The project team determines which dependencies are discretionary during the process
      of sequencing the activities.




                                                                                                                    191
    External dependencies. External dependencies involve a relationship between project activities and non-
   uu
       project activities. These dependencies are usually outside of the project team's control. For example, the
       testing activity in a software project may be dependent on the delivery of hardware from an external source, or
       governmental environmental hearings may need to be held before site preparation can begin on a construction
       project. The project management team determines which dependencies are external during the process of
       sequencing the activities.
    Internal dependencies. Internal dependencies involve a precedence relationship between project activities and
   uu
       are generally inside the project team's control. For example, if the team cannot test a machine until they assemble
       it, there is an internal mandatory dependency. The project management team determines which dependencies
       are internal during the process of sequencing the activities.

6.3.2.3 LEADS AND LAGS

   A lead is the amount of time a successor activity can be advanced with respect to a predecessor activity. For example,
on a project to construct a new office building, the landscaping could be scheduled to start 2 weeks prior to the scheduled
punch list completion. This would be shown as a finish-to-start with a 2-week lead as shown in Figure 6-10. Lead is often
represented as a negative value for lag in scheduling software.

                                            Figure 6-10. Examples of Lead and Lag




                                                                                                            Part 1 - Guide
192
      A lag is the amount of time a successor activity will be delayed with respect to a predecessor activity. For example,
   a technical writing team may begin editing the draft of a large document 15 days after they begin writing it. This can be
   shown as a start-to-start relationship with a 15-day lag as shown in Figure 6-10. Lag can also be represented in project
   schedule network diagrams as shown in Figure 6-11 in the relationship between activities H and I (as indicated by the
   nomenclature SS+10 (start-to-start plus 10 days lag) even though the offset is not shown relative to a timescale).
      The project management team determines the dependencies that may require a lead or a lag to accurately define the
   logical relationship. The use of leads and lags should not replace schedule logic. Also, duration estimates do not include
   any leads or lags. Activities and their related assumptions should be documented.

   6.3.2.4 PROJECT MANAGEMENT INFORMATION SYSTEM (PMIS)





      Described in Section 4.3.2.2. Project management information systems includes scheduling software that has the
   capability to help plan, organize, and adjust the sequence of the activities; insert the logical relationships, lead and lag
   values; and differentiate the different types of dependencies.




                                                                                                                           193
6.3.3 SEQUENCE ACTIVITIES: OUTPUTS

6.3.3.1 PROJECT SCHEDULE NETWORK DIAGRAMS

   A project schedule network diagram is a graphical representation of the logical relationships, also referred to as
dependencies, among the project schedule activities. Figure 6-11 illustrates a project schedule network diagram. A
project schedule network diagram is produced manually or by using project management software. It can include full
project details, or have one or more summary activities. A summary narrative can accompany the diagram and describe
the basic approach used to sequence the activities. Any unusual activity sequences within the network should be fully
described within the narrative.
   Activities that have multiple predecessor activities indicate a path convergence. Activities that have multiple successor
activities indicate a path divergence. Activities with divergence and convergence are at greater risk as they are affected
by multiple activities or can affect multiple activities. Activity I is called a path convergence, as it has more than one
predecessor, while activity K is called a path divergence, as it has more than one successor.

6.3.3.2 PROJECT DOCUMENTS UPDATES

  Project documents that may be updated as a result of carrying out this process include but are not limited to:
    Activity attributes. Described in Section 6.2.3.2. Activity attributes may describe a necessary sequence of
   uu
       events or defined predecessor or successor relationships, as well as defined lead and lag and logical relationships
       between the activities.
    Activity list. Described in Section 6.2.3.1. The activity list may be impacted by the change in relationships
   uu
       among the project activities during the sequencing activities.
    Assumption log. Described in Section 4.1.3.2. Assumptions and constraints recorded in the assumption log may
   uu
       need to be updated based on the sequencing, relationship determination, and leads and lags, and may give rise
       to individual project risks that may impact the project schedule.
    Milestone list. Described in Section 6.2.3.3. The scheduled dates for specific milestones may be impacted by
   uu
       changes in relationships among the project activities during the sequencing activities.

   6.4 ESTIMATE ACTIVITY DURATIONS
      Estimate Activity Durations is the process of estimating the number of work periods needed to complete individual
   activities with estimated resources. The key benefit of this process is that it provides the amount of time each activity
   will take to complete. This process is performed throughout the project. The inputs, tools and techniques, and outputs of
   this process are depicted in Figure 6-12. Figure 6-13 depicts the data flow diagram of the process.

   Estimating activity durations uses information from the scope of work, required resource types or skill levels,
estimated resource quantities, and resource calendars. Other factors that may influence the duration estimates include
constraints imposed on the duration, effort involved, or type of resources (e.g., fixed duration, fixed effort or work, fixed
number of resources), as well as the schedule network analysis technique used. The inputs for the estimates of duration
originate from the person or group on the project team who is most familiar with the nature of the work in the specific
activity. The duration estimate is progressively elaborated, and the process considers the quality and availability of the
input data. For example, as more detailed and precise data are available about the project engineering and design work,
the accuracy and quality of the duration estimates improve.




                                                                                                                                       Part 1 - Guide
196
   The Estimate Activity Durations process requires an estimation of the amount of work effort required to complete
the activity and the amount of available resources estimated to complete the activity. These estimates are used to
approximate the number of work periods (activity duration) needed to complete the activity using the appropriate project
and resource calendars. In many cases, the number of resources that are expected to be available to accomplish an
activity, along with the skill proficiency of those resources, may determine the activity's duration. A change to a driving
resource allocated to the activity will usually have an effect on the duration, but this is not a simple "straight-line" or
linear relationship. Sometimes, the intrinsic nature of the work (i.e., constraints imposed on the duration, effort involved,
or number of resources) will take a predetermined amount of time to complete regardless of the resource allocation
(e.g., a 24-hour stress test). Other factors for consideration when estimating duration include:
    Law of diminishing returns. When one factor (e.g., resource) used to determine the effort required to produce a
   uu
       unit of work is increased while all other factors remain fixed, a point will eventually be reached at which additions
       of that one factor start to yield progressively smaller or diminishing increases in output.
    Number of resources. Increasing the number of resources to twice the original number of the resources does
   uu
       not always reduce the time by half, as it may increase extra duration due to risk, and at some point adding
       too many resources to the activity may increase duration due to knowledge transfer, learning curve, additional
       coordination, and other factors involved.
    Advances in technology. This may also play an important role in determining duration estimates. For example, an
   uu
       increase in the output of a manufacturing plant may be achieved by procuring the latest advances in technology,
       which may impact duration and resource needs.
    Motivation of staff. The project manager also needs to be aware of Student Syndrome--or procrastination--
   uu
       when people start to apply themselves only at the last possible moment before the deadline, and Parkinson's Law
       where work expands to fill the time available for its completion.
  All data and assumptions that support duration estimating are documented for each activity duration estimate.

      of effort and duration estimates.
   Milestone list. Described in Section 6.2.3.3. The milestone list may have scheduled dates for specific milestones
  uu
      that may impact the duration estimates.
   Project team assignments. Described in Section 9.3.3.1. The project is staffed when the appropriate people
  uu
      have been assigned to the team.
   Resource breakdown structure. Described in Section 9.2.3.3. The resource breakdown structure provides a
  uu
      hierarchical structure of the identified resources by resource category and resource type.

    Resource calendars. Described in Section 9.2.1.2. The resource calendars influence the duration of schedule
   uu
      activities due to the availability of specific resources, type of resources, and resources with specific attributes.
      Resource calendars specify when and how long identified project resources will be available during the project.
    Resource requirements. Described in Section 9.2.3.1. The estimated activity resource requirements will have
   uu
      an effect on the duration of the activity, since the level to which the resources assigned to the activity meet
      the requirements will significantly influence the duration of most activities. For example, if additional or lower-
      skilled resources are assigned to an activity, there may be reduced efficiency or productivity due to increased
      communication, training, and coordination needs leading to a longer duration estimate.
    Risk register. Described in Section 11.2.3.1. Individual project risks may impact resource selection and
   uu
      availability. Updates to the risk register are included with project documents updates, described in Section

6.4.2 ESTIMATE ACTIVITY DURATIONS: TOOLS AND TECHNIQUES

6.4.2.1 EXPERT JUDGMENT

   Described in Section 4.1.2.1. Expertise should be considered from individuals or groups with specialized knowledge
or training in the following topics:
    Schedule development, management, and control;
   uu

    Expertise in estimating; and
   uu

    Discipline or application knowledge.
   uu


6.4.2.2 ANALOGOUS ESTIMATING

   Analogous estimating is a technique for estimating the duration or cost of an activity or a project using historical
data from a similar activity or project. Analogous estimating uses parameters from a previous, similar project, such as
duration, budget, size, weight, and complexity, as the basis for estimating the same parameter or measure for a future
project. When estimating durations, this technique relies on the actual duration of previous, similar projects as the basis
for estimating the duration of the current project. It is a gross value estimating approach, sometimes adjusted for known
differences in project complexity. Analogous duration estimating is frequently used to estimate project duration when
there is a limited amount of detailed information about the project.
   Analogous estimating is generally less costly and less time-consuming than other techniques, but it is also
less accurate. Analogous duration estimates can be applied to a total project or to segments of a project and may
be used in conjunction with other estimating methods. Analogous estimating is most reliable when the previous
activities are similar in fact and not just in appearance, and the project team members preparing the estimates
have the needed expertise.

6.4.2.3 PARAMETRIC ESTIMATING

  Parametric estimating is an estimating technique in which an algorithm is used to calculate cost or duration based
on historical data and project parameters. Parametric estimating uses a statistical relationship between historical data
and other variables (e.g., square footage in construction) to calculate an estimate for activity parameters, such as cost,
budget, and duration.




                                                                                                            Part 1 - Guide
200
   Durations can be quantitatively determined by multiplying the quantity of work to be performed by the number of labor
hours per unit of work. For example, duration on a design project is estimated by the number of drawings multiplied by
the number of labor hours per drawing, or on a cable installation, the meters of cable multiplied by the number of labor
hours per meter. If the assigned resource is capable of installing 25 meters of cable per hour, the duration required to
install 1,000 meters is 40 hours (1,000 meters divided by 25 meters per hour).
   This technique can produce higher levels of accuracy depending on the sophistication and underlying data built into
the model. Parametric schedule estimates can be applied to a total project or to segments of a project, in conjunction
with other estimating methods.

6.4.2.4 THREE-POINT ESTIMATING

   The accuracy of single-point duration estimates may be improved by considering estimation uncertainty and risk.
Using three-point estimates helps define an approximate range for an activity's duration:
    Most likely (tM). This estimate is based on the duration of the activity, given the resources likely to be assigned,
   uu
       their productivity, realistic expectations of availability for the activity, dependencies on other participants, and
       interruptions.
    Optimistic (tO). The activity duration based on analysis of the best-case scenario for the activity.
   uu

    Pessimistic (tP). The duration based on analysis of the worst-case scenario for the activity.
   uu

  Depending on the assumed distribution of values within the range of the three estimates, the expected duration, tE,
can be calculated. One commonly used formula is triangular distribution:
  tE = (tO + tM + tP) / 3.
   Triangular distribution is used when there is insufficient historical data or when using judgmental data. Duration
estimates based on three points with an assumed distribution provide an expected duration and clarify the range of
uncertainty around the expected duration.




                                                                                                                       201
6.4.2.5 BOTTOM-UP ESTIMATING

   Bottom-up estimating is a method of estimating project duration or cost by aggregating the estimates of the lower-
level components of the WBS. When an activity's duration cannot be estimated with a reasonable degree of confidence,
the work within the activity is decomposed into more detail. The detail durations are estimated. These estimates are
then aggregated into a total quantity for each of the activity's durations. Activities may or may not have dependencies
between them that can affect the application and use of resources. If there are dependencies, this pattern of resource
usage is reflected and documented in the estimated requirements of the activity.

6.4.2.6 DATA ANALYSIS

  Data analysis techniques that can be used for this process include but are not limited to:
    Alternatives analysis. Alternatives analysis is used to compare various levels of resource capability or skills;
   uu
       scheduling compression techniques (described in Section 6.5.2.6); different tools (manual versus automated);
       and make, rent, or buy decisions regarding the resources. This allows the team to weigh resource, cost, and
       duration variables to determine an optimal approach for accomplishing project work.
    Reserve analysis. Reserve analysis is used to determine the amount of contingency and management reserve
   uu
       needed for the project. Duration estimates may include contingency reserves, sometimes referred to as schedule
       reserves, to account for schedule uncertainty. Contingency reserves are the estimated duration within the schedule
       baseline, which is allocated for identified risks that are accepted. Contingency reserves are associated with the
       known-unknowns, which may be estimated to account for this unknown amount of rework. The contingency
       reserve may be a percentage of the estimated activity duration or a fixed number of work periods. Contingency
       reserves may be separated from the individual activities and aggregated. As more precise information about the
       project becomes available, the contingency reserve may be used, reduced, or eliminated. Contingency should be
       clearly identified in the schedule documentation.
       Estimates may also be produced for the amount of management reserve of schedule for the project. Management
       reserves are a specified amount of the project budget withheld for management control purposes and are
       reserved for unforeseen work that is within scope of the project. Management reserves are intended to address
       the unknown-unknowns that can affect a project. Management reserve is not included in the schedule baseline,
       but it is part of the overall project duration requirements. Depending on contract terms, use of management
       reserves may require a change to the schedule baseline.




                                                                                                          Part 1 - Guide
202
6.4.2.7 DECISION MAKING

    Described in Section 5.2.2.4. Decision-making techniques that can be used in this process include but are not limited
to voting. One variation of the voting method that is often used in agile-based projects is called the fist of five (also called
fist to five). In this technique, the project manager asks the team to show their level of support for a decision by holding
up a closed fist (indicating no support) up to five fingers (indicating full support). If a team member holds up fewer than
three fingers, the team member is given the opportunity to discuss any objections with the team. The project manager
continues the fist-of-five process until the team achieves consensus (everyone holds up three or more fingers) or agrees
to move on to the next decision.

6.4.2.8 MEETINGS

   The project team may hold meetings to estimate activity durations. When using an agile approach, it is necessary
to conduct sprint or iteration planning meetings to discuss prioritized product backlog items (user stories) and decide
which of these items the team will commit to work on in the upcoming iteration. The team breaks down user stories to
low-level tasks, with estimates in hours, and then validates that the estimates are achievable based on team capacity
over the duration (iteration). This meeting is usually held on the first day of the iteration and is attended by the product
owner, the Scrum team, and the project manager. The outcome of the meeting includes an iteration backlog, as well as
assumptions, concerns, risks, dependencies, decisions, and actions.



6.4.3 ESTIMATE ACTIVITY DURATIONS: OUTPUTS

6.4.3.1 DURATION ESTIMATES

   Duration estimates are quantitative assessments of the likely number of time periods that are required to complete
an activity, a phase, or a project. Duration estimates do not include any lags as described in Section 6.3.2.3. Duration
estimates may include some indication of the range of possible results. For example:
    A range of 2 weeks  2 days, which indicates that the activity will take at least 8 days and not more than 12
   uu
       (assuming a 5-day work week); or
    A 15% probability of exceeding 3 weeks, which indicates a high probability--85%--that the activity will take
   uu
       3 weeks or less.




                                                                                                                           203
6.4.3.2 BASIS OF ESTIMATES

   The amount and type of additional details supporting the duration estimate vary by application area. Regardless of
the level of detail, the supporting documentation should provide a clear and complete understanding of how the duration
estimate was derived.
  Supporting detail for duration estimates may include:
    Documentation of the basis of the estimate (i.e., how it was developed),
   uu

    Documentation of all assumptions made,
   uu

    Documentation of any known constraints,
   uu

    Indication of the range of possible estimates (e.g., 10%) to indicate that the duration is estimated between a
   uu
       range of values),
    Indication of the confidence level of the final estimate, and
   uu

    Documentation of individual project risks influencing this estimate.

6.4.3.3 PROJECT DOCUMENTS UPDATES

  Project documents that may be updated as a result of carrying out this process include but are not limited to:
    Activity attributes. Described in Section 6.2.3.2. Activity duration estimates produced during this process are
   uu
       documented as part of the activity attributes.
    Assumption log. Described in Section 4.1.3.2. This includes assumptions made in developing the duration
   uu
       estimate, such as resource skill levels and availability, as well as a basis of estimates for durations. Additionally,
       constraints arising out of the scheduling methodology and scheduling tool are also documented.
    Lessons learned register. Described in Section 4.4.3.1. The lessons learned register can be updated with
   uu
       techniques that were efficient and effective in developing effort and duration estimates.

   6.5 DEVELOP SCHEDULE
      Develop Schedule is the process of analyzing activity sequences, durations, resource requirements, and schedule
   constraints to create a schedule model for project execution and monitoring and controlling. The key benefit of this
   process is that it generates a schedule model with planned dates for completing project activities. This process
   is performed throughout the project. The inputs, tools and techniques, and outputs of this process are depicted in
   Figure 6-14. Figure 6-15 depicts the data flow diagram of the process.

      Developing an acceptable project schedule is an iterative process. The schedule model is used to determine the
   planned start and finish dates for project activities and milestones based on the best available information. Schedule
   development can require the review and revision of duration estimates, resource estimates, and schedule reserves to
   establish an approved project schedule that can serve as a baseline to track progress. Key steps include defining the
   project milestones, identifying and sequencing activities, and estimating durations. Once the activity start and finish
   dates have been determined, it is common to have the project staff assigned to the activities review their assigned
   activities. The staff confirms that the start and finish dates present no conflict with resource calendars or assigned
   activities on other projects or tasks and thus are still valid. The schedule is then analyzed to determine conflicts with
   logical relationships and if resource leveling is required before the schedule is approved and baselined. Revising and
   maintaining the project schedule model to sustain a realistic schedule continues throughout the duration of the project,
   as described in Section 6.7.

6.5.2 DEVELOP SCHEDULE: TOOLS AND TECHNIQUES

6.5.2.1 SCHEDULE NETWORK ANALYSIS

   Schedule network analysis is the overarching technique used to generate the project schedule model. It employs
several other techniques such as critical path method (described in Section 6.5.2.2), resource optimization techniques
(described in Section 6.5.2.3), and modeling techniques (described in Section 6.5.2.4). Additional analysis includes but
is not limited to:
    Assessing the need to aggregate schedule reserves to reduce the probability of a schedule slip when multiple
   uu
       paths converge at a single point in time or when multiple paths diverge from a single point in time, to reduce the
       probability of a schedule slip.
    Reviewing the network to see if the critical path has high-risk activities or long lead items that would necessitate
   uu
       use of schedule reserves or the implementation of risk responses to reduce the risk on the critical path.
  Schedule network analysis is an iterative process that is employed until a viable schedule model is developed.




                                                                                                                     209
   6.5.2.2 CRITICAL PATH METHOD

      The critical path method is used to estimate the minimum project duration and determine the amount of schedule
   flexibility on the logical network paths within the schedule model. This schedule network analysis technique calculates
   the early start, early finish, late start, and late finish dates for all activities without regard for any resource limitations
   by performing a forward and backward pass analysis through the schedule network, as shown in Figure 6-16. In this
   example, the longest path includes activities A, C, and D, and therefore the sequence of A-C-D is the critical path.
   The critical path is the sequence of activities that represents the longest path through a project, which determines
   the shortest possible project duration. The longest path has the least total float--usually zero. The resulting early
   and late start and finish dates are not necessarily the project schedule; rather they indicate the time periods within
   which the activity could be executed, using the parameters entered in the schedule model for activity durations, logical
   relationships, leads, lags, and other known constraints. The critical path method is used to calculate the critical path(s)
   and the amount of total and free float or schedule flexibility on the logical network paths within the schedule model.
      On any network path, the total float or schedule flexibility is measured by the amount of time that a schedule
   activity can be delayed or extended from its early start date without delaying the project finish date or violating a
   schedule constraint. A critical path is normally characterized by zero total float on the critical path. As implemented
   with the precedence diagramming method sequencing, critical paths may have positive, zero, or negative total float
   depending on the constraints applied. Positive total float is caused when the backward pass is calculated from a
   schedule constraint that is later than the early finish date that has been calculated during forward pass calculation.
   Negative total float is caused when a constraint on the late dates is violated by duration and logic. Negative float
   analysis is a technique that helps to find possible accelerated ways of bringing a delayed schedule back on track.
   Schedule networks may have multiple near-critical paths. Many software packages allow the user to define the
   parameters used to determine the critical path(s). Adjustments to activity durations (when more resources or less
   scope can be arranged), logical relationships (when the relationships were discretionary to begin with), leads and
   lags, or other schedule constraints may be necessary to produce network paths with a zero or positive total float.
   Once the total float and the free float have been calculated, the free float is the amount of time that a schedule
   activity can be delayed without delaying the early start date of any successor or violating a schedule constraint. For
   example the free float for Activity B, in Figure 6-16, is 5 days.

   6.5.2.3 RESOURCE OPTIMIZATION

     Resource optimization is used to adjust the start and finish dates of activities to adjust planned resource use to be
   equal to or less than resource availability. Examples of resource optimization techniques that can be used to adjust the
   schedule model due to demand and supply of resources include but are not limited to:
       Resource leveling. A technique in which start and finish dates are adjusted based on resource constraints with
      uu
          the goal of balancing the demand for resources with the available supply. Resource leveling can be used when
          shared or critically required resources are available only at certain times or in limited quantities, or are over-
          allocated, such as when a resource has been assigned to two or more activities during the same time period (as
          shown in Figure 6-17), or there is a need to keep resource usage at a constant level. Resource leveling can often





          cause the original critical path to change. Available float is used for leveling resources. Consequently, the critical





          path through the project schedule may change.
       Resource smoothing. A technique that adjusts the activities of a schedule model such that the requirements for
      uu
          resources on the project do not exceed certain predefined resource limits. In resource smoothing, as opposed to
          resource leveling, the project's critical path is not changed and the completion date may not be delayed. In other
          words, activities may only be delayed within their free and total float. Resource smoothing may not be able to
          optimize all resources.

6.5.2.4 DATA ANALYSIS

  Data analysis techniques that can be used for this process include but are not limited to:
   What-if scenario analysis. What-if scenario analysis is the process of evaluating scenarios in order to predict
  uu
      their effect, positive or negative, on project objectives. This is an analysis of the question, "What if the situation
      represented by scenario X happens?" A schedule network analysis is performed using the schedule to compute
      the different scenarios, such as delaying a major component delivery, extending specific engineering durations,
      or introducing external factors, such as a strike or a change in the permit process. The outcome of the what-if
      scenario analysis can be used to assess the feasibility of the project schedule under different conditions, and in
      preparing schedule reserves and response plans to address the impact of unexpected situations.
   Simulation. Simulation models the combined effects of individual project risks and other sources of uncertainty
  uu
      to evaluate their potential impact on achieving project objectives. The most common simulation technique is
      Monte Carlo analysis (see Section 11.4.2.5), in which risks and other sources of uncertainty are used to calculate
      possible schedule outcomes for the total project. Simulation involves calculating multiple work package durations
      with different sets of activity assumptions, constraints, risks, issues, or scenarios using probability distributions
      and other representations of uncertainty (see Section 11.4.2.4). Figure 6-18 shows a probability distribution for a
      project with the probability of achieving a certain target date (i.e., project finish date). In this example, there is a
      10% probability that the project will finish on or before the target date of May 13, while there is a 90% probability
      of completing the project by May 28.

6.5.2.5 LEADS AND LAGS

   Described in Section 6.3.2.3. Leads and lags are refinements applied during network analysis to develop a viable
schedule by adjusting the start time of the successor activities. Leads are used in limited circumstances to advance a
successor activity with respect to the predecessor activity, and lags are used in limited circumstances where processes
require a set period of time to elapse between the predecessors and successors without work or resource impact.




                                                                                                         Part 1 - Guide

6.5.2.6 SCHEDULE COMPRESSION

    Schedule compression techniques are used to shorten or accelerate the schedule duration without reducing the
project scope in order to meet schedule constraints, imposed dates, or other schedule objectives. A helpful technique
is the negative float analysis. The critical path is the one with the least float. Due to violating a constraint or imposed
date, the total float can become negative. Schedule compression techniques are compared in Figure 6-19 and include:
    Crashing. A technique used to shorten the schedule duration for the least incremental cost by adding resources.
   uu
       Examples of crashing include approving overtime, bringing in additional resources, or paying to expedite delivery
       to activities on the critical path. Crashing works only for activities on the critical path where additional resources
       will shorten the activity's duration. Crashing does not always produce a viable alternative and may result in
       increased risk and/or cost.
    Fast tracking. A schedule compression technique in which activities or phases normally done in sequence
   uu
       are performed in parallel for at least a portion of their duration. An example is constructing the foundation for a
       building before completing all of the architectural drawings. Fast tracking may result in rework and increased
       risk. Fast tracking only works when activities can be overlapped to shorten the project duration on the critical
       path. Using leads in case of schedule acceleration usually increases coordination efforts between the activities
       concerned and increases quality risk. Fast tracking may also increase project costs.

6.5.2.7 PROJECT MANAGEMENT INFORMATION SYSTEM (PMIS)

   Described in Section 4.3.2.2. Project management information systems include scheduling software that expedites
the process of building a schedule model by generating start and finish dates based on the inputs of activities, network
diagrams, resources, and activity durations.

6.5.2.8 AGILE RELEASE PLANNING

  Agile release planning provides a high-level summary timeline of the release schedule (typically 3 to 6 months)
based on the product roadmap and the product vision for the product's evolution. Agile release planning also
determines the number of iterations or sprints in the release, and allows the product owner and team to decide
how much needs to be developed and how long it will take to have a releasable product based on business goals,
dependencies, and impediments.
   Since features represent value to the customer, the timeline provides a more easily understood project schedule
as it defines which feature will be available at the end of each iteration, which is exactly the depth of information the
customer is looking for.
  Figure 6-20 shows the relationship among product vision, product roadmap, release planning, and iteration planning.

   6.5.3 DEVELOP SCHEDULE: OUTPUTS

   6.5.3.1 SCHEDULE BASELINE

      A schedule baseline is the approved version of a schedule model that can be changed only through formal change
   control procedures and is used as a basis for comparison to actual results. It is accepted and approved by the appropriate
   stakeholders as the schedule baseline with baseline start dates and baseline finish dates. During monitoring and
   controlling, the approved baseline dates are compared to the actual start and finish dates to determine if variances have
   occurred. The schedule baseline is a component of the project management plan.

   6.5.3.2 PROJECT SCHEDULE

      The project schedule is an output of a schedule model that presents linked activities with planned dates, durations,
   milestones, and resources. At a minimum, the project schedule includes a planned start date and planned finish date
   for each activity. If resource planning is done at an early stage, the project schedule remains preliminary until resource
   assignments have been confirmed and scheduled start and finish dates are established. This process usually occurs no
   later than the completion of the project management plan (Section 4.2.3.1). A target project schedule model may also
   be developed with a defined target start and target finish for each activity. The project schedule may be presented in
   summary form, sometimes referred to as the master schedule or milestone schedule, or presented in detail. Although
   a project schedule model can be presented in tabular form, it is more often presented graphically, using one or more of
   the following formats:
       Bar charts. Also known as Gantt charts, bar charts represent schedule information where activities are listed
      uu
          on the vertical axis, dates are shown on the horizontal axis, and activity durations are shown as horizontal
          bars placed according to start and finish dates. Bar charts are relatively easy to read and are commonly used.
          Depending on the audience, float can be depicted or not. For control and management communications, the
          broader, more comprehensive summary activity is used between milestones or across multiple interdependent
          work packages and is displayed in bar chart reports. An example is the summary schedule portion of Figure 6-21
          that is presented in a WBS-structured format.






                                                                                                                         217
    Milestone charts. These charts are similar to bar charts, but only identify the scheduled start or completion of
   uu
      major deliverables and key external interfaces. An example is the milestone schedule portion of Figure 6-21.
    Project schedule network diagrams. These diagrams are commonly presented in the activity-on-node
   uu
      diagram format showing activities and relationships without a time scale, sometimes referred to as a pure
      logic diagram, as shown in Figure 6-11, or presented in a time-scaled schedule network diagram format that
      is sometimes called a logic bar chart, as shown for the detailed schedule in Figure 6-21. These diagrams, with
      activity date information, usually show both the project network logic and the project's critical path schedule
      activities. This example also shows how each work package is planned as a series of related activities.
      Another presentation of the project schedule network diagram is a time-scaled logic diagram. These diagrams
      include a time scale and bars that represent the duration of activities with the logical relationships. They are
      optimized to show the relationships between activities where any number of activities may appear on the
      same line of the diagram in sequence.
   Figure 6-21 shows schedule presentations for a sample project being executed, with the work in progress reported
through as-of date or status date. For a simple project schedule model, Figure 6-21 reflects schedule presentations in
the forms of (1) a milestone schedule as a milestone chart, (2) a summary schedule as a bar chart, and (3) a detailed
schedule as a project schedule linked bar chart diagram. Figure 6-21 also visually shows the relationships among the
different levels of detail of the project schedule.

6.5.3.3 SCHEDULE DATA

   The schedule data for the project schedule model is the collection of information for describing and controlling the
schedule. The schedule data includes, at a minimum, the schedule milestones, schedule activities, activity attributes,
and documentation of all identified assumptions and constraints. The amount of additional data varies by application
area. Information frequently supplied as supporting detail includes but is not limited to:
    Resource requirements by time period, often in the form of a resource histogram;
   uu

    Alternative schedules, such as best-case or worst-case, not resource-leveled or resource-leveled, or with or
   uu
       without imposed dates; and
    Applied schedule reserves.
   uu

  Schedule data could also include such items as resource histograms, cash-flow projections, order and delivery
schedules, or other relevant information.

6.5.3.4 PROJECT CALENDARS

   A project calendar identifies working days and shifts that are available for scheduled activities. It distinguishes
time periods in days or parts of days that are available to complete scheduled activities from time periods that are not
available for work. A schedule model may require more than one project calendar to allow for different work periods for
some activities to calculate the project schedule. The project calendars may be updated.

6.5.3.5 CHANGE REQUESTS

   Described in Section 4.3.3.4. Modifications to the project scope or project schedule may result in change requests
to the scope baseline, and/or other components of the project management plan. Change requests are processed for
review and disposition through the Perform Integrated Change Control process (Section 4.6). Preventive actions may
include recommended changes to eliminate or reduce the probability of negative schedule variances.

   6.5.3.6 PROJECT MANAGEMENT PLAN UPDATES

      Any change to the project management plan goes through the organization's change control process via a change
   request. Components that may require a change request for the project management plan include but are not limited to:
       Schedule management plan. Described in Section 6.1.3.1. The schedule management plan may be updated to
      uu
         reflect a change in the way the schedule was developed and will be managed.
       Cost baseline. Described in Section 7.3.3.1. Changes to the cost baseline are incorporated in response to
      uu
         approved changes in scope, resources, or cost estimates. In some cases, cost variances can be so severe that a
         revised cost baseline is needed to provide a realistic basis for performance measurement.

   6.5.3.7 PROJECT DOCUMENTS UPDATES

     Project documents that may be updated as a result of carrying out this process include but are not limited to:
       Activity attributes. Described in Section 6.2.3.2. Activity attributes are updated to include any revised resource
      uu
         requirements and any other revisions generated by the Develop Schedule process.
       Assumption log. Described in Section 4.1.3.2. The assumption log may be updated with changes to assumptions
      uu
         in duration, resource utilization, sequencing, or other information that is revealed as a result of developing the
         schedule model.
       Duration estimates. Described in Section 6.4.3.1. The number and availability of resources, along with the
      uu
         activity dependencies can result in a change to the duration estimates. If the resource-leveling analysis changes
         the resource requirements, then the duration estimates will likely need to be updated as well.
       Lessons learned register. Described in Section 4.4.3.1. The lessons learned register can be updated with
      uu
         techniques that were efficient and effective in developing the schedule model.
       Resource requirements. Described in Section 9.2.3.1. Resource leveling can have a significant effect on
      uu
         preliminary estimates for the types and quantities of resources required. If the resource-leveling analysis changes
         the resource requirements, then the resource requirements are updated.
       Risk register. Described in Section 11.2.3.1. The risk register may need to be updated to reflect opportunities or
      uu
         threats perceived through scheduling assumptions.

6.6 CONTROL SCHEDULE
   Control Schedule is the process of monitoring the status of the project to update the project schedule and managing
changes to the schedule baseline. The key benefit of this process is that the schedule baseline is maintained throughout
the project. This process is performed throughout the project. The inputs, tools and techniques, and outputs of this
process are depicted in Figure 6-22. Figure 6-23 depicts the data flow diagram of the process.

     Updating the schedule model requires knowing the actual performance to date. Any change to the schedule baseline
   can only be approved through the Perform Integrated Change Control process (Section 4.6). Control Schedule, as a
   component of the Perform Integrated Change Control process, is concerned with:





       Determining the current status of the project schedule,





      uu

       Influencing the factors that create schedule changes,
      uu

       Reconsidering necessary schedule reserves,
      uu

       Determining if the project schedule has changed, and
      uu

       Managing the actual changes as they occur.
      uu




                                                                                                                                              223
  When an agile approach is used, Control Schedule is concerned with:
    Determining the current status of the project schedule by comparing the total amount of work delivered and
   uu
      accepted against the estimates of work completed for the elapsed time cycle;
    Conducting retrospectives (scheduled reviews to record lessons learned) for correcting processes and improving,
   uu
      if required;
    Reprioritizing the remaining work plan (backlog);
   uu

    Determining the rate at which the deliverables are produced, validated, and accepted (velocity) in the given time
   uu
      per iteration (agreed-upon work cycle duration, typically 2 weeks or 1 month);
    Determining that the project schedule has changed; and
   uu

    Managing the actual changes as they occur.
   uu

  When work is being contracted, regular and milestone status updates from contractors and suppliers are a means of
ensuring the work is progressing as agreed upon to ensure the schedule is under control. Scheduled status reviews and
walkthroughs should be done to ensure the contractor reports are accurate and complete.



6.6.1 CONTROL SCHEDULE: INPUTS

6.6.1.1 PROJECT MANAGEMENT PLAN

  Described in Section 4.2.3.1. Project management plan components include but are not limited to:
    Schedule management plan. Described in Section 6.1.3.1. The schedule management describes the frequency
   uu
      that the schedule will be updated, how reserve will be used, and how the schedule will be controlled.
    Schedule baseline. Described in Section 6.5.3.1. The schedule baseline is compared with actual results to
   uu
      determine if a change, corrective action, or preventive action is necessary.
    Scope baseline. Described in Section 5.4.3.1. The project WBS, deliverables, constraints, and assumptions
   uu
      documented in the scope baseline are considered explicitly when monitoring and controlling the schedule
      baseline.
    Performance measurement baseline. Described in Section 4.2.3.1. When using earned value analysis the
   uu
      performance measurement baseline is compared to actual results to determine if a change, corrective action, or
      preventive action is necessary.

   6.6.1.2 PROJECT DOCUMENTS

     Project documents that can be considered as inputs for this process include but are not limited to:
       Lessons learned register. Described in Section 4.4.3.1. Lessons learned earlier in the project can be applied to
      uu
          later phases in the project to improve schedule control.
       Project calendars. Described in Section 6.5.3.4. A schedule model may require more than one project calendar
      uu
          to allow for different work periods for some activities to calculate the schedule forecasts.
       Project schedule. Described in Section 6.5.3.2. Project schedule refers to the most recent version with notations
      uu
          to indicate updates, completed activities, and started activities as of the indicated date.
       Resource calendars. Described in Section 9.2.1.2. Resource calendars show the availability of team and
      uu
          physical resources.
       Schedule data. Described in Section 6.5.3.3. Schedule data will be reviewed and updated in the Control
      uu
          Schedule process.

   6.6.1.3 WORK PERFORMANCE DATA

      Described in Section 4.3.3.2. Work performance data contains data on project status such as which activities have
   started, their progress (e.g., actual duration, remaining duration, and physical percent complete), and which activities
   have finished.

   6.6.1.4 ORGANIZATIONAL PROCESS ASSETS

     The organizational process assets that can influence the Control Schedule process include but are not limited to:
       Existing formal and informal schedule control-related policies, procedures, and guidelines;
      uu

       Schedule control tools; and
      uu

       Monitoring and reporting methods to be used.
      uu






                                                                                                                       225
6.6.2 CONTROL SCHEDULE: TOOLS AND TECHNIQUES

6.6.2.1 DATA ANALYSIS

  Data analysis techniques that can be used for this process include but are not limited to:
   Earned value analysis. Described in Section 7.4.2.2. Schedule performance measurements such as schedule
  uu
          variance (SV) and schedule performance index (SPI) are used to assess the magnitude of variation to the original
          schedule baseline.
   Iteration burndown chart. This chart tracks the work that remains to be completed in the iteration backlog. It
  uu
          is used to analyze the variance with respect to an ideal burndown based on the work committed from iteration
          planning (see Section 6.4.2.8). A forecast trend line can be used to predict the likely variance at iteration
          completion and take appropriate actions during the course of the iteration. A diagonal line representing the ideal
          burndown and daily actual remaining work is then plotted. A trend line is then calculated to forecast completion
          based on remaining work. Figure 6-24 is an example of an iteration burndown chart.

    Performance reviews. Performance reviews measure, compare, and analyze schedule performance against
   uu
       the schedule baseline such as actual start and finish dates, percent complete, and remaining duration for work
       in progress.
    Trend analysis. Described in Section 4.5.2.2. Trend analysis examines project performance over time to determine
   uu
       whether performance is improving or deteriorating. Graphical analysis techniques are valuable for understanding
       performance to date and for comparing to future performance goals in the form of completion dates.
    Variance analysis. Variance analysis looks at variances in planned versus actual start and finish dates, planned
   uu
       versus actual durations, and variances in float. Part of variance analysis is determining the cause and degree of
       variance relative to the schedule baseline (see Section 6.5.3.1), estimating the implications of those variances
       for future work to completion, and deciding whether corrective or preventive action is required. For example, a
       major delay on any activity not on the critical path may have little effect on the overall project schedule, while a
       much shorter delay on a critical or near-critical activity may require immediate action.
    What-if scenario analysis. Described in Section 6.5.2.4. What-if scenario analysis is used to assess the various
   uu
       scenarios guided by the output from the Project Risk Management processes to bring the schedule model into
       alignment with the project management plan and approved baseline.

6.6.2.2 CRITICAL PATH METHOD

   Described in Section 6.5.2.2. Comparing the progress along the critical path can help determine schedule status. The
variance on the critical path will have a direct impact on the project end date. Evaluating the progress of activities on
near critical paths can identify schedule risk.

6.6.2.3 PROJECT MANAGEMENT INFORMATION SYSTEM (PMIS)

   Described in Section 4.3.2.2. Project management information systems include scheduling software that provides
the ability to track planned dates versus actual dates, to report variances to and progress made against the schedule
baseline, and to forecast the effects of changes to the project schedule model.

6.6.2.4 RESOURCE OPTIMIZATION

   Described in Section 6.5.2.3. Resource optimization techniques involve the scheduling of activities and the resources
required by those activities while taking into consideration both the resource availability and the project time.




                                                                                                                       227
6.6.2.5 LEADS AND LAGS

   Adjusting leads and lags is applied during network analysis to find ways to bring project activities that are behind into
alignment with the plan. For example, on a project to construct a new office building, the landscaping can be adjusted to
start before the exterior work of the building is completed by increasing the lead time in the relationship, or a technical
writing team can adjust the start of editing the draft of a large document immediately after the document is written by
eliminating or decreasing lag time.

6.6.2.6 SCHEDULE COMPRESSION

  Schedule compression techniques (see Section 6.5.2.6) are used to find ways to bring project activities that are
behind into alignment with the plan by fast tracking or crashing the schedule for the remaining work.



6.6.3 CONTROL SCHEDULE: OUTPUTS

6.6.3.1 WORK PERFORMANCE INFORMATION

   Described in Section 4.5.1.3. Work performance information includes information on how the project work
is performing compared to the schedule baseline. Variances in the start and finish dates and the durations can be
calculated at the work package level and control account level. For projects using earned value analysis, the (SV) and
(SPI) are documented for inclusion in work performance reports (see Section 4.5.3.1).

6.6.3.2 SCHEDULE FORECASTS

   Schedule updates are forecasts of estimates or predictions of conditions and events in the project's future based on
information and knowledge available at the time of the forecast. Forecasts are updated and reissued based on work
performance information provided as the project is executed. The information is based on the project's past performance
and expected future performance based on corrective or preventive actions. This can include earned value performance
indicators, as well as schedule reserve information that could impact the project in the future.




                                                                                                             Part 1 - Guide
228
6.6.3.3 CHANGE REQUESTS

   Described in Section 4.3.3.4. Schedule variance analysis, as well as reviews of progress reports, results of performance
measures, and modifications to the project scope or project schedule, may result in change requests to the schedule
baseline, scope baseline, and/or other components of the project management plan. Change requests are processed
for review and disposition through the Perform Integrated Change Control process (Section 4.6). Preventive actions may
include recommended changes to eliminate or reduce the probability of negative schedule variances.

6.6.3.4 PROJECT MANAGEMENT PLAN UPDATES

   Any change to the project management plan goes through the organization's change control process via a change
request. Components that may require a change request for the project management plan include but are not limited to:
    Schedule management plan. Described in Section 6.1.3.1. The schedule management plan may be updated to
   uu
       reflect a change in the way the schedule is managed.
    Schedule baseline. Described in Section 6.5.3.1. Changes to the schedule baseline are incorporated in
   uu
       response to approved change requests related to change in project scope, resources, or activity duration
       estimates. The schedule baseline may be updated to reflect changes caused by schedule compression
       techniques or performance issues.
    Cost baseline. Described in Section 7.3.3.1. Changes to the cost baseline are incorporated in response to
   uu
       approved changes in scope, resources, or cost estimates.
    Performance measurement baseline. Described in Section 4.2.3.1. Changes to the performance measurement
   uu
       baseline are incorporated in response to approved changes in scope, schedule performance, or cost estimates.
       In some cases, the performance variances can be so severe that a change request is put forth to revise the
       performance measurement baseline to provide a realistic basis for performance measurement.




                                                                                                                       229
6.6.3.5 PROJECT DOCUMENTS UPDATES

  Project documents that may be updated as a result of carrying out this process include but are not limited to:
   Assumption log. Described in Section 4.1.3.2. Schedule performance may indicate the need to revise
  uu
      assumptions on activity sequencing, durations, and productivity.
   Basis of estimates. Described in Section 6.4.3.2. Schedule performance may indicate the need to revise the
  uu
      way duration estimates were developed.
   Lessons learned register. Described in Section 4.4.3.1. The lessons learned register can be updated with
  uu
      techniques that were effective in maintaining the schedule, causes of variances, and corrective actions that were
      used to respond to schedule variances.
   Project schedule. An updated project schedule (see Section 6.5.3.2) will be generated from the schedule model
  uu
      populated with updated schedule data to reflect the schedule changes and manage the project.
   Resource calendars. Described in Section 9.2.1.2. Resource calendars are updated to reflect changes to
  uu
      the utilization of resource calendars that were the result of optimizing resources, schedule compression, and
      corrective or preventive actions.
   Risk register. Described in Section 11.2.3.1. The risk register and risk response plans within it, may be updated
  uu
      based on the risks that may arise due to schedule compression techniques.
   Schedule data. Described in Section 6.5.3.3. New project schedule network diagrams may be developed to
  uu
      display approved remaining durations and approved modifications to the schedule. In some cases, project
      schedule delays can be so severe that a new target schedule with forecasted start and finish dates is needed to
      provide realistic data for directing the work, measuring performance, and measuring progress.

    PROJE CT CO ST MA NAG EM ENT
     Project Cost Management includes the processes involved in planning, estimating, budgeting, financing, funding,
   managing, and controlling costs so that the project can be completed within the approved budget. The Project Cost
   Management processes are:
     7.1 Plan Cost Management--The process of defining how the project costs will be estimated, budgeted, managed,
   monitored, and controlled.
      7.2 Estimate Costs--The process of developing an approximation of the monetary resources needed to complete
   project work.
      7.3 Determine Budget--The process of aggregating the estimated costs of individual activities or work packages to
   establish an authorized cost baseline.
     7.4 Control Costs--The process of monitoring the status of the project to update the project costs and manage
   changes to the cost baseline.
      Figure 7-1 provides an overview of the Project Cost Management processes. The Project Cost Management processes
   are presented as discrete processes with defined interfaces, while in practice they overlap and interact in ways that
   cannot be completely detailed in the PMBOK(R) Guide. These processes interact with each other and with processes in
   other Knowledge Areas.
      On some projects, especially those of smaller scope, cost estimating and cost budgeting are tightly linked and can
   be viewed as a single process that can be performed by a single person over a relatively short period of time. They are
   presented here as distinct processes because the tools and techniques for each are different. The ability to influence
   cost is greatest at the early stages of the project, making early scope definition critical (see Section 5.3).

KEY CONCEPTS FOR PROJECT COST MANAGEMENT

   Project Cost Management is primarily concerned with the cost of the resources needed to complete project activities.
Project Cost Management should consider the effect of project decisions on the subsequent recurring cost of using,
maintaining, and supporting the product, service, or result of the project. For example, limiting the number of design
reviews can reduce the cost of the project but could increase the resulting product's operating costs.
   Another aspect of cost management is recognizing that different stakeholders measure project costs in different
ways and at different times. For example, the cost of an acquired item may be measured when the acquisition decision
is made or committed, the order is placed, the item is delivered, or the actual cost is incurred or recorded for project
accounting purposes. In many organizations, predicting and analyzing the prospective financial performance of
the project's product is performed outside of the project. In others, such as a capital facilities project, Project Cost
Management can include this work. When such predictions and analyses are included, Project Cost Management may
address additional processes and numerous general financial management techniques such as return on investment,
discounted cash flow, and investment payback analysis.

TRENDS AND EMERGING PRACTICES IN PROJECT COST MANAGEMENT

   Within the practice of Project Cost Management, trends include the expansion of earned value management (EVM) to
include the concept of earned schedule (ES).
   ES is an extension to the theory and practice of EVM. Earned schedule theory replaces the schedule variance
measures used in traditional EVM (earned value - planned value) with ES and actual time (AT). Using the alternate
equation for calculating schedule variance ES - AT, if the amount of earned schedule is greater than 0, then the project
is considered ahead of schedule. In other words, the project earned more than planned at a given point in time. The
schedule performance index (SPI) using earned schedule metrics is ES/AT. This indicates the efficiency with which work
is being accomplished. Earned schedule theory also provides formulas for forecasting the project completion date, using
earned schedule, actual time, and estimated duration.

TAILORING CONSIDERATIONS

   Because each project is unique, the project manager may need to tailor the way Project Cost Management processes
are applied. Considerations for tailoring include but are not limited to:
    Knowledge management. Does the organization have a formal knowledge management and financial database
   uu
       repository that a project manager is required to use and that is readily accessible?
    Estimating and budgeting. Does the organization have existing formal or informal cost estimating and
   uu
       budgeting-related policies, procedures, and guidelines?
    Earned value management. Does the organization use earned value management in managing projects?
   uu

    Use of agile approach. Does the organization use agile methodologies in managing projects? How does this
   uu
       impact cost estimating?
    Governance. Does the organization have formal or informal audit and governance policies, procedures, and guidelines?
   uu


CONSIDERATIONS FOR AGILE/ADAPTIVE ENVIRONMENTS

   Projects with high degrees of uncertainty or those where the scope is not yet fully defined may not benefit from
detailed cost calculations due to frequent changes. Instead, lightweight estimation methods can be used to generate a
fast, high-level forecast of project labor costs, which can then be easily adjusted as changes arise. Detailed estimates
are reserved for short-term planning horizons in a just-in-time fashion.
   In cases where high-variability projects are also subject to strict budgets, the scope and schedule are more often
adjusted to stay within cost constraints.

   7.1 PLAN COST MANAGEMENT
      Plan Cost Management is the process of defining how the project costs will be estimated, budgeted, managed,
   monitored, and controlled. The key benefit of this process is that it provides guidance and direction on how the project
   costs will be managed throughout the project. This process is performed once or at predefined points in the project. The
   inputs, tools and techniques, and outputs of this process are depicted in Figure 7-2. Figure 7-3 depicts the data flow
   diagram of the process.

   The cost management planning effort occurs early in project planning and sets the framework for each of the cost
management processes so that performance of the processes will be efficient and coordinated. The cost management
processes and their associated tools and techniques are documented in the cost management plan. The cost management
plan is a component of the project management plan.



7.1.1 PLAN COST MANAGEMENT: INPUTS

7.1.1.1 PROJECT CHARTER

   Described in Section 4.2.3.1. The project charter provides the preapproved financial resources from which the detailed
project costs are developed. The project charter also defines the project approval requirements that will influence the
management of the project costs.

7.1.1.2 PROJECT MANAGEMENT PLAN

  Described in Section 4.2.3.1. Project management plan components include but are not limited to:
    Schedule management plan. Described in Section 6.1.3.1. The schedule management plan establishes the
   uu
       criteria and the activities for developing, monitoring, and controlling the schedule. The schedule management
       plan provides processes and controls that will impact cost estimation and management.
    Risk management plan. Described in Section 11.1.3.1. The risk management plan provides the approach for
   uu
       identifying, analyzing, and monitoring risks. The risk management plan provides processes and controls that will
       impact cost estimation and management.

7.1.1.3 ENTERPRISE ENVIRONMENTAL FACTORS

limited to:
    Organizational culture and structure can influence cost management.
   uu

    Market conditions describe what products, services, and results are available in the regional and global markets.
   uu

    Currency exchange rates for project costs are sourced from more than one country.
   uu




                                                                                                          Part 1 - Guide
236
       Published commercial information such as resource cost rate information is often available from commercial
      uu
         databases that track skills and human resource costs, and provide standard costs for material and equipment.
         Published seller price lists are another source of information.
       Project management information system provides alternative possibilities for managing cost.

                                                                                                                      237
7.1.2.2 DATA ANALYSIS

   A data analysis technique that can be used for this process includes but is not limited to alternatives analysis.
Alternatives analysis can include reviewing strategic funding options such as: self-funding, funding with equity, or
funding with debt. It can also include consideration of ways to acquire project resources such as making, purchasing,
renting, or leasing.

7.1.2.3 MEETINGS

   Project teams may hold planning meetings to develop the cost management plan. Attendees may include the project
manager, the project sponsor, selected project team members, selected stakeholders, anyone with responsibility for
project costs, and others as needed.



7.1.3 PLAN COST MANAGEMENT: OUTPUTS

7.1.3.1 COST MANAGEMENT PLAN

   The cost management plan is a component of the project management plan and describes how the project costs will
be planned, structured, and controlled. The cost management processes and their associated tools and techniques are
documented in the cost management plan.
  For example, the cost management plan can establish the following:
    Units of measure. Each unit used in measurements (such as staff hours, staff days, or weeks for time measures;
   uu
      meters, liters, tons, kilometers, or cubic yards for quantity measures; or lump sum in currency form) is defined
      for each of the resources.
    Level of precision. This is the degree to which cost estimates will be rounded up or down (e.g., US$995.59 to
   uu
      US$1,000), based on the scope of the activities and magnitude of the project.
    Level of accuracy. The acceptable range (e.g., 10%) used in determining realistic cost estimates is specified,
   uu
      and may include an amount for contingencies.




                                                                                                       Part 1 - Guide
238
    Organizational procedures links. The work breakdown structure (WBS) (Section 5.4) provides the
   uu
      framework for the cost management plan, allowing for consistency with the estimates, budgets, and control
      of costs. The WBS component used for the project cost accounting is called the control account. Each
      control account is assigned a unique code or account number(s) that links directly to the performing
      organization's accounting system.
    Control thresholds. Variance thresholds for monitoring cost performance may be specified to indicate an
   uu
      agreed-upon amount of variation to be allowed before some action needs to be taken. Thresholds are typically
      expressed as percentage deviations from the baseline plan.
    Rules of performance measurement. Earned value management (EVM) rules of performance measurement are
   uu
      set. For example, the cost management plan may:
      nuDefine the points in the WBS at which measurement of control accounts will be performed;
      nuEstablish  the EVM techniques (e.g., weighted milestones, fixed-formula, percent complete, etc.) to be
          employed; and
      nuSpecify  tracking methodologies and the EVM computation equations for calculating projected estimate at
          completion (EAC) forecasts to provide a validity check on the bottom-up EAC.
    Reporting formats. The formats and frequency for the various cost reports are defined.
   uu

    Additional details. Additional details about cost management activities include but are not limited to:
   uu

      nuDescription of strategic funding choices,
      nuProcedure to account for fluctuations in currency exchange rates, and
      nuProcedure for project cost recording.

  For more specific information regarding earned value management, refer to the Practice Standard for Earned Value
Management - Second Edition [17].

7.2 ESTIMATE COSTS
   Estimate Costs is the process of developing an approximation of the cost of resources needed to complete project
work. The key benefit of this process is that it determines the monetary resources required for the project. This process
is performed periodically throughout the project as needed. The inputs, tools and techniques, and outputs of this process
are depicted in Figure 7-4. Figure 7-5 depicts the data flow diagram of the process.

      A cost estimate is a quantitative assessment of the likely costs for resources required to complete the activity. It is a
   prediction that is based on the information known at a given point in time. Cost estimates include the identification and
   consideration of costing alternatives to initiate and complete the project. Cost trade-offs and risks should be considered,
   such as make versus buy, buy versus lease, and the sharing of resources in order to achieve optimal costs for the project.
      Cost estimates are generally expressed in units of some currency (i.e., dollars, euros, yen, etc.), although in some
   instances other units of measure, such as staff hours or staff days, are used to facilitate comparisons by eliminating the
   effects of currency fluctuations.
      Cost estimates should be reviewed and refined during the course of the project to reflect additional detail as it becomes
   available and assumptions are tested. The accuracy of a project estimate will increase as the project progresses through
   the project life cycle. For example, a project in the initiation phase may have a rough order of magnitude (ROM) estimate
   in the range of -25% to +75%. Later in the project, as more information is known, definitive estimates could narrow
   the range of accuracy to -5% to +10%. In some organizations, there are guidelines for when such refinements can be
   made and the degree of confidence or accuracy that is expected.
      Costs are estimated for all resources that will be charged to the project. This includes but is not limited to labor,
   materials, equipment, services, and facilities, as well as special categories such as an inflation allowance, cost of
   financing, or contingency costs. Cost estimates may be presented at the activity level or in summary form.



   7.2.1 ESTIMATE COSTS: INPUTS

   7.2.1.1 PROJECT MANAGEMENT PLAN

     Described in Section 4.2.3.1. Project management plan components include but are not limited to:
       Cost management plan. Described in Section 7.1.3.1. The cost management plan describes estimating methods
      uu
          that can be used and the level of precision and accuracy required for the cost estimate.
       Quality management plan. Described in Section 8.1.3.1. The quality management plan describes the activities
      uu
          and resources necessary for the project management team to achieve the quality objectives set for the project.






                                                                                                                           241
   Scope baseline. Described in Section 5.4.3.1. The scope baseline includes the project scope statement, WBS,
  uu
      and WBS dictionary:
      nuProject scope statement. The scope statement (Section 5.3.3.1) reflects funding constraints by period for the
         expenditure of project funds or other financial assumptions and constraints.
      nuWork   breakdown structure. The WBS (Section 5.4.3.1) provides the relationships among all the project
         deliverables and their various components.
      nuWBS    dictionary. The WBS dictionary (Section 5.4.3.) and related detailed statements of work provide an
         identification of the deliverables and a description of the work in each WBS component required to produce
         each deliverable.

7.2.1.2 PROJECT DOCUMENTS

  Project documents that can be considered as inputs for this process include but are not limited to:
   Lessons learned register. Described in Section 4.4.3.1. Lessons learned earlier in the project with regard to
  uu
      developing cost estimates can be applied to later phases in the project to improve the accuracy and precision of
      the cost estimates.
   Project schedule. Described in Section 6.5.3.2. The schedule includes the type, quantity, and amount of time
  uu
      that team and physical resources will be active on the project. The duration estimates (Section 6.4.3.1) will
      affect cost estimates when resources are charged per unit of time and when there are seasonal fluctuations
      in costs. The schedule also provides useful information for projects that incorporate the cost of financing
      (including interest charges).
   Resource requirements. Described in Section 9.2.3.1. Resource requirements identify the types and quantities
  uu
      of resources required for each work package or activity.
   Risk register. Described in Section 11.2.3.1. The risk register contains details of individual project risks that
  uu
      have been identified and prioritized, and for which risk responses are required. The risk register provides detailed
      information that can be used to estimate costs.

7.2.1.3 ENTERPRISE ENVIRONMENTAL FACTORS

  The enterprise environmental factors that can influence the Estimate Costs process include but are not limited to:
    Market conditions. These conditions describe what products, services, and results are available in the market,
   uu
      from whom, and under what terms and conditions. Regional and/or global supply and demand conditions greatly
      influence resource costs.
    Published commercial information. Resource cost rate information is often available from commercial
   uu
      databases that track skills and human resource costs, and provide standard costs for material and equipment.
      Published seller price lists are another source of information.
    Exchange rates and inflation. For large-scale projects that extend multiple years with multiple currencies, the
   uu
      fluctuations of currencies and inflation need to be understood and built into the Estimate Cost process.

7.2.1.4 ORGANIZATIONAL PROCESS ASSETS

  The organizational process assets that can influence the Estimate Costs process include but are not limited to:
    Cost estimating policies,
   uu

    Cost estimating templates,
   uu

    Historical information and lessons learned repository.
   uu



7.2.2 ESTIMATE COSTS: TOOLS AND TECHNIQUES

7.2.2.1 EXPERT JUDGMENT

   Described in Section 4.1.2.1 Expertise should be considered from individuals or groups with specialized knowledge
or training in the following topics:
    Previous similar projects;
   uu

    Information in the industry, discipline, and application area; and
   uu

    Cost estimating methods.
   uu




                                                                                                                    243
7.2.2.2 ANALOGOUS ESTIMATING

   Described in Section 6.4.2.2. Analogous cost estimating uses values, or attributes, of a previous project that are
similar to the current project. Values and attributes of the projects may include but are not limited to: scope, cost, budget,
duration, and measures of scale (e.g., size, weight). Comparison of these project values, or attributes, becomes the basis
for estimating the same parameter or measurement for the current project.

7.2.2.3 PARAMETRIC ESTIMATING

   Described in Section 6.4.2.3. Parametric estimating uses a statistical relationship between relevant historical data
and other variables (e.g., square footage in construction) to calculate a cost estimate for project work. This technique can
produce higher levels of accuracy depending on the sophistication and underlying data built into the model. Parametric
cost estimates can be applied to a total project or to segments of a project, in conjunction with other estimating methods.

7.2.2.4 BOTTOM-UP ESTIMATING

   Described in Section 6.4.2.5. Bottom-up estimating is a method of estimating a component of work. The cost
of individual work packages or activities is estimated to the greatest level of specified detail. The detailed cost
is then summarized or "rolled up" to higher levels for subsequent reporting and tracking purposes. The cost and
accuracy of bottom-up cost estimating are typically influenced by the size or other attributes of the individual
activity or work package.

7.2.2.5 THREE-POINT ESTIMATING

  Described in Section 6.4.2.4. The accuracy of single-point cost estimates may be improved by considering estimation
uncertainty and risk and using three estimates to define an approximate range for an activity's cost:
    Most likely (cM). The cost of the activity, based on realistic effort assessment for the required work and any
   uu
       predicted expenses.
    Optimistic (cO). The cost based on analysis of the best-case scenario for the activity.
   uu

    Pessimistic (cP). The cost based on analysis of the worst-case scenario for the activity.
   uu




                                                                                                              Part 1 - Guide
244
   Depending on the assumed distribution of values within the range of the three estimates, the expected cost, cE, can
be calculated using a formula. Two commonly used formulas are triangular and beta distributions. The formulas are:
    Triangular distribution. cE = (cO + cM + cP) / 3
   uu

    Beta distribution. cE = (cO + 4cM + cP) / 6
   uu

  Cost estimates based on three points with an assumed distribution provide an expected cost and clarify the range of
uncertainty around the expected cost.

7.2.2.6 DATA ANALYSIS

  Data analysis techniques that can be used in the Estimate Costs process include but are not limited to:
    Alternatives analysis. Alternatives analysis is a technique used to evaluate identified options in order to select
   uu
      which options or approaches to use to execute and perform the work of the project. An example would be
      evaluating the cost, schedule, resource, and quality impacts of buying versus making a deliverable.
    Reserve analysis. Cost estimates may include contingency reserves (sometimes called contingency allowances)
   uu
      to account for cost uncertainty. Contingency reserves are the budget within the cost baseline that is allocated for
      identified risks. Contingency reserves are often viewed as the part of the budget intended to address the known-
      unknowns that can affect a project. For example, rework for some project deliverables could be anticipated, while
      the amount of this rework is unknown. Contingency reserves may be estimated to account for this unknown
      amount of rework. Contingency reserves can be provided at any level from the specific activity to the entire
      project. The contingency reserve may be a percentage of the estimated cost, a fixed number, or may be developed
      by using quantitative analysis methods.
      As more precise information about the project becomes available, the contingency reserve may be used, reduced,
      or eliminated. Contingency should be clearly identified in cost documentation. Contingency reserves are part of
      the cost baseline and the overall funding requirements for the project.
    Cost of quality. Assumptions about costs of quality (Section 8.1.2.3) may be used to prepare the estimates. This
   uu
      includes evaluating the cost impact of additional investment in conformance versus the cost of nonconformance.
      It can also include looking at short-term cost reductions versus the implication of more frequent problems later
      on in the product life cycle.




                                                                                                                     245
7.2.2.7 PROJECT MANAGEMENT INFORMATION SYSTEM (PMIS)

   Described in Section 4.3.2.2. The project management information system can include spreadsheets, simulation
software, and statistical analysis tools to assist with cost estimating. Such tools simplify the use of some cost-estimating
techniques and thereby facilitate rapid consideration of cost estimate alternatives.

7.2.2.8 DECISION MAKING

   The decision-making techniques that can be used in the Estimate Costs process include but are not limited to voting.
Described in Section 5.2.2.4, voting is an assessment process having multiple alternatives with an expected outcome in
the form of future actions. These techniques are useful for engaging team members to improve estimate accuracy and
commitment to the emerging estimates.



7.2.3 ESTIMATE COSTS: OUTPUTS

7.2.3.1 COST ESTIMATES

   Cost estimates include quantitative assessments of the probable costs required to complete project work, as well as
contingency amounts to account for identified risks, and management reserve to cover unplanned work. Cost estimates
can be presented in summary form or in detail. Costs are estimated for all resources that are applied to the cost
estimate. This includes but is not limited to direct labor, materials, equipment, services, facilities, information technology,
and special categories such as cost of financing (including interest charges), an inflation allowance, exchange rates,
or a cost contingency reserve. Indirect costs, if they are included in the project estimate, can be included at the activity
level or at higher levels.




                                                                                                               Part 1 - Guide
246
   7.2.3.2 BASIS OF ESTIMATES

      The amount and type of additional details supporting the cost estimate vary by application area. Regardless of
   the level of detail, the supporting documentation should provide a clear and complete understanding of how the cost
   estimate was derived.
     Supporting detail for cost estimates may include:
       Documentation of the basis of the estimate (i.e., how it was developed),
      uu

       Documentation of all assumptions made,
      uu

       Documentation of any known constraints,
      uu

       Documentation of identified risks included when estimating costs,
      uu

       Indication of the range of possible estimates (e.g., US$10,000 (10%) to indicate that the item is expected to
      uu
         cost between a range of values), and
       Indication of the confidence level of the final estimate.
      uu


   7.2.3.3 PROJECT DOCUMENTS UPDATES

     Project documents that may be updated as a result of carrying out this process include but are not limited to:
       Assumption log. Described in Section 4.1.3.2. During the Cost Estimates process, new assumptions may be
      uu
         made, new constraints may be identified, and existing assumptions or constraints may be revisited and changed.
         The assumption log should be updated with this new information.
       Lessons learned register. Described in Section 4.4.3.1. The lessons learned register can be updated with
      uu
         techniques that were efficient and effective in developing cost estimates.
       Risk register. Described in Section 11.2.3.1. The risk register may be updated when appropriate risk responses
      uu
         are chosen and agreed upon during the Estimate Cost process.






                                                                                                                      247
7.3 DETERMINE BUDGET
   Determine Budget is the process of aggregating the estimated costs of individual activities or work packages to
establish an authorized cost baseline. The key benefit of this process is that it determines the cost baseline against
which project performance can be monitored and controlled. This process is performed once or at predefined points in
the project. The inputs, tools and techniques, and outputs of this process are depicted in Figure 7-6. Figure 7-7 depicts
the data flow diagram of the process.
   A project budget includes all the funds authorized to execute the project. The cost baseline is the approved version of
the time-phased project budget that includes contingency reserves, but excludes management reserves.

7.3.1 DETERMINE BUDGET: INPUTS

7.3.1.1 PROJECT MANAGEMENT PLAN

  Described in Section 4.2.3.1. Project management plan components include but are not limited to:
   Cost management plan. Described in Section 7.1.3.1. The cost management plan describes how the project
  uu
      costs will be structured into the project budget.
   Resource management plan. Described in Section 9.1.3.1. The resource management plan provides information
  uu
      on rates (personnel and other resources), estimation of travel costs, and other foreseen costs that are necessary
      to estimate the overall project budget.
   Scope baseline. Described in Section 5.4.3.1. The scope baseline includes the project scope statement, WBS,
  uu
      and WBS dictionary details for cost estimation and management.

7.3.1.2 PROJECT DOCUMENTS

  Examples of project documents that can be considered as inputs for this process include but are not limited to:
   Basis of estimates. Described in Section 6.4.3.2. Supporting detail for cost estimates contained in the basis for
  uu
      estimates should specify any basic assumptions dealing with the inclusion or exclusion of indirect or other costs
      in the project budget.
   Cost estimates. Described in Section 7.2.3.1. Cost estimates for each activity within a work package are
  uu
      aggregated to obtain a cost estimate for each work package.
   Project schedule. Described in Section 6.5.3.2. The project schedule includes planned start and finish dates
  uu
      for the project's activities, milestones, work packages, and control accounts. This information can be used to
      aggregate costs to the calendar periods in which the costs are planned to be incurred.
   Risk register. Described in Section 11.2.3.1. The risk register should be reviewed to consider how to aggregate
  uu
      the risk response costs. Updates to the risk register are included with project documents updates described in
      Section 11.5.3.3.




                                                                                                        Part 1 - Guide
250
   7.3.1.3 BUSINESS DOCUMENTS

      Described in Section 1.2.6. The business documents that can be considered as inputs for this process include but
   are not limited to:
       Business case. The business case identifies the critical success factors for the project, including financial
      uu
          success factors.
       Benefits management plan. The benefits management plan includes the target benefits, such as net present
      uu
          value calculations, timeframe for realizing benefits, and the metrics associated with the benefits.

   7.3.1.4 AGREEMENTS

      Described in Section 12.2.3.2. Applicable agreement information and costs relating to products, services, or results
   that have been or will be purchased are included when determining the budget.

   7.3.1.5 ENTERPRISE ENVIRONMENTAL FACTORS

      The enterprise environmental factors that can influence the Estimate Costs process include but are not limited
   to exchange rates. For large-scale projects that extend multiple years with multiple currencies, the fluctuations of
   currencies need to be understood and built into the Determine Budget process.

   7.3.1.6 ORGANIZATIONAL PROCESS ASSETS

     The organizational process assets that can influence the Determine Budget process include but are not limited to:
       Existing formal and informal cost budgeting-related policies, procedures, and guidelines;
      uu

       Historical information and lessons learned repository.
      uu

       Cost budgeting tools; and
      uu

7.3.2 DETERMINE BUDGET: TOOLS AND TECHNIQUES

7.3.2.1 EXPERT JUDGMENT

   Described in Section 4.1.2.1. Expertise should be considered from individuals or groups with specialized knowledge
or training in the following topics:
    Previous similar projects;
   uu

    Information in the industry, discipline, and application area;
   uu

    Financial principles; and
   uu

    Funding requirement and sources.
   uu


7.3.2.2 COST AGGREGATION

   Cost estimates are aggregated by work packages in accordance with the WBS. The work package cost estimates
are then aggregated for the higher component levels of the WBS (such as control accounts) and, ultimately, for the
entire project.

7.3.2.3 DATA ANALYSIS

   A data analysis technique that can be used in the Determine Budget process includes but is not limited to reserve
analysis, which can establish the management reserves for the project. Management reserves are an amount of
the project budget withheld for management control purposes and are reserved for unforeseen work that is within
scope of the project. Management reserves are intended to address the unknown unknowns that can affect a project.
The management reserve is not included in the cost baseline but is part of the overall project budget and funding
requirements. When an amount of management reserves is used to fund unforeseen work, the amount of management
reserve used is added to the cost baseline, thus requiring an approved change to the cost baseline.




                                                                                                      Part 1 - Guide
252
7.3.2.4 HISTORICAL INFORMATION REVIEW

   Reviewing historical information can assist in developing parametric estimates or analogous estimates. Historical
information may include project characteristics (parameters) to develop mathematical models to predict total project
costs. Such models may be simple (e.g., residential home construction is based on a certain cost per square foot of space)
or complex (e.g., one model of software development costing uses multiple separate adjustment factors, each of which
has numerous points within it).
   Both the cost and accuracy of analogous and parametric models can vary widely. They are most likely to be
reliable when:
    Historical information used to develop the model is accurate,
   uu

    Parameters used in the model are readily quantifiable, and
   uu

    Models are scalable, such that they work for large projects, small projects, and phases of a project.
   uu


7.3.2.5 FUNDING LIMIT RECONCILIATION

   The expenditure of funds should be reconciled with any funding limits on the commitment of funds for the project.
A variance between the funding limits and the planned expenditures will sometimes necessitate the rescheduling of
work to level out the rate of expenditures. This is accomplished by placing imposed date constraints for work into
the project schedule.

7.3.2.6 FINANCING

   Financing entails acquiring funding for projects. It is common for long-term infrastructure, industrial, and public
services projects to seek external sources of funds. If a project is funded externally, the funding entity may have certain
requirements that are required to be met.




                                                                                                                       253
   7.3.3 DETERMINE BUDGET: OUTPUTS

   7.3.3.1 COST BASELINE

      The cost baseline is the approved version of the time-phased project budget, excluding any management reserves,
   which can only be changed through formal change control procedures. It is used as a basis for comparison to actual
   results. The cost baseline is developed as a summation of the approved budgets for the different schedule activities.
      Figure 7-8 illustrates the various components of the project budget and cost baseline. Cost estimates for the various
   project activities, along with any contingency reserves (see Section 7.2.2.6) for these activities, are aggregated
   into their associated work package costs. The work package cost estimates, along with any contingency reserves
   estimated for the work packages, are aggregated into control accounts. The summation of the control accounts
   make up the cost baseline. Since the cost estimates that make up the cost baseline are directly tied to the schedule
   activities, this enables a time-phased view of the cost baseline, which is typically displayed in the form of an S-curve,
   as is illustrated in Figure 7-9. For projects that use earned value management, the cost baseline is referred to as the
   performance measurement baseline.
     Management reserves (Section 7.2.2.3) are added to the cost baseline to produce the project budget. As changes
   warranting the use of management reserves arise, the change control process is used to obtain approval to move the
   applicable management reserve funds into the cost baseline.

7.3.3.2 PROJECT FUNDING REQUIREMENTS

   Total funding requirements and periodic funding requirements (e.g., quarterly, annually) are derived from the cost
baseline. The cost baseline will include projected expenditures plus anticipated liabilities. Funding often occurs in
incremental amounts, and may not be evenly distributed, which appear as steps in Figure 7-9. The total funds required
are those included in the cost baseline plus management reserves, if any. Funding requirements may include the
source(s) of the funding.

7.3.3.3 PROJECT DOCUMENTS UPDATES

   7.4 CONTROL COSTS
      Control Costs is the process of monitoring the status of the project to update the project costs and managing changes
   to the cost baseline. The key benefit of this process is that the cost baseline is maintained throughout the project. This
   process is performed throughout the project. The inputs, tools and techniques, and outputs of this process are depicted
   in Figure 7-10. Figure 7-11 depicts the data flow diagram of the process.

       Updating the budget requires knowledge of the actual costs spent to date. Any increase to the authorized budget can
   only be approved through the Perform Integrated Change Control process (Section 4.6). Monitoring the expenditure of
   funds without regard to the value of work being accomplished for such expenditures has little value to the project, other
   than to track the outflow of funds. Much of the effort of cost control involves analyzing the relationship between the
   consumption of project funds and the work being accomplished for such expenditures. The key to effective cost control
   is the management of the approved cost baseline.
     Project cost control includes:
       Influencing the factors that create changes to the authorized cost baseline;
      uu

       Ensuring that all change requests are acted on in a timely manner;
      uu

       Managing the actual changes when and as they occur;
      uu

       Ensuring that cost expenditures do not exceed the authorized funding by period, by WBS component, by activity,
      uu
          and in total for the project;
       Monitoring cost performance to isolate and understand variances from the approved cost baseline;
      uu

       Monitoring work performance against funds expended;
      uu

       Preventing unapproved changes from being included in the reported cost or resource usage;
      uu

       Informing appropriate stakeholders of all approved changes and associated cost; and
      uu

       Bringing expected cost overruns within acceptable limits.

7.4.2.2 DATA ANALYSIS

  Data analysis techniques that can be used to control costs include but are not limited to:
   Earned value analysis (EVA). Earned value analysis compares the performance measurement baseline to the
  uu
      actual schedule and cost performance. EVM integrates the scope baseline with the cost baseline and schedule
      baseline to form the performance measurement baseline. EVM develops and monitors three key dimensions for
      each work package and control account:
      nuPlanned    value. Planned value (PV) is the authorized budget assigned to scheduled work. It is the authorized
         budget planned for the work to be accomplished for an activity or work breakdown structure (WBS) component,
         not including management reserve. This budget is allocated by phase over the life of the project, but at a given
         point in time, planned value defines the physical work that should have been accomplished. The total of the
         PV is sometimes referred to as the performance measurement baseline (PMB). The total planned value for the
         project is also known as budget at completion (BAC).
      nuEarned value. Earned value (EV) is a measure of work performed expressed in terms of the budget authorized
         for that work. It is the budget associated with the authorized work that has been completed. The EV being
         measured needs to be related to the PMB, and the EV measured cannot be greater than the authorized
         PV budget for a component. The EV is often used to calculate the percent complete of a project. Progress
         measurement criteria should be established for each WBS component to measure work in progress. Project
         managers monitor EV, both incrementally to determine current status and cumulatively to determine the long-
         term performance trends.
      nuActual   cost. Actual cost (AC) is the realized cost incurred for the work performed on an activity during a
         specific time period. It is the total cost incurred in accomplishing the work that the EV measured. The AC
         needs to correspond in definition to what was budgeted in the PV and measured in the EV (e.g., direct hours
         only, direct costs only, or all costs including indirect costs). The AC will have no upper limit; whatever is spent
         to achieve the EV will be measured.




                                                                                                                       261
   Variance analysis. Described in Section 4.5.2.2. Variance analysis, as used in EVM, is the explanation (cause,
  uu
      impact, and corrective actions) for cost (CV = EV - AC), schedule (SV = EV - PV), and variance at completion
      (VAC = BAC - EAC) variances. Cost and schedule variances are the most frequently analyzed measurements.
      For projects not using formal earned value analysis, similar variance analyses can be performed by comparing
      planned cost against actual cost to identify variances between the cost baseline and actual project performance.
      Further analysis can be performed to determine the cause and degree of variance relative to the schedule
      baseline and any corrective or preventive actions needed. Cost performance measurements are used to assess
      the magnitude of variation to the original cost baseline. An important aspect of project cost control includes
      determining the cause and degree of variance relative to the cost baseline (see Section 7.3.3.1) and deciding
      whether corrective or preventive action is required. The percentage range of acceptable variances will tend to
      decrease as more work is accomplished. Examples of variance analysis include but are not limited to:
      nuSchedule variance. Schedule variance (SV) is a measure of schedule performance expressed as the difference
         between the earned value and the planned value. It is the amount by which the project is ahead or behind
         the planned delivery date, at a given point in time. It is a measure of schedule performance on a project. It
         is equal to the earned value (EV) minus the planned value (PV). The EVA schedule variance is a useful metric
         in that it can indicate when a project is falling behind or is ahead of its baseline schedule. The EVA schedule
         variance will ultimately equal zero when the project is completed because all of the planned values will have
         been earned. Schedule variance is best used in conjunction with critical path method (CPM) scheduling and
         risk management. Equation: SV = EV - PV.
      nuCost variance. Cost variance (CV) is the amount of budget deficit or surplus at a given point in time, expressed
         as the difference between earned value and the actual cost. It is a measure of cost performance on a project.
         It is equal to the earned value (EV) minus the actual cost (AC). The cost variance at the end of the project will
         be the difference between the budget at completion (BAC) and the actual amount spent. The CV is particularly
         critical because it indicates the relationship of physical performance to the costs spent. Negative CV is often
         difficult for the project to recover. Equation: CV = EV - AC.




                                                                                                           Part 1 - Guide
262
   nuSchedule    performance index. The schedule performance index (SPI) is a measure of schedule efficiency
      expressed as the ratio of earned value to planned value. It measures how efficiently the project team is
      accomplishing the work. It is sometimes used in conjunction with the cost performance index (CPI) to forecast
      the final project completion estimates. An SPI value less than 1.0 indicates less work was completed than
      was planned. An SPI greater than 1.0 indicates that more work was completed than was planned. Since the
      SPI measures all project work, the performance on the critical path also needs to be analyzed to determine
      whether the project will finish ahead of or behind its planned finish date. The SPI is equal to the ratio of the
      EV to the PV. Equation: SPI = EV/PV.
   nuCost  performance index. The cost performance index (CPI) is a measure of the cost efficiency of budgeted
      resources, expressed as a ratio of earned value to actual cost. It is considered the most critical EVA metric
      and measures the cost efficiency for the work completed. A CPI value of less than 1.0 indicates a cost overrun
      for work completed. A CPI value greater than 1.0 indicates a cost underrun of performance to date. The CPI is
      equal to the ratio of the EV to the AC. Equation: CPI = EV/AC.
 Trend analysis. Described in Section 4.5.2.2. Trend analysis examines project performance over time to determine
uu
   if performance is improving or deteriorating. Graphical analysis techniques are valuable for understanding
   performance to date and for comparison to future performance goals in the form of BAC versus estimate at
   completion (EAC) and completion dates. Examples of the trend analysis techniques include but are not limited to:
   nuCharts.  In earned value analysis, three parameters of planned value, earned value, and actual cost can be
      monitored and reported on both a period-by-period basis (typically weekly or monthly) and on a cumulative
      basis. Figure 7-12 uses S-curves to display EV data for a project that is performing over budget and behind
      the schedule.

      nuForecasting. As the project progresses, the project team may develop a forecast for the estimate at completion
         (EAC) that may differ from the budget at completion (BAC) based on the project performance. If it becomes
         obvious that the BAC is no longer viable, the project manager should consider the forecasted EAC. Forecasting
         the EAC involves making projections of conditions and events in the project's future based on current
         performance information and other knowledge available at the time of the forecast. Forecasts are generated,
         updated, and reissued based on work performance data (Section 4.3.3.2) that is provided as the project is
         executed. The work performance information covers the project's past performance and any information that
         could impact the project in the future.
         EACs are typically based on the actual costs incurred for work completed, plus an estimate to complete (ETC)
         the remaining work. It is incumbent on the project team to predict what it may encounter to perform the ETC,
         based on its experience to date. Earned value analysis works well in conjunction with manual forecasts of the
         required EAC costs. The most common EAC forecasting approach is a manual, bottom-up summation by the
         project manager and project team.
         The project manager's bottom-up EAC method builds upon the actual costs and experience incurred for
         the work completed, and requires a new estimate to complete the remaining project work. Equation: EAC =
         AC + Bottom-up ETC.




                                                                                                                   Part 1 - Guide
264
      The project manager's manual EAC is quickly compared with a range of calculated EACs representing
      various risk scenarios. When calculating EAC values, the cumulative CPI and SPI values are typically
      used. While EVM data quickly provide many statistical EACs, only three of the more common methods are
      described as follows:
      muEAC    forecast for ETC work performed at the budgeted rate. This EAC method accepts the actual project
          performance to date (whether favorable or unfavorable) as represented by the actual costs, and predicts
          that all future ETC work will be accomplished at the budgeted rate. When actual performance is unfavorable,
          the assumption that future performance will improve should be accepted only when supported by project
          risk analysis. Equation: EAC = AC + (BAC - EV).
      muEAC    forecast for ETC work performed at the present CPI. This method assumes that what the project has
          experienced to date can be expected to continue in the future. The ETC work is assumed to be performed
          at the same cumulative cost performance index (CPI) as that incurred by the project to date. Equation:
          EAC = BAC / CPI.
      muEAC    forecast for ETC work considering both SPI and CPI factors. In this forecast, the ETC work will be
          performed at an efficiency rate that considers both the cost and schedule performance indices. This
          method is most useful when the project schedule is a factor impacting the ETC effort. Variations of this
          method weight the CPI and SPI at different values (e.g., 80/20, 50/50, or some other ratio) according to
          the project manager's judgment. Equation: EAC = AC + [(BAC - EV) / (CPI x SPI)].
 Reserve analysis. Described in Section 7.2.2.6. During cost control, reserve analysis is used to monitor the
uu
   status of contingency and management reserves for the project to determine if these reserves are still needed or
   if additional reserves need to be requested. As work on the project progresses, these reserves may be used as
   planned to cover the cost of risk responses or other contingencies. Conversely, when opportunities are captured
   and resulting in cost savings, funds may be added to the contingency amount, or taken from the project as
   margin/profit.
   If the identified risks do not occur, the unused contingency reserves may be removed from the project budget to
   free up resources for other projects or operations. Additional risk analysis during the project may reveal a need
   to request that additional reserves be added to the project budget.




                                                                                                                265
   7.4.2.3 TO-COMPLETE PERFORMANCE INDEX

      The to-complete performance index (TCPI) is a measure of the cost performance that is required to be achieved with
   the remaining resources in order to meet a specified management goal, expressed as the ratio of the cost to finish
   the outstanding work to the remaining budget. TCPI is the calculated cost performance index that is achieved on the
   remaining work to meet a specified management goal, such as the BAC or the EAC. If it becomes obvious that the BAC
   is no longer viable, the project manager should consider the forecasted EAC. Once approved, the EAC may replace the
   BAC in the TCPI calculation. The equation for the TCPI based on the BAC: (BAC - EV) / (BAC - AC).
     The TCPI is conceptually displayed in Figure 7-13. The equation for the TCPI is shown in the lower left as the work
   remaining (defined as the BAC minus the EV) divided by the funds remaining (which can be either the BAC minus the
   AC, or the EAC minus the AC).
      If the cumulative CPI falls below the baseline (as shown in Figure 7-13), all future work of the project will need
   to be performed immediately in the range of the TCPI (BAC) (as reflected in the top line of Figure 7-13) to stay
   within the authorized BAC. Whether this level of performance is achievable is a judgment call based on a number of
   considerations, including risk, time remaining in the project, and technical performance. This level of performance
   is displayed as the TCPI (EAC) line. The equation for the TCPI is based on the EAC: (BAC - EV) / (EAC - AC). The EVM
   formulas are provided in Table 7-1.

7.4.2.4 PROJECT MANAGEMENT INFORMATION SYSTEM (PMIS)

   Described in Section 4.3.2.2. Project management information systems are often used to monitor the three EVM
dimensions (PV, EV, and AC), to display graphical trends, and to forecast a range of possible final project results.



7.4.3 CONTROL COSTS: OUTPUTS

7.4.3.1 WORK PERFORMANCE INFORMATION

   Described in Section 4.5.1.3. Work performance information includes information on how the project work is
performing compared to the cost baseline. Variances in the work performed and the cost of the work are evaluated at
the work package level and control account level. For projects using earned value analysis, CV, CPI, EAC, VAC, and TCPI
are documented for inclusion in work performance reports (Section 4.5.3.1).




                                                                                                        Part 1 - Guide

   7.4.3.2 COST FORECASTS

     Either a calculated EAC value or a bottom-up EAC value is documented and communicated to stakeholders.

   7.4.3.3 CHANGE REQUESTS

     Described in Section 4.3.3.4. Analysis of project performance may result in a change request to the cost and
   schedule baselines or other components of the project management plan. Change requests are processed for review
   and disposition through the Perform Integrated Change Control process (Section 4.6).

   7.4.3.4 PROJECT MANAGEMENT PLAN UPDATES

      Any change to the project management plan goes through the organization's change control process via a change
   request. Components that may require a change request for the project management plan include but are not limited to:
       Cost management plan. Described in Section 7.1.3.1. Changes to the cost management plan, such as changes
      uu
         to control thresholds or specified levels of accuracy required in managing the project's cost, are incorporated in
         response to feedback from relevant stakeholders.
       Cost baseline. Described in Section 7.3.3.1. Changes to the cost baseline are incorporated in response to
      uu
         approved changes in scope, resources, or cost estimates. In some cases, cost variances can be so severe that a
         revised cost baseline is needed to provide a realistic basis for performance measurement.
       Performance measurement baseline. Described in Section 4.2.3.1. Changes to the performance measurement
      uu
         baseline are incorporated in response to approved changes in scope, schedule performance, or cost estimates.
         In some cases, the performance variances can be so severe that a change request is put forth to revise the
         performance measurement baseline to provide a realistic basis for performance measurement.

7.4.3.5 PROJECT DOCUMENTS UPDATES

  Project documents that may be updated as a result of carrying out this process include but are not limited to:
   Assumption log. Described in Section 4.1.3.2. Cost performance may indicate the need to revise assumptions
  uu
      on resource productivity and other factors influencing cost performance.
   Basis of estimates. Described in Section 6.4.3.2. Cost performance may indicate the need to revisit the original
  uu
      basis of estimates.
   Cost estimates. Described in Section 7.2.3.1. Cost estimates may need to be updated to reflect the actual cost
  uu
      efficiency for the project.
   Lessons learned register. Described in Section 4.4.3.1. The lessons learned register can be updated with
  uu
      techniques that were effective in maintaining the budget, variance analysis, earned value analysis, forecasting,
      and corrective actions that were used to respond to cost variances.
   Risk register. Described in Section 11.2.3.1. The risk register may be updated if the cost variances have crossed,
  uu
      or are likely to cross, the cost threshold.

    PROJE CT Q UA LITY MANA GEM ENT
      Project Quality Management includes the processes for incorporating the organization's quality policy regarding
   planning, managing, and controlling project and product quality requirements in order to meet stakeholders' objectives.
   Project Quality Management also supports continuous process improvement activities as undertaken on behalf of the
   performing organization.
     The Project Quality Management processes are:
      8.1 Plan Quality Management--The process of identifying quality requirements and/or standards for the project
   and its deliverables, and documenting how the project will demonstrate compliance with quality requirements and/
   or standards.
      8.2 Manage Quality--The process of translating the quality management plan into executable quality activities that
   incorporate the organization's quality policies into the project.
      8.3 Control Quality--The process of monitoring and recording the results of executing the quality management
   activities to assess performance and ensure the project outputs are complete, correct, and meet customer expectations.
      Figure 8-1 provides an overview of the Project Quality Management processes. The Project Quality Management
   processes are presented as discrete processes with defined interfaces while, in practice, they overlap and interact in
   ways that cannot be completely detailed in the PMBOK(R) Guide. In addition, these quality processes may differ within
   industries and companies.

   Figure 8-2 provides an overview of the major inputs and outputs of the Project Quality Management processes
and the interrelations of these processes in the Project Quality Management Knowledge Area. The Plan Quality
Management process is concerned with the quality that the work needs to have. Manage Quality is concerned with
managing the quality processes throughout the project. During the Manage Quality process, quality requirements
identified during the Plan Quality Management process are turned into test and evaluation instruments, which are
then applied during the Control Quality process to verify these quality requirements are met by the project. Control
Quality is concerned with comparing the work results with the quality requirements to ensure the result is acceptable.
There are two outputs specific to the Project Quality Management Knowledge Area that are used by other Knowledge
Areas: verified deliverables and quality reports.

   KEY CONCEPTS FOR PROJECT QUALITY MANAGEMENT

      Project Quality Management addresses the management of the project and the deliverables of the project. It
   applies to all projects, regardless of the nature of their deliverables. Quality measures and techniques are specific
   to the type of deliverables being produced by the project. For example, the project quality management of software
   deliverables may use different approaches and measures from those used when building a nuclear power plant. In
   either case, failure to meet the quality requirements can have serious negative consequences for any or all of the
   project's stakeholders. For example:





       Meeting customer requirements by overworking the project team may result in decreased profits and increased
      uu





         levels of overall project risks, employee attrition, errors, or rework.
       Meeting project schedule objectives by rushing planned quality inspections may result in undetected errors,
      uu
         decreased profits, and increased post-implementation risks.




                                                                                                                                  273
   Quality and grade are not the same concepts. Quality as a delivered performance or result is "the degree to which a
set of inherent characteristics fulfill requirements" (ISO 9000 [18].). Grade as a design intent is a category assigned to
deliverables having the same functional use but different technical characteristics. The project manager and the project
management team are responsible for managing the trade-offs associated with delivering the required levels of both
quality and grade. While a quality level that fails to meet quality requirements is always a problem, a low-grade product
may not be a problem. For example:
    It may not be a problem if a suitable low-grade product (one with a limited number of features) is of high quality
   uu
       (no obvious defects). In this example, the product would be appropriate for its general purpose of use.
    It may be a problem if a high-grade product (one with numerous features) is of low quality (many defects). In
   uu
       essence, a high-grade feature set would prove ineffective and/or inefficient due to low quality.
   Prevention is preferred over inspection. It is better to design quality into deliverables, rather than to find quality issues
during inspection. The cost of preventing mistakes is generally much less than the cost of correcting mistakes when
they are found by inspection or during usage.
    Depending on the project and the industry area, the project team may need a working knowledge of statistical control
processes to evaluate data contained in the Control Quality outputs. The team should know the differences between the
following pairs of terms:
    Prevention (keeping errors out of the process) and inspection (keeping errors out of the hands of the customer);
   uu

    Attribute sampling (the result either conforms or does not conform) and variable sampling (the result is rated on
   uu
       a continuous scale that measures the degree of conformity); and
    Tolerances (specified range of acceptable results) and control limits (that identify the boundaries of common
   uu
       variation in a statistically stable process or process performance).
   The cost of quality (COQ) includes all costs incurred over the life of the product by investment in preventing
nonconformance to requirements, appraising the product or service for conformance to requirements, and failing to
meet requirements (rework). Failure costs are often categorized into internal (found by the project team) and external
(found by the customer). Failure costs are also called the cost of poor quality. Section 8.1.2.3 provides some examples
to consider in each area. Organizations choose to invest in defect prevention because of the benefits over the life of the
product. Because projects are temporary, decisions about the COQ over a product's life cycle are often the concern of
program management, portfolio management, the PMO, or operations.




                                                                                                                Part 1 - Guide
274
     There are five levels of increasingly effective quality management as follows:
       Usually, the most expensive approach is to let the customer find the defects. This approach can lead to warranty
      uu
         issues, recalls, loss of reputation, and rework costs.
       Detect and correct the defects before the deliverables are sent to the customer as part of the quality control
      uu
         process. The control quality process has related costs, which are mainly the appraisal costs and internal
         failure costs.
       Use quality assurance to examine and correct the process itself and not just special defects.
      uu

       Incorporate quality into the planning and designing of the project and product.
      uu

       Create a culture throughout the organization that is aware and committed to quality in processes and products.
      uu


   TRENDS AND EMERGING PRACTICES IN PROJECT QUALITY MANAGEMENT

      Modern quality management approaches seek to minimize variation and to deliver results that meet defined
   stakeholder requirements. Trends in Project Quality Management include but are not limited to:
       Customer satisfaction. Understand, evaluate, define, and manage requirements so that customer expectations
      uu
         are met. This requires a combination of conformance to requirements (to ensure the project produces what it
         was created to produce) and fitness for use (the product or service needs to satisfy the real needs). In agile
         environments, stakeholder engagement with the team ensures customer satisfaction is maintained throughout
         the project.
       Continual improvement. The plan-do-check-act (PDCA) cycle is the basis for quality improvement as defined by
      uu
         Shewhart and modified by Deming. In addition, quality improvement initiatives such as total quality management
         (TQM), Six Sigma, and Lean Six Sigma may improve both the quality of project management, as well as the
         quality of the end product, service, or result.
       Management responsibility. Success requires the participation of all members of the project team.
      uu
         Management retains, within its responsibility for quality, a related responsibility to provide suitable resources
         at adequate capacities.
       Mutually beneficial partnership with suppliers. An organization and its suppliers are interdependent.
      uu
         Relationships based on partnership and cooperation with the supplier are more beneficial to the organization and





         to the suppliers than traditional supplier management. The organization should prefer long-term relationships





         over short-term gains. A mutually beneficial relationship enhances the ability for both the organization and the
         suppliers to create value for each other, enhances the joint responses to customer needs and expectations, and
         optimizes costs and resources.




                                                                                                                      275
TAILORING CONSIDERATIONS

   Each project is unique; therefore, the project manager will need to tailor the way Project Quality Management
processes are applied. Considerations for tailoring include but are not limited to:
    Policy compliance and auditing. What quality policies and procedures exist in the organization? What quality
   uu
       tools, techniques, and templates are used in the organization?
    Standards and regulatory compliance. Are there any specific quality standards in the industry that need to be
   uu
       applied? Are there any specific governmental, legal, or regulatory constraints that need to be taken into consideration?
    Continuous improvement. How will quality improvement be managed in the project? Is it managed at the
   uu
       organizational level or at the level of each project?
    Stakeholder engagement. Is there a collaborative environment for stakeholders and suppliers?
   uu


CONSIDERATIONS FOR AGILE/ADAPTIVE ENVIRONMENTS

   In order to navigate changes, agile methods call for frequent quality and review steps built in throughout the project
rather than toward the end of the project.
   Recurring retrospectives regularly check on the effectiveness of the quality processes. They look for the root cause of
issues then suggest trials of new approaches to improve quality. Subsequent retrospectives evaluate any trial processes
to determine if they are working and should be continued or new adjusting or should be dropped from use.
   In order to facilitate frequent, incremental delivery, agile methods focus on small batches of work, incorporating as
many elements of project deliverables as possible. Small batch systems aim to uncover inconsistencies and quality
issues earlier in the project life cycle when the overall costs of change are lower.




                                                                                                               Part 1 - Guide

   8.1 PLAN QUALITY MANAGEMENT
      Plan Quality Management is the process of identifying quality requirements and/or standards for the project and its
   deliverables, and documenting how the project will demonstrate compliance with quality requirements and/or standards.
   The key benefit of this process is that it provides guidance and direction on how quality will be managed and verified
   throughout the project. This process is performed once or at predefined points in the project. The inputs and outputs of
   this process are depicted in Figure 8.3. Figure 8.4 depicts the data flow diagram for the process.

    Quality planning should be performed in parallel with the other planning processes. For example, changes proposed
in the deliverables in order to meet identified quality standards may require cost or schedule adjustments and a detailed
risk analysis of the impact to plans.
   The quality planning techniques discussed here are those used most frequently on projects. There are many others
that may be useful on certain projects or in specific application areas.

   8.1.1 PLAN QUALITY MANAGEMENT: INPUTS

   8.1.1.1 PROJECT CHARTER

       Described in Section 4.1.3.1. The project charter provides the high-level project description and product characteristics.
   It also contains the project approval requirements, measurable project objectives, and related success criteria that will
   influence the quality management of the project.

   8.1.1.2 PROJECT MANAGEMENT PLAN

     Described in Section 4.2.3.1. Project management plan components include but are not limited to:
       Requirements management plan. Described in Section 5.1.3.2. The requirements management plan provides
      uu
          the approach for identifying, analyzing, and managing the requirements that the quality management plan and
          quality metrics will reference.
       Risk management plan. Described in Section 11.1.3.1. The risk management plan provides the approach for
      uu
          identifying, analyzing, and monitoring risks. The information in the risk management plan and quality management
          plan work together to successfully deliver product and project success.
       Stakeholder engagement plan. Described in Section 13.2.3.1. The stakeholder engagement plan provides
      uu
          the method for documenting the stakeholders' needs and expectations that provide the foundation for quality
          management.
       Scope baseline. Described in Section 5.4.3.1. The WBS along with the deliverables documented in the project
      uu
          scope statement are considered while determining which quality standards and objectives are suitable for the
          project, and which project deliverables and processes will be subjected to quality review. The scope statement
          includes the acceptance criteria for the deliverables. The definition of acceptance criteria may significantly
          increase or decrease quality costs and, therefore, project costs. Satisfying all acceptance criteria implies the
          needs of the stakeholders have been met.






                                                                                                                            279

   uu
      regarding quality requirements and standard compliance.
    Requirements documentation. Described in Section 5.2.3.1. Requirements documentation captures the
   uu
      requirements that the project and product should attain to meet stakeholder expectations. The components
      of the requirements documentation include but are not limited to project and product quality requirements.
      Requirements are used by the project team to help plan how quality control will be implemented on the project.
    Requirements traceability matrix. Described in Section 5.2.3.2. The requirements traceability matrix links
   uu
      product requirements to deliverables and helps to ensure each requirement in the requirements documentation
      is tested. The matrix provides an overview of the tests required to verify the requirements.
    Risk register. Described in Section 11.2.3.1. The risk register contains information on threats and opportunities
   uu
      that may impact quality requirements.
    Stakeholder register. Described in Section 13.1.3.1. The stakeholder register helps to identify stakeholders who
   uu
      have a particular interest in or impact on quality, with the emphasis on the customer and project sponsor needs
      and expectations.

      uu

       Historical databases and lessons learned repository.
      uu



   8.1.2 PLAN QUALITY MANAGEMENT: TOOLS AND TECHNIQUES

   8.1.2.1 EXPERT JUDGMENT

      Described in Section 4.1.2.1. Expertise should be considered from individuals or groups with specialized knowledge
   or training in the following topics:
       Quality assurance,
      uu

       Quality control,
      uu

       Quality measurements,
      uu

       Quality improvements, and
      uu

       Quality systems.
      uu


   8.1.2.2 DATA GATHERING

     Data-gathering techniques that can be used for this process include but are not limited to:
       Benchmarking. Benchmarking involves comparing actual or planned project practices or the project's quality
      uu
         standards to those of comparable projects to identify best practices, generate ideas for improvement, and provide
         a basis for measuring performance. Benchmarked projects may exist within the performing organization or
         outside of it, or can be within the same application area or other application area. Benchmarking allows for





         analogies from projects in a different application area or different industries to be made.





       Brainstorming. Described in Section 4.1.2.2. Brainstorming can be used to gather data creatively from a
      uu
         group of team members or subject matter experts to develop the quality management plan that best fits
         the upcoming project.




                                                                                                                      281
   Interviews. Described in Section 5.2.2.2. Project and product quality needs and expectations, implicit and
  uu
      explicit, formal and informal, can be identified by interviewing experienced project participants, stakeholders,
      and subject matter experts. Interviews should be conducted in an environment of trust and confidentiality to
      encourage honest and unbiased contributions.

8.1.2.3 DATA ANALYSIS

  Data analysis techniques that can be used for this process include but are not limited to:
   Cost-benefit analysis. A cost-benefit analysis is a financial analysis tool used to estimate the strengths and
  uu
      weaknesses of alternatives in order to determine the best alternative in terms of benefits provided. A cost-
      benefit analysis will help the project manager determine if the planned quality activities are cost effective. The
      primary benefits of meeting quality requirements include less rework, higher productivity, lower costs, increased
      stakeholder satisfaction, and increased profitability. A cost-benefit analysis for each quality activity compares the
      cost of the quality step to the expected benefit.
   Cost of quality. The cost of quality (COQ) associated with a project consists of one or more of the following costs
  uu
      (Figure 8-5 lists examples for each cost group):
      nuPrevention   costs. Costs related to the prevention of poor quality in the products, deliverables, or services of
         the specific project.
      nuAppraisal  costs. Costs related to evaluating, measuring, auditing, and testing the products, deliverables, or
         services of the specific project.
      nuFailure costs (internal/external). Costs related to nonconformance of the products, deliverables, or services to
         the needs or expectations of the stakeholders.
      The optimal COQ is one that reflects the appropriate balance for investing in the cost of prevention and appraisal
      to avoid failure costs. Models show that there is an optimal quality cost for projects, where investing in additional
      prevention/appraisal costs is neither beneficial nor cost effective.




                                                                                                            Part 1 - Guide

                                                                          the project because of failures
                       Money spent during the project
                       to avoid failures

   8.1.2.4 DECISION MAKING

      A decision-making technique that can be used for this process includes but is not limited to multicriteria decision
   analysis. Multicriteria decision analysis tools (e.g., prioritization matrix) can be used to identify the key issues and
   suitable alternatives to be prioritized as a set of decisions for implementation. Criteria are prioritized and weighted
   before being applied to all available alternatives to obtain a mathematical score for each alternative. The alternatives
   are then ranked by score. As used in this process, it can help prioritize quality metrics.






                                                                                                                       283
8.1.2.5 DATA REPRESENTATION

  Data representation techniques that can be used for this process include but are not limited to:
   Flowcharts. Flowcharts are also referred to as process maps because they display the sequence of steps
  uu
      and the branching possibilities that exist for a process that transforms one or more inputs into one or more
      outputs. Flowcharts show the activities, decision points, branching loops, parallel paths, and the overall order
      of processing by mapping the operational details of procedures that exist within a horizontal value chain. One
      version of a value chain, known as a SIPOC (suppliers, inputs, process, outputs, and customers) model, is shown
      in Figure 8-6. Flowcharts may prove useful in understanding and estimating the cost of quality for a process.
      Information is obtained by using the workflow branching logic and associated relative frequencies to estimate
      the expected monetary value for the conformance and nonconformance work required to deliver the expected
      conforming output. When flowcharts are used to represent the steps in a process, they are sometimes called
      process flows or process flow diagrams and they can be used for process improvement as well as identifying
      where quality defects can occur or where to incorporate quality checks.
   Logical data model. Logical data models are a visual representation of an organization's data, described in
  uu
      business language and independent of any specific technology. The logical data model can be used to identify
      where data integrity or other quality issues can arise.
   Matrix diagrams. Matrix diagrams help find the strength of relationships among different factors, causes, and
  uu
      objectives that exist between the rows and columns that form the matrix. Depending on how many factors
      may be compared, the project manager can use different shapes of matrix diagrams; for example, L, T, Y, X, C,
      and roof-shaped. In this process they facilitate identifying the key quality metrics that are important for the
      success of the project.
   Mind mapping. Described in Section 5.2.2.3. Mind mapping is a diagrammatic method used to visually
  uu
      organizing information. A mind map in quality is often created around a single quality concept, drawn as an
      image in the center of a blank landscape page, to which associated representations of ideas such as images,
      words, and parts of words are added. The mind-mapping technique may help in the rapid gathering of project
      quality requirements, constraints, dependencies, and relationships.

   8.1.2.6 TEST AND INSPECTION PLANNING

      During the planning phase, the project manager and the project team determine how to test or inspect the product,
   deliverable, or service to meet the stakeholders' needs and expectations, as well as how to meet the goal for the
   product's performance and reliability. The tests and inspections are industry dependent and can include, for example,
   alpha and beta tests in software projects, strength tests in construction projects, inspection in manufacturing, and field





   tests and nondestructive tests in engineering.





                                                                                                                                                     285
8.1.2.7 MEETINGS

   Project teams may hold planning meetings to develop the quality management plan. Attendees can include the
project manager, the project sponsor, selected project team members, selected stakeholders, anyone with responsibility
for project quality management activities, and others as needed.



8.1.3 PLAN QUALITY MANAGEMENT: OUTPUTS

8.1.3.1 QUALITY MANAGEMENT PLAN

   The quality management plan is a component of the project management plan that describes how applicable
policies, procedures, and guidelines will be implemented to achieve the quality objectives. It describes the activities
and resources necessary for the project management team to achieve the quality objectives set for the project.
The quality management plan may be formal or informal, detailed, or broadly framed. The style and detail of the
quality management plan are determined by the requirements of the project. The quality management plan should
be reviewed early in the project to ensure that decisions are based on accurate information. The benefits of this
review can include a sharper focus on the project's value proposition, reductions in costs, and less frequent schedule
overruns that are caused by rework.
  The quality management plan may include but is not limited to the following components:
    Quality standards that will be used by the project;
   uu

    Quality objectives of the project;
   uu

    Quality roles and responsibilities;
   uu

    Project deliverables and processes subject to quality review;
   uu

    Quality control and quality management activities planned for the project;
   uu

    Quality tools that will be used for the project; and
   uu

    Major procedures relevant for the project, such as dealing with nonconformance, corrective actions procedures,
   uu
       and continuous improvement procedures.




                                                                                                        Part 1 - Guide
286
8.1.3.2 QUALITY METRICS

   A quality metric specifically describes a project or product attribute and how the Control Quality process will
verify compliance to it. Some examples of quality metrics include percentage of tasks completed on time, cost
performance measured by CPI, failure rate, number of defects identified per day, total downtime per month, errors
found per line of code, customer satisfaction scores, and percentage of requirements covered by the test plan as
a measure of test coverage.

8.1.3.3 PROJECT MANAGEMENT PLAN UPDATES

   Any change to the project management plan goes through the organization's change control process via a change
request. Components that may require a change request for the project management plan include but are not limited to:
    Risk management plan. Described in Section 11.1.3.1. Decisions on the quality management approach may
   uu
      require changes to the agreed-upon approach to managing risk on the project, and these will be recorded in the
      risk management plan.
    Scope baseline. Described in Section 5.4.3.1. The scope baseline may change as a result of this process if
   uu
      specific quality management activities need to be added. The WBS dictionary also records quality requirements,
      which may need updating.

8.1.3.4 PROJECT DOCUMENTS UPDATES

  Project documents that may be updated as a result of carrying out this process include but are not limited to:

8.2 MANAGE QUALITY
   Manage Quality is the process of translating the quality management plan into executable quality activities that
incorporate the organization's quality policies into the project. The key benefits of this process are that it increases
the probability of meeting the quality objectives as well as identifying ineffective processes and causes of poor quality.
Manage Quality uses the data and results from the control quality process to reflect the overall quality status of the
project to the stakeholders. This process is performed throughout the project.
   The inputs, tools and techniques, and outputs of this process are depicted in Figure 8-7. Figure 8-8 depicts the data
flow diagram of the process.

      Manage Quality is sometimes called quality assurance, although Manage Quality has a broader definition than quality
   assurance as it is used in nonproject work. In project management, the focus of quality assurance is on the processes
   used in the project. Quality assurance is about using project processes effectively. It involves following and meeting
   standards to assure stakeholders that the final product will meet their needs, expectations, and requirements. Manage
   Quality includes all the quality assurance activities, and is also concerned with the product design aspects and process
   improvements. Manage Quality work will fall under the conformance work category in the cost of quality framework.






                                                                                                                                             289
   The Manage Quality process implements a set of planned and systematic acts and processes defined within the
project's quality management plan that helps to:
    Design an optimal and mature product by implementing specific design guidelines that address specific aspects
   uu
       of the product,
    Build confidence that a future output will be completed in a manner that meets the specified requirements and
   uu
       expectations through quality assurance tools and techniques such as quality audits and failure analysis,
    Confirm that the quality processes are used and that their use meets the quality objectives of the project, and
   uu

    Improve the efficiency and effectiveness of processes and activities to achieve better results and performance
   uu
       and enhance stakeholders' satisfaction.
   The project manager and project team may use the organization's quality assurance department, or other organizational
functions, to execute some of the Manage Quality activities such as failure analysis, design of experiments, and quality
improvement. Quality assurance departments usually have cross-organizational experience in using quality tools and
techniques and are a good resource for the project.
   Manage Quality is considered the work of everybody--the project manager, the project team, the project sponsor, the
management of the performing organization, and even the customer. All of these have roles in managing quality in the
project, though the roles differ in size and effort. The level of participation in the quality management effort may differ
between industries and project management styles. In agile projects, quality management is performed by all team
members throughout the project, but in traditional projects, quality management is often the responsibility of specific
team members.



8.2.1 MANAGE QUALITY: INPUTS

8.2.1.1 PROJECT MANAGEMENT PLAN

  Described in Section 4.2.3.1. Project management plan components include but are not limited to the quality
management plan. Described in Section 8.1.3.1, the quality management plan defines the acceptable level of project
and product quality and describes how to ensure this level of quality in its deliverables and processes. The quality
management plan also describes what to do with nonconforming products and what corrective action to implement.




                                                                                                            Part 1 - Guide
290
8.2.1.2 PROJECT DOCUMENTS

  Project documents that can be considered as inputs for this process include but are not limited to:
   Lessons learned register. Described in Section 4.4.3.1. Lessons learned earlier in the project with regard to
  uu
      managing quality can be applied to later phases in the project to improve the efficiency and effectiveness of
      managing quality.
   Quality control measurements. Described in Section 8.3.3.1. Quality control measurements are used to analyze
  uu
      and evaluate the quality of the processes and deliverables of the project against the standards of the performing
      organization or the requirements specified. Quality control measurements can also compare the processes used
      to create the measurements and validate actual measurements to determine their level of correctness.
   Quality metrics. Described in Section 8.1.3.2. Quality metrics are verified as part of the Control Quality process.
  uu
      The Manage Quality process uses these quality metrics as a basis for the development of test scenarios for the
      project and its deliverables and as a basis for improvement initiatives.
   Risk report. Described in Section 11.2.3.2. Risk report is used in the Manage Quality process to identify sources
  uu
      of overall project risk and the most important drivers of overall risk exposure that can impact the quality objectives
      of the project.

8.2.1.3 ORGANIZATIONAL PROCESS ASSETS

  The organizational process assets that can influence the Manage Quality process include but are not limited to:
   Organizational quality management system that includes policies, procedures, and guidelines;
  uu

   Quality templates such as check sheets, traceability matrix, test plans, test documents, and others;
  uu

   Results from previous audits; and
  uu

   Lessons learned repository with information from similar projects.

8.2.2 MANAGE QUALITY: TOOLS AND TECHNIQUES

8.2.2.1 DATA GATHERING

   A data-gathering technique that can be used for this process includes but is not limited to checklists (see Section
11.2.2.2). A checklist is a structured tool, usually component-specific, used to verify that a set of required steps has
been performed or to check if a list of requirements has been satisfied. Based on the project's requirements and
practices, checklists may be simple or complex. Many organizations have standardized checklists available to ensure
consistency in frequently performed tasks. In some application areas, checklists are also available from professional
associations or commercial service providers. Quality checklists should incorporate the acceptance criteria included in
the scope baseline.

8.2.2.2 DATA ANALYSIS

  Data analysis techniques that can be used for this process include but are not limited to:
    Alternatives analysis. Described in Section 9.2.2.5. This technique is used to evaluate identified options in order
   uu
       to select which different quality options or approaches are most appropriate to use.
    Document analysis. Described in Section 5.2.2.3. The analysis of different documents produced as part of
   uu
       the output of project control processes, such as quality reports, test reports, performance reports, and variance
       analysis, can point to and focus on processes that may be out of control and may jeopardize meeting the
       specified requirements or stakeholders' expectations.
    Process analysis. Process analysis identifies opportunities for process improvements. This analysis also
   uu
       examines problems, constraints, and non-value-added activities that occur during a process.
    Root cause analysis (RCA). Root cause analysis is an analytical technique used to determine the basic underlying
   uu
       reason that causes a variance, defect, or risk. A root cause may underlie more than one variance, defect, or risk. It
       may also be used as a technique for identifying root causes of a problem and solving them. When all root causes
       for a problem are removed, the problem does not recur.




                                                                                                             Part 1 - Guide
292
8.2.2.3 DECISION MAKING

   A decision-making technique that can be used for this process includes but is not limited to multicriteria decision
analysis. Described in Section 8.1.2.4. Multicriteria decision making is used to evaluate several criteria when discussing
alternatives that impact project or product quality. Project decisions can include choosing among different implementation
scenarios or suppliers. Product decisions can include evaluating the life cycle cost, schedule, stakeholder satisfaction,
and risks associated with resolving product defects.

8.2.2.4 DATA REPRESENTATION

  Data representation techniques that can be used for this process include but are not limited to:
    Affinity diagrams. Described in Section 5.2.2.5. Affinity diagrams can organize potential causes of defects into
   uu
       groups showing areas that should be focused on the most.
    Cause-and-effect diagrams. Cause-and-effect diagrams are also known as fishbone diagrams, why-why
   uu
       diagrams, or Ishikawa diagrams. This type of diagram breaks down the causes of the problem statement identified
       into discrete branches, helping to identify the main or root cause of the problem. Figure 8-9 is an example of a
       cause-and-effect diagram.
    Flowcharts. Described in Section 8.1.2.5. Flowcharts show a series of steps that lead to a defect.
   uu

    Histograms. Histograms show a graphical representation of numerical data. Histograms can show the number
   uu
       of defects per deliverable, a ranking of the cause of defects, the number of times each process is noncompliant,
       or other representations of project or product defects.
    Matrix diagrams. Described in Section 8.1.2.5. The matrix diagram seeks to show the strength of relationships
   uu
       among factors, causes, and objectives that exist between the rows and columns that form the matrix.
    Scatter diagrams. A scatter diagram is a graph that shows the relationship between two variables. Scatter
   uu
       diagrams can demonstrate a relationship between any element of a process, environment, or activity on one axis
       and a quality defect on the other axis.

8.2.2.5 AUDITS

   An audit is a structured, independent process used to determine if project activities comply with organizational and
project policies, processes, and procedures. A quality audit is usually conducted by a team external to the project,
such as the organization's internal audit department, PMO, or by an auditor external to the organization. Quality audit
objectives may include but are not limited to:
    Identifying all good and best practices being implemented;
   uu

    Identifying all nonconformity, gaps, and shortcomings;
   uu

    Sharing good practices introduced or implemented in similar projects in the organization and/or industry;
   uu

    Proactively offering assistance in a positive manner to improve the implementation of processes to help raise
   uu
       team productivity; and
    Highlighting contributions of each audit in the lessons learned repository of the organization.
   uu




                                                                                                                         Part 1 - Guide
294
   The subsequent effort to correct any deficiencies should result in a reduced cost of quality and an increase in sponsor
or customer acceptance of the project's product. Quality audits may be scheduled or random, and may be conducted by
internal or external auditors.
  Quality audits can confirm the implementation of approved change requests including updates, corrective actions,
defect repairs, and preventive actions.

8.2.2.6 DESIGN FOR X

   Design for X (DfX) is a set of technical guidelines that may be applied during the design of a product for the optimization
of a specific aspect of the design. DfX can control or even improve the product's final characteristics. The X in DfX can
be different aspects of product development, such as reliability, deployment, assembly, manufacturing, cost, service,
usability, safety, and quality. Using the DfX may result in cost reduction, quality improvement, better performance, and
customer satisfaction.

8.2.2.7 PROBLEM SOLVING

   Problem solving entails finding solutions for issues or challenges. It can include gathering additional information,
critical thinking, creative, quantitative and/or logical approaches. Effective and systematic problem solving is a
fundamental element in quality assurance and quality improvement. Problems can arise as a result of the Control Quality
process or from quality audits and can be associated with a process or deliverable. Using a structured problem-solving
method will help eliminate the problem and develop a long-lasting solution. Problem-solving methods generally include
the following elements:
    Defining the problem,
   uu

    Identifying the root-cause,
   uu

    Generating possible solutions,
   uu

    Choosing the best solution,
   uu

    Implementing the solution, and
   uu

    Verifying solution effectiveness.

                                                                                                                         295
8.2.2.8 QUALITY IMPROVEMENT METHODS

   Quality improvements can occur based on findings and recommendations from quality control processes, the findings
of the quality audits, or problem solving in the Manage Quality process. Plan-do-check-act and Six Sigma are two of the
most common quality improvement tools used to analyze and evaluate opportunities for improvement.



8.2.3 MANAGE QUALITY: OUTPUTS

8.2.3.1 QUALITY REPORTS

   The quality reports can be graphical, numerical, or qualitative. The information provided can be used by other
processes and departments to take corrective actions in order to achieve the project quality expectations. The information
presented in the quality reports may include all quality management issues escalated by the team; recommendations for
process, project, and product improvements; corrective actions recommendations (including rework, defect/bugs repair,
100% inspection, and more); and the summary of findings from the Control Quality process.

8.2.3.2 TEST AND EVALUATION DOCUMENTS

   Test and evaluation documents can be created based on industry needs and the organization's templates. They are
inputs to the Control Quality process and are used to evaluate the achievement of quality objectives. These documents
may include dedicated checklists and detailed requirements traceability matrices as part of the document.

8.2.3.3 CHANGE REQUESTS

   Described in Section 4.3.3.4. If changes occur during the Manage Quality process that impact any of the components
of the project management plan, project documents, or project or product management processes, the project manager
should submit a change request and follow the Perform Integrated Change Control process as defined in Section 4.6.




                                                                                                           Part 1 - Guide
296
   8.2.3.4 PROJECT MANAGEMENT PLAN UPDATES

      Any change to the project management plan goes through the organization's change control process via a change
   request. Components that may require a change request for the project management plan include but are not limited to:
       Quality management plan. Described in Section 8.1.3.1. The agreed-upon approach to managing quality may
      uu
         need to be modified due to the actual results.
       Scope baseline. Described in Section 5.4.3.1. The scope baseline may change as a result of specific quality
      uu
         management activities.
       Schedule baseline. Described in Section 6.5.3.1. The schedule baseline may change as a result of specific
      uu
         quality management activities.
       Cost baseline. Described in Section 7.3.3.1. The cost baseline may change as a result of specific quality
      uu
         management activities.

   8.2.3.5 PROJECT DOCUMENTS UPDATES

     Project documents that may be updated as a result of carrying out this process include but are not limited to:
       Issue log. Described in Section 4.3.3.3. New issues raised as a result of this process are recorded in the
      uu
         issue log.
       Lessons learned register. Described in Section 4.4.3.1. The lessons learned register is updated with information
      uu
         on challenges encountered and how they could have been avoided as well as approaches that worked well for
         the managing quality.
       Risk register. Described in Section 11.2.3.1. New risks identified during this process are recorded in the risk
      uu
         register and managed using the risk management processes.






                                                                                                                      297
8.3 CONTROL QUALITY
   Control Quality is the process of monitoring and recording results of executing the quality management activities in
order to assess performance and ensure the project outputs are complete, correct, and meet customer expectations.
The key benefit of this process is verifying that project deliverables and work meet the requirements specified by key
stakeholders for final acceptance. The Control Quality process determines if the project outputs do what they were
intended to do. Those outputs need to comply with all applicable standards, requirements, regulations, and specifications.
This process is performed throughout the project.
  The inputs, tools and techniques, and outputs of this process are depicted in Figure 8-10. Figure 8-11 depicts the
data flow diagram of the process.

      The Control Quality process is performed to measure the completeness, compliance, and fitness for use of a product





   or service prior to user acceptance and final delivery. This is done by measuring all steps, attributes, and variables used





   to verify conformance or compliance to the specifications stated during the planning stage.
     Quality control should be performed throughout the project to formally demonstrate, with reliable data, that the
   sponsor's and/or customer's acceptance criteria have been met.




                                                                                                                                         299
   The level of effort to control quality and the degree of implementation may differ between industries and project
management styles; in pharmaceutical, health, transportation, and nuclear industries, for example, there may be stricter
quality control procedures compared to other industries, and the effort needed to meet the standards may be extensive.
For example, in agile projects, the Control Quality activities may be performed by all team members throughout the
project life cycle. In waterfall model-based projects, the quality control activities are performed at specific times, toward
the end of the project or phase, by specified team members.



8.3.1 CONTROL QUALITY: INPUTS

8.3.1.1 PROJECT MANAGEMENT PLAN

  Described in Section 4.2.3.1. Project management plan components include but are not limited to the quality
management plan. Described in Section 8.1.3.1, the quality management plan defines how quality control will be
performed within the project.

8.3.1.2 PROJECT DOCUMENTS

  Project documents that can be considered as inputs for this process include but are not limited to:
    Lessons learned register. Described in Section 4.4.3.1. Lessons learned earlier in the project can be applied to
   uu
       later phases in the project to improve quality control.
    Quality metrics. Described in Section 8.1.3.2. A quality metric specifically describes a project or product attribute
   uu
       and how the Control Quality process will verify compliance to it.

      structured manner.
   Check sheets. Check sheets are also known as tally sheets and are used to organize facts in a manner that will
  uu
      facilitate the effective collection of useful data about a potential quality problem. They are especially useful for
      gathering attributes data while performing inspections to identify defects; for example, data about the frequencies
      or consequences of defects collected. See Figure 8-12.

    Statistical sampling. Statistical sampling involves choosing part of a population of interest for inspection (for
   uu
       example, selecting 10 engineering drawings at random from a list of 75). The sample is taken to measure controls
       and verify quality. Sample frequency and sizes should be determined during the Plan Quality Management process.
    Questionnaires and Surveys. Surveys may be used to gather data about customer satisfaction after the
   uu
       deployment of the product or service. The cost regarding defects identified in the surveys may be considered
       external failure costs in the COQ model and can have extensive cost implications for the organization.

8.3.2.2 DATA ANALYSIS

  Data analysis techniques that can be used for this process include but are not limited to:
    Performance reviews. Performance reviews measure, compare, and analyze the quality metrics defined by the
   uu
       Plan Quality Management process against the actual results.
    Root cause analysis (RCA). Described in Section 8.2.2.2. Root cause analysis is used to identify the source
   uu
       of defects.

8.3.2.3 INSPECTION

    An inspection is the examination of a work product to determine if it conforms to documented standards. The results
of inspections generally include measurements and may be conducted at any level. The results of a single activity can be
inspected, or the final product of the project can be inspected. Inspections may be called reviews, peer reviews, audits,
or walkthroughs. In some application areas, these terms have narrow and specific meanings. Inspections also are used
to verify defect repairs.

8.3.2.4 TESTING/PRODUCT EVALUATIONS

   Testing is an organized and constructed investigation conducted to provide objective information about the quality
of the product or service under test in accordance with the project requirements. The intent of testing is to find errors,
defects, bugs, or other nonconformance problems in the product or service. The type, amount, and extent of tests
needed to evaluate each requirement are part of the project quality plan and depend on the nature of the project, time,
budget, and other constraints. Tests can be performed throughout the project, as different components of the project
become available, and at the end of the project on the final deliverables. Early testing helps identify nonconformance
problems and helps reduce the cost of fixing the nonconforming components.




                                                                                                                     303
   Different application areas require different tests. For example, software testing may include unit testing, integration
testing, black-box, white-box, interface testing, regression testing, Alpha testing, etc. In construction projects, testing
may include cement strength, concrete workability test, nondestructive tests at construction sites for testing the quality
of hardened concrete structures, and soil tests. In hardware development, testing may include environmental stress
screening, burn-in tests, system testing, and more.

8.3.2.5 DATA REPRESENTATION

  Data representation techniques that can be used for this process include but are not limited to:
    Cause-and-effect diagrams. Described in Section 8.2.2.4. Cause-and-effect diagrams are used to identify the
   uu
       possible effects of quality defects and errors.
    Control charts. Control charts are used to determine whether or not a process is stable or has predictable
   uu
       performance. Upper and lower specification limits are based on the requirements and reflect the maximum and
       minimum values allowed. Upper and lower control limits are different from specification limits. The control limits
       are determined using standard statistical calculations and principles to ultimately establish the natural capability
       for a stable process. The project manager and appropriate stakeholders may use the statistically calculated
       control limits to identify the points at which corrective action will be taken to prevent performance that remains
       outside the control limits. Control charts can be used to monitor various types of output variables. Although used
       most frequently to track repetitive activities required for producing manufactured lots, control charts may also be
       used to monitor cost and schedule variances, volume, frequency of scope changes, or other management results
       to help determine if the project management processes are in control.
    Histograms. Described in Section 8.2.2.4. Histograms can demonstrate the number of defects by source
   uu
       or by component.
    Scatter diagrams. Described in Section 8.2.2.4. Scatter diagrams can show the planned performance on one
   uu
       axis and the actual performance on the second axis.




                                                                                                            Part 1 - Guide

8.3.2.6 MEETINGS

  The following meetings may be used as part of the Control Quality process:
    Approved change requests review. All approved change requests should be reviewed to verify that they were
   uu
       implemented as approved. This review should also check that partial changes are completed and all parts have
       been properly implemented, tested, completed, and certified.
    Retrospectives/lesson learned. A meeting held by a project team to discuss:
   uu

       nuSuccessful elements in the project/phase,
       nuWhat could be improved,
       nuWhat to incorporate in the ongoing project and what in future projects, and
       nuWhat to add to the organization process assets.



8.3.3 CONTROL QUALITY: OUTPUTS

8.3.3.1 QUALITY CONTROL MEASUREMENTS

   Quality control measurements are the documented results of Control Quality activities. They should be captured in the
format that was specified in the quality management plan.

8.3.3.2 VERIFIED DELIVERABLES

   A goal of the Control Quality process is to determine the correctness of deliverables. The results of performing the
Control Quality process are verified deliverables that become an input to the Validate Scope process (Section 5.5) for
formalized acceptance. If there were any change requests or improvements related to the deliverables, they may be
changed, inspected, and reverified.

8.3.3.3 WORK PERFORMANCE INFORMATION

   Described in Section 4.5.1.3. Work performance information includes information on project requirements fulfillment,
causes for rejections, rework required, recommendations for corrective actions, lists of verified deliverables, status of
the quality metrics, and the need for process adjustments.




                                                                                                                     305
8.3.3.4 CHANGE REQUESTS

   Described in Section 4.3.3.4. If changes occur during the Control Quality process that may impact any of the
components of the project management plan or project documents, the project manager should submit a change
request. Change requests are processed for review and disposition through the Perform Integrated Change Control
process (Section 4.6).

8.3.3.5 PROJECT MANAGEMENT PLAN UPDATES

   Any change to the project management plan goes through the organization's change control process via a change
request. Components that may require a change request for the project management plan include but are not limited to
the quality management plan, as described in Section 8.1.3.1.

8.3.3.6 PROJECT DOCUMENTS UPDATES

  Project documents that may be updated as a result of carrying out this process include but are not limited to:
    Issue log. Described in Section 4.3.3.3. Many times a deliverable that does not meet the quality requirements
   uu
      is documented as an issue.
    Lessons learned register. Described in Section 4.4.3.1. The lessons learned register is updated with information
   uu
      on the source of quality defects and how they could have been avoided as well as approaches that worked well.
    Risk register. Described in Section 11.2.3.1. New risks identified during this process are recorded in the risk
   uu
      register and managed using the risk management processes.
    Test and evaluation documents. Described in Section 8.2.3.2. Test and evaluation documents may be modified
   uu
      as a result of this process in order to make future tests more effective.




                                                                                                        Part 1 - Guide

    PROJE CT R ESOURCE MA NAGEM ENT
      Project Resource Management includes the processes to identify, acquire, and manage the resources needed for
   the successful completion of the project. These processes help ensure that the right resources will be available to the
   project manager and project team at the right time and place.
     The Project Resource Management processes are:
     9.1 Plan Resource Management--The process of defining how to estimate, acquire, manage, and utilize physical
   and team resources.
     9.2 Estimate Activity Resources--The process of estimating team resources and the type and quantities of
   material, equipment, and supplies necessary to perform project work.
      9.3 Acquire Resources--The process of obtaining team members, facilities, equipment, materials, supplies, and
   other resources necessary to complete project work.
     9.4 Develop Team--The process of improving competencies, team member interaction, and the overall team
   environment to enhance project performance.
     9.5 Manage Team--The process of tracking team member performance, providing feedback, resolving issues,
   and managing team changes to optimize project performance.
      9.6 Control Resources--The process of ensuring that the physical resources assigned and allocated to the
   project are available as planned, as well as monitoring the planned versus actual use of resources, and performing
   corrective action as necessary.
     Figure 9-1 provides an overview of the Project Resource Management processes. The Project Resource





   Management processes are presented as discrete processes with defined interfaces while, in practice, they overlap
   and interact in ways that cannot be completely detailed in the PMBOK(R) Guide.

    There is a distinction between the skills and competencies needed for the project manager to manage team
resources versus physical resources. Physical resources include equipment, materials, facilities, and infrastructure.
Team resources or personnel refer to the human resources. Personnel may have varied skill sets, may be assigned
full- or part-time, and may be added or removed from the project team as the project progresses. There is some overlap
between Project Resource Management and Project Stakeholder Management (Section 13). This section (Section 9)
focuses on the subset of stakeholders who make up the project team.

KEY CONCEPTS FOR PROJECT RESOURCE MANAGEMENT

   The project team consists of individuals with assigned roles and responsibilities who work collectively to achieve
a shared project goal. The project manager should invest suitable effort in acquiring, managing, motivating, and
empowering the project team. Although specific roles and responsibilities for the project team members are assigned,
the involvement of all team members in project planning and decision making is beneficial. Participation of team
members during planning adds their expertise to the process and strengthens their commitment to the project.
   The project manager should be both leader and manager of the project team. In addition to project management
activities such as initiating, planning, executing, monitoring and controlling, and closing the various project phases, the
project manager is responsible for the team formation as an effective group. The project manager should be aware of
different aspects that influence the team, such as:
    Team environment,
   uu

    Geographical locations of team members,
   uu

    Communications among stakeholders,
   uu

    Organizational change management,
   uu

    Internal and external politics,
   uu

    Cultural issues and organizational uniqueness, and
   uu

    Other factors that may alter project performance.
   uu

   As a leader, the project manager is also responsible for proactively developing team skills and competencies while
retaining and improving team satisfaction and motivation. The project manager should be aware of, and subscribe to,
professional and ethical behavior, and ensure that all team members adhere to these behaviors.




                                                                                                                       309
   Physical resource management is concentrated in allocating and using the physical resources (material, equipment,
and supplies, for example) needed for successful completion of the project in an efficient and effective way. In order to do
that, organizations should have data on resource demands (now and in the reasonable future), resource configurations
that will be required to meet those demands, and the supply of resources. Failing to manage and control resources
efficiently is a source of risk for successful project completion. For example:
    Failing to secure critical equipment or infrastructure on time may result in delays in the manufacturing of the
   uu
       final product,
    Ordering low-quality material may damage the quality of the product causing a high rate of recalls or rework, and
   uu

    Keeping too much inventory may result in high operations costs and reduce the organization's profit. Unacceptably
   uu
       low inventory level, on the other hand, may result in not satisfying customer demand and, again, reduce the
       organization's profit.

TRENDS AND EMERGING PRACTICES IN PROJECT RESOURCE MANAGEMENT

    Project management styles are shifting away from a command and control structure for managing projects and
toward a more collaborative and supportive management approach that empowers teams by delegating decision
making to the team members. In addition, modern project resource management approaches seek to optimize resource
utilization. Trends and emerging practices for Project Resource Management include but are not limited to:
    Resource management methods. Due to the scarce nature of critical resources, in some industries, several
   uu
       trends have become popular in the past several years. There is extensive literature about lean management, just-
       in-time (JIT) manufacturing, Kaizen, total productive maintenance (TPM), theory of constraints (TOC), and other
       methods. A project manager should determine if the performing organization has adopted one or more resource
       management tools and adapt the project accordingly.
    Emotional intelligence (EI). The project manager should invest in personal EI by improving inbound (e.g.,
   uu
       self-management and self-awareness) and outbound (e.g., relationship management) competencies. Research
       suggests that project teams that succeed in developing team EI or become an emotionally competent group are
       more effective. Additionally, there is a reduction in staff turnover.
    Self-organizing teams. The increase in using agile approaches mainly for the execution of IT projects has given
   uu
       rise to the self-organizing team, where the team functions with an absence of centralized control. In projects
       that have self-organizing teams, the project manager (who may not be called a project manager) role provides
       the team with the environment and support needed and trusts the team to get the job done. Successful self-
       organizing teams usually consist of generalized specialists, instead of subject matter experts, who continuously
       adapt to the changing environment and embrace constructive feedback.




                                                                                                            Part 1 - Guide

    Virtual teams/distributed teams. The globalization of projects has promoted the need for virtual teams that work
   uu
      on the same project, but are not colocated at the same site. The availability of communication technology such as
      email, audio conferencing, social media, web-based meetings, and video conferencing has made virtual teams
      feasible. Managing virtual teams has unique advantages, such as being able to use special expertise on a project
      team even when the expert is not in the same geographic area, incorporating employees who work from home
      offices, and including people with mobility limitations or disabilities. The challenges of managing virtual teams
      are mainly in the communication domain, including a possible feeling of isolation, gaps in sharing knowledge
      and experience between team members, and difficulties in tracking progress and productivity, possible time zone
      difference and cultural differences.

TAILORING CONSIDERATIONS

   Because each project is unique, the project manager will need to tailor the way Project Resource Management
processes are applied. Considerations for tailoring include but are not limited to:
    Diversity. What is the diversity background of the team?
   uu

    Physical location. What is the physical location of team members and physical resources?
   uu

    Industry-specific resources. What special resources are needed in the industry?
   uu

    Acquisition of team members. How will team members be acquired for the project? Are team resources
   uu
      full-time or part-time on the project?
    Management of team. How is team development managed for the project? Are there organizational tools to
   uu
      manage team development or will new ones need to be established? Are there team members who have special
      needs? Will the team need special training to manage diversity?
    Life cycle approaches. What life cycle approach will be used on the project?
   uu


CONSIDERATIONS FOR AGILE/ADAPTIVE ENVIRONMENTS

   Projects with high variability benefit from team structures that maximize focus and collaboration, such as self-
organizing teams with generalizing specialists.
   Collaboration is intended to boost productivity and facilitate innovative problem solving. Collaborative teams may
facilitate accelerated integration of distinct work activities, improve communication, increase knowledge sharing, and
provide flexibility of work assignments in addition to other advantages.




                                                                                                                   311
   Although the benefits of collaboration also apply to other project environments, collaborative teams are often critical
to the success of projects with a high degree of variability and rapid changes, because there is less time for centralized
tasking and decision making.
  Planning for physical and human resources is much less predictable in projects with high variability. In these
environments, agreements for fast supply and lean methods are critical to controlling costs and achieving the schedule.



9.1 PLAN RESOURCE MANAGEMENT
   Plan Resource Management is the process of defining how to estimate, acquire, manage, and use team and physical
resources. The key benefit of this process is that it establishes the approach and level of management effort needed
for managing project resources based on the type and complexity of the project. This process is performed once or at
predefined points in the project. The inputs, tools and techniques, and outputs of the process are depicted in Figure 9-2.
Figure 9-3 depicts the data flow diagram for the process.

      Resource planning is used to determine and identify an approach to ensure that sufficient resources are available for
   the successful completion of the project. Project resources may include team members, supplies, materials, equipment,
   services and facilities. Effective resource planning should consider and plan for the availability of, or competition for,
   scarce resources.





      Those resources can be obtained from the organization's internal assets or from outside the organization through a





   procurement process. Other projects may be competing for the same resources required for the project at the same time
   and location. This may significantly impact project costs, schedules, risks, quality, and other project areas.




                                                                                                                           313
9.1.1 PLAN RESOURCE MANAGEMENT: INPUTS

9.1.1.1 PROJECT CHARTER

  Described in Section 4.1.3.1. The project charter provides the high-level project description and requirements. It also
has the key stakeholder list, summary milestones, and preapproved financial resources that may influence the resource
management of the project.

9.1.1.2 PROJECT MANAGEMENT PLAN

  Described in Section 4.2.3.1. Project management plan components include but are not limited to:
    Quality management plan. Described in Section 8.1.3.1. The quality management plan helps define the level of
   uu
       resources that will be required to achieve and maintain the defined level of quality and achieve the metrics for
       the project.
    Scope baseline. Described in Section 5.4.3.1. The scope baseline identifies the deliverables that drive the types
   uu
       and quantities of resources that will need to be managed.

9.1.1.3 PROJECT DOCUMENTS

  Project documents that can be considered as inputs for this process include but are not limited to:
    Project schedule. Described in Section 6.5.3.2. The project schedule shows the timeline for needed resources.
   uu

    Requirements documentation. Described in Section 5.2.3.1. Requirements will dictate the type and amount of
   uu
       resources needed for the project and may influence how they are managed.
    Risk register. Described in Section 11.2.3.1. The risk register contains information on threats and opportunities
   uu
       that may impact resource planning.
    Stakeholder register. Described in Section 13.1.3.1. The stakeholder register aids in identifying those
   uu
       stakeholders who have a particular interest in or an impact on resources needed for the project. It also helps to
       identify stakeholders who can influence the use of one kind of resource over another.




                                                                                                          Part 1 - Guide
314
9.1.1.4 ENTERPRISE ENVIRONMENTAL FACTORS

  The enterprise environmental factors that can influence the Plan Resource Management include but are not limited to:
    Organizational culture and structure,
   uu

    Geographic distribution of facilities and resources,
   uu

    Existing resources competencies and availability, and
   uu

    Marketplace conditions.
   uu


9.1.1.5 ORGANIZATIONAL PROCESS ASSETS

  The organizational process assets that can influence the Plan Resource Management include but are not limited to:
    Human resource policies and procedures,
   uu

    Physical resource management policies and procedures,

    Historical information for similar projects.
   uu



9.1.2 PLAN RESOURCE MANAGEMENT: TOOLS AND TECHNIQUES

9.1.2.1 EXPERT JUDGMENT

   Described in Section 4.1.2.1. Expertise should be considered from individuals or groups with specialized knowledge
or training in the following topics:
    Negotiating for the best resources within the organization;
   uu

    Talent management and personnel development;
   uu

    Determining the preliminary effort level needed to meet project objectives;
   uu

    Determining reporting requirements based on the organizational culture;
   uu

    Estimating lead times required for acquisition, based on lessons learned and market conditions;
   uu

    Identifying risks associated with resource acquisition, retention, and release plans;
   uu

    Complying with applicable government and union regulations; and
   uu

    Managing sellers and the logistics effort to ensure materials and supplies are available when needed.
   uu




                                                                                                                  315
9.1.2.2 DATA REPRESENTATION

   Data representation techniques that can be used for this process include but are not limited to charts. Various formats
exist to document and communicate team member roles and responsibilities. Most fall into hierarchical, matrix, or text-
oriented formats. Some project assignments are listed in subsidiary plans, such as the risk, quality, or communications
management plans. Regardless of the method used to document team member roles, the objective is to ensure that
each work package has an unambiguous owner and that all team members have a clear understanding of their roles
and responsibilities. A hierarchical format may be used to represent high-level roles, while a text-based format may be
better suited to document the detailed responsibilities.
    Hierarchical charts. The traditional organizational chart structure can be used to show positions and relationships
   uu
       in a graphical, top-down format.
       nuWork   breakdown structures (WBS). The WBS is designed to show how project deliverables are broken down
          into work packages and provide a way of showing high-level areas of responsibility.
       nuOrganizational breakdown structure (OBS). While the WBS shows a breakdown of project deliverables, an OBS
          is arranged according to an organization's existing departments, units, or teams, with the project activities or
          work packages listed under each department. An operational department, such as information technology or
          purchasing, can see all of its project responsibilities by looking at its portion of the OBS.
       nuResource breakdown structure. The resource breakdown structure is a hierarchical list of team and physical
          resources related by category and resource type that is used for planning, managing and controlling project
          work. Each descending (lower) level represents an increasingly detailed description of the resource until the
          information is small enough to be used in conjunction with the work breakdown structure (WBS) to allow the
          work to be planned, monitored, and controlled.




                                                                                                           Part 1 - Guide
316
 Assignment Matrix. A RAM shows the project resources assigned to each work package. It is used to illustrate
uu
   the connections between work packages, or activities, and project team members. On larger projects, RAMs can
   be developed at various levels. For example, a high-level RAM can define the responsibilities of a project team,
   group, or unit within each component of the WBS. Lower-level RAMs are used within the group to designate roles,
   responsibilities, and levels of authority for specific activities. The matrix format shows all activities associated
   with one person and all people associated with one activity. This also ensures that there is only one person
   accountable for any one task to avoid confusion about who is ultimately in charge or has authority for the work.
   One example of a RAM is a RACI (responsible, accountable, consult, and inform) chart, shown in Figure 9-4.
   The sample chart shows the work to be done in the left column as activities. The assigned resources can be
   shown as individuals or groups. The project manager can select other options, such as "lead" and "resource"
   designations, as appropriate for the project. A RACI chart is a useful tool to use to ensure clear assignment of
   roles and responsibilities when the team consists of internal and external resources.
 Text-oriented formats. Team member responsibilities that require detailed descriptions can be specified in text-
uu
   oriented formats. Usually in outline form, these documents provide information such as responsibilities, authority,
   competencies, and qualifications. The documents are known by various names including position descriptions
   and role-responsibility-authority forms. These documents can be used as templates for future projects, especially
   when the information is updated throughout the current project by applying lessons learned.

9.1.2.3 ORGANIZATIONAL THEORY

   Organizational theory provides information regarding the way in which people, teams, and organizational units
behave. Effective use of common techniques identified in organizational theory can shorten the amount of time, cost,
and effort needed to create the Plan Resource Management process outputs and improve planning efficiency. Applicable
organizational theories may recommend exercising a flexible leadership style that adapts to the changes in a team's
maturity level throughout the project life cycle. It is important to recognize that the organization's structure and culture
impacts the project organizational structure.

9.1.2.4 MEETINGS

  The project team may hold meetings to plan resource management for the project.



9.1.3 PLAN RESOURCE MANAGEMENT: OUTPUTS

9.1.3.1 RESOURCE MANAGEMENT PLAN

   The resource management plan is the component of the project management plan that provides guidance on how
project resources should be categorized, allocated, managed, and released. It may be divided between the team
management plan and physical resource management plan according to the specifics of the project. The resource
management plan may include but is not limited to:
    Identification of resources. Methods for identifying and quantifying team and physical resources needed.
   uu

    Acquiring resources. Guidance on how to acquire team and physical resources for the project.
   uu

    Roles and responsibilities:
   uu

       nuRole. The function assumed by, or assigned to, a person in the project. Examples of project roles are civil
          engineer, business analyst, and testing coordinator.
       nuAuthority. The   rights to apply project resources, make decisions, sign approvals, accept deliverables, and
          influence others to carry out the work of the project. Examples of decisions that need clear authority
          include the selection of a method for completing an activity, quality acceptance criteria, and how to
          respond to project variances. Team members operate best when their individual levels of authority match
          their individual responsibilities.




                                                                                                             Part 1 - Guide
318
         nuResponsibility. The assigned duties and work that a project team member is expected to perform in order to
             complete the project's activities.
         nuCompetence. The skill and capacity required to complete assigned activities within the project constraints.
             If project team members do not possess required competencies, performance can be jeopardized. When
             such mismatches are identified, proactive responses such as training, hiring, schedule changes, or scope
             changes are initiated.
       Project organization charts. A project organization chart is a graphic display of project team members and their
      uu
         reporting relationships. It can be formal or informal, highly detailed or broadly framed, based on the needs of the
         project. For example, the project organization chart for a 3,000-person disaster response team will have greater
         detail than a project organization chart for an internal, 20-person project.
       Project team resource management. Guidance on how project team resources should be defined, staffed,
      uu
         managed, and eventually released.
       Training. Training strategies for team members.
      uu

       Team development. Methods for developing the project team.
      uu

       Resource control. Methods for ensuring adequate physical resources are available as needed and that the
      uu
         acquisition of physical resources is optimized for project needs. Includes information on managing inventory,
         equipment, and supplies during throughout the project life cycle.
       Recognition plan. Which recognition and rewards will be given to team members, and when they will be given.
      uu


   9.1.3.2 TEAM CHARTER

     The team charter is a document that establishes the team values, agreements, and operating guidelines for the team.
   The team charter may include but is not limited to:
       Team values,
      uu

       Communication guidelines,
      uu

       Decision-making criteria and process,
      uu

       Conflict resolution process,
      uu





       Meeting guidelines, and
      uu





       Team agreements.
      uu




                                                                                                                        319
    The team charter establishes clear expectations regarding acceptable behavior by project team members. Early
commitment to clear guidelines decreases misunderstandings and increases productivity. Discussing areas such as
codes of conduct, communication, decision making, and meeting etiquette allows team members to discover values that
are important to one another. The team charter works best when the team develops it, or at least has an opportunity to
contribute to it. All project team members share responsibility for ensuring the rules documented in the team charter are
followed. The team charter can be reviewed and updated periodically to ensure a continued understanding of the team
ground rules and to orient and integrate new team members.

9.1.3.3 PROJECT DOCUMENTS UPDATES

  Project documents that may be updated as a result of carrying out this process include but are not limited to:
    Assumption log. Described in Section 4.1.3.2. The assumption log is updated with assumptions regarding the
   uu
       availability, logistics requirements, and location of physical resources as well as the skill sets and availability of
       team resources.
    Risk register. Described in Section 11.2.3.1. The risk register is updated with risks associated with team and
   uu
       physical resource availability or other known resource-related risks.



9.2 ESTIMATE ACTIVITY RESOURCES
   Estimate Activity Resources is the process of estimating team resources and the type and quantities of materials,
equipment, and supplies necessary to perform project work. The key benefit of this process is that it identifies the
type, quantity, and characteristics of resources required to complete the project. This process is performed periodically
throughout the project as needed. The inputs, tools and techniques, and outputs of this process are depicted in Figure
9-5. Figure 9-6 depicts the data flow diagram of the process.




                                                                                                             Part 1 - Guide

   The Estimate Activity Resources process is closely coordinated with other processes, such as the Estimate Costs
process. For example:
    A construction project team will need to be familiar with local building codes. Such knowledge is often readily
   uu
      available from local sellers. If the internal labor pool lacks experience with unusual or specialized construction
      techniques, the additional cost for a consultant may be the most effective way to secure knowledge of the local
      building codes.
    An automotive design team will need to be familiar with the latest automated assembly techniques. The requisite
   uu
      knowledge could be obtained by hiring a consultant, by sending a designer to a seminar on robotics, or by
      including someone from manufacturing as a member of the project team.


9.2.1 ESTIMATE ACTIVITY RESOURCES: INPUTS

9.2.1.1 PROJECT MANAGEMENT PLAN

  Described in Section 4.2.3.1. Project management plan components include but are not limited to:
    Resource management plan. Described in Section 9.1.3.1. The resource management plan defines the
   uu
      approach to identify the different resources needed for the project. It also defines the methods to quantify the
      resources needed for each activity and aggregates this information.
    Scope baseline. Described in Section 5.4.3.1. The scope baseline identifies the project and product scope
   uu
      necessary to meet the project objectives. The scope drives the needs for both team and physical resources.

9.2.1.2 PROJECT DOCUMENTS

  Project documents that can be considered as inputs for this process include but are not limited to:
    Activity attributes. Described in Section 6.2.3.2. Activity attributes provide the primary data source for use
   uu
      in estimating team and physical resources required for each activity on the activity list. Examples of attributes
      include the resource requirements, imposed dates, activity location, assumptions, and constraints.
    Activity list. Described in Section 6.2.3.1. The activity list identifies the activities that will need resources.
   uu




                                                                                                            Part 1 - Guide
322
    Assumption log. Described in Section 4.1.3.2. The assumption log may have information on productivity factors,
   uu
      availability, cost estimates, and approaches to work that will influence the nature and number of team and
      physical resources.
    Cost estimates. Described in Section 7.2.3.1. The cost of resources may impact resource selection from the
   uu
      quantity and skill level perspectives.
    Resource calendars. A resource calendar identifies the working days, shifts, start and end of normal business
   uu
      hours, weekends, and public holidays when each specific resource is available. Information on which resources
      (such as team resource, equipment, and material) are potentially available during a planned activity period is
      used for estimating resource utilization. Resource calendars also specify when, and for how long, identified
      team and physical resources will be available during the project. This information may be at the activity or
      project level. This includes consideration of attributes such as resource experience and/or skill level, as well
      as various geographical locations.
    Risk register. Described in Section 11.2.3.1. The risk register describes the individual risks that can impact
   uu
      resource selection and availability.

9.2.1.3 ENTERPRISE ENVIRONMENTAL FACTORS

   The enterprise environmental factors that can influence the Estimate Activity Resources process include but are not
limited to:
    Resource location,
   uu

    Resource availability,
   uu

    Team resource skills,
   uu

    Organizational culture,
   uu

    Published estimating data, and

9.2.1.4 ORGANIZATIONAL PROCESS ASSETS

   The organizational process assets that can influence the Estimate Activity Resources process include but are not
limited to:
    Policies and procedures regarding staffing,
   uu

    Policies and procedures relating to supplies and equipment, and
   uu

    Historical information regarding types of resources used for similar work on previous projects.
   uu



9.2.2 ESTIMATE ACTIVITY RESOURCES: TOOLS AND TECHNIQUES

9.2.2.1 EXPERT JUDGMENT

   Described in Section 4.1.2.1. Expertise should be considered from individuals or groups with specialized knowledge
or training in team and physical resource planning and estimating.

9.2.2.2 BOTTOM-UP ESTIMATING

  Described in Section 6.4.2.5. Team and physical resources are estimated at the activity level and then aggregated to
develop the estimates for work packages, control accounts, and summary project levels.

9.2.2.3 ANALOGOUS ESTIMATING

   Described in Section 6.4.2.2. Analogous estimating uses information regarding resources from a previous similar
project as the basis for estimating a future project. It is used as quick estimating method and can be used when the
project manager can only identify a few top levels of the WBS.

9.2.2.4 PARAMETRIC ESTIMATING

  Described in Section 6.4.2.3. Parametric estimating uses an algorithm or a statistical relationship between historical
data and other variables to calculate resource quantities needed for an activity, based on historical data and project
parameters. For example, if an activity needs 4,000 hours of coding and it needs to finish it in 1 year, it will require two
people to code (each doing 2,000 hours a year). This technique can produce higher levels of accuracy depending on the
sophistication and underlying data built into the model.




                                                                                                             Part 1 - Guide
324
9.2.2.5 DATA ANALYSIS

   A data analysis technique used in this process includes but is not limited to alternatives analysis. Alternatives analysis
is used to evaluate identified options in order to select the options or approaches to use to execute and perform the work
of the project. Many activities have multiple options for accomplishment. They include using various levels of resource
capability or skills, different sizes or types of machines, different tools (manual versus automated), and make-rent-or-
buy decisions regarding the resources. Alternatives analysis assists in providing the best solution to perform the project
activities, within the defined constraints.

9.2.2.6 PROJECT MANAGEMENT INFORMATION SYSTEM (PMIS)

   Described in Section 4.3.2.2. Project management information systems can include resource management software
that can help plan, organize, and manage resource pools and develop resource estimates. Depending on the sophistication
of the software, resource breakdown structures, resource availability, resource rates, and various resource calendars
can be defined to assist in optimizing resource utilization.

9.2.2.7 MEETINGS

   The project manager may hold planning meetings with functional managers to estimate the resources needed per
activity, level of effort (LoE), skill level of the team resources, and the quantity of the materials needed. Participants
at these meetings may include the project manager, the project sponsor, selected project team members, selected
stakeholders, and others as needed.



9.2.3 ESTIMATE ACTIVITY RESOURCES: OUTPUTS

9.2.3.1 RESOURCE REQUIREMENTS

  Resource requirements identify the types and quantities of resources required for each work package or activity in a
work package and can be aggregated to determine the estimated resources for each work package, each WBS branch,
and the project as a whole. The amount of detail and the level of specificity of the resource requirement descriptions
can vary by application area. The resource requirements' documentation can include assumptions that were made in
determining which types of resources are applied, their availability, and what quantities are needed.




                                                                                                                        325
9.2.3.2 BASIS OF ESTIMATES

  Described in Section 6.4.3.2. The amount and type of additional details supporting the resource estimate vary by
application area. Regardless of the level of detail, the supporting documentation should provide a clear and complete
understanding of how the resource estimate was derived.
  Supporting detail for resource estimates may include:
    Method used to develop the estimate,
   uu

    Resources used to develop the estimate (such as information from previous similar projects),
   uu

    Assumptions associated with the estimate,
   uu

    Known constraints,
   uu

    Range of estimates,
   uu

    Confidence level of the estimate, and
   uu

    Documentation of identified risks influencing the estimate.
   uu


9.2.3.3 RESOURCE BREAKDOWN STRUCTURE

   The resource breakdown structure is a hierarchical representation of resources by category and type (see Figure 9-7
for example). Examples of resource categories include but are not limited to labor, material, equipment, and supplies.
Resource types may include the skill level, grade level, required certifications, or other information as appropriate to the
project. In Plan Resource Management, the resource breakdown structure was used to guide the categorization for the
project. In this process it is a completed document that will be used to acquire and monitor resources.




                                                                                                             Part 1 - Guide

9.3 ACQUIRE RESOURCES
   Acquire Resources is the process of obtaining team members, facilities, equipment, materials, supplies, and other
resources necessary to complete project work. The key benefit of this process is that it outlines and guides the selection
of resources and assigns them to their respective activities. This process is performed periodically throughout the
project as needed. The inputs, tools and techniques, and outputs of the process are depicted in Figure 9-8. Figure 9-9
depicts the data flow diagram for the process.

      The resources needed for the project can be internal or external to the project-performing organization. Internal
   resources are acquired (assigned) from functional or resource managers. External resources are acquired through the
   procurement processes.
      The project management team may or may not have direct control over resource selection because of collective
   bargaining agreements, use of subcontractor personnel, a matrix project environment, internal or external reporting





   relationships, or other reasons. It is important that the following factors are considered during the process of acquiring





   the project resources:




                                                                                                                                               329
    The project manager or project team should effectively negotiate and influence others who are in a position to
   uu
      provide the required team and physical resources for the project.
    Failure to acquire the necessary resources for the project may affect project schedules, budgets, customer
   uu
      satisfaction, quality, and risks. Insufficient resources or capabilities decrease the probability of success and, in a
      worst-case scenario, could result in project cancellation.
    If the team resources are not available due to constraints such as economic factors or assignment to other
   uu
      projects, the project manager or project team may be required to assign alternative resources, perhaps with
      different competencies or costs. Alternative resources are allowed provided there is no violation of legal,
      regulatory, mandatory, or other specific criteria.
   These factors should be considered and accounted for in the planning stages of the project. The project manager
or project management team will be required to document the impact of the unavailability of required resources in the
project schedule, project budget, project risks, project quality, training plans, and other project management plans.



9.3.1 ACQUIRE RESOURCES: INPUTS

9.3.1.1 PROJECT MANAGEMENT PLAN

  Described in Section 4.2.3.1. Project management plan components include but are not limited to:
    Resource management plan. Described in Section 9.1.3.1. The resource management plan provides guidance
   uu
      on how to acquire resources for the project.
    Procurement management plan. Described in Section 12.1.3.1. The procurement management plan has
   uu
      information regarding resources that will be acquired from outside the project. This includes information on how
      procurements will be integrated with other project work and stakeholders involved in procuring resources.
    Cost baseline. Described in Section 7.3.3.1. The cost baseline provides the overall budget for the project activities.
   uu




                                                                                                            Part 1 - Guide
330
   9.3.1.2 PROJECT DOCUMENTS

     Project documents that can be considered as inputs for this process include but are not limited to:
      Project schedule. Described in Section 6.5.3.2. The project schedule shows the activities and their planned start
     uu
         and end dates to help determine when the resources need to be available and acquired.
      Resource calendars. Described in Section 9.3.3.3. Resource calendars document the time periods that each
     uu
         resource needed for the project is available for the project. Creating a reliable schedule depends on having a
         good understanding of each resource's availability and schedule constraints, including time zones, work hours,
         vacation time, local holidays, maintenance schedule and commitments to other projects. Resource calendars are
         progressively elaborated and updated throughout the project. Once created as an output of this process, they are
         used as needed whenever this process is repeated.
      Resource requirements. Described in Section 9.2.3.1. Resource requirements identify which resources need
     uu
         to be acquired.
      Stakeholder register. Described in Section 13.1.3.1. The stakeholder register may reveal stakeholders' needs
     uu
         or expectations for specific resources to be used on the project that need to be considered in the Acquire
         Resources process.

   9.3.1.3 ENTERPRISE ENVIRONMENTAL FACTORS

     The enterprise environmental factors that can influence the Acquire Resources process include but are not limited to:
      Existing information on organizational resources including availability, competence levels, and prior experience
     uu
         for team resources and resource costs;
      Marketplace conditions;
     uu

      Organizational structure; and
     uu

      Geographic locations.
     uu


   9.3.1.4 ORGANIZATIONAL PROCESS ASSETS

     The organizational process assets that can influence the Acquire Resources process include but are not limited to:





      Policies and procedures for acquiring, allocating, and assigning resources to the project; and
     uu





      Historical information and lessons learned repository.
     uu




                                                                                                                      331
9.3.2 ACQUIRE RESOURCES: TOOLS AND TECHNIQUES

9.3.2.1 DECISION MAKING

   Described in Section 5.2.2.4. Decision-making techniques that can be used in the Acquire Resources process include
but are not limited to multicriteria decision analysis, as described in Section 8.1.2.4. Selection criteria are often used to
select physical project resources, or the project team. Using a multicriteria decision analysis tool, criteria are developed
and used to rate or score potential resources (for example, choosing between internal and external team resources). The
criteria are weighted according to their relative importance and values can be changed for different types of resources.
Some examples of selection criteria that can be used are:
    Availability. Verify that the resource is available to work on the project within the time period needed.
   uu

    Cost. Verify if the cost of adding the resource is within the prescribed budget.
   uu

    Ability. Verify that the team member provides the capability needed by the project.
   uu

  Some selection criteria that are unique for team resources are:
    Experience. Verify that the team member has the relevant experience that will contribute to the project success.
   uu

    Knowledge. Consider if the team member has relevant knowledge of the customer, similar implemented projects,
   uu
       and nuances of the project environment.
    Skills. Determine if the team member has the relevant skills to use a project tool.
   uu

    Attitude. Determine if the team member has the ability to work with others as a cohesive team.
   uu

    International factors. Consider team member location, time zone, and communication capabilities.
   uu


9.3.2.2 INTERPERSONAL AND TEAM SKILLS

   An interpersonal and team skill that can be used for this process includes but is not limited to negotiation. Described
in Section 12.2.2.5. Many projects need to negotiate for required resources. The project management team may need
to negotiate with:
    Functional managers. Ensure that the project receives the best resources possible in the required timeframe
   uu
       and until their responsibilities are complete.
    Other project management teams within the performing organization. Appropriately assign or share scarce
   uu
       or specialized resources.
    External organizations and suppliers. Provide appropriate, scarce, specialized, qualified, certified, or other
   uu
       specific team or physical resources. Special consideration should be given to external negotiating policies,
       practices, processes, guidelines, legal, and other such criteria.




                                                                                                             Part 1 - Guide
332
   The project management team's ability to influence others plays an important role in negotiating resource allocation,
as does the politics of the organizations involved. For example, convincing a functional manager about the high visibility
of the project may influence him or her to assign the best resources to this project over competing ones.

9.3.2.3 PRE-ASSIGNMENT

   When physical or team resources for a project are determined in advance, they are considered pre-assigned. This
situation can occur if the project is the result of specific resources being identified as part of a competitive proposal or if
the project is dependent upon the expertise of particular persons. Pre-assignment might also include the team members
who have already been assigned in Develop Project Charter Process or other processes before the initial Resource
Management Plan has been completed.

9.3.2.4 VIRTUAL TEAMS

   The use of virtual teams creates new possibilities when acquiring project team members. Virtual teams can be
defined as groups of people with a shared goal who fulfill their roles with little or no time spent meeting face to face. The
availability of communication technology such as email, audio conferencing, social media, web-based meetings, and
video conferencing has made virtual teams feasible. The virtual team model makes it possible to:
    Form teams of people from the same organization who live in widespread geographic areas;
   uu

    Add special expertise to a project team even though the expert is not in the same geographic area;
   uu

    Incorporate employees who work from home offices;
   uu

    Form teams of people who work different shifts, hours, or days;
   uu

    Include people with mobility limitations or disabilities;
   uu

    Move forward with projects that would have been held or canceled due to travel expenses; and
   uu

    Save the expense of offices and all physical equipment needed for employees.
   uu

  Communication planning becomes increasingly important in a virtual team environment. Additional time may be
needed to set clear expectations, facilitate communications, develop protocols for resolving conflict, include people in
decision making, understand cultural differences, and share credit in successes.

   A resource calendar identifies the working days, shifts, start and end of normal business hours, weekends, and public
holidays when each specific resource is available. Information on which resources (such as team resource, equipment,
and material) are potentially available during a planned activity period is used for estimating resource utilization.
Resource calendars also specify when and for how long identified team and physical resources will be available during
the project. This information may be at the activity or project level. This includes consideration of attributes such as
resource experience and/or skill level, as well as various geographical locations.

9.3.3.4 CHANGE REQUESTS

   Described in Section 4.3.3.4. When changes occur as a result of carrying out the Acquire Resources process (for
example, impacts to the schedule) or when recommended corrective or preventive actions impact any of the components
of the project management plan or project documents, the project manager needs to submit a change request. Change
requests are processed for review and disposition through the Perform Integrated Change Control process (Section 4.6).

9.3.3.5 PROJECT MANAGEMENT PLAN UPDATES

   Any change to the project management plan goes through the organization's change control process via a change
request. Components of the project management plan that may be updated as a result of carrying out this process
include but are not limited to:
    Resource management plan. Described in Section 9.1.3.1. The resource management plan may be updated to
   uu
       reflect actual experience in acquiring resources for the project, including lessons learned in acquiring resources
       early in the project that will impact how resources are acquired later in the project.
    Cost baseline. Described in Section 7.3.3.1. The cost baseline may change as a result of the acquisition of
   uu
       resources for the project.

   uu
      on challenges encountered and how they could have been avoided as well as approaches that worked well for
      acquiring resources.
    Project schedule. Described in Section 6.5.3.2. Changes to the project schedule may result from the availability
   uu
      of required resources.
    Resource breakdown structure. Described in Section 9.2.3.3. Resources acquired during this process are
   uu
      recorded in the resource breakdown structure.
    Resource requirements. Described in Section 9.2.3.1. Resource requirements documentation is updated to
   uu
      reflect resources acquired for the project.
    Risk register. Described in Section 11.2.3.1. New risks identified during this process are recorded in the risk
   uu
      register and managed using the risk management processes.
    Stakeholder register. Described in Section 13.1.3.1. The stakeholder register is updated with any new
   uu
      stakeholders and any new information about existing stakeholders that has been gained as a result of
      this process.

9.3.3.7 ENTERPRISE ENVIRONMENTAL FACTORS UPDATES

  Enterprise environmental factors that are updated include but are not limited to:
    Resource availability within the organization, and
   uu

    Amount of the organization's consumable resources that have been used.

9.4 DEVELOP TEAM
   Develop Team is the process of improving competencies, team member interaction, and the overall team environment
to enhance project performance. The key benefit of this process is that it results in improved teamwork, enhanced
interpersonal skills and competencies, motivated employees, reduced attrition, and improved overall project performance.
This process is performed throughout the project.
   The inputs, tools and techniques, and outputs of the process are depicted in Figure 9-10. Figure 9-11 depicts the data
flow diagram for the process.

      Project managers require the skills to identify, build, maintain, motivate, lead, and inspire project teams to achieve
   high team performance and to meet the project's objectives. Teamwork is a critical factor for project success, and





   developing effective project teams is one of the primary responsibilities of the project manager. Project managers





   should create an environment that facilitates teamwork and continually motivates the team by providing challenges
   and opportunities, providing timely feedback and support as needed, and recognizing and rewarding good performance.
   High team performance can be achieved by employing these behaviors:
       Using open and effective communication,
      uu

       Creating team-building opportunities,
      uu

       Developing trust among team members,
      uu

       Managing conflicts in a constructive manner,
      uu

       Encouraging collaborative problem solving, and
      uu

       Encouraging collaborative decision making.

                                                                                                                                              337
   Project managers operate in a global environment and work on projects characterized by cultural diversity. Team
members often have diverse industry experience, communicate in multiple languages, and sometimes work with a
"team language" or cultural norm that may be different from their native one. The project management team should
capitalize on cultural differences, focus on developing and sustaining the project team throughout the project life cycle,
and promote working together interdependently in a climate of mutual trust. Developing the project team improves
the people skills, technical competencies, and overall team environment and project performance. It requires clear,
timely, effective, and efficient communication between team members throughout the life of the project. Objectives of
developing a project team include but are not limited to:
    Improving the knowledge and skills of team members to increase their ability to complete project deliverables,
   uu
       while lowering costs, reducing schedules, and improving quality;
    Improving feelings of trust and agreement among team members to raise morale, lower conflict, and increase
   uu
       teamwork;
    Creating a dynamic, cohesive, and collaborative team culture to: (1) improve individual and team productivity,
   uu
       team spirit, and cooperation; and (2) allow cross-training and mentoring between team members to share
       knowledge and expertise; and
    Empowering the team to participate in decision making and take ownership of the provided solutions to improve
   uu
       team productivity for more effective and efficient results.
   One of the models used to describe team development is the Tuckman ladder [19, 20], which includes five stages of
development that teams may go through. Although it is common for these stages to occur in order, it is not uncommon
for a team to get stuck in a particular stage or regress to an earlier stage. Projects with team members who worked
together in the past might skip a stage.
    Forming. This phase is where the team members meet and learn about the project and their formal roles and
   uu
       responsibilities. Team members tend to be independent and not as open in this phase.
    Storming. During this phase, the team begins to address the project work, technical decisions, and the project
   uu
       management approach. If team members are not collaborative or open to differing ideas and perspectives, the
       environment can become counterproductive.
    Norming. In this phase, team members begin to work together and adjust their work habits and behaviors to
   uu
       support the team. The team members learn to trust each other.
    Performing. Teams that reach the performing stage function as a well-organized unit. They are interdependent
   uu
       and work through issues smoothly and effectively.
    Adjourning. In this phase, the team completes the work and moves on from the project. This typically occurs when
   uu
       staff is released from the project as deliverables are completed or as part of the Close Project or Phase process.




                                                                                                            Part 1 - Guide
338
      The duration of a particular stage depends upon team dynamics, team size, and team leadership. Project managers
   should have a good understanding of team dynamics in order to move their team members through all stages in an
   effective manner.



   9.4.1 DEVELOP TEAM: INPUTS

   9.4.1.1 PROJECT MANAGEMENT PLAN

      Described in Section 4.2.3.1. Project management plan components include but are not limited to the resource
   management plan. Described in Section 9.1.3.1, the resource management plan provides guidance on providing
   project team member rewards, feedback, additional training, and disciplinary actions as a result of team performance
   assessments and other forms of project team management. The resource management plan may include also the team
   performance assessment criteria.

   9.4.1.2 PROJECT DOCUMENTS

     Project documents that can be considered as inputs for this process include but are not limited to:
       Lessons learned register. Described in Section 4.4.3.1. Lessons learned earlier in the project with regard to
      uu
         developing the team can be applied to later phases in the project to improve team performance.
       Project schedule. Described in Section 6.5.3.2. The project schedule defines how and when to provide training
      uu
         to the project team and develop the competencies required at different phases. It identifies the need for team
         development strategies based on variations, if any, during the project execution.
       Project team assignments. Described in Section 9.3.3.1. Project team assignments identify the team and
      uu
         member roles and responsibilities.
       Resource calendars. Described in Section 9.2.1.2. Resource calendars identify times when the project team
      uu
         members can participate in team development activities. It also helps illustrate team availability during the
         entire project.
       Team charter. Described in Section 9.1.3.2. The team charter is where the team operating guidelines are
      uu





         documented. The team values and operating guidelines provide the structure that describes how the team will
         operate together.





   9.4.1.3 ENTERPRISE ENVIRONMENTAL FACTORS

     The enterprise environmental factors that can influence the Develop Team process include but are not limited to:
       Human resource management policies regarding hiring and termination, employee performance reviews,

                                                                                                                    339
9.4.1.4 ORGANIZATIONAL PROCESS ASSETS

   The organizational process assets that can influence the Develop Team process include but are not limited to historical
information and the lessons learned repository.



9.4.2 DEVELOP TEAM: TOOLS AND TECHNIQUES

9.4.2.1 COLOCATION

   Colocation involves placing many or all of the most active project team members in the same physical location to
enhance their ability to perform as a team. Colocation can be temporary, such as at strategically important times during
the project, or can continue for the entire project. Colocation strategies can include a team meeting room, common
places to post schedules, and other conveniences that enhance communication and a sense of community.

9.4.2.2 VIRTUAL TEAMS

   The use of virtual teams can bring benefits such as the use of more skilled resources, reduced costs, less travel and
relocation expenses, and the proximity of team members to suppliers, customers, or other key stakeholders. Virtual
teams can use technology to create an online team environment where the team can store files, use conversations
threads to discuss issues, and keep a team calendar.

9.4.2.3 COMMUNICATION TECHNOLOGY

   Described in Section 10.1.2.3. Communication technology is important in addressing the team development issues in
colocated and virtual teams. It helps build a harmonious environment for the colocated team and a better understanding
for the virtual team, especially those working in different time zones. Examples of communication technology that may
be used are:
    Shared portal. A shared repository for information sharing (e.g., website, collaboration software or intranet) is
   uu
       effective for virtual project teams.

   9.4.2.4 INTERPERSONAL AND TEAM SKILLS

     Interpersonal and team skills that can be used for this process include but are not limited to:
       Conflict management. Described in Section 9.5.2.1. The project manager needs to resolve conflicts in a timely
      uu
         manner and in a constructive way in order to achieve a high-performing team.
       Influencing. Described in Section 9.5.2.1. An influencing skill used in this process is gathering relevant and
      uu
         critical information to address important issues and reach agreements while maintaining mutual trust.
       Motivation. Motivation is providing a reason for someone to act. Teams are motivated by empowering them to
      uu
         participate in decision making and encouraging them to work independently.
       Negotiation. Described in Section 12.2.2.5. Negotiation among team members is used to reach consensus on
      uu
         project needs. Negotiation can build trust and harmony among the team members.
       Team building. Team building is conducting activities that enhance the team's social relations and build a
      uu
         collaborative and cooperative working environment. Team building activities can vary from a 5-minute agenda
         item in a status review meeting to an offsite, professionally facilitated event designed to improve interpersonal
         relationships. The objective of team-building activities is to help individual team members work together effectively.
         Team-building strategies are particularly valuable when team members operate from remote locations without the
         benefit of face-to-face contact. Informal communication and activities can help in building trust and establishing
         good working relationships. While team building is essential during the initial stages of a project, it should be a
         continuous process. Changes in a project environment are inevitable, and to manage them effectively, a continuous
         or renewed team-building effort may be applied. The project manager should continually monitor team functionality
         and performance to determine if any actions are needed to prevent or correct various team problems.

   9.4.2.5 RECOGNITION AND REWARDS

      Part of the team development process involves recognizing and rewarding desirable behavior. The original
   plan for rewarding people is developed during the Plan Resource Management process. Rewards will be effective
   only if they satisfy a need that is valued by that individual. Reward decisions are made, formally or informally,
   during the process of managing the project team. Cultural differences should be considered when determining
   recognition and rewards.






                                                                                                                          341
   People are motivated when they feel they are valued in the organization and this value is demonstrated by the rewards
given to them. Generally, money is viewed as a tangible aspect of any reward system, but intangible rewards could be
equally or even more effective. Most project team members are motivated by an opportunity to grow, accomplish, be
appreciated, and apply their professional skills to meet new challenges. A good strategy for project managers is to give
the team recognition throughout the life cycle of the project rather than waiting until the project is completed.

9.4.2.6 TRAINING

   Training includes all activities designed to enhance the competencies of the project team members. Training can be
formal or informal. Examples of training methods include classroom, online, computer-based, on-the-job training from
another project team member, mentoring, and coaching. If project team members lack the necessary management or
technical skills, such skills can be developed as part of the project work. Scheduled training takes place as stated in
the resource management plan. Unplanned training takes place as a result of observation, conversation, and project
performance appraisals conducted during management of the project team. Training costs could be included in the
project budget or supported by the performing organization if the added skills may be useful for future projects. It may
be performed by in-house or by external trainers.

9.4.2.7 INDIVIDUAL AND TEAM ASSESSMENTS

   Individual and team assessment tools give the project manager and the project team insight into areas of strengths
and weaknesses. These tools help project managers assess team members' preferences, aspirations, how they process
and organize information, how they make decisions, and how they interact with people. Various tools are available such
as attitudinal surveys, specific assessments, structured interviews, ability tests, and focus groups. These tools can
provide improved understanding, trust, commitment, and communications among team members and facilitate more
productive teams throughout the project.

9.4.2.8 MEETINGS

   Meetings are used to discuss and address pertinent topics for developing the team. Attendees include the project
manager and the project team. Types of meetings include but are not limited to project orientation meetings, team-
building meetings, and team development meetings.




                                                                                                         Part 1 - Guide

   9.4.3 DEVELOP TEAM: OUTPUTS

   9.4.3.1 TEAM PERFORMANCE ASSESSMENTS

      As project team development efforts such as training, team building, and colocation are implemented, the project
   management team makes formal or informal assessments of the project team's effectiveness. Effective team
   development strategies and activities are expected to increase the team's performance, which increases the likelihood
   of meeting project objectives.
     The evaluation of a team's effectiveness may include indicators such as:
       Improvements in skills that allow individuals to perform assignments more effectively,
      uu

       Improvements in competencies that help team members perform better as a team,
      uu

       Reduced staff turnover rate, and
      uu

       Increased team cohesiveness where team members share information and experiences openly and help each
      uu
          other to improve the overall project performance.
      As a result of conducting an evaluation of the team's overall performance, the project management team can
   identify the specific training, coaching, mentoring, assistance, or changes required to improve the team's performance.
   This should also include identifying the appropriate or required resources necessary to achieve and implement the
   improvements identified in the assessment.

   9.4.3.2 CHANGE REQUESTS

      Described in Section 4.3.3.4. If change requests occur as a result of carrying out the Develop Team process or if
   recommended corrective or preventive actions impact any of the components of the project management plan or project
   documents, the project manager needs to submit a change request and follow the Perform Integrated Change Control
   process as defined in Section 4.6.

   9.4.3.3 PROJECT MANAGEMENT PLAN UPDATES

   Managing the project team requires a variety of management and leadership skills for fostering teamwork and
integrating the efforts of team members to create high-performance teams. Team management involves a combination
of skills with special emphasis on communication, conflict management, negotiation, and leadership. Project managers
should provide challenging assignments to team members and provide recognition for high performance.
  The project manager needs to be sensitive to both the willingness and the ability of team members to perform their
work and adjust their management and leadership styles accordingly. Team members with low-skill abilities will require
more intensive oversight than those who have demonstrated ability and experience.

   9.5.1 MANAGE TEAM: INPUTS

   9.5.1.1 PROJECT MANAGEMENT PLAN

      Described in Section 4.2.3.1. Project management plan components include but are not limited to the resource
   management plan. Described in Section 9.1.3.1, the resource management plan provides guidance on how project team
   resources should be managed and eventually released.

   9.5.1.2 PROJECT DOCUMENTS

     Project documents that can be considered as inputs for this process include but are not limited to:
       Issue log. Described in Section 4.3.3.3. Issues arise in the course of managing the project team. An issue log can
      uu
          be used to document and monitor who is responsible for resolving specific issues by a target date.
       Lessons learned register. Described in Section 4.4.3.1. Lessons learned earlier in the project can be applied to
      uu
          later phases in the project to improve the efficiency and effectiveness of managing the team.
       Project team assignments. Described in Section 9.3.3.1. Project team assignments identify the team member
      uu
          roles and responsibilities.
       Team charter. Described in Section 9.1.3.2. The team charter provides guidance for how the team will make
      uu
          decisions, conduct meetings, and resolve conflict.

   9.5.1.3 WORK PERFORMANCE REPORTS

      Described in Section 4.5.3.1. Work performance reports are the physical or electronic representation of work
   performance information intended to generate decisions, actions, or awareness. Performance reports that can help with
   project team management include results from schedule control, cost control, quality control, and scope validation. The
   information from performance reports and related forecasts assists in determining future team resource requirements,
   recognition and rewards, and updates to the resource management plan.

   9.5.1.4 TEAM PERFORMANCE ASSESSMENTS





      Described in Section 9.4.3.1. The project management team makes ongoing formal or informal assessments of the
   project team's performance. By continually assessing the project team's performance, actions can be taken to resolve





   issues, modify communication, address conflict, and improve team interaction.




                                                                                                                      347

    Certificates of appreciation,
   uu

    Corporate apparel, and
   uu

    Other organizational perquisites.
   uu



9.5.2 MANAGE TEAM: TOOLS AND TECHNIQUES

9.5.2.1 INTERPERSONAL AND TEAM SKILLS

  Interpersonal and team skills that can be used for this process include but are not limited to:
    Conflict management. Conflict is inevitable in a project environment. Sources of conflict include scarce
   uu
      resources, scheduling priorities, and personal work styles. Team ground rules, group norms, and solid project
      management practices, like communication planning and role definition, reduce the amount of conflict.
      Successful conflict management results in greater productivity and positive working relationships. When managed
      properly, differences of opinion can lead to increased creativity and better decision making. If the differences
      become a negative factor, project team members are initially responsible for their resolution. If conflict escalates,
      the project manager should help facilitate a satisfactory resolution. Conflict should be addressed early and
      usually in private, using a direct, collaborative approach. If disruptive conflict continues, formal procedures may
      be used, including disciplinary actions.
      The success of project managers in managing their project teams often depends on their ability to resolve
      conflict. Different project managers may use different conflict resolution methods. Factors that influence conflict
      resolution methods include:
      nuImportance and intensity of the conflict,
      nuTime pressure for resolving the conflict,
      nuRelative power of the people involved in the conflict,
      nuImportance of maintaining a good relationship, and
      nuMotivation to resolve conflict on a long-term or short-term basis.




                                                                                                           Part 1 - Guide

          There are five general techniques for resolving conflict. Each technique has its place and use:
          muWithdraw/avoid. Retreating from an actual or potential conflict situation; postponing the issue to be better
             prepared or to be resolved by others.
          muSmooth/accommodate. Emphasizing areas of agreement rather than areas of difference; conceding one's
             position to the needs of others to maintain harmony and relationships.
          muCompromise/reconcile. Searching       for solutions that bring some degree of satisfaction to all parties in order
             to temporarily or partially resolve the conflict. This approach occasionally results in a lose-lose situation.
          muForce/direct. Pushing one's viewpoint at the expense of others; offering only win-lose solutions, usually enforced
             through a power position to resolve an emergency. This approach often results to a win-lose situation.
          muCollaborate/problem  solve. Incorporating multiple viewpoints and insights from differing perspectives;
             requires a cooperative attitude and open dialogue that typically leads to consensus and commitment. This
             approach can result in a win-win situation.
    Decision making. Decision making, in this context, involves the ability to negotiate and influence the organization
   uu
      and the project management team, rather than the set of tools described in the decision making tool set. Some
      guidelines for decision making include:
      nuFocus on goals to be served,
      nuFollow a decision-making process,
      nuStudy the environmental factors,
      nuAnalyze available information,
      nuStimulate team creativity, and
      nuAccount for risk.

    Emotional intelligence. Emotional intelligence is the ability to identify, assess, and manage the personal
   uu
      emotions of oneself and other people, as well as the collective emotions of groups of people. The team
      can use emotional intelligence to reduce tension and increase cooperation by identifying, assessing, and
      controlling the sentiments of project team members, anticipating their actions, acknowledging their concerns,
      and following up on their issues.






                                                                                                                         349
    Influencing. Because project managers often have little or no direct authority over team members in a matrix
   uu
      environment, their ability to influence stakeholders on a timely basis is critical to project success. Key influencing
      skills include:
      nuAbility to be persuasive;
      nuClearly articulating points and positions;
      nuHigh levels of active and effective listening skills;
      nuAwareness of, and consideration for, the various perspectives in any situation; and
      nuGathering relevant information to address issues and reach agreements while maintaining mutual trust.

    Leadership. Successful projects require leaders with strong leadership skills. Leadership is the ability to lead
   uu
      a team and inspire them to do their jobs well. It encompasses a wide range of skills, abilities and actions.
      Leadership is important through all phases of the project life cycle. There are multiple leadership theories
      defining leadership styles that should be used as needed for each situation or team. It is especially important to
      communicate the vision and inspire the project team to achieve high performance.

9.5.2.2 PROJECT MANAGEMENT INFORMATION SYSTEM (PMIS)

  Described in Section 4.3.2.2. Project management information systems can include resource management or
scheduling software that can be used for managing and coordinating team members across project activities.



9.5.3 MANAGE TEAM: OUTPUTS

9.5.3.1 CHANGE REQUESTS

   Described in Section 4.3.3.4. When change requests occur as a result of carrying out the Manage Team process or
when recommended corrective or preventive actions impact any of the components of the project management plan or
project documents, the project manager needs to submit a change request. Change requests are processed for review
and disposition through the Perform Integrated Change Control process (Section 4.6).
   For example, staffing changes, whether made by choice or by uncontrollable events, can disrupt the project team.
This disruption can cause the schedule to slip or the budget to be exceeded. Staffing changes include moving people to
different assignments, outsourcing some of the work, or replacing team members who leave.




                                                                                                            Part 1 - Guide
350
   9.5.3.2 PROJECT MANAGEMENT PLAN UPDATES

      Any change to the project management plan goes through the organization's change control process via a change
   request. Components of the project management plan that may require a change request for the project management
   plan include but are not limited to:
       Resource management plan. Described in Section 9.1.3.1. The resource management plan is updated to reflect
      uu
         actual experience in managing the project team.
       Schedule baseline. Described in Section 6.5.3.1. Changes to the project schedule may be required to reflect the
      uu
         way the team is performing.
       Cost baseline. Described in Section 7.3.3.1. Changes to the project cost baseline may be required to reflect the
      uu
         way the team is performing.

   9.5.3.3 PROJECT DOCUMENTS UPDATES

     Project documents that may be updated as a result of carrying out this process include but are not limited to:
       Issue log. Described in Section 4.3.3.3. New issues raised as a result of this process are recorded in the issue log.
      uu

       Lessons learned register. Described in Section 4.4.3.1. The lessons learned register is updated with information
      uu
         on challenges encountered and how they could have been avoided as well as approaches that worked well for
         the managing the team.
       Project team assignments. Described in Section 9.3.3.1. If changes to the team are required, those changes
      uu
         are recorded in the project team assignments documentation.

   9.5.3.4 ENTERPRISE ENVIRONMENTAL FACTORS UPDATES

      Enterprise environmental factors that are updated as a result of the Manage Team process include but are not
   limited to:
       Input to organizational performance appraisals, and
      uu

       Personnel skill.

9.6 CONTROL RESOURCES
   Control Resources is the process of ensuring that the physical resources assigned and allocated to the project are
available as planned, as well as monitoring the planned versus actual utilization of resources and taking corrective
action as necessary. The key benefit of this process is ensuring that the assigned resources are available to the project
at the right time and in the right place and are released when no longer needed. This process is performed throughout
the project. The inputs and outputs of this process are depicted in Figure 9-14. Figure 9-15 depicts the data flow
diagram for the process.

       The Control Resources process should be performed continuously in all project phases and throughout the project





   life cycle. The resources needed for the project should be assigned and released at the right time, right place, and right
   amount for the project to continue without delays. The Control Resources process is concerned with physical resources
   such as equipment, materials, facilities, and infrastructure. Team members are addressed in the Manage Team process.
      The Control Resources techniques discussed here are those used most frequently on projects. There are many others
   that may be useful on certain projects or in some application areas.




                                                                                                                                     353
  Updating resource allocation requires knowing what actual resources have been used to date and what is still
needed. This is done mainly by reviewing the performance usage to date. Control Resources is concerned with:
    Monitoring resource expenditures,
   uu

    Identifying and dealing with resource shortage/surplus in a timely manner,
   uu

    Ensuring that resources are used and released according to the plan and project needs,
   uu

    Informing appropriate stakeholders if any issues arise with relevant resources,
   uu

    Influencing the factors that can create resources utilization change, and
   uu

    Managing the actual changes as they occur.
   uu

  Any changes needed to the schedule or cost baselines can be approved only through the Perform Integrated Change
Control process (Section 4.6).



9.6.1 CONTROL RESOURCES: INPUTS

9.6.1.1 PROJECT MANAGEMENT PLAN

   Described in Section 4.2.3.1. Project management plan components include but are not limited to the resource
management plan. Described in Section 9.1.3.1, the resource management plan provides guidance on how physical
resources should be used, controlled, and eventually released.

9.6.1.2 PROJECT DOCUMENTS

  Project documents that can be considered as inputs for this process include but are not limited to:
    Issue log. Described in Section 4.3.3.3. The issue log is used to identify issues such as lack of resources, delays
   uu
      in raw material supplies, or low grades of raw material.
    Lessons learned register. Described in Section 4.4.3.1. Lessons learned earlier in the project can be applied to
   uu
      later phases in the project to improve physical resource control.
    Physical resource assignments. Described in Section 9.3.3.1. The physical resource assignments describe
   uu
      the expected resource utilization along with details such as type, amount, location, and whether the resource is
      internal to the organization or outsourced.




                                                                                                        Part 1 - Guide
354
       Project schedule. Described in Section 6.5.3.2. The project schedule shows the resources that are needed,
      uu
         when they are needed, and the location where they are needed.
       Resource breakdown structure. Described in Section 9.2.3.3. The resource breakdown structure provides a
      uu
         reference in case any resource needs to be replaced or reacquired during the course of the project.
       Resource requirements. Described in Section 9.2.3.1. Resource requirements identify the needed material,
      uu
         equipment, supplies, and other resources.
       Risk register. Described in Section 11.2.3.1. The risk register identifies individual risks that can impact
      uu
         equipment, materials, or supplies.

   9.6.1.3 WORK PERFORMANCE DATA

      Described in Section 4.3.3.2. Work performance data contains data on project status such as the number and type
   of resources that have been used.

   9.6.1.4 AGREEMENTS

      Described in Section 12.2.3.2. Agreements made within the context of the project are the basis for all resources
   external to the organization and should define procedures when new, unplanned resources are needed or when issues
   arise with the current resources.

   9.6.1.5 ORGANIZATIONAL PROCESS ASSETS

     The organizational process assets that can influence the Control Resources process include but are not limited to:
       Policies regarding resource control and assignment,
      uu

       Escalation procedures for handling issues within the performing organization, and
      uu

       Lessons learned repository from previous similar projects.

                                                                                                                     355
9.6.2 CONTROL RESOURCES: TOOLS AND TECHNIQUES

9.6.2.1 DATA ANALYSIS

  Data analysis techniques that can be used in this process include but are not limited to:
    Alternatives analysis. Described in Section 9.2.2.5. Alternatives can be analyzed to select the best resolution
   uu
      for correcting variances in resource utilization. Alternatives such as paying additional for overtime or additional
      team resources can be weighed against a late delivery or phased deliveries.
    Cost-benefit analysis. Described in Section 8.1.2.3. This analysis helps to determine the best corrective action
   uu
      in terms of cost in case of project deviations.
    Performance reviews. Performance reviews measure, compare, and analyze planned resource utilization
   uu
      to actual resource utilization. Cost and schedule work performance information can also be analyzed to help
      pinpoint issues that can influence resource utilization.
    Trend analysis. Described in Section 4.5.2.2. As the project progresses, the project team may use trend analysis,
   uu
      based on current performance information, to determine the resources needed at upcoming stages of the project.
      Trend analysis examines project performance over time and can be used to determine whether performance is
      improving or deteriorating.

9.6.2.2 PROBLEM SOLVING

   Described in Section 8.2.2.7. Problem solving may use a set of tools that helps the project manager to solve
problems that arise during the control resource process. The problem can come from inside the organization (machines
or infrastructure used by another department in the organization and not released in time, materials that have been
damaged because of unsuitable storage conditions, etc.) or from outside the organization (major supplier that has gone
bankrupt or bad weather that has damaged resources). The project manager should use methodical steps to deal with
problem solving, which can include:
    Identify the problem. Specify the problem.
   uu

    Define the problem. Break it into smaller, manageable problems.
   uu

    Investigate. Collect data.
   uu

    Analyze. Find the root cause of the problem.
   uu

    Solve. Choose the suitable solution from a variety of available ones.
   uu

    Check the solution. Determine if the problem has been fixed.
   uu




                                                                                                          Part 1 - Guide
356
   9.6.2.3 INTERPERSONAL AND TEAM SKILLS

      Interpersonal and team skills, sometimes known as "soft skills," are personal competencies. The interpersonal and
   team skills used in this process include:
       Negotiation. Described in Section 12.2.2.5. The project manager may need to negotiate for additional physical
      uu
          resources, changes in physical resources, or costs associated with the resources.
       Influencing. Described in Section 9.5.2.1. Influencing can help the project manager solve problems and obtain
      uu
          the resources needed in a timely manner.

   9.6.2.4 PROJECT MANAGEMENT INFORMATION SYSTEM (PMIS)

     Described in Section 4.3.2.2. Project management information systems can include resource management or
   scheduling software that can be used to monitor the resource utilization which helps ensure that the right resources are
   working on the right activities at the right time and place.



   9.6.3 CONTROL RESOURCES: OUTPUTS

   9.6.3.1 WORK PERFORMANCE INFORMATION

      Described in Section 4.5.1.3. Work performance information includes information on how the project work is
   progressing by comparing resource requirements and resource allocation to resource utilization across the project
   activities. This comparison can show gaps in resource availability that need to be addressed.

   9.6.3.2 CHANGE REQUESTS

      Described in Section 4.3.3.4. When change requests occur as a result of carrying out the Control Resources process
   or when recommended, corrective, or preventive actions impact any of the components of the project management
   plan or project documents, the project manager needs to submit a change request. Change requests are processed for
   review and disposition through the Perform Integrated Change Control process (Section 4.6).






                                                                                                                       357
9.6.3.3 PROJECT MANAGEMENT PLAN UPDATES

   Any change to the project management plan goes through the organization's change control process via a change
request. Components that may require a change request for the project management plan include but are not limited to:
    Resource management plan. Described in Section 9.1.3.1. The resource management plan is updated to reflect
   uu
      actual experience in managing project resources.
    Schedule baseline. Described in Section 6.5.3.1. Changes to the project schedule may be required to reflect the
   uu
      way project resources are being managed.
    Cost baseline. Described in Section 7.3.3.1. Changes to the project cost baseline may be required to reflect the
   uu
      way project resources are being managed.

9.6.3.4 PROJECT DOCUMENTS UPDATES

  Project documents that may be updated as a result of performing this process include but are not limited to:
    Assumption log. Described in Section 4.1.3.2. The assumption log may be updated with new assumptions
   uu
      regarding equipment, materials, supplies, and other physical resources.
    Issue log. Described in Section 4.3.3.3. New issues raised as a result of this process are recorded in the
   uu
      issue log.
    Lessons learned register. Described in Section 4.4.3.1. The lessons learned register can be updated with
   uu
      techniques that were effective in managing resource logistics, scrap, utilization variances, and corrective actions
      that were used to respond to resource variances.
    Physical resource assignments. Described in Section 9.3.3.1. Physical resource assignments are dynamic and
   uu
      subject to change due to availability, the project, organization, environment, or other factors.
    Resource breakdown structure. Described in Section 9.2.3.3. Changes to the resource breakdown structure
   uu
      may be required to reflect the way project resources are being used.
    Risk register. Described in Section 11.2.3.1. The risk register is updated with any new risks associated with
   uu
      resource availability, utilization, or other physical resource risks.

    PROJE CT CO MMUNICA TIONS M ANAGEM ENT
      Project Communications Management includes the processes necessary to ensure that the information needs of
   the project and its stakeholders are met through development of artifacts and implementation of activities designed
   to achieve effective information exchange. Project Communications Management consists of two parts. The first part
   is developing a strategy to ensure communication is effective for stakeholders. The second part is carrying out the
   activities necessary to implement the communication strategy.
     The Project Communications Management processes are:
     10.1 Plan Communications Management--The process of developing an appropriate approach and plan for project
   communication activities based on the information needs of each stakeholder or group, available organizational assets,
   and the needs of the project.
      10.2 Manage Communications--The process of ensuring timely and appropriate collection, creation, distribution,
   storage, retrieval, management, monitoring, and the ultimate disposition of project information.
      10.3 Monitor Communications--The process of ensuring the information needs of the project and its stakeholders
   are met.
      Figure 10-1 provides an overview of the Project Communications Management processes. The Project
   Communications Management processes are presented as discrete processes with defined interfaces while, in
   practice, they overlap and interact in ways that cannot be completely detailed in the PMBOK(R) Guide.

KEY CONCEPTS FOR PROJECT COMMUNICATIONS MANAGEMENT

   Communication is the exchange of information, intended or involuntary. The information exchanged can be in the
form of ideas, instructions, or emotions. The mechanisms by which information is exchanged can be in:
    Written form. Either physical or electronic.
   uu

    Spoken. Either face-to-face or remote.
   uu

    Formal or informal (as in formal papers or social media).
   uu

    Through gestures. Tone of voice and facial expressions.
   uu

    Through media. Pictures, actions, or even just the choice of words.
   uu

    Choice of words. There is often more than one word to express an idea; there can be subtle differences in the
   uu
      meaning of each of these words and phrases.




                                                                                                                               Part 1 - Guide
360
      Communications describe the possible means by which the information can be sent or received, either through
   communication activities, such as meetings and presentations, or artifacts, such as emails, social media, project reports,
   or project documentation.
      Project managers spend most of their time communicating with team members and other project stakeholders, both
   internal (at all organizational levels) and external to the organization. Effective communication builds a bridge between
   diverse stakeholders who may have different cultural and organizational backgrounds as well as different levels of
   expertise, perspectives, and interests.
     Communication activities have many dimensions, including but not limited to:
       Internal. Focus on stakeholders within the project and within the organization.
      uu

       External. Focus on external stakeholders such as customers, vendors, other projects, organizations, government,
      uu
          the public, and environmental advocates.
       Formal. Reports, formal meetings (both regular and ad hoc), meeting agendas and minutes, stakeholder briefings,
      uu
          and presentations.
       Informal. General communications activities using emails, social media, websites, and informal ad hoc discussions.
      uu

       Hierarchical focus. The position of the stakeholder or group with respect to the project team will affect the
      uu
          format and content of the message, in the following ways:
          nuUpward. Senior management stakeholders.
          nuDownward. The team and others who will contribute to the work of the project.
          nuHorizontal. Peers of the project manager or team.

       Official. Annual reports; reports to regulators or government bodies.
      uu

       Unofficial. Communications that focus on establishing and maintaining the profile and recognition of the
      uu
          project and building strong relationships between the project team and its stakeholders using flexible and
          often informal means.
       Written and oral. Verbal (words and voice inflections) and nonverbal (body language and actions), social media
      uu
          and websites, media releases.






                                                                                                                        361
      Communication develops the relationships necessary for successful project and program outcomes. Communication
   activities and artifacts to support communication vary widely, ranging from emails and informal conversations to
   formal meetings and regular project reports. The act of sending and receiving information takes place consciously
   or unconsciously through words, facial expressions, gestures and other actions. In the context of successfully
   managing project relationships with stakeholders, communication includes developing strategies and plans for suitable
   communications artifacts and activities with the stakeholder community and the application of skills to enhance the
   effectiveness of the planned and other ad hoc communications.
      There are two parts to successful communication. The first part involves developing an appropriate communication
   strategy based on both the needs of the project and the project's stakeholders. From that strategy, a communications
   management plan is developed to ensure that the appropriate messages are communicated to stakeholders in
   various formats and various means as defined by the communication strategy. These messages constitute the
   project's communications--the second part of successful communication. Project communications are the products
   of the planning process, addressed by the communications management plan that defines the collection, creation,
   dissemination, storage, retrieval, management, tracking, and disposition of these communications artifacts. Finally,
   the communication strategy and communications management plan will form the foundation to monitor the effect of
   the communication.
      The project's communications are supported by efforts to prevent misunderstandings and miscommunication and by
   careful selection of the methods, messengers, and messages developed from the planning process.
      Misunderstandings can be reduced but not eliminated through using the 5Cs of written communications in composing
   a traditional (non-social media) written or spoken message:






                                                                                                         Part 1 - Guide
   362
       Correct grammar and spelling. Poor use of grammar or inaccurate spelling can be distracting and can also
      uu
         introduce distortions in the message, diminishing credibility.
       Concise expression and elimination of excess words. A concise, well-crafted message reduces the
      uu
         opportunities for misunderstanding the intent of the message.
       Clear purpose and expression directed to the needs of the reader. Ensure that the needs and interests of the
      uu
         audience are factored into the message.
       Coherent logical flow of ideas. A coherent logical flow of ideas and using "markers" such as introduction and
      uu
         summaries of the ideas throughout the writing.
       Controlling flow of words and ideas. Controlling the flow of words and ideas may involve graphics or
      uu
         just summaries.
     The 5Cs of written communications are supported by communication skills, such as:
       Listening actively. Staying engaged with the speaker and summarizing conversations to ensure effective
      uu
         information exchange.
       Awareness of cultural and personal differences. Developing the team's awareness of cultural and personal
      uu
         differences to reduce misunderstandings and enhance communication capability.
       Identifying, setting, and managing stakeholder expectations. Negotiating with stakeholders reduces the
      uu
         existence of conflicting expectations among the stakeholder community.
       Enhancement of skills. Enhancing the skills of all team members in the following activities:
      uu

         nuPersuading a person, a team, or an organization to perform an action;
         nuMotivating people and providing encouragement or reassurance;
         nuCoaching to improve performance and achieve desired results;
         nuNegotiating    to achieve mutually acceptable agreements between parties and reduce approval or decision
            delays; and
         nuResolving conflict to prevent disruptive impacts.

      The fundamental attributes of effective communication activities and developing effective communication
   artifacts are:





         nuClarity on the purpose of the communication--defining its purpose;





         nuUnderstanding   as much as possible about the receiver of the communications, meeting needs, and
            preferences; and
         nuMonitoring and measuring the effectiveness of the communications.




                                                                                                                363
TRENDS AND EMERGING PRACTICES IN PROJECT COMMUNICATIONS MANAGEMENT

   Along with a focus on stakeholders and recognition of the value to projects and organizations of effective stakeholder
engagement comes the recognition that developing and implementing appropriate communication strategies is vital
to maintaining effective relationships with stakeholders. Trends and emerging practices for Project Communications
Management include but are not limited to:
    Inclusion of stakeholders in project reviews. The stakeholder community of each project includes individuals,
   uu
       groups, and organizations that the project team has identified as essential to the successful delivery of project
       objectives and organizational outcomes. An effective communication strategy requires regular and timely reviews
       of the stakeholder community and updates to manage changes in its membership and attitudes.
    Inclusion of stakeholders in project meetings. Project meetings should include stakeholders from outside
   uu
       the project and even the organization, where appropriate. Practices inherent in the agile approaches can be
       applied to all types of projects. Practices often include short, daily standup meetings, where the achievements
       and issues of the previous day, and plans for the current day's work, are discussed with the project team and
       key stakeholders.
    Increased use of social computing. Social computing in the form of infrastructure, social media services,
   uu
       and personal devices has changed how organizations and their people communicate and do business. Social
       computing incorporates different approaches to collaboration supported by public IT infrastructure. Social
       networking refers to how users build networks of relationships to explore their interests and activities with
       others. Social media tools can not only support information exchange, but also build relationships accompanied
       by deeper levels of trust and community.
    Multifaceted approaches to communication. The standard communication strategy for project stakeholder
   uu
       communications embraces and selects from all technologies and respects cultural, practical, and personal
       preferences for language, media, content, and delivery. When appropriate, social media and other advanced
       computing technologies may be included. Multifaceted approaches such as these are more effective for
       communicating to stakeholders from different generations and cultures.




                                                                                                          Part 1 - Guide
364
   TAILORING CONSIDERATIONS

      Because each project is unique, the project team will need to tailor the way that Project Communications Management
   processes are applied. Considerations for tailoring include but are not limited to:
       Stakeholders. Are the stakeholders internal or external to the organization, or both?
      uu

       Physical location. What is the physical location of team members? Is the team colocated? Is the team in the
      uu
          same geographical area? Is the team distributed across multiple time zones?
       Communications technology. What technology is available to develop, record, transmit, retrieve, track, and
      uu
          store communication artifacts? What technologies are most appropriate and cost effective for communicating to
          stakeholders?
       Language. Language is a main factor to consider in communication activities. Is one language used? Or are
      uu
          many languages used? Have allowances been made to adjust to the complexity of team members from diverse
          language groups?
       Knowledge management. Does the organization have a formal knowledge management repository? Is the
      uu
          repository used?

   CONSIDERATIONS FOR AGILE/ADAPTIVE ENVIRONMENTS

      Project environments subject to various elements of ambiguity and change have an inherent need to communicate
   evolving and emerging details more frequently and quickly. This motivates streamlining team member access to
   information, frequent team checkpoints, and colocating team members as much as possible.
      In addition, posting project artifacts in a transparent fashion, and holding regular stakeholder reviews are intended to
   promote communication with management and stakeholders.

10.1 PLAN COMMUNICATIONS MANAGEMENT
   Plan Communications Management is the process of developing an appropriate approach and plan for project
communications activities based on the information needs of each stakeholder or group, available organizational
assets, and the needs of the project. The key benefit of this process is a documented approach to effectively and
efficiently engage stakeholders by presenting relevant information in a timely manner. This process is performed
periodically throughout the project as needed. The inputs, tools and techniques, and outputs of the process are depicted
in Figure 10-2. Figure 10-3 depicts the data flow diagram for the process.

      An effective communications management plan that recognizes the diverse information needs of the project's
   stakeholders is developed early in the project life cycle. It should be reviewed regularly and modified when necessary,
   when the stakeholder community changes or at the start of each new project phase.
     On most projects, communications planning is performed very early, during stakeholder identification and project
   management plan development.





      While all projects share the need to communicate project information, the information needs and methods of distribution





   may vary widely. In addition, the methods of storage, retrieval, and ultimate disposition of the project information need
   to be considered and documented during this process. The results of the Plan Communications Management process
   should be reviewed regularly throughout the project and revised as needed to ensure continued applicability.




                                                                                                                            367

   10.1.2.2 COMMUNICATION REQUIREMENTS ANALYSIS

      Analysis of communication requirements determines the information needs of the project stakeholders. These
   requirements are defined by combining the type and format of information needed with an analysis of the value of
   that information.




                                                                                                                369

   uu


10.1.2.3 COMMUNICATION TECHNOLOGY

  The methods used to transfer information among project stakeholders may vary significantly. Common methods
used for information exchange and collaboration include conversations, meetings, written documents, databases, social
media, and websites.
  Factors that can affect the choice of communication technology include:
    Urgency of the need for information. The urgency, frequency, and format of the information to be communicated
   uu
      may vary from project to project and also within different phases of a project.
    Availability and reliability of technology. The technology that is required for distribution of project
   uu
      communications artifacts should be compatible, available, and accessible for all stakeholders throughout
      the project.
    Ease of use. The choice of communication technologies should be suitable for project participants and proper
   uu
      training events should be planned, where appropriate.




                                                                                                       Part 1 - Guide
370
       Project environment. Whether the team will meet and operate on a face-to-face basis or in a virtual environment;
      uu
         whether they will be located in one or multiple time zones; whether they will use multiple languages for
         communication; and finally, whether there are any other project environmental factors, such as various aspects
         of culture, which may constrain the efficiency of the communication.
       Sensitivity and confidentiality of the information. Some aspects to consider are:
      uu

         nuWhether information to be communicated is sensitive or confidential. If so, additional security measures may
             be required.
         nuSocial   media policies for employees to ensure appropriate behavior, security, and the protection of
             proprietary information.

   10.1.2.4 COMMUNICATION MODELS

      Communication models can represent the communication process in its most basic linear form (sender and receiver),
   in a more interactive form that encompasses the additional element of feedback (sender, receiver, and feedback), or in
   a more complex model that incorporates the human elements of the sender(s) or receiver(s) and attempts to show the
   complexity of any communication that involves people.
       Sample basic sender/receiver communication model. This model describes communication as a process
      uu
         and consists of two parties, defined as the sender and receiver. This model is concerned with ensuring that the
         message is delivered, rather than understood. The sequence of steps in a basic communication model is:
         nuEncode. The message is coded into symbols, such as text, sound or some other medium for transmission
             (sending).
         nuTransmit   message. The message is sent via a communication channel. The transmission of this message
             may be compromised by various physical factors such as unfamiliar technology or inadequate infrastructure.
             Noise and other factors may be present and contribute to loss of information in transmission and/or reception
             of the message.
         nuDecode. The data received is translated by the receiver back into a form useful to the receiver.






                                                                                                                      371
   Sample interactive communication model. This model also describes communication as a process consisting
  uu
      of two parties, the sender and receiver, but recognizes the need to ensure that the message has been understood.
      In this model, noise includes any interference or barriers that might compromise the understanding of the
      message, such as the distraction of the receiver, variations in the perceptions of receivers, or lack of appropriate
      knowledge or interest. The additional steps in an interactive communication model are:
      nuAcknowledge. Upon receipt of a message, the receiver may signal (acknowledge) receipt of the message, but
         this does not necessarily mean agreement with or comprehension of the message--merely that it has been
         received.
      nuFeedback/response.    When the received message has been decoded and understood, the receiver
         encodes thoughts and ideas into a message and then transmits this message to the original sender. If
         the sender perceives that the feedback matches the original message, the communication has been
         successful. In communication between people, feedback can be achieved through active listening,
         described in Section 10.2.2.6.
      As part of the communication process, the sender is responsible for the transmission of the message, ensuring
      the information being communicated is clear and complete, and confirming the message is correctly interpreted.
      The receiver is responsible for ensuring that the information is received in its entirety, interpreted correctly, and
      acknowledged or responded to appropriately. These components take place in an environment where there will
      likely be noise and other barriers to effective communication.




                                                                                                           Part 1 - Guide
372
      Cross-cultural communication presents challenges to ensuring that the meaning of the message has been
   understood. Differences in communication styles can arise from differences in working methods, age, nationality,
   professional discipline, ethnicity, race, or gender. People from different cultures communicate using different languages
   (e.g., technical design documents, different styles) and expect different processes and protocols.
      The communication model shown in Figure 10-4 incorporates the idea that the message itself and how it is
   transmitted are influenced by the sender's current emotional state, knowledge, background, personality, culture, and
   biases. Similarly, the receiver's emotional state knowledge, background, personality, culture, and biases will influence
   how the message is received and interpreted, and will contribute to the barriers or noise.
     This communication model and its enhancements can assist in developing communication strategies and plans for
   person-to-person or even small group to small group communications. It is not useful for other communications artifacts
   such as emails, broadcast messages, or social media.

10.1.2.5 COMMUNICATION METHODS

  There are several communication methods that are used to share information among project stakeholders. These
methods are broadly classified as follows:
    Interactive communication. Between two or more parties performing a multidirectional exchange of information
   uu
      in real time. It employs communications artifacts such as meetings, phone calls, instant messaging, some forms
      of social media, and videoconferencing.
    Push communication. Sent or distributed directly to specific recipients who need to receive the information.
   uu
      This ensures that the information is distributed but does not ensure that it actually reached or was understood
      by the intended audience. Push communications artifacts include letters, memos, reports, emails, faxes, voice
      mails, blogs, and press releases.
    Pull communication. Used for large complex information sets, or for large audiences, and requires the recipients
   uu
      to access content at their own discretion subject to security procedures. These methods include web portals,
      intranet sites, e-learning, lessons learned databases, or knowledge repositories.
  Different approaches should be applied to meet the needs of the major forms of communication defined in the
communications management plan:
    Interpersonal communication. Information is exchanged between individuals, typically face-to-face.
   uu

    Small group communication. Occurs within groups of around three to six people.
   uu

    Public communication. A single speaker addressing a group of people.
   uu

    Mass communication. There is a minimal connection between the person or group sending the message and
   uu
      the large, sometimes anonymous groups for whom the information is intended.
    Networks and social computing communication. Supports emerging communication trends of many-to-many
   uu
      supported by social computing technology and media.




                                                                                                      Part 1 - Guide
374
     Possible communications artifacts and methods include but are not limited to:
      Notice boards,
     uu

      Newsletters/in-house magazines/e-magazines,
     uu

      Letters to staff/volunteers,
     uu

      Press releases,
     uu

      Annual reports,
     uu

      Emails and intranets,
     uu

      Web portals and other information repositories (for pull communication)
     uu

      Phone conversations,
     uu

      Presentations,
     uu

      Team briefings/group meetings,
     uu

      Focus groups,
     uu

      Face-to-face formal or informal meetings between various stakeholders,
     uu

      Consultation groups or staff forums, and
     uu

      Social computing technology and media.
     uu


   10.1.2.6 INTERPERSONAL AND TEAM SKILLS

     Interpersonal and team skills that can be used for this process include but are not limited to:
      Communication styles assessment. A technique used to assess communication styles and identify the
     uu
         preferred communication method, format, and content for planned communication activities. Often used with
         unsupportive stakeholders, this assessment may follow a stakeholder engagement assessment (described in
         Section 13.2.2.5) to identify gaps in stakeholder engagement that require additional tailored communication
         activities and artifacts.






                                                                                                                375
    Political awareness. Political awareness helps the project manager to plan communications based on the project
   uu
       environment as well as the organization's political environment. Political awareness concerns the recognition of
       power relationships, both formal and informal, and also the willingness to operate within these structures. An
       understanding of the strategies of the organization, knowing who wields power and influence in this arena, and
       developing an ability to communicate with these stakeholders are all aspects of political awareness.
    Cultural awareness. Cultural awareness is an understanding of the differences between individuals, groups,
   uu
       and organizations and adapting the project's communication strategy in the context of these differences. This
       awareness and any consequent actions minimize misunderstandings and miscommunication that may result from
       cultural differences within the project's stakeholder community. Cultural awareness and cultural sensitivity help
       the project manager to plan communications based on the cultural differences and requirements of stakeholders
       and team members.

10.1.2.7 DATA REPRESENTATION

   A data representation technique that can be used for this process includes but is not limited to a stakeholder
engagement assessment matrix. Described in Section 13.2.2.5. The stakeholder engagement assessment matrix,
shown in Figure 13-6, displays gaps between current and desired engagement levels of individual stakeholders, it can
be further analyzed in this process to identify additional communication requirements (beyond the regular reports) as a
method to close any engagement level gaps.

10.1.2.8 MEETINGS

   Project meetings can include virtual (e-meetings) or face-to-face meetings, and can be supported with document
collaboration technologies, including email messages and project websites. The Plan Communications Management
process requires discussion with the project team to determine the most appropriate way to update and communicate
project information, and to respond to requests from various stakeholders for information.




                                                                                                         Part 1 - Guide

   10.1.3 PLAN COMMUNICATIONS MANAGEMENT: OUTPUTS

   10.1.3.1 COMMUNICATIONS MANAGEMENT PLAN

       The communications management plan is a component of the project management plan that describes how project
   communications will be planned, structured, implemented, and monitored for effectiveness. The plan contains the
   following information:
       Stakeholder communication requirements;
      uu

       Information to be communicated, including language, format, content, and level of detail;
      uu

       Escalation processes;
      uu

       Reason for the distribution of that information;
      uu

       Timeframe and frequency for the distribution of required information and receipt of acknowledgment or response,
      uu
         if applicable;
       Person responsible for communicating the information;
      uu

       Person responsible for authorizing release of confidential information;
      uu

       Person or groups who will receive the information, including information about their needs, requirements, and
      uu
         expectations;
       Methods or technologies used to convey the information, such as memos, email, press releases, or social media;
      uu

       Resources allocated for communication activities, including time and budget;
      uu

       Method for updating and refining the communications management plan as the project progresses and develops,
      uu
         such as when the stakeholder community changes as the project moves through different phases;
       Glossary of common terminology;
      uu

       Flow charts of the information flow in the project, workflows with possible sequence of authorization, list of
      uu
         reports, meeting plans, etc.; and
       Constraints derived from specific legislation or regulation, technology, organizational policies, etc.
      uu





      The communications management plan can include guidelines and templates for project status meetings, project
   team meetings, e-meetings, and email messages. The use of a project website and project management software can





   be included if these are to be used in the project.




                                                                                                                  377
10.1.3.2 PROJECT MANAGEMENT PLAN UPDATES


Any change to the project management plan goes through the organization's change control process via a change
request. Components that may require a change request for the project management plan include but are not limited
to the stakeholder engagement plan, which is described in Section 13.2.3.1. The stakeholder engagement plan is
updated to reflect any processes, procedures, tools, or techniques that affect the engagement of stakeholders in project
decisions and execution.


10.1.3.3 PROJECT DOCUMENTS UPDATES

  Project documents that may be updated as a result of carrying out this process include but are not limited to:
    Project schedule. Described in Section 6.5.3.2. The project schedule may be updated to reflect communication
   uu
       activities.
    Stakeholder register. Described in Section 13.1.3.1.The stakeholder register may be updated to reflect
   uu
       communications planned.




                                                                                                         Part 1 - Guide

   10.2 MANAGE COMMUNICATIONS
      Manage Communications is the process of ensuring timely and appropriate collection, creation, distribution, storage,
   retrieval, management, monitoring, and the ultimate disposition of project information. The key benefit of this process is
   that it enables an efficient and effective information flow between the project team and the stakeholders. This process
   is performed throughout the project.
      The Manage Communications process identifies all aspects of effective communication, including choice of
   appropriate technologies, methods, and techniques. In addition, it should allow for flexibility in the communications
   activities, allowing adjustments in the methods and techniques to accommodate the changing needs of stakeholders
   and the project. The inputs, tools, techniques, and outputs of this process are depicted in Figure 10-5. Figure 10-6
   depicts the data flow diagram of the Manage Communications process.

      This process goes beyond the distribution of relevant information and seeks to ensure that the information being
   communicated to project stakeholders has been appropriately generated and formatted, and received by the intended
   audience. It also provides opportunities for stakeholders to make requests for further information, clarification, and
   discussion. Techniques and considerations for effective communications management include but are not limited to:
       Sender-receiver models. Incorporating feedback loops to provide opportunities for interaction/participation and
      uu
         remove barriers to effective communication.
       Choice of media. Decisions about application of communications artifacts to meet specific project needs, such
      uu
         as when to communicate in writing versus orally, when to prepare an informal memo versus a formal report, and
         when to use push/pull options and the choice of appropriate technology.
       Writing style. Appropriate use of active versus passive voice, sentence structure, and word choice.

   effect of increasing or maintaining stakeholders' support for the project's deliverables and expected outcomes. The
   impact and consequences of project communications should be carefully evaluated and monitored to ensure that the
   right message with the right content (the same meaning for sender and receiver) is delivered to the right audience,





   through the right channel, and at the right time. Monitor Communications may require a variety of methods, such as
   customer satisfaction surveys, collecting lessons learned, observations of the team, reviewing data from the issue log,





   or evaluating changes in the stakeholder engagement assessment matrix described in Section 13.2.2.5.
     The Monitor Communications process can trigger an iteration of the Plan Communications Management and/or
   Manage Communications processes to improve effectiveness of communication through additional and possibly amended
   communications plans and activities. Such iterations illustrate the continuous nature of the Project Communications
   Management processes. Issues or key performance indicators, risks, or conflicts may trigger an immediate revision.

    PROJE CT R I SK MANA GEM ENT
      Project Risk Management includes the processes of conducting risk management planning, identification, analysis,
   response planning, response implementation, and monitoring risk on a project. The objectives of project risk management
   are to increase the probability and/or impact of positive risks and to decrease the probability and/or impact of negative
   risks, in order to optimize the chances of project success.
     The Project Risk Management processes are:
     11.1 Plan Risk Management--The process of defining how to conduct risk management activities for a project.
     11.2 Identify Risks--The process of identifying individual project risks as well as sources of overall project risk,
   and documenting their characteristics.
      11.3 Perform Qualitative Risk Analysis--The process of prioritizing individual project risks for further analysis
   or action by assessing their probability of occurrence and impact as well as other characteristics.
      11.4 Perform Quantitative Risk Analysis--The process of numerically analyzing the combined effect of identified
   individual project risks and other sources of uncertainty on overall project objectives.
     11.5 Plan Risk Responses--The process of developing options, selecting strategies, and agreeing on actions to
   address overall project risk exposure, as well as to treat individual project risks.
     11.6 Implement Risk Responses--The process of implementing agreed-upon risk response plans.
      11.7 Monitor Risks--The process of monitoring the implementation of agreed-upon risk response plans,
   tracking identified risks, identifying and analyzing new risks, and evaluating risk process effectiveness throughout
   the project.





      Figure 11-1 provides an overview of the Project Risk Management processes. The Project Management Risk processes





   are presented as discrete processes with defined interfaces while, in practice, they overlap and interact in ways that
   cannot be completely detailed in this PMBOK(R) Guide.

   KEY CONCEPTS FOR PROJECT RISK MANAGEMENT

      All projects are risky since they are unique undertakings with varying degrees of complexity that aim to deliver
   benefits. They do this in a context of constraints and assumptions, while responding to stakeholder expectations that
   may be conflicting and changing. Organizations should choose to take project risk in a controlled and intentional manner
   in order to create value while balancing risk and reward.
      Project Risk Management aims to identify and manage risks that are not addressed by the other project management
   processes. When unmanaged, these risks have the potential to cause the project to deviate from the plan and fail to
   achieve the defined project objectives. Consequently, the effectiveness of Project Risk Management is directly related
   to project success.
      Risk exists at two levels within every project. Each project contains individual risks that can affect the achievement of
   project objectives. It is also important to consider the riskiness of the overall project, which arises from the combination
   of individual project risks and other sources of uncertainty. Project Risk Management processes address both levels of
   risk in projects, and these are defined as follows:
       Individual project risk is an uncertain event or condition that, if it occurs, has a positive or negative effect on
      uu
          one or more project objectives.
       Overall project risk is the effect of uncertainty on the project as a whole, arising from all sources of uncertainty
      uu
          including individual risks, representing the exposure of stakeholders to the implications of variations in project
          outcome, both positive and negative.
      Individual project risks can have a positive or negative effect on project objectives if they occur. Project Risk
   Management aims to exploit or enhance positive risks (opportunities) while avoiding or mitigating negative risks
   (threats). Unmanaged threats may result in issues or problems such as delay, cost overruns, performance shortfall,
   or loss of reputation. Opportunities that are captured can lead to benefits such as reduced time and cost, improved
   performance, or reputation.
     Overall project risk can also be positive or negative. Management of overall project risk aims to keep project risk
   exposure within an acceptable range by reducing drivers of negative variation, promoting drivers of positive variation,
   and maximizing the probability of achieving overall project objectives.






                                                                                                                          397
    Risks will continue to emerge during the lifetime of the project, so Project Risk Management processes should be conducted
iteratively. Risk is initially addressed during project planning by shaping the project strategy. Risk should also be monitored and
managed as the project progresses to ensure that the project stays on track and emergent risks are addressed.
   In order to manage risk effectively on a particular project, the project team needs to know what level of risk exposure
is acceptable in pursuit of the project objectives. This is defined by measurable risk thresholds that reflect the risk
appetite of the organization and project stakeholders. Risk thresholds express the degree of acceptable variation around
a project objective. They are explicitly stated and communicated to the project team and reflected in the definitions of
risk impact levels for the project.

TRENDS AND EMERGING PRACTICES IN PROJECT RISK MANAGEMENT

   The focus of project risk management is broadening to ensure that all types of risk are considered, and that project
risks are understood in a wider context. Trends and emerging practices for Project Risk Management include but are
not limited to:
    Non-event risks. Most projects focus only on risks that are uncertain future events that may or may not occur.
   uu
       Examples of event-based risks include: a key seller may go out of business during the project, the customer may
       change the requirement after design is complete, or a subcontractor may propose enhancements to the standard
       operating processes.
       There is an increasing recognition that non-event risks need to be identified and managed. There are two main
       types of non-event risks:
       nuVariability  risk. Uncertainty exists about some key characteristics of a planned event or activity or decision.
           Examples of variability risks include: productivity may be above or below target, the number of errors found
           during testing may be higher or lower than expected, or unseasonal weather conditions may occur during the
           construction phase.
       nuAmbiguity    risk. Uncertainty exists about what might happen in the future. Areas of the project where
           imperfect knowledge might affect the project's ability to achieve its objectives include: elements of the
           requirement or technical solution, future developments in regulatory frameworks, or inherent systemic
           complexity in the project.




                                                                                                                   Part 1 - Guide
398
   Variability risks can be addressed using Monte Carlo analysis, with the range of variation reflected in probability
   distributions, followed by actions to reduce the spread of possible outcomes. Ambiguity risks are managed by
   defining those areas where there is a deficit of knowledge or understanding, then filling the gap by obtaining
   expert external input or benchmarking against best practices. Ambiguity is also addressed through incremental
   development, prototyping, or simulation.
 Project resilience. The existence of emergent risk is becoming clear, with a growing awareness of so-called
uu
   unknowable-unknowns. These are risks that can only be recognized after they have occurred. Emergent risks
   can be tackled through developing project resilience. This requires each project to have:
   nuRightlevel of budget and schedule contingency for emergent risks, in addition to a specific risk budget for
      known risks;
   nuFlexible project processes that can cope with emergent risk while maintaining overall direction toward project
      goals, including strong change management;
   nuEmpowered       project team that has clear objectives and that is trusted to get the job done within agreed-
      upon limits;
   nuFrequent review of early warning signs to identify emergent risks as early as possible; and
   nuClear input from stakeholders to clarify areas where the project scope or strategy can be adjusted in response
      to emergent risks.
 Integrated risk management. Projects exist in an organizational context, and they may form part of a program
uu
   or portfolio. Risk exists at each of these levels, and risks should be owned and managed at the appropriate level.
   Some risks identified at higher levels will be delegated to the project team for management, and some project
   risks may be escalated to higher levels if they are best managed outside the project. A coordinated approach to
   enterprise-wide risk management ensures alignment and coherence in the way risk is managed across all levels.
   This builds risk efficiency into the structure of programs and portfolios, providing the greatest overall value for a
   given level of risk exposure.




                                                                                                                   399
TAILORING CONSIDERATIONS

  Because each project is unique, it is necessary to tailor the way Project Risk Management processes are applied.
Considerations for tailoring include but are not limited to:
    Project size. Does the project's size in terms of budget, duration, scope, or team size require a more detailed
   uu
       approach to risk management? Or is it small enough to justify a simplified risk process?
    Project complexity. Is a robust risk approach demanded by high levels of innovation, new technology, commercial
   uu
       arrangements, interfaces, or external dependencies that increase project complexity? Or is the project simple
       enough that a reduced risk process will suffice?
    Project importance. How strategically important is the project? Is the level of risk increased for this project
   uu
       because it aims to produce breakthrough opportunities, addresses significant blocks to organizational
       performance, or involves major product innovation?
    Development approach. Is this a waterfall project, where risk processes can be followed sequentially and
   uu
       iteratively, or does the project follow an agile approach where risk is addressed at the start of each iteration as
       well as during its execution?
   Tailoring of the Project Risk Management processes to meet these considerations is part of the Plan Risk Management
process, and the outcomes of tailoring decisions are recorded in the risk management plan.

CONSIDERATIONS FOR AGILE/ADAPTIVE ENVIRONMENTS

  High-variability environments, by definition, incur more uncertainty and risk. To address this, projects managed using
adaptive approaches make use of frequent reviews of incremental work products and cross-functional project teams to
accelerate knowledge sharing and ensure that risk is understood and managed. Risk is considered when selecting the
content of each iteration, and risks will also be identified, analyzed, and managed during each iteration.
   Additionally, the requirements are kept as a living document that is updated regularly, and work may be reprioritized
as the project progresses, based on an improved understanding of current risk exposure.

   11.1 PLAN RISK MANAGEMENT
      Plan Risk Management is the process of defining how to conduct risk management activities for a project. The key
   benefit of this process is that it ensures that the degree, type, and visibility of risk management are proportionate to both
   risks and the importance of the project to the organization and other stakeholders. This process is performed once or
   at predefined points in the project. The inputs, tools and techniques, and outputs of the process are depicted in Figure
   11-2. Figure 11-3 depicts the data flow diagram for the process.

    The Plan Risk Management process should begin when a project is conceived and should be completed early in the
project. It may be necessary to revisit this process later in the project life cycle, for example at a major phase change, or
if the project scope changes significantly, or if a subsequent review of risk management effectiveness determines that
the Project Risk Management process requires modification.



11.1.1 PLAN RISK MANAGEMENT: INPUTS

11.1.1.1 PROJECT CHARTER

   Described in Section 4.1.3.1. The project charter documents the high-level project description and boundaries, high-
level requirements, and risks.




                                                                                                                                Part 1 - Guide
402
11.1.1.2 PROJECT MANAGEMENT PLAN

  Described in Section 4.2.3.1. In planning Project Risk Management, all approved subsidiary management plans
should be taken into consideration in order to make the risk management plan consistent with them. The methodology
outlined in other project management plan components might influence the Plan Risk Management process.

11.1.1.3 PROJECT DOCUMENTS

   Project documents that can be considered as inputs for this process include but are not limited to the stakeholder
register as described in Section 13.1.3.1. The stakeholder register contains details of the project's stakeholders and
provides an overview of their project roles and their attitude toward risk on this project. This is useful in determining
roles and responsibilities for managing risk on the project, as well as setting risk thresholds for the project.

11.1.1.4 ENTERPRISE ENVIRONMENTAL FACTORS

   The enterprise environmental factors that can influence the Plan Risk Management process include but are not
limited to overall risk thresholds set by the organization or key stakeholders.

11.1.1.5 ORGANIZATIONAL PROCESS ASSETS

   The organizational process assets that can influence the Plan Risk Management process include but are not
limited to:
    Organizational risk policy;
   uu

    Risk categories, possibly organized into a risk breakdown structure;
   uu

    Common definitions of risk concepts and terms;
   uu

    Risk statement formats;
   uu

    Templates for the risk management plan, risk register, and risk report;
   uu

    Roles and responsibilities;
   uu

    Authority levels for decision making; and
   uu

    Lessons learned repository from previous similar projects.
   uu




                                                                                                                     403
11.1.2 PLAN RISK MANAGEMENT: TOOLS AND TECHNIQUES

11.1.2.1 EXPERT JUDGMENT

   Described in Section 4.1.2.1. Expertise should be considered from individuals or groups with specialized knowledge
or training in the following topics:
    Familiarity with the organization's approach to managing risk, including enterprise risk management where this
   uu
       is performed;
    Tailoring risk management to the specific needs of a project; and
   uu

    Types of risk that are likely to be encountered on projects in the same area.
   uu


11.1.2.2 DATA ANALYSIS

   Data analysis techniques that can be used for this process includes but are not limited to a stakeholder analysis
(Section 13.1.2.3) to determine the risk appetite of project stakeholders.

11.1.2.3 MEETINGS

   The risk management plan may be developed as part of the project kick-off meeting or a specific planning meeting
may be held. Attendees may include the project manager, selected project team members, key stakeholders, or team
members who are responsible to manage the risk management process on the project. Others outside the organization
may also be invited, as needed, including customers, sellers, and regulators. A skilled facilitator can help participants
remain focused on the task, agree on key aspects of the risk approach, identify and overcome sources of bias, and
resolve any disagreements that may arise.
  Plans for conducting risk management activities are defined in these meetings and documented in the risk
management plan (see Section 11.1.3.1).




                                                                                                          Part 1 - Guide

   11.1.3 PLAN RISK MANAGEMENT: OUTPUTS

   11.1.3.1 RISK MANAGEMENT PLAN

      The risk management plan is a component of the project management plan that describes how risk management
   activities will be structured and performed. The risk management plan may include some or all of the following elements:
       Risk strategy. Describes the general approach to managing risk on this project.
      uu

       Methodology. Defines the specific approaches, tools, and data sources that will be used to perform risk
      uu
          management on the project.
       Roles and responsibilities. Defines the lead, support, and risk management team members for each type of
      uu
          activity described in the risk management plan, and clarifies their responsibilities.
       Funding. Identifies the funds needed to perform activities related to Project Risk Management. Establishes
      uu
          protocols for the application of contingency and management reserves.
       Timing. Defines when and how often the Project Risk Management processes will be performed throughout the
      uu
          project life cycle, and establishes risk management activities for inclusion into the project schedule.
       Risk categories. Provide a means for grouping individual project risks. A common way to structure risk categories
      uu
          is with a risk breakdown structure (RBS), which is a hierarchical representation of potential sources of risk (see
          example in Figure 11-4). An RBS helps the project team consider the full range of sources from which individual
          project risks may arise. This can be useful when identifying risks or when categorizing identified risks. The
          organization may have a generic RBS to be used for all projects, or there may be several RBS frameworks for
          different types of projects, or the project may develop a tailored RBS. Where an RBS is not used, an organization
          may use a custom risk categorization framework, which may take the form of a simple list of categories or a
          structure based on project objectives.

 Stakeholder risk appetite. The risk appetites of key stakeholders on the project are recorded in the risk
uu
   management plan, as they inform the details of the Plan Risk Management process. In particular, stakeholder risk
   appetite should be expressed as measurable risk thresholds around each project objective. These thresholds will
   determine the acceptable level of overall project risk exposure, and they are also used to inform the definitions of
   probability and impacts to be used when assessing and prioritizing individual project risks.
 Definitions of risk probability and impacts. Definitions of risk probability and impact levels are specific to the
uu
   project context and reflect the risk appetite and thresholds of the organization and key stakeholders. The project
   may generate specific definitions of probability and impact levels or it may start with general definitions provided
   by the organization. The number of levels reflects the degree of detail required for the Project Risk Management
   process, with more levels used for a more detailed risk approach (typically five levels), and fewer for a simple
   process (usually three). Table 11-1 provides an example of definitions of probability and impacts against three
   project objectives. These scales can be used to evaluate both threats and opportunities by interpreting the impact
   definitions as negative for threats (delay, additional cost, and performance shortfall) and positive for opportunities
   (reduced time or cost, and performance enhancement).

   Probability and impact matrix. Described in Section 11.3.2.6. Prioritization rules may be specified by the
  uu
      organization in advance of the project and be included in organizational process assets, or they may be tailored to
      the specific project. Opportunities and threats are represented in a common probability and impact matrix using
      positive definitions of impact for opportunities and negative impact definitions for threats. Descriptive terms
      (such as very high, high, medium, low, and very low) or numeric values can be used for probability and impact.
      Where numeric values are used, these can be multiplied to give a probability-impact score for each risk, which
      allows the relative priority of individual risks to be evaluated within each priority level. An example probability and
      impact matrix is presented in Figure 11-5, which also shows a possible numeric risk scoring scheme.

   Reporting formats. Reporting formats define how the outcomes of the Project Risk Management process will
  uu
      be documented, analyzed, and communicated. This section of the risk management plan describes the content
      and format of the risk register and the risk report, as well as any other required outputs from the Project Risk
      Management processes.
   Tracking. Tracking documents how risk activities will be recorded and how risk management processes will
  uu
      be audited.

   11.2 IDENTIFY RISKS
       Identify Risks is the process of identifying individual project risks as well as sources of overall project risk, and
   documenting their characteristics. The key benefit of this process is the documentation of existing individual project risks
   and the sources of overall project risk. It also brings together information so the project team can respond appropriately
   to identified risks. This process is performed throughout the project. The inputs, tools and techniques, and outputs of the
   process are depicted in Figure 11-6. Figure 11-7 depicts the data flow diagram for the process.

       Identify Risks considers both individual project risks and sources of overall project risk. Participants in risk
   identification activities may include the following: project manager, project team members, project risk specialist
   (if assigned), customers, subject matter experts from outside the project team, end users, other project managers,
   operations managers, stakeholders, and risk management experts within the organization. While these personnel are
   often key participants for risk identification, all project stakeholders should be encouraged to identify individual project
   risks. It is particularly important to involve the project team so they can develop and maintain a sense of ownership and
   responsibility for identified individual project risks, the level of overall project risk, and associated risk response actions.
     When describing and recording individual project risks, a consistent format should be used for risk statements to
   ensure that each risk is understood clearly and unambiguously in order to support effective analysis and risk response
   development. Risk owners for individual project risks may be nominated as part of the Identify Risks process, and will
   be confirmed during the Perform Qualitative Risk Analysis process. Preliminary risk responses may also be identified
   and recorded and will be reviewed and confirmed as part of the Plan Risk Responses process.
       Identify Risks is an iterative process, since new individual project risks may emerge as the project progresses through
   its life cycle and the level of overall project risk will also change. The frequency of iteration and participation in each risk
   identification cycle will vary by situation, and this will be defined in the risk management plan.



   11.2.1 IDENTIFY RISKS: INPUTS

   11.2.1.1 PROJECT MANAGEMENT PLAN

      Described in Section 4.2.3.1. Project management plan components include but are not limited to:
       Requirements management plan. Described in Section 5.1.3.2. The requirements management plan may
      uu
          indicate project objectives that are particularly at risk.
       Schedule management plan. Described in Section 6.1.3.1. The schedule management plan may identify areas
      uu
          that are subject to uncertainty or ambiguity.
       Cost management plan. Described in Section 7.1.3.1. The cost management plan may identify areas that are
      uu
          subject to uncertainty or ambiguity.
       Quality management plan. Described in Section 8.1.3.1. The quality management plan may identify areas that
      uu





          are subject to uncertainty or ambiguity, or where key assumptions have been made that might give rise to risk.





       Resource management plan. Described in Section 9.1.3.1. The resource management plan may identify
      uu
          areas that are subject to uncertainty or ambiguity, or where key assumptions have been made that might give
          rise to risk.




                                                                                                                              411
   Risk management plan. Described in Section 11.1.3.1. The risk management plan provides information on
  uu
      risk-related roles and responsibilities, indicates how risk management activities are included in the budget and
      schedule, and describes categories of risk, which may be expressed as a risk breakdown structure (Figure 11-4).
   Scope baseline. Described in Section 5.4.3.1. The scope baseline includes deliverables and criteria for their
  uu
      acceptance, some of which might give rise to risk. It also contains the WBS, which can be used as a framework
      to structure risk identification techniques.
   Schedule baseline. Described in Section 6.5.3.1. The schedule baseline may be reviewed to identify milestones
  uu
      and deliverable due dates that are subject to uncertainty or ambiguity, or where key assumptions have been
      made that might give rise to risk.
   Cost baseline. Described in Section 7.3.3.1. The cost baseline may be reviewed to identify costs or funding
  uu
      requirements that are subject to uncertainty or ambiguity, or where key assumptions have been made that might
      give rise to risk.

11.2.1.2 PROJECT DOCUMENTS

  Project documents that can be considered as inputs for this process include but are not limited to:
   Assumption log. Described in Section 4.1.3.2. Assumptions and constraints recorded in the assumption log may
  uu
      give rise to individual project risks and may also influence the level of overall project risk.
   Cost estimates. Described in Section 7.2.3.1. Cost estimates provide quantitative assessments of project costs,
  uu
      ideally expressed as a range, indicating the degree of risk, where a structured review of the documents may
      indicate that the current estimate is insufficient and poses a risk to the project.
   Duration estimates. Described in Section 6.4.3.1. Duration estimates provide quantitative assessments of
  uu
      project durations, ideally expressed as a range, indicating the degree of risk, where a structured review of the
      documents may indicate that the current estimate is insufficient and poses a risk to the project.
   Issue log. Described in Section 4.3.3.3. Issues recorded in the issue log may give rise to individual project risks
  uu
      and may also influence the level of overall project risk.
   Lessons learned register. Described in Section 4.4.3.1. Lessons learned about risk identified from earlier phases
  uu
      of the project are reviewed to determine whether similar risks might recur during the remainder of the project.
   Requirements documentation. Described in Section 5.2.3.1. Requirements documentation lists the project
  uu
      requirements and allows the team to identify those that could be at risk.




                                                                                                        Part 1 - Guide
412
    Resource requirements. Described in Section 9.2.3.1. Resource requirements provide quantitative
   uu
      assessments of project resource requirements, ideally expressed as a range, indicating the degree of risk,
      where a structured review of the documents may indicate that the current estimate is insufficient and poses
      a risk to the project.
    Stakeholder register. Described in Section 13.1.3.1. The stakeholder register indicates which individuals or
   uu
      groups might participate in identifying risks to the project. It also details those individuals who are available to
      act as risk owners.

11.2.1.3 AGREEMENTS

   Described in Section 12.2.3.2. If the project requires external procurement of resources, the agreements may have
information such as milestone dates, contract type, acceptance criteria, and awards and penalties that can present
threats or opportunities.

11.2.1.4 PROCUREMENT DOCUMENTATION

   Described in Section 12.3.1.4. If the project requires external procurement of resources, the initial procurement
documentation should be reviewed as procuring goods and services from outside the organization may increase or
decrease overall project risk and may introduce additional individual project risks. As the procurement documentation
is updated throughout the project, the most up to date documentation can be reviewed for risks. For example, seller
performance reports, approved change requests and information on inspections.

11.2.1.5 ENTERPRISE ENVIRONMENTAL FACTORS

  The enterprise environmental factors that can influence the Identify Risks process include but are not limited to:
    Published material, including commercial risk databases or checklists,
   uu

    Academic studies,
   uu

    Benchmarking results, and
   uu

    Industry studies of similar projects.
   uu


11.2.1.6 ORGANIZATIONAL PROCESS ASSETS

  The organizational process assets that can influence the Identify Risks process include but are not limited to:
    Project files, including actual data,
   uu

    Organizational and project process controls,
   uu

    Risk statement formats, and
   uu

11.2.2 IDENTIFY RISKS: TOOLS AND TECHNIQUES

11.2.2.1 EXPERT JUDGMENT

    Described in Section 4.1.2.1. Expertise should be considered from individuals or groups with specialized knowledge
of similar projects or business areas. Such experts should be identified by the project manager and invited to consider
all aspects of individual project risks as well as sources of overall project risk, based on their previous experience and
areas of expertise. The experts' bias should be taken into account in this process.

11.2.2.2 DATA GATHERING

  Data-gathering techniques that can be used for this process include but are not limited to:
    Brainstorming. The goal of brainstorming (see Section 4.1.2.2) is to obtain a comprehensive list of individual
   uu
       project risks and sources of overall project risk. The project team usually performs brainstorming, often with
       a multidisciplinary set of experts who are not part of the team. Ideas are generated under the guidance of a
       facilitator, either in a free-form brainstorm session or one that uses more structured techniques. Categories of
       risk, such as in a risk breakdown structure, can be used as a framework. Particular attention should be paid to
       ensuring that risks identified through brainstorming are clearly described, since the technique can result in ideas
       that are not fully formed.
    Checklists. A checklist is a list of items, actions, or points to be considered. It is often used as a reminder.
   uu
       Risk checklists are developed based on historical information and knowledge that has been accumulated from
       similar projects and from other sources of information. They are an effective way to capture lessons learned
       from similar completed projects, listing specific individual project risks that have occurred previously and that
       may be relevant to this project. The organization may maintain a risk checklist based on its own completed
       projects or may use generic risk checklists from the industry. While a checklist may be quick and simple to use,
       it is impossible to build an exhaustive one, and care should be taken to ensure the checklist is not used to avoid
       the effort of proper risk identification. The project team should also explore items that do not appear on the
       checklist. Additionally, the checklist should be reviewed from time to time to update new information as well as
       remove or archive obsolete information.
    Interviews. Individual project risks and sources of overall project risk can be identified by interviewing experienced
   uu
       project participants, stakeholders, and subject matter experts. Interviews (see Section 5.2.2.2) should be
       conducted in an environment of trust and confidentiality to encourage honest and unbiased contributions.




                                                                                                           Part 1 - Guide
414
11.2.2.3 DATA ANALYSIS

  Data analysis techniques that can be used for this process include but are not limited to:
   Root cause analysis. Root cause analysis (see Section 8.2.2.2) is typically used to discover the underlying
  uu
      causes that lead to a problem, and develop preventive action. It can be used to identify threats by starting with a
      problem statement (for example, the project might be delayed or over budget) and exploring which threats might
      result in that problem occurring. The same technique can be used to find opportunities by starting with a benefit
      statement (for example, early delivery or under budget) and exploring which opportunities might result in that
      benefit being realized.
   Assumption and constraint analysis. Every project and its project management plan are conceived
  uu
      and developed based on a set of assumptions and within a series of constraints. These are often already
      incorporated in the scope baseline and project estimates. Assumption and constraint analysis explores the
      validity of assumptions and constraints to determine which pose a risk to the project. Threats may be identified
      from the inaccuracy, instability, inconsistency, or incompleteness of assumptions. Constraints may give rise to
      opportunities through removing or relaxing a limiting factor that affects the execution of a project or process.
   SWOT analysis. This technique examines the project from each of the strengths, weaknesses, opportunities,
  uu
      and threats (SWOT) perspectives. For risk identification, it is used to increase the breadth of identified risks by
      including internally generated risks. The technique starts with the identification of strengths and weaknesses
      of the organization, focusing on either the project, organization, or the business area in general. SWOT analysis
      then identifies any opportunities for the project that may arise from strengths, and any threats resulting from
      weaknesses. The analysis also examines the degree to which organizational strengths may offset threats and
      determines if weaknesses might hinder opportunities.
   Document analysis. Described in Section 5.2.2.3. Risks may be identified from a structured review of project
  uu
      documents, including, but not limited to, plans, assumptions, constraints, previous project files, contracts,
      agreements, and technical documentation. Uncertainty or ambiguity in project documents, as well as
      inconsistencies within a document or between different documents, may be indicators of risk on the project.




                                                                                                                     415
11.2.2.4 INTERPERSONAL AND TEAM SKILLS

    Interpersonal and team skills that can be used for this process includes but are not limited to facilitation (see Section
4.1.2.3). Facilitation improves the effectiveness of many of the techniques used to identify individual project risks and
sources of overall project risk. A skilled facilitator can help participants remain focused on the risk identification task,
follow the method associated with the technique accurately, ensure clear risk descriptions, identify and overcome
sources of bias, and resolve any disagreements that may arise.

11.2.2.5 PROMPT LISTS

   A prompt list is a predetermined list of risk categories that might give rise to individual project risks and that could also
act as sources of overall project risk. The prompt list can be used as a framework to aid the project team in idea generation
when using risk identification techniques. The risk categories in the lowest level of the risk breakdown structure can be
used as a prompt list for individual project risks. Some common strategic frameworks are more suitable for identifying
sources of overall project risk, for example PESTLE (political, economic, social, technological, legal, environmental), TECOP
(technical, environmental, commercial, operational, political), or VUCA (volatility, uncertainty, complexity, ambiguity).

11.2.2.6 MEETINGS

   To undertake risk identification, the project team may conduct a specialized meeting (often called a risk workshop).
Most risk workshops include some form of brainstorming (see Section 4.1.2.2), but other risk identification techniques
may be included depending on the level of the risk process defined in the risk management plan. Use of a skilled
facilitator will increase the effectiveness of the meeting. It is also essential to ensure that the right people participate in
the risk workshop. On larger projects, it may be appropriate to invite the project sponsor, subject matter experts, sellers,
representatives of the customer, or other project stakeholders. Risk workshops for smaller projects may be restricted to
a subset of the project team.




                                                                                                                Part 1 - Guide
416
   11.2.3 IDENTIFY RISKS: OUTPUTS

   11.2.3.1 RISK REGISTER

      The risk register captures details of identified individual project risks. The results of Perform Qualitative Risk Analysis,
   Plan Risk Responses, Implement Risk Responses, and Monitor Risks are recorded in the risk register as those processes
   are conducted throughout the project. The risk register may contain limited or extensive risk information depending on
   project variables such as size and complexity.
     On completion of the Identify Risks process, the content of the risk register may include but is not limited to:
       List of identified risks. Each individual project risk is given a unique identifier in the risk register. Identified risks
      uu
          are described in as much detail as required to ensure unambiguous understanding. A structured risk statement
          may be used to distinguish risks from their cause(s) and their effect(s).
       Potential risk owners. Where a potential risk owner has been identified during the Identify Risks process, the
      uu
          risk owner is recorded in the risk register. This will be confirmed during the Perform Qualitative Risk Analysis
          process.
       List of potential risk responses. Where a potential risk response has been identified during the Identify Risks
      uu
          process, it is recorded in the risk register. This will be confirmed during the Plan Risk Responses process.
      Additional data may be recorded for each identified risk, depending on the risk register format specified in the risk
   management plan. This may include: a short risk title, risk category, current risk status, one or more causes, one or
   more effects on objectives, risk triggers (events or conditions that indicate that a risk is about to occur), WBS reference
   of affected activities, and timing information (when was the risk identified, when might the risk occur, when might it no
   longer be relevant, and what is the deadline for taking action).






                                                                                                                             417
11.2.3.2 RISK REPORT

   The risk report presents information on sources of overall project risk, together with summary information on identified
individual project risks. The risk report is developed progressively throughout the Project Risk Management process. The
results of Perform Qualitative Risk Analysis, Perform Quantitative Risk Analysis, Plan Risk Responses, Implement Risk
Responses, and Monitor Risks are also included in the risk report as those processes are completed. On completion of
the Identify Risks process, information in the risk report may include but is not limited to:
    Sources of overall project risk, indicating which are the most important drivers of overall project risk exposure;
   uu
       and
    Summary information on identified individual project risks, such as number of identified threats and opportunities,
   uu
       distribution of risks across risk categories, metrics and trends, etc.
   Additional information may be included in the risk report, depending on the reporting requirements specified in the
risk management plan.

11.2.3.3 PROJECT DOCUMENTS UPDATES

  Project documents that may be updated as a result of this process include but are not limited to:
    Assumption log. Described in Section 4.1.3.2. During the Identify Risks process, new assumptions may be
   uu
       made, new constraints may be identified, and existing assumptions or constraints may be revisited and changed.
       The assumption log should be updated with this new information.
    Issue log. Described in Section 4.3.3.3. The issue log should be updated to capture any new issues uncovered
   uu
       or changes in currently logged issues.
    Lessons learned register. Described in Section 4.4.3.1. The lessons learned register can be updated with
   uu
       information on techniques that were effective in identifying risks to improve performance in later phases or
       other projects.




                                                                                                            Part 1 - Guide

   11.3 PERFORM QUALITATIVE RISK ANALYSIS
      Perform Qualitative Risk Analysis is the process of prioritizing individual project risks for further analysis or action
   by assessing their probability of occurrence and impact as well as other characteristics. The key benefit of this
   process is that it focuses efforts on high-priority risks. This process is performed throughout the project. The inputs,
   tools and techniques, and outputs of the process are depicted in Figure 11-8. Figure 11-9 depicts the data flow
   diagram for the process.

   Perform Qualitative Risk Analysis assesses the priority of identified individual project risks using their probability of
occurrence, the corresponding impact on project objectives if the risks occur, and other factors. Such assessments are
subjective as they are based on perceptions of risk by the project team and other stakeholders. Effective assessment
therefore requires explicit identification and management of the risk attitudes of key participants in the Perform
Qualitative Risk Analysis process. Risk perception introduces bias into the assessment of identified risks, so attention
should be paid to identifying bias and correcting for it. Where a facilitator is used to support the Perform Qualitative
Risk Analysis process, addressing bias is a key part of the facilitator's role. An evaluation of the quality of the available
information on individual project risks also helps to clarify the assessment of each risk's importance to the project.




                                                                                                                                Part 1 - Guide
420
       Perform Qualitative Risk Analysis establishes the relative priorities of individual project risks for Plan Risk Responses.
   It identifies a risk owner for each risk who will take responsibility for planning an appropriate risk response and ensuring
   that it is implemented. Perform Qualitative Risk Analysis also lays the foundation for Perform Quantitative Risk Analysis
   if this process is required.
      The Perform Qualitative Risk Analysis process is performed regularly throughout the project life cycle, as defined in
   the risk management plan. Often, in an agile development environment, the Perform Qualitative Risk Analysis process is
   conducted before the start of each iteration.



   11.3.1 PERFORM QUALITATIVE RISK ANALYSIS: INPUTS

   11.3.1.1 PROJECT MANAGEMENT PLAN

      Described in Section 4.2.3.1. Project management plan components include the risk management plan as
   described in Section 11.1.3.1. Of particular interest in this process are the roles and responsibilities for conducting risk
   management, budgets for risk management, schedule activities for risk management, risk categories (often defined in
   a risk breakdown structure), definitions of probability and impact, the probability and impact matrix, and stakeholders'
   risk thresholds. These inputs are usually tailored to the project during the Plan Risk Management process. If they are
   not available, they may be developed during the Perform Qualitative Risk Analysis process and presented to the project
   sponsor for approval before use.

   11.3.1.2 PROJECT DOCUMENTS

     Project documents that can be considered as inputs for this process include but are not limited to:
       Assumption log. Described in Section 4.1.3.2. The assumption log is used for identifying, managing, and
      uu
          monitoring key assumptions and constraints that may affect the project. These may inform the assessment of
          the priority of individual project risks.
       Risk register. Described in Section 11.2.3.1. The risk register contains details of each identified individual project
      uu
          risk that will be assessed during the Perform Qualitative Risk Analysis process.
       Stakeholder register. Described in Section 13.1.3.1. This includes details of project stakeholders who may be
      uu





          nominated as risk owners.





                                                                                                                            421
11.3.1.3 ENTERPRISE ENVIRONMENTAL FACTORS

  The enterprise environmental factors that can influence Perform Qualitative Risk Analysis include but are not limited to:
    Industry studies of similar projects, and
   uu

    Published material, including commercial risk databases or checklists.
   uu


11.3.1.4 ORGANIZATIONAL PROCESS ASSETS

   The organizational process assets that can influence Perform Qualitative Risk Analysis include but are not limited to
information from similar completed projects.



11.3.2 PERFORM QUALITATIVE RISK ANALYSIS: TOOLS AND TECHNIQUES

11.3.2.1 EXPERT JUDGMENT

   Described in Section 4.1.2.1. Expertise should be considered from individuals or groups with specialized knowledge
or training in the following topics:
    Previous similar projects, and
   uu

    Qualitative risk analysis.
   uu

   Expert judgment is often obtained through facilitated risk workshops or interviews. The possibility of expert views
being biased should be taken into account in this process.

11.3.2.2 DATA GATHERING

   Data-gathering techniques that can be used for this process include but are not limited to interviews. Structured or
semi-structured interviews (Section 5.2.2.2) can be used to assess the probability and impacts of individual project risks,
as well as other factors. The interviewer should promote an environment of trust and confidentiality in the interview
setting to encourage honest and unbiased assessments.




                                                                                                            Part 1 - Guide
422
11.3.2.3 DATA ANALYSIS

  Data analysis techniques that can be used during this process include but are not limited to:
   Risk data quality assessment. Risk data quality assessment evaluates the degree to which the data about
  uu
      individual project risks is accurate and reliable as a basis for qualitative risk analysis. The use of low-quality
      risk data may lead to a qualitative risk analysis that is of little use to the project. If data quality is unacceptable,
      it may be necessary to gather better data. Risk data quality may be assessed via a questionnaire measuring
      the project's stakeholder perceptions of various characteristics, which may include completeness, objectivity,
      relevancy, and timeliness. A weighted average of selected data quality characteristics can then be generated to
      give an overall quality score.
   Risk probability and impact assessment. Risk probability assessment considers the likelihood that a specific
  uu
      risk will occur. Risk impact assessment considers the potential effect on one or more project objectives such
      as schedule, cost, quality, or performance. Impacts will be negative for threats and positive for opportunities.
      Probability and impact are assessed for each identified individual project risk. Risks can be assessed in
      interviews or meetings with participants selected for their familiarity with the types of risk recorded in the
      risk register. Project team members and knowledgeable persons external to the project are included. The level
      of probability for each risk and its impact on each objective are evaluated during the interview or meeting.
      Differences in the levels of probability and impact perceived by stakeholders are to be expected, and such
      differences should be explored. Explanatory detail, including assumptions justifying the levels assigned, are
      also recorded. Risk probabilities and impacts are assessed using the definitions given in the risk management
      plan (see Table 11-1). Risks with low probability and impact may be included within the risk register as part
      of a watch list for future monitoring.
   Assessment of other risk parameters. The project team may consider other characteristics of risk (in addition
  uu
      to probability and impact) when prioritizing individual project risks for further analysis and action. These
      characteristics may include but are not limited to:




                                                                                                                         423
       nuUrgency. The period of time within which a response to the risk is to be implemented in order to be effective.
           A short period indicates high urgency.
       nuProximity. The period of time before the risk might have an impact on one or more project objectives. A short
           period indicates high proximity.
       nuDormancy.    The period of time that may elapse after a risk has occurred before its impact is discovered. A
           short period indicates low dormancy.
       nuManageability. The    ease with which the risk owner (or owning organization) can manage the occurrence or
           impact of a risk. Where management is easy, manageability is high.
       nuControllability.
                        The degree to which the risk owner (or owning organization) is able to control the risk's
           outcome. Where the outcome can be easily controlled, controllability is high.
       nuDetectability. The ease with which the results of the risk occurring, or being about to occur, can be detected
           and recognized. Where the risk occurrence can be detected easily, detectability is high.
       nuConnectivity. The extent to which the risk is related to other individual project risks. Where a risk is connected
           to many other risks, connectivity is high.
       nuStrategic impact. The potential for the risk to have a positive or negative effect on the organization's strategic
           goals. Where the risk has a major effect on strategic goals, strategic impact is high.
       nuPropinquity. The  degree to which a risk is perceived to matter by one or more stakeholders. Where a risk is
           perceived as very significant, propinquity is high.
   The consideration of some of these characteristics can provide a more robust prioritization of risks than is possible
by only assessing probability and impact.

11.3.2.4 INTERPERSONAL AND TEAM SKILLS

   Interpersonal and team skills that can be used for this process include but are not limited to facilitation (see Section
4.1.2.3). Facilitation improves the effectiveness of the qualitative analysis of individual project risks. A skilled facilitator
can help participants remain focused on the risk analysis task, follow the method associated with the technique
accurately, reach consensus on assessments of probability and impacts, identify and overcome sources of bias, and
resolve any disagreements that may arise.




                                                                                                                Part 1 - Guide
424
11.3.2.5 RISK CATEGORIZATION

   Risks to the project can be categorized by sources of risk (e.g., using the risk breakdown structure (RBS); see
Figure 11-4), the area of the project affected (e.g., using the work breakdown structure (WBS); see Figures 5-12,
5-13, and 5-14), or other useful categories (e.g., project phase, project budget, and roles and responsibilities) to
determine the areas of the project most exposed to the effects of uncertainty. Risks can also be categorized by
common root causes. Risk categories that may be used for the project are defined in the risk management plan.
   Grouping risks into categories can lead to the development of more effective risk responses by focusing attention and
effort on the areas of highest risk exposure, or by developing generic risk responses to address groups of related risks.

11.3.2.6 DATA REPRESENTATION

  Data representation techniques that can be used during this process include but are not limited to:
    Probability and impact matrix. A probability and impact matrix is a grid for mapping the probability of each
   uu
       risk occurrence and its impact on project objectives if that risk occurs. This matrix specifies combinations of
       probability and impact that allow individual project risks to be divided into priority groups (see Figure 11-5). Risks
       can be prioritized for further analysis and planning of risk responses based on their probability and impacts.
       The probability of occurrence for each individual project risk is assessed as well as its impact on one or more
       project objectives if it does occur, using definitions of probability and impact for the project as specified in the
       risk management plan. Individual project risks are assigned to a priority level based on the combination of their
       assessed probability and impact, using a probability and impact matrix.
       An organization can assess a risk separately for each objective (e.g., cost, time, and scope) by having a separate
       probability and impact matrix for each. Alternatively, it may develop ways to determine one overall priority level
       for each risk, either by combining assessments for different objectives, or by taking the highest priority level
       regardless of which objective is affected.
    Hierarchical charts. Where risks have been categorized using more than two parameters, the probability and
   uu
       impact matrix cannot be used and other graphical representations are required. For example, a bubble chart displays
       three dimensions of data, where each risk is plotted as a disk (bubble), and the three parameters are represented
       by the x-axis value, the y-axis value, and the bubble size. An example bubble chart is shown in Figure 11-10, with
       detectability and proximity plotted on the x and y axes, and impact value represented by bubble size.




                                                                                                                        425

   11.3.2.7 MEETINGS

      To undertake qualitative risk analysis, the project team may conduct a specialized meeting (often called a risk
   workshop) dedicated to the discussion of identified individual project risks. The goals of this meeting include the review
   of previously identified risks, assessment of probability and impacts (and possibly other risk parameters), categorization,
   and prioritization. A risk owner, who will be responsible for planning an appropriate risk response and for reporting





   progress on managing the risk, will be allocated to each individual project risk as part of the Perform Qualitative Risk





   Analysis process. The meeting may start by reviewing and confirming the probability and impact scales to be used for
   the analysis. The meeting may also identify additional risks during the discussion, and these should be recorded for
   analysis. Use of a skilled facilitator will increase the effectiveness of the meeting.




                                                                                                                       Part 1 - Guide

   11.3.3 PERFORM QUALITATIVE RISK ANALYSIS: OUTPUTS

   11.3.3.1 PROJECT DOCUMENTS UPDATES

     Project documents that may be updated as a result of carrying out this process include but are not limited to:
      Assumption log. Described in Section 4.1.3.2. During the Perform Qualitative Risk Analysis process, new
     uu
         assumptions may be made, new constraints may be identified, and existing assumptions or constraints may be
         revisited and changed. The assumption log should be updated with this new information.
      Issue log. Described in Section 4.3.3.3. The issue log should be updated to capture any new issues uncovered
     uu
         or changes in currently logged issues.
      Risk register. Described in Section 11.2.3.1. The risk register is updated with new information generated during
     uu
         the Perform Qualitative Risk Analysis process. Updates to the risk register may include assessments of probability
         and impacts for each individual project risk, its priority level or risk score, the nominated risk owner, risk urgency
         information or risk categorization, and a watch list for low-priority risks or risks requiring further analysis.
      Risk report. Described in Section 11.2.3.2. The risk report is updated to reflect the most important individual
     uu
         project risks (usually those with the highest probability and impact), as well as a prioritized list of all identified
         risks on the project and a summary conclusion.






                                                                                                                          427
11.4 PERFORM QUANTITATIVE RISK ANALYSIS
   Perform Quantitative Risk Analysis is the process of numerically analyzing the combined effect of identified individual
project risks and other sources of uncertainty on overall project objectives. The key benefit of this process is that it
quantifies overall project risk exposure, and it can also provide additional quantitative risk information to support risk
response planning. This process is not required for every project, but where it is used, it is performed throughout the
project. The inputs and outputs of this process are depicted in Figure 11-11. Figure 11-12 depicts the data flow diagram
for the process.

      Perform Quantitative Risk Analysis is not required for all projects. Undertaking a robust analysis depends on the availability
   of high-quality data about individual project risks and other sources of uncertainty, as well as a sound underlying project
   baseline for scope, schedule, and cost. Quantitative risk analysis usually requires specialized risk software and expertise
   in the development and interpretation of risk models. It also consumes additional time and cost. The use of quantitative
   risk analysis for a project will be specified in the project's risk management plan. It is most likely appropriate for large or





   complex projects, strategically important projects, projects for which it is a contractual requirement, or projects in which





   a key stakeholder requires it. Quantitative risk analysis is the only reliable method to assess overall project risk through
   evaluating the aggregated effect on project outcomes of all individual project risks and other sources of uncertainty.
     Perform Quantitative Risk Analysis uses information on individual project risks that have been assessed by the
   Perform Qualitative Risk Analysis process as having a significant potential to affect the project's objectives.
      Outputs from Perform Quantitative Risk Analysis are used as inputs to the Plan Risk Responses process, particularly
   in recommending responses to the level of overall project risk and key individual risks. A quantitative risk analysis
   may also be undertaken following the Plan Risk Responses process, to determine the likely effectiveness of planned
   responses in reducing overall project risk exposure.

                                                                                                                         431
11.4.2.2 DATA GATHERING

   Interviews (see Section 5.2.2.2) may be used to generate inputs for the quantitative risk analysis, drawing on inputs
that include individual project risks and other sources of uncertainty. This is particularly useful where information is
required from experts. The interviewer should promote an environment of trust and confidentiality during the interview
to encourage honest and unbiased contributions.

11.4.2.3 INTERPERSONAL AND TEAM SKILLS

   Interpersonal and team skills that can be used for this process include but are not limited to facilitation (see
Section 4.1.2.3). A skilled facilitator is useful for gathering input data during a dedicated risk workshop involving
project team members and other stakeholders. Facilitated workshops can improve effectiveness by establishing a
clear understanding of the purpose of the workshop, building consensus among participants, ensuring continued
focus on the task, and using creative approaches to deal with interpersonal conflict or sources of bias.

11.4.2.4 REPRESENTATIONS OF UNCERTAINTY

   Quantitative risk analysis requires inputs to a quantitative risk analysis model that reflect individual project risks and
other sources of uncertainty.
   Where the duration, cost, or resource requirement for a planned activity is uncertain, the range of possible values
can be represented in the model as a probability distribution. This may take several forms. The most commonly used
are triangular, normal, lognormal, beta, uniform, or discrete distributions. Care should be taken when selecting an
appropriate probability distribution to reflect the range of possible values for the planned activity.
   Individual project risks may be covered by probability distributions. Alternatively, risks may be included in the
model as probabilistic branches, where optional activities are added to the model to represent the time and/or cost
impact of the risk should it occur, and the chance that these activities actually occur in a particular simulation run
matches the risk's probability. Branches are most useful for risks that might occur independently of any planned
activity. Where risks are related, for example, with a common cause or a logical dependency, correlation is used in
the model to indicate this relationship.
   Other sources of uncertainty may also be represented using branches to describe alternative paths through
the project.

11.4.2.5 DATA ANALYSIS

  Data analysis techniques that can be used during this process include but are not limited to:
   Simulation. Quantitative risk analysis uses a model that simulates the combined effects of individual project risks
  uu
      and other sources of uncertainty to evaluate their potential impact on achieving project objectives. Simulations
      are typically performed using a Monte Carlo analysis. When running a Monte Carlo analysis for cost risk, the
      simulation uses the project cost estimates. When running a Monte Carlo analysis for schedule risk, the schedule
      network diagram and duration estimates are used. An integrated quantitative cost-schedule risk analysis uses
      both inputs. The output is a quantitative risk analysis model.
      Computer software is used to iterate the quantitative risk analysis model several thousand times. The input
      values (e.g., cost estimates, duration estimates, or occurrence of probabilistic branches) are chosen at random
      for each iteration. Outputs represent the range of possible outcomes for the project (e.g., project end date,
      project cost at completion). Typical outputs include a histogram presenting the number of iterations where a
      particular outcome resulted from the simulation, or a cumulative probability distribution (S-curve) representing
      the probability of achieving any particular outcome or less. An example S-curve from a Monte Carlo cost risk
      analysis is shown in Figure 11-13.

      For a quantitative schedule risk analysis, it is also possible to conduct a criticality analysis that determines which
      elements of the risk model have the greatest effect on the project critical path. A criticality index is calculated for
      each element in the risk model, which gives the frequency with which that element appears on the critical path
      during the simulation, usually expressed as a percentage. The output from a criticality analysis allows the project
      team to focus risk response planning efforts on those activities with the highest potential effect on the overall
      schedule performance of the project.
   Sensitivity analysis. Sensitivity analysis helps to determine which individual project risks or other sources of
  uu
      uncertainty have the most potential impact on project outcomes. It correlates variations in project outcomes with
      variations in elements of the quantitative risk analysis model.
      One typical display of sensitivity analysis is the tornado diagram, which presents the calculated correlation
      coefficient for each element of the quantitative risk analysis model that can influence the project outcome.
      This can include individual project risks, project activities with high degrees of variability, or specific sources
      of ambiguity. Items are ordered by descending strength of correlation, giving the typical tornado appearance.
      An example tornado diagram is shown in Figure 11-14.

    Decision tree analysis. Decision trees are used to support selection of the best of several alternative courses of
   uu
      action. Alternative paths through the project are shown in the decision tree using branches representing different
      decisions or events, each of which can have associated costs and related individual project risks (including both
      threats and opportunities). The end-points of branches in the decision tree represent the outcome from following
      that particular path, which can be negative or positive.
      The decision tree is evaluated by calculating the expected monetary value of each branch, allowing the optimal
      path to be selected. An example decision tree is shown in Figure 11-15.

            Note 1: The decision tree shows how to make a decision between alternative capital strategies (represented as "decision nodes")
                    when the environment contains uncertain elements (represented as "chance nodes").
            Note 2: Here, a decision is being made whether to invest $120M US to build a new plant or to instead invest only $50M US
                    to upgrade the existing plant. For each decision, the demand (which is uncertain, and therefore represents a
                    "chance node") must be accounted for. For example, strong demand leads to $200M revenue with the new plant
                    but only $120M US for the upgraded plant, perhaps due to capacity limitations of the upgraded plant. The end of





                    each branch shows the net effect of the payoffs minus costs. For each decision branch, all effects are added (see
                    shaded areas) to determine the overall Expected Monetary Value (EMV) of the decision. Remember to account for
                    the investment costs. From the calculations in the shaded areas, the upgraded plant has a higher EMV of $46M -





                    also the EMV of the overall decision. (This choice also represents the lowest risk, avoiding the worst case possible

    Influence diagrams. Influence diagrams are graphical aids to decision making under uncertainty. An influence
   uu
       diagram represents a project or situation within the project as a set of entities, outcomes, and influences, together
       with the relationships and effects between them. Where an element in the influence diagram is uncertain as a
       result of the existence of individual project risks or other sources of uncertainty, this can be represented in the
       influence diagram using ranges or probability distributions. The influence diagram is then evaluated using a
       simulation technique, such as Monte Carlo analysis, to indicate which elements have the greatest influence
       on key outcomes. Outputs from an influence diagram are similar to other quantitative risk analysis methods,
       including S-curves and tornado diagrams.


11.4.3 PERFORM QUANTITATIVE RISK ANALYSIS: OUTPUTS

11.4.3.1 PROJECT DOCUMENTS UPDATES

   Project documents that can be considered as outputs for this process include but are not limited to the risk report
described in Section 11.2.3.2. The risk report will be updated to reflect the results of the quantitative risk analysis. This
will typically include:
    Assessment of overall project risk exposure. Overall project risk is reflected in two key measures:
   uu

       nuChances    of project success, indicated by the probability that the project will achieve its key objectives (e.g.,
           required end date or interim milestones, required cost target, etc.) given the identified individual project risks
           and other sources of uncertainty; and
       nuDegree    of inherent variability remaining within the project at the time the analysis was conducted, indicated
           by the range of possible project outcomes.
    Detailed probabilistic analysis of the project. Key outputs from the quantitative risk analysis are presented,
   uu
       such as S-curves, tornado diagrams, and criticality analysis, together with a narrative interpretation of the results.
       Possible detailed results of a quantitative risk analysis may include:
       nuAmount of contingency reserve needed to provide a specified level of confidence;
       nuIdentification   of individual project risks or other sources of uncertainty that have the greatest effect on the
           project critical path; and
       nuMajor drivers of overall project risk, with the greatest influence on uncertainty in project outcomes.

    Prioritized list of individual project risks. This list includes those individual project risks that pose the greatest
   uu
       threat or present the greatest opportunity to the project, as indicated by sensitivity analysis.
    Trends in quantitative risk analysis results. As the analysis is repeated at different times during the project life
   uu
       cycle, trends may become apparent that inform the planning of risk responses.
    Recommended risk responses. The risk report may present suggested responses to the level of overall
   uu
       project risk exposure or key individual project risks, based on the results of the quantitative risk analysis. These
       recommendations will form inputs to the Plan Risk Responses process.

   11.5 PLAN RISK RESPONSES
      Plan Risk Responses is the process of developing options, selecting strategies, and agreeing on actions to address
   overall project risk exposure, as well as to treat individual project risks. The key benefit of this process is that it identifies
   appropriate ways to address overall project risk and individual project risks. This process also allocates resources
   and inserts activities into project documents and the project management plan as needed. This process is performed
   throughout the project. The inputs, tools and techniques, and outputs of the process are depicted in Figure 11-16.
   Figure 11-17 depicts the data flow diagram for the process.

      Effective and appropriate risk responses can minimize individual threats, maximize individual opportunities, and
   reduce overall project risk exposure. Unsuitable risk responses can have the converse effect. Once risks have been
   identified, analyzed, and prioritized, plans should be developed by the nominated risk owner for addressing every
   individual project risk the project team considers to be sufficiently important, either because of the threat it poses to the
   project objectives or the opportunity it offers. The project manager should also consider how to respond appropriately to
   the current level of overall project risk.
      Risk responses should be appropriate for the significance of the risk, cost-effective in meeting the challenge, realistic
   within the project context, agreed upon by all parties involved, and owned by a responsible person. Selecting the
   optimal risk response from several options is often required. The strategy or mix of strategies most likely to be effective
   should be selected for each risk. Structured decision-making techniques may be used to choose the most appropriate
   response. For large or complex projects, it may be appropriate to use a mathematical optimization model or real options
   analysis as a basis for a more robust economic analysis of alternative risk response strategies.
      Specific actions are developed to implement the agreed-upon risk response strategy, including primary and backup
   strategies, as necessary. A contingency plan (or fallback plan) can be developed for implementation if the selected
   strategy turns out not to be fully effective or if an accepted risk occurs. Secondary risks should also be identified.
   Secondary risks are risks that arise as a direct result of implementing a risk response. A contingency reserve is often
   allocated for time or cost. If developed, it may include identification of the conditions that trigger its use.



   11.5.1 PLAN RISK RESPONSES: INPUTS

   11.5.1.1 PROJECT MANAGEMENT PLAN

     Described in Section 4.2.3.1. Project management plan components include but are not limited to:
       Resource management plan. Described in Section 9.1.3.1. The resource management plan is used to help
      uu
          determine how resources allocated to agreed-upon risk responses will be coordinated with other project resources.
       Risk management plan. Described in Section 11.1.3.1. Risk management roles and responsibilities and risk
      uu
          thresholds are used in this process.
       Cost baseline. Described in Section 7.3.3.1. The cost baseline has information on the contingency fund that is
      uu





          allocated to respond to risks.





                                                                                                                           439
11.5.1.2 PROJECT DOCUMENTS

  Project documents that can be considered as inputs for this process include but are not limited to:
   Lessons learned register. Described in Section 4.4.3.1. Lessons learned about effective risk responses used in
  uu
      earlier phases of the project are reviewed to determine if similar responses might be useful during the remainder
      of the project.
   Project schedule. Described in Section 6.5.3.2. The schedule is used to determine how agreed-upon risk
  uu
      responses will be scheduled alongside other project activities.
   Project team assignments. Described in Section 9.3.3.2. Project team assignments can show the resources
  uu
      that can be allocated to agreed-upon risk responses.
   Resource calendars. Described in Section 9.2.1.2. Resource calendars identify when potential resources are
  uu
      available to be allocated to agreed-upon risk responses.
   Risk register. Described in Section 11.2.3.1. The risk register contains details of individual project risks that
  uu
      have been identified and prioritized, and for which risk responses are required. The priority level for each risk
      can help to guide the selection of appropriate risk responses. For example, high-priority threats or opportunities
      may require priority action and highly proactive response strategies. Threats and opportunities in the low-priority
      zone may not require proactive management action beyond being placed in the risk register as part of the watch
      list or adding a contingency reserve.
      The risk register identifies the nominated risk owner for each risk. It may also contain preliminary risk responses
      identified earlier in the Project Risk Management process. The risk register may provide other data on identified
      risks that can assist in planning risk responses, including root causes, risk triggers and warning signs, risks
      requiring responses in the near term, and risks where a need for additional analysis has been identified.
   Risk report. Described in Section 11.2.3.2. The risk report presents the current level of overall risk exposure of
  uu
      the project that will inform selection of the risk response strategy. The risk report may also list individual project
      risks in priority order and provide additional analysis of the distribution of individual project risks that may inform
      risk response selection.
   Stakeholder register. Described in Section 13.1.3.1. The stakeholder register identifies potential owners for
  uu
      risk responses.




                                                                                                             Part 1 - Guide

11.5.1.3 ENTERPRISE ENVIRONMENTAL FACTORS

   The enterprise environmental factors that can influence the Plan Risk Responses process include but are not limited
to the risk appetite and thresholds of key stakeholders.

11.5.1.4 ORGANIZATIONAL PROCESS ASSETS

  The organizational process assets that can influence the Plan Risk Responses process include but are not limited to:
    Templates for the risk management plan, risk register, and risk report;
   uu

    Historical databases; and
   uu

    Lessons learned repositories from similar projects.

11.5.2 PLAN RISK RESPONSES: TOOLS AND TECHNIQUES

11.5.2.1 EXPERT JUDGMENT

   Described in Section 4.1.2.1. Expertise should be considered from individuals or groups with specialized knowledge
in the following topics:
    Threat response strategies,
   uu

    Opportunity response strategies,
   uu

    Contingent response strategies, and
   uu

    Overall project risk response strategies.
   uu

   Expert input may be sought from individuals with particular subject matter expertise relevant to a specific individual
project risk, for example, where specialist technical knowledge is required.




                                                                                                                     441
11.5.2.2 DATA GATHERING

   Data-gathering techniques that can be used for this process include but are not limited to interviews (see
Section 5.2.2.2). Development of responses to individual project risks and overall project risk may be undertaken
during structured or semi-structured interviews (see Section 5.2.2.2) with risk owners. Other stakeholders may
also be interviewed if necessary. The interviewer should promote an environment of trust and confidentiality in the
interview setting to encourage honest and unbiased decisions.

11.5.2.3 INTERPERSONAL AND TEAM SKILLS

   Interpersonal and team skills that can be used for this process includes but are not limited to facilitation (see
Section 4.1.2.3). The use of facilitation improves the effectiveness of developing responses to individual project
risks and overall project risk. A skilled facilitator can help risk owners understand the risk, identify and compare
alternative possible risk response strategies, choose an appropriate response strategy, and identify and overcome
sources of bias.

11.5.2.4 STRATEGIES FOR THREATS

  Five alternative strategies may be considered for dealing with threats, as follows:
    Escalate. Escalation is appropriate when the project team or the project sponsor agrees that a threat is outside
   uu
      the scope of the project or that the proposed response would exceed the project manager's authority. Escalated
      risks are managed at the program level, portfolio level, or other relevant part of the organization, and not on the
      project level. The project manager determines who should be notified about the threat and communicates the
      details to that person or part of the organization. It is important that ownership of escalated threats is accepted
      by the relevant party in the organization. Threats are usually escalated to the level that matches the objectives
      that would be affected if the threat occurred. Escalated threats are not monitored further by the project team after
      escalation, although they may be recorded in the risk register for information.




                                                                                                           Part 1 - Guide
442
 Avoid. Risk avoidance is when the project team acts to eliminate the threat or protect the project from its
uu
   impact. It may be appropriate for high-priority threats with a high probability of occurrence and a large negative
   impact. Avoidance may involve changing some aspect of the project management plan or changing the objective
   that is in jeopardy in order to eliminate the threat entirely, reducing its probability of occurrence to zero. The
   risk owner may also take action to isolate the project objectives from the risk's impact if it were to occur.
   Examples of avoidance actions may include removing the cause of a threat, extending the schedule, changing the
   project strategy, or reducing scope. Some risks can be avoided by clarifying requirements, obtaining information,
   improving communication, or acquiring expertise.
 Transfer. Transfer involves shifting ownership of a threat to a third party to manage the risk and to bear the
uu
   impact if the threat occurs. Risk transfer often involves payment of a risk premium to the party taking on the
   threat. Transfer can be achieved by a range of actions, which include but are not limited to the use of insurance,
   performance bonds, warranties, guarantees, etc. Agreements may be used to transfer ownership and liability for
   specified risks to another party.
 Mitigate. In risk mitigation, action is taken to reduce the probability of occurrence and/or impact of a threat. Early
uu
   mitigation action is often more effective than trying to repair the damage after the threat has occurred. Adopting
   less complex processes, conducting more tests, or choosing a more stable seller are examples of mitigation
   actions. Mitigation may involve prototype development (see Section 5.2.2.8) to reduce the risk of scaling up from
   a bench-scale model of a process or product. Where it is not possible to reduce probability, a mitigation response
   might reduce the impact by targeting factors that drive the severity. For example, designing redundancy into a
   system may reduce the impact from a failure of the original component.
 Accept. Risk acceptance acknowledges the existence of a threat, but no proactive action is taken. This strategy
uu
   may be appropriate for low-priority threats, and it may also be adopted where it is not possible or cost-effective
   to address a threat in any other way. Acceptance can be either active or passive. The most common active
   acceptance strategy is to establish a contingency reserve, including amounts of time, money, or resources to
   handle the threat if it occurs. Passive acceptance involves no proactive action apart from periodic review of the
   threat to ensure that it does not change significantly.




                                                                                                                   443
11.5.2.5 STRATEGIES FOR OPPORTUNITIES

  Five alternative strategies may be considered for dealing with opportunities, as follows:
   Escalate. This risk response strategy is appropriate when the project team or the project sponsor agrees that
  uu
      an opportunity is outside the scope of the project or that the proposed response would exceed the project
      manager's authority. Escalated opportunities are managed at the program level, portfolio level, or other relevant
      part of the organization, and not on the project level. The project manager determines who should be notified
      about the opportunity and communicates the details to that person or part of the organization. It is important
      that ownership of escalated opportunities is accepted by the relevant party in the organization. Opportunities
      are usually escalated to the level that matches the objectives that would be affected if the opportunity occurred.
      Escalated opportunities are not monitored further by the project team after escalation, although they may be
      recorded in the risk register for information.
   Exploit. The exploit strategy may be selected for high-priority opportunities where the organization wants to
  uu
      ensure that the opportunity is realized. This strategy seeks to capture the benefit associated with a particular
      opportunity by ensuring that it definitely happens, increasing the probability of occurrence to 100%. Examples of
      exploiting responses may include assigning an organization's most talented resources to the project to reduce
      the time to completion, or using new technologies or technology upgrades to reduce cost and duration.
   Share. Sharing involves transferring ownership of an opportunity to a third party so that it shares some of the
  uu
      benefit if the opportunity occurs. It is important to select the new owner of a shared opportunity carefully so they
      are best able to capture the opportunity for the benefit of the project. Risk sharing often involves payment of a
      risk premium to the party taking on the opportunity. Examples of sharing actions include forming risk-sharing
      partnerships, teams, special-purpose companies, or joint ventures.
   Enhance. The enhance strategy is used to increase the probability and/or impact of an opportunity. Early
  uu
      enhancement action is often more effective than trying to improve the benefit after the opportunity has occurred.
      The probability of occurrence of an opportunity may be increased by focusing attention on its causes. Where it
      is not possible to increase probability, an enhancement response might increase the impact by targeting factors
      that drive the size of the potential benefit. Examples of enhancing opportunities include adding more resources
      to an activity to finish early.
   Accept. Accepting an opportunity acknowledges its existence but no proactive action is taken. This strategy may
  uu
      be appropriate for low-priority opportunities, and it may also be adopted where it is not possible or cost-effective
      to address an opportunity in any other way. Acceptance can be either active or passive. The most common active
      acceptance strategy is to establish a contingency reserve, including amounts of time, money, or resources to take
      advantage of the opportunity if it occurs. Passive acceptance involves no proactive action apart from periodic
      review of the opportunity to ensure that it does not change significantly.




                                                                                                           Part 1 - Guide
444
11.5.2.6 CONTINGENT RESPONSE STRATEGIES

   Some responses are designed for use only if certain events occur. For some risks, it is appropriate for the project
team to make a response plan that will only be executed under certain predefined conditions, if it is believed that
there will be sufficient warning to implement the plan. Events that trigger the contingency response, such as missing
intermediate milestones or gaining higher priority with a seller, should be defined and tracked. Risk responses
identified using this technique are often called contingency plans or fallback plans and include identified triggering
events that set the plans in effect.

11.5.2.7 STRATEGIES FOR OVERALL PROJECT RISK

   Risk responses should be planned and implemented not only for individual project risks but also to address overall
project risk. The same risk response strategies that are used to deal with individual project risks can also be applied to
overall project risk:
    Avoid. Where the level of overall project risk is significantly negative and outside the agreed-upon risk
   uu
       thresholds for the project, an avoid strategy may be adopted. This involves taking focused action to reduce
       the negative effect of uncertainty on the project as a whole and bring the project back within the thresholds.
       An example of avoidance at the overall project level would include removal of high-risk elements of scope
       from the project. Where it is not possible to bring the project back within the thresholds, the project may be
       canceled. This represents the most extreme degree of risk avoidance and it should be used only if the overall
       level of threat is, and will remain, unacceptable.
    Exploit. Where the level of overall project risk is significantly positive and outside the agreed-upon risk thresholds
   uu
       for the project, an exploit strategy may be adopted. This involves taking focused action to capture the positive
       effect of uncertainty on the project as a whole. An example of exploiting at the overall project level would include
       addition of high-benefit elements of scope to the project to add value or benefits to stakeholders. Alternatively
       the risk thresholds for the project may be modified with the agreement of key stakeholders in order to embrace
       the opportunity.
    Transfer/share. If the level of overall project risk is high but the organization is unable to address it effectively,
   uu
       a third party may be involved to manage the risk on behalf of the organization. Where overall project risk is
       negative, a transfer strategy is required, which may involve payment of a risk premium. In the case of high
       positive overall project risk, ownership may be shared in order to reap the associated benefits. Examples of
       both transfer and share strategies for overall project risk include but are not limited to setting up a collaborative
       business structure in which the buyer and the seller share the overall project risk, launching a joint venture or
       special-purpose company, or subcontracting key elements of the project.




                                                                                                                       445
    Mitigate/enhance. These strategies involve changing the level of overall project risk to optimize the chances
   uu
       of achieving the project's objectives. The mitigation strategy is used where overall project risk is negative, and
       enhancement applies when it is positive. Examples of mitigation or enhancement strategies include replanning
       the project, changing the scope and boundaries of the project, modifying project priority, changing resource
       allocations, adjusting delivery times, etc.
    Accept. Where no proactive risk response strategy is possible to address overall project risk, the organization
   uu
       may choose to continue with the project as currently defined, even if overall project risk is outside the agreed-
       upon thresholds. Acceptance can be either active or passive. The most common active acceptance strategy is
       to establish an overall contingency reserve for the project, including amounts of time, money, or resources to be
       used if the project exceeds its thresholds. Passive acceptance involves no proactive action apart from periodic
       review of the level of overall project risk to ensure that it does not change significantly.

11.5.2.8 DATA ANALYSIS

   A number of alternative risk response strategies may be considered. Data analysis techniques that can be used to
select a preferred risk response strategy include but are not limited to:
    Alternatives analysis. A simple comparison of the characteristics and requirements of alternative risk response
   uu
       options can lead to a decision on which response is most appropriate.
    Cost-benefit analysis. If the impact of an individual project risk can be quantified in monetary terms, then the
   uu
       cost-effectiveness of alternative risk response strategies can be determined using cost-benefit analysis (see
       Section 8.1.2.3). The ratio of (change in impact level) divided by (implementation cost) gives the cost effectiveness
       of the response strategy, with a higher ratio indicating a more effective response.

11.5.2.9 DECISION MAKING

   Decision-making techniques that can be used to select a risk response strategy include but are not limited to
multicriteria decision analysis (described in Section 8.1.2.4). One or more risk response strategies may be under
consideration. Decision-making techniques can help prioritize risk response strategies. Multicriteria decision analysis
uses a decision matrix to provide a systematic approach for establishing key decision criteria, evaluating and ranking
alternatives, and selecting a preferred option. Criteria for risk response selection may include but are not limited to
cost of response, likely effectiveness of response in changing probability and/or impact, resource availability, timing
constraints (urgency, proximity, and dormancy), level of impact if the risk occurs, effect of response on related risks,
introduction of secondary risks, etc. Different strategies may be selected later in the project if the original choice proves
to be ineffective.

   11.5.3 PLAN RISK RESPONSES: OUTPUTS

   11.5.3.1 CHANGE REQUESTS

      Described in Section 4.3.3.4. Planned risk responses may result in a change request to the cost and schedule
   baselines or other components of the project management plan. Change requests are processed for review and
   disposition through the Perform Integrated Change Control process (Section 4.6).

   11.5.3.2 PROJECT MANAGEMENT PLAN UPDATES

      Any change to the project management plan goes through the organization's change control process via a change
   request. Components that may require a change request for the project management plan include but are not limited to:
       Schedule management plan. Described in Section 6.1.3.1. Changes to the schedule management plan, such as
      uu
         changes to resource loading and leveling, or updates to the schedule strategy, are incorporated.
       Cost management plan. Described in Section 7.1.3.1. Changes to the cost management plan, such as changes
      uu
         to cost accounting, tracking, and reports, as well as updates to the budget strategy and how contingency reserves
         are consumed, are incorporated.
       Quality management plan. Described in Section 8.1.3.1. Changes to the quality management plan, such as
      uu
         changes to approaches for meeting requirements, quality management approaches, or quality control processes,
         are incorporated.
       Resource management plan. Described in Section 9.1.3.1. Changes to the resource management plan, such as
      uu
         changes to resource allocation, as well as updates to the resource strategy, are incorporated.

      uu
         plan, such as alterations in the make-or-buy decision or contract type(s), are incorporated.
       Scope baseline. Described in Section 5.4.3.1. Changes in the scope baseline are incorporated in response to
      uu
         approved changes in scope that may arise from agreed-upon risk responses.
       Schedule baseline. Described in Section 6.5.3.1. Changes in the schedule baseline are incorporated in response
      uu
         to approved changes in schedule estimates that may arise from agreed-upon risk responses.





       Cost baseline. Described in Section 7.3.3.1. Changes in the cost baseline are incorporated in response to
      uu
         approved changes in cost estimates that may arise from agreed-upon risk responses.

11.5.3.3 PROJECT DOCUMENTS UPDATES

  Project documents that may be updated as a result of carrying out this process include but are not limited to:
   Assumption log. Described in Section 4.1.3.2. During the Plan Risk Responses process, new assumptions
  uu
      may be made, new constraints may be identified, and existing assumptions or constraints may be revisited and
      changed. The assumption log should be updated with this new information.
   Cost forecasts. Described in Section 7.4.3.2. Cost forecasts may change as a result of planned risk responses.
  uu

  uu
      to the project schedule.
   Project team assignments. Described in Section 9.3.3.2. Once the responses are confirmed, the necessary
  uu
      resources should be allocated to each action associated with a risk response plan. These resources include suitably
      qualified and experienced personnel to execute the agreed-upon action (usually within the project team) a specific
      budget and time allowance for the action, and any required technical resources to complete the action.

      nuResidual risks that are expected to remain after planned responses have been taken, as well as those that
         have been deliberately accepted; and
      nuSecondary risks that arise as a direct outcome of implementing a risk response.

   Risk report. Described in Section 11.2.3.2. The risk report may be updated to present agreed-upon responses
  uu
      to the current overall project risk exposure and high-priority risks, together with the expected changes that may
      be expected as a result of implementing these responses.




                                                                                                          Part 1 - Guide

   11.6 IMPLEMENT RISK RESPONSES
      Implement Risk Responses is the process of implementing agreed-upon risk response plans. The key benefit of
   this process is that it ensures that agreed-upon risk responses are executed as planned in order to address overall
   project risk exposure, minimize individual project threats, and maximize individual project opportunities. This process is
   performed throughout the project. The inputs, tools and techniques, and outputs of the process are depicted in Figure
   11-18. Figure 11-19 depicts the data flow diagram for the process.

  Proper attention to the Implement Risk Responses process will ensure that agreed-upon risk responses are actually
executed. A common problem with Project Risk Management is that project teams spend effort in identifying and
analyzing risks and developing risk responses, then risk responses are agreed upon and documented in the risk register
and risk report, but no action is taken to manage the risk.
  Only if risk owners give the required level of effort to implementing the agreed-upon responses will the overall risk
exposure of the project and individual threats and opportunities be managed proactively.



11.6.1 IMPLEMENT RISK RESPONSES: INPUTS

11.6.1.1 PROJECT MANAGEMENT PLAN

   Described in Section 4.2.3.1. Project management plan components include but are not limited to the risk
management plan. Described in Section 11.1.3.1, the risk management plan lists the roles and responsibilities of
project team members and other stakeholders for risk management. This information is used when allocating owners
for agreed-upon risk responses. The risk management plan also defines the level of detail for the risk management
methodology for the project. It also specifies risk thresholds for the project based on the risk appetite of key stakeholders,
which define the acceptable target that the implementation of risk responses is required to achieve.

11.6.1.2 PROJECT DOCUMENTS

  Project documents that can be considered as inputs for this process include but are not limited to:
    Lessons learned register. Described in Section 4.4.3.1. Lessons learned earlier in the project with regard
   uu
       to implementing risk responses can be applied to later phases in the project to improve the effectiveness
       of this process.
    Risk register. Described in Section 11.2.3.1. The risk register records the agreed-upon risk responses for each
   uu
       individual risk and the nominated owners for each response plan.
    Risk report. Described in Section 11.2.3.2. The risk report includes an assessment of the current overall project
   uu
       risk exposure, as well as the agreed-upon risk response strategy. It also describes the major individual project
       risks with their planned responses.

11.6.1.3 ORGANIZATIONAL PROCESS ASSETS

   The organizational process assets that can influence the Implement Risk Responses process include but are not
limited to the lessons learned repository from similar completed projects that indicate the effectiveness of particular
risk responses.




                                                                                                              Part 1 - Guide

   11.6.2 IMPLEMENT RISK RESPONSES: TOOLS AND TECHNIQUES

   11.6.2.1 EXPERT JUDGMENT

      Described in Section 4.1.2.1. Expertise should be considered from individuals or groups with specialized
   knowledge to validate or modify risk responses if necessary, and decide how to implement them in the most
   efficient and effective manner.

   11.6.2.2 INTERPERSONAL AND TEAM SKILLS

      Interpersonal and team skills that can be used for this process include but are not limited to influencing. Some risk
   response actions may be owned by people outside the immediate project team or who have other competing demands.
   The project manager or person responsible for facilitating the risk process may need to exercise influencing (see
   Section 9.5.2.1) to encourage nominated risk owners to take necessary action where required.

   11.6.2.3 PROJECT MANAGEMENT INFORMATION SYSTEM (PMIS)

      Described in Section 4.3.2.2. Project management information systems can include schedule, resource, and cost
   software to ensure that agreed-upon risk response plans and their associated activities are integrated into the project
   alongside other project activities.



   11.6.3 IMPLEMENT RISK RESPONSES: OUTPUTS

   11.6.3.1 CHANGE REQUESTS

     Described in Section 4.3.3.4. Implementation of risk responses may result in a change request to the cost and
   schedule baselines or other components of the project management plan. Change requests are processed for review
   and disposition through the Perform Integrated Change Control process (Section 4.6).






                                                                                                                       451
11.6.3.2 PROJECT DOCUMENTS UPDATES

  Project documents that may be updated as a result of carrying out this process include but are not limited to:
   Issue log. Described in Section 4.3.3.3. Where issues are identified as part of the Implement Risk Responses
  uu
      process, they are recorded in the issue log.
   Lessons learned register. Described in Section 4.4.3.1. The lessons learned register is updated with information
  uu
      on challenges encountered when implementing risk responses and how they could have been avoided, as well
      as approaches that worked well for implementing risk responses.
   Project team assignments. Described in Section 9.3.3.2. Once the risk responses are confirmed, the necessary
  uu
      resources should be allocated to each action associated with a risk response plan. These resources include
      suitably qualified and experienced personnel to execute the agreed-upon action (usually within the project team),
      a specific budget and time allowance for the action, and any required technical resources to complete the action.
   Risk register. Described in Section 11.2.3.1. The risk register may be updated to reflect any changes to the
  uu
      previously agreed-upon risk responses for individual project risks that are subsequently made as a result of the
      Implement Risk Responses process.
   Risk report. Described in Section 11.2.3.2. The risk report may be updated to reflect any changes to the
  uu
      previously agreed-upon risk response to overall project risk exposure that are subsequently made as a result of
      the Implement Risk Responses process.




                                                                                                        Part 1 - Guide

   11.7 MONITOR RISKS
      Monitor Risks is the process of monitoring the implementation of agreed-upon risk response plans, tracking identified
   risks, identifying and analyzing new risks, and evaluating risk process effectiveness throughout the project. The key
   benefit of this process is that it enables project decisions to be based on current information about overall project risk
   exposure and individual project risks. This process is performed throughout the project. The inputs, tools and techniques,
   and outputs of the process are depicted in Figure 11-20. Figure 11-21 depicts the data flow diagram for the process.

   In order to ensure that the project team and key stakeholders are aware of the current level of risk exposure, project
work should be continuously monitored for new, changing, and outdated individual project risks and for changes in
the level of overall project risk by applying the Monitor Risks process. The Monitor Risks process uses performance
information generated during project execution to determine if:
    Implemented risk responses are effective,
   uu

    Level of overall project risk has changed,
   uu

    Status of identified individual project risks has changed,
   uu

    New individual project risks have arisen,
   uu

    Risk management approach is still appropriate,
   uu

    Project assumptions are still valid,
   uu

    Risk management policies and procedures are being followed,
   uu

    Contingency reserves for cost or schedule require modification, and
   uu

    Project strategy is still valid.

   11.7.1 MONITOR RISKS: INPUTS

   11.7.1.1 PROJECT MANAGEMENT PLAN

      Described in Section 4.2.3.1. Project management plan components include but are not limited to the risk
   management plan. Described in Section 11.3.1.1. The risk management plan provides guidance on how and when
   risks should be reviewed, which policies and procedures should be followed, the roles and responsibilities in the
   monitoring process, and reporting formats.

   11.7.1.2 PROJECT DOCUMENTS

     Project documents that should be considered as inputs for this process include but are not limited to:
       Issue log. Described in Section 4.3.3.3. The issue log is used to see if any of the open issues have been updated
      uu
         and necessitate an update to the risk register.
       Lessons learned register. Described in Section 4.4.3.1. Risk-related lessons from earlier in the project can be
      uu
         applied to later phases in the project.
       Risk register. Described in Section 11.2.3.1. The risk register has key inputs that include identified individual
      uu
         project risks, risk owners, agreed-upon risk responses, and specific implementation actions. It may also provide
         other details including control actions for assessing the effectiveness of response plans, symptoms and warning
         signs of risk, residual and secondary risks, and a watch list of low-priority risks.
       Risk report. Described in Section 11.2.3.2. The risk report includes an assessment of the current overall project
      uu
         risk exposure as well as the agreed-upon risk response strategy. It also describes the major individual risks with
         planned responses and risk owners.






                                                                                                                       455
11.7.1.3 WORK PERFORMANCE DATA

  Described in Section 4.3.3.2. Work performance data contains data on project status such as risk responses that
have been implemented, risks that have occurred, risks that are active and those that have been closed out.

11.7.1.4 WORK PERFORMANCE REPORTS

   Described in Section 4 5.3.1. Work performance reports provide information from performance measurements that
can be analyzed to provide project work performance information including variance analysis, earned value data, and
forecasting data. This information could be relevant when monitoring performance-related risks.



11.7.2 MONITOR RISKS: TOOLS AND TECHNIQUES

11.7.2.1 DATA ANALYSIS

  Data analysis techniques that can be used for this process include but are not limited to:
    Technical performance analysis. Technical performance analysis compares technical accomplishments during
   uu
       project execution to the schedule of technical achievement. It requires the definition of objective, quantifiable
       measures of technical performance, which can be used to compare actual results against targets. Such technical
       performance measures may include weight, transaction times, number of delivered defects, storage capacity,
       etc. Deviation can indicate the potential impact of threats or opportunities.
    Reserve analysis. Described in Section 7.2.2.6. Throughout execution of the project, some individual project
   uu
       risks may occur with positive or negative impacts on budget or schedule contingency reserves. Reserve analysis
       compares the amount of the contingency reserves remaining to the amount of risk remaining at any time in the
       project in order to determine if the remaining reserve is adequate. This may be communicated using various
       graphical representations, including a burndown chart.

11.7.2.2 AUDITS

   Described in Section 8.2.2.5. Risk audits are a type of audit that may be used to consider the effectiveness of the risk
management process. The project manager is responsible for ensuring that risk audits are performed at an appropriate
frequency, as defined in the project's risk management plan. Risk audits may be included during routine project review
meetings or may form part of a risk review meeting, or the team may choose to hold separate risk audit meetings. The
format for the risk audit and its objectives should be clearly defined before the audit is conducted.




                                                                                                            Part 1 - Guide
456
   11.7.2.3 MEETINGS

      Meetings that can be used during this process include but are not limited to risk reviews. Risk reviews are scheduled
   regularly and should examine and document the effectiveness of risk responses in dealing with overall project risk
   and with identified individual project risks. Risk reviews may also result in identification of new individual project risks,
   (including secondary risks that arise from agreed-upon risk responses), reassessment of current risks, the closing of
   risks that are outdated, issues that have arisen as the result of risks that have occurred, and identification of lessons
   to be learned for implementation in ongoing phases in the current project or in similar projects in the future. The risk
   review may be conducted as part of a periodic project status meeting or a dedicated risk review meeting may be held,
   as specified in the risk management plan.

      Described in Section 4.5.1.3. Work performance information includes information on how project risk management
   is performing by comparing the individual risks that have occurred with the expectation of how they would occur. This
   information indicates the effectiveness of the response planning and response implementation processes.

   11.7.3.2 CHANGE REQUESTS

      Described in Section 4.3.3.4. The Monitor Risks process may result in a change request to the cost and schedule
   baselines or other components of the project management plan. Change requests are processed for review and
   disposition through the Perform Integrated Change Control process (Section 4.6).
      Change requests can include recommended corrective and preventive actions to address the current level of overall
   project risk or to address individual project risks.

   11.7.3.3 PROJECT MANAGEMENT PLAN UPDATES

      Any change to the project management plan goes through the organization's change control process via a change
   request. This may affect any component of the project management plan.






                                                                                                                           457
11.7.3.4 PROJECT DOCUMENTS UPDATES

  Project documents that may be updated as a result of carrying out this process include but are not limited to:
   Assumption log. Described in Section 4.1.3.2. During the Monitor Risks process, new assumptions may be
  uu
      made, new constraints may be identified, and existing assumptions or constraints may be revisited and changed.
      The assumption log is updated with this new information.
   Issue log. Described in Section 4.3.3.3. Where issues are identified as part of the Monitor Risks process, these
  uu
      are recorded in the issue log.
   Lessons learned register. Described in Section 4.4.3.1. The lessons learned register is updated with any
  uu
      risk-related lessons learned during risk reviews so these can be used on later phases of the project or in
      future projects.
   Risk register. Described in Section 11.2.3.1. The risk register is updated with information on individual project
  uu
      risks generated during the Monitor Risks process. This may include adding new risks, updating outdated risks or
      risks that were realized, updating risk responses, and so forth.
   Risk report. Described in Section 11.2.3.2. As new information becomes available through the Monitor Risks
  uu
      process, the risk report is updated to reflect the current status of major individual project risks and the current
      level of overall project risk. The risk report may also include details of the top individual project risks, agreed-
      upon responses and owners, and conclusions and recommendations. It may also include conclusions from risk
      audits on the effectiveness of the risk management process.

11.7.3.5 ORGANIZATIONAL PROCESS ASSETS UPDATES

  Organizational process assets that are updated as a result of the Monitor Risks process include but are not limited to:
   Templates for the risk management plan, risk register, and risk report; and
  uu

   Risk breakdown structure.

    PROJE CT PR OCUREMENT M ANAGEM ENT
      Project Procurement Management includes the processes necessary to purchase or acquire products, services,
   or results needed from outside the project team. Project Procurement Management includes the management and
   control processes required to develop and administer agreements such as contracts, purchase orders, memoranda of
   agreements (MOAs), or internal service level agreements (SLAs). The personnel authorized to procure the goods and/or
    services required for the project may be members of the project team, management, or part of the organization's
   purchasing department if applicable.
     Project Procurement Management processes include the following:
     12.1 Plan Procurement Management--The process of documenting project procurement decisions, specifying the
   approach, and identifying potential sellers.
     12.2 Conduct Procurements--The process of obtaining seller responses, selecting a seller, and awarding a contract.
     12.3 Control Procurements--The process of managing procurement relationships, monitoring contract performance,
   making changes and corrections as appropriate, and closing out contracts.
      The procurement processes are presented as discrete processes with defined interfaces. In practice, procurement
   processes can be complex and can interact with each other and with processes in other Knowledge Areas in ways
   that cannot be completely detailed in the PMBOK(R) Guide. The processes described in this section are written from the
   viewpoint where goods or services are obtained from outside of the project.
      Figure 12-1 provides an overview of the Project Procurement Management processes. The Project Procurement
   Management processes are presented as discrete processes with defined interfaces while, in practice, they overlap and
   interact in ways that cannot be completely detailed in the PMBOK(R) Guide.

KEY CONCEPTS FOR PROJECT PROCUREMENT MANAGEMENT

   More than most other project management processes, there can be significant legal obligations and penalties tied to
the procurement process. The project manager does not have to be a trained expert in procurement management laws
and regulations but should be familiar enough with the procurement process to make intelligent decisions regarding
contracts and contractual relationships. The project manager is typically not authorized to sign legal agreements binding
the organization; this is reserved for those who have the authority to do so.
   The Project Procurement Management processes involve agreements that describe the relationship between two
parties--a buyer and a seller. Agreements can be as simple as the purchase of a defined quantity of labor hours at
a specified labor rate, or they can be as complex as multiyear international construction contracts. The contracting
approach and the contract itself should reflect the simplicity or complexity of the deliverables or required effort and
should be written in a manner that complies with local, national, and international laws regarding contracts.




                                                                                                                         Part 1 - Guide
460
      A contract should clearly state the deliverables and results expected, including any knowledge transfer from the seller
   to the buyer. Anything not in the contract cannot be legally enforced. When working internationally, project managers
   should keep in mind the effect that culture and local law have upon contracts and their enforceability, no matter how
   clearly a contract is written.
       A purchasing contract includes terms and conditions and may incorporate other buyer specifics as to what the seller
   is to perform or provide. It is the project management team's responsibility to make certain that all procurements meet
   the specific needs of the project while working with the procurement office to ensure organizational procurement
   policies are followed. Depending on the application area, an agreement can be a contract, an SLA, an understanding,
   an MOA, or a purchase order.
      Most organizations document policies and procedures specifically defining procurement rules and specifying who
   has authority to sign and administer such agreements on behalf of the organization. Across the world, organizations use
   different names for departments or divisions that deal with procurement, such as purchasing, contracting, procurement,
   or acquisitions; however, the responsibilities are likely to be similar.
       Although all project documents may be subject to some form of review and approval, the legally binding nature of
   a contract means it will be subjected to a more extensive approval process, often involving the legal department. In
   all cases, the primary focus of the review and approval process is to ensure that the contract adequately describes
   the products, services, or results that the seller is agreeing to provide, while being in compliance with the laws and
   regulations regarding procurements. These sections are often separate appendices or annexes, allowing standardized
   legal contract language to be used.
      A complex project may involve managing multiple contracts simultaneously or in sequence. In such cases, each
   contract life cycle may begin and end during any phase of the project life cycle. The buyer-seller relationship may exist
   at many levels on any one project, and between organizations internal to and external to the acquiring organization.
      Depending on the application area, the seller may be identified as a contractor, vendor, service provider, or supplier.
   The buyer may be the owner of the final product, a subcontractor, the acquiring organization, a service requestor, or the
   purchaser. The seller can be viewed during the contract life cycle first as a bidder, then as the selected source, and then
   as the contracted supplier or vendor.






                                                                                                                         461
  The winning bidder may manage the work as a project. In such cases:
    The buyer becomes the customer to subcontractors, suppliers, and service providers and is therefore a key
   uu
       project stakeholder from the seller's perspective.
    The seller's project management team may be concerned with all the processes involved in performing the work
   uu
       or providing the services.
    Terms and conditions of the contract and the procurement statement of work (SOW) become key inputs to many
   uu
       of the seller's management processes. The contract can actually contain the inputs (e.g., major deliverables,
       key milestones, cost objectives) or it can limit the project team's options (for example, buyer approval of staffing
       decisions is often required on IT integration projects). The procurement SOW may have other names, such as the
       technical statement of work.
    The seller itself may become a buyer of lower-tiered products, services, and materials from subcontractors
   uu
       and suppliers.
   In this section, it is assumed that the buyer of an item for the project is assigned to the project team and/or is part
of the larger organization. The seller is assumed to be providing services and/or materials to the project and is usually
outside the performing organization. For some projects, the seller role may be filled by a group or function that is part of
the performing organization but external to the project. For larger, more complex projects, the seller may become part
of an integrated project team after the contract is awarded.
   For smaller organizations or startup companies and those without a purchasing, contracting, or procurement
department, the project manager may assume the purchasing authority role to negotiate and sign contracts directly
(decentralized purchasing). For more mature organizations, the actual procurement and contracting functions
will be carried out by a separate department with the specific role to purchase, negotiate, and sign contracts
(centralized purchasing).
  In international contracting, the legal jurisdictions under which the contracts will be administered are clearly spelled
out in the contract. In most cases, the seller is an external contractor who is bound by a formal contractual relationship.




                                                                                                             Part 1 - Guide

TRENDS AND EMERGING PRACTICES IN PROCUREMENT MANAGEMENT

   There are a number of major trends in software tools, risk, processes, logistics, and technology with different
industries that can affect the success rate of projects. Trends and emerging practices for Project Procurement
Management include but are not limited to:
    Advances in tools. There has been significant improvement in the development of tools to manage the
   uu
      procurement and implementation phases of a project. Online tools for procurement now give the buyers a
      single point where procurements can be advertised and provide sellers with a single source to find procurement
      documents and complete them directly online. In the construction/engineering/infrastructure field, the increasing
      use of the building information model (BIM) in software tools has been shown to save significant amounts of time
      and money on projects using it. This approach can substantially reduce construction claims, thereby reducing
      both costs and schedule. Major companies and governments worldwide are beginning to mandate the use of
      BIM on large projects.
    More advanced risk management. An increasing trend in risk management is to write contracts that accurately
   uu
      allocate specific risks to those entities most capable of managing them. No contractor is capable of managing all
      the possible major risks on a project. The buyer will be required to accept the risks that the contractors do not have
      control over, such as changing corporate policies in the buying organization, changing regulatory requirements,
      and other risks from outside the project. Contracts may specify that risk management be performed as part of
      the contract.
    Changing contracting processes. There has been a significant growth in megaprojects in the past several
   uu
      years, particularly in the areas of infrastructure development and engineering projects. Multibillion-dollar projects
      are now common. A large proportion of these involve international contracts with multiple contractors from many
      countries and are inherently more risky than projects using only local contractors. Increasingly, the contractor
      works closely with the client in the procurement process to take advantage of discounts through quantity
      purchases or other special considerations. For these projects, the use of internationally recognized standard
      contract forms is increasing in order to reduce problems and claims during execution.




                                                                                                                       463
   Logistics and supply chain management. Because so many large engineering, construction infrastructure
  uu
      projects are done through multiple international contractors, the management of the flow of materials becomes
      critical to successful completion. For long-lead items, both the manufacture of the items and their transportation
      to the project site become schedule-drivers. In the IT field, a long-lead item may require ordering 2 to 3 months
      in advance. In complex construction projects, long-lead items may require ordering 1 to 2 years in advance or
      longer. For these projects, long-lead items may be procured in advance of other procurement contracts to meet
      the planned project completion date. It is possible to begin contracting for these long-lead materials, supplies,
      or equipment before the final design of the end product itself is completed based on the known requirements
      identified in the top-level design. The management of the supply chain is an area of increasing emphasis by the
      contractor's project team. Not only are primary sources of supplies identified early in the project, but secondary,
      back-up sources are also generally identified. Many countries around the world require international contractors
      to purchase certain minimum percentages of material and supplies from local vendors.
   Technology and stakeholder relations. Publicly funded projects are under increasing scrutiny. A trend in
  uu
      infrastructure and commercial construction projects is the use of technology including web cameras (webcams)
      to improve stakeholder communications and relations. During construction, one or more webcams are installed
      on the site, with periodic updates to a publicly available website. The progress on the project can be viewed on
      the Internet by all stakeholders. Video data can also be stored, allowing analysis if a claim arises. Some projects
      have discovered that the use of webcams minimizes disputes relating to the construction work on site, as the
      webcam has recorded the events, so there should be no disagreement about the facts of the matter.
   Trial engagements. Not every seller is well suited for an organization's environment. Therefore, some projects
  uu
      will engage several candidate sellers for initial deliverables and work products on a paid basis before making the
      full commitment to a larger portion of the project scope. This accelerates momentum by allowing the buyer to
      evaluate potential partners, while simultaneously making progress on project work.




                                                                                                          Part 1 - Guide
464
   TAILORING CONSIDERATIONS

      Because each project is unique, the project manager may need to tailor the way that Project Procurement Management
   processes are applied. Considerations for tailoring include but are not limited to:
       Complexity of procurement. Is there one main procurement or are there multiple procurements at different
      uu
         times with different sellers that add to the complexity of the procurements?
       Physical location. Are the buyers and sellers in the same location, or reasonably close, or in different time zones,
      uu
         countries, or continents?
       Governance and regulatory environment. Are local laws and regulations regarding procurement activities
      uu
         integrated with the organization's procurement policies? How does this affect contract auditing requirements?
       Availability of contractors. Are there available contractors who are capable of performing the work?
      uu


   CONSIDERATIONS FOR AGILE/ADAPTIVE ENVIRONMENTS

      In agile environments, specific sellers may be used to extend the team. This collaborative working relationship can
   lead to a shared risk procurement model where both the buyer and the seller share in the risk and rewards associated
   with a project.
      Larger projects may use an adaptive approach for some deliverables and a more stable approach for other parts.
   In these cases, a governing agreement such as a master services agreement (MSA) may be used for the overall
   engagement, with the adaptive work being placed in an appendix or supplement. This allows changes to occur on the
   adaptive scope without impacting the overall contract.






                                                                                                                       465
12.1 PLAN PROCUREMENT MANAGEMENT
  Plan Procurement Management is the process of documenting project procurement decisions, specifying the
approach and identifying potential sellers. The key benefit of this process is that it determines whether to acquire
goods and services from outside the project and, if so, what to acquire as well as how and when to acquire it. Goods
and services may be procured from other parts of the performing organization or from external sources. This process is
performed once or at predefined points in the project. The inputs, tools and techniques, and outputs of this process are
depicted in Figure 12-2. Figure 12-3 depicts the data flow diagram of the process.

   Defining roles and responsibilities related to procurement should be done early in the Plan Procurement Management
process. The project manager should ensure that the project team is staffed with procurement expertise at the level
required for the project. Participants in the procurement process may include personnel from the purchasing or
procurement department as well as personnel from the buying organization's legal department. These responsibilities
should be documented in the procurement management plan.
  Typical steps might be:
    Prepare the procurement statement of work (SOW) or terms of reference (TOR).
   uu

    Prepare a high-level cost estimate to determine the budget.
   uu

    Advertise the opportunity.
   uu

    Identify a short list of qualified sellers.
   uu

    Prepare and issue bid documents.
   uu

    Prepare and submit proposals by the seller.
   uu

    Conduct a technical evaluation of the proposals including quality.
   uu

    Perform a cost evaluation of the proposals.
   uu

    Prepare the final combined quality and cost evaluation to select the winning proposal.
   uu

    Finalize negotiations and sign contract between the buyer and the seller.
   uu

   The requirements of the project schedule can significantly influence the strategy during the Plan Procurement
Management process. Decisions made in developing the procurement management plan can also influence the
project schedule and are integrated with the Develop Schedule process, the Estimate Activity Resources process, and
make-or-buy decisions.



12.1.1 PLAN PROCUREMENT MANAGEMENT: INPUTS

12.1.1.1 PROJECT CHARTER

  Described in Section 4.1.3.1. The project charter contains the objectives, project description, summary milestones,
and the preapproved financial resources.




                                                                                                      Part 1 - Guide
468
   12.1.1.2 BUSINESS DOCUMENTS

     Described in Section 1.2.6. The business documents include the following:
      Business case. The procurement strategy and business case need to be aligned to ensure the business case
     uu
         remains valid.
      Benefits management plan. The benefits management plan describes when specific project benefits are
     uu
         expected to be available, which will drive procurement dates and contract language.

   12.1.1.3 PROJECT MANAGEMENT PLAN

     Described in Section 4.2.3.1. Project management plan components include but are not limited to:
      Scope management plan. Described in Section 5.1.3.1. The scope management plan describes how the scope
     uu
         of work by the contractors will be managed through the execution phase of the project.
      Quality management plan. Described in Section 8.1.3.1. The quality management plan contains the applicable
     uu
         industry standards and codes the project is required to follow. This information is used in bidding documents
         such as the RFP and will eventually be referenced in the contract. This information may be used in supplier
         prequalification or as part of the selection criteria.
      Resource management plan. Described in Section 9.1.3.1. The resource management plan has information on
     uu
         which resources will be purchased or leased, along with any assumptions or constraints that would influence
         the procurement.
      Scope baseline. Described in Section 5.4.3.1. The scope baseline contains the scope statement, WBS, and WBS
     uu
         dictionary. Early in the project, the project scope may still be evolving. The elements of the scope that are known
         are used to develop the statement of work (SOW) and the terms of reference (TOR).

   12.1.1.4 PROJECT DOCUMENTS

     Project documents that can be considered as inputs for this process include but are not limited to:
      Milestone list. Described in Section 6.2.3.3. This list of major milestones show when the sellers are required to
     uu
         deliver their results.





      Project team assignments. Described in Section 9.3.3.2. The project team assignments contain information on
     uu





         the skills and abilities of the project team and their availability to support the procurement activities. If the project
         team does not have the skills to perform the procurement activities for which they are responsible, additional
         resources will need to be acquired or training will need to be provided, or both.




                                                                                                                             469
    Requirements documentation. Described in Section 5.2.3.1. Requirements documentation may include:
   uu

      nuTechnical requirements that the seller is required to satisfy, and
      nuRequirements    with contractual and legal implications that may include health, safety, security, performance,
          environmental, insurance, intellectual property rights, equal employment opportunity, licenses, permits, and
          other nontechnical requirements.
    Requirements traceability matrix. Described in Section 5.2.3.2. The requirements traceability matrix links
   uu
      product requirements from their origin to the deliverables that satisfy them.
    Resource requirements. Described in Section 9.2.3.1. Resource requirements contain information on specific
   uu
      needs such as team and phyisical resources that may need to be acquired.
    Risk register. Described in Section 11.2.3.1. The risk register provides the list of risks, along with the results of
   uu
      risk analysis and risk response planning. Some risks are transferred via a procurement agreement.
    Stakeholder register. Described in Section 13.1.3.1. The stakeholder register provides details on the
   uu
      project participants and their interests in the project, including regulatory agencies, contracting personnel,
      and legal personnel.

12.1.1.5 ENTERPRISE ENVIRONMENTAL FACTORS

  The enterprise environmental factors that can influence the Plan Procurement Management process include but are
not limited to:
    Marketplace conditions;
   uu

   uu

    Financial accounting and contract payments system.
   uu




                                                                                                          Part 1 - Guide
470
   12.1.1.6 ORGANIZATIONAL PROCESS ASSETS

      The various types of contractual agreements used by the organization also influence decisions for the Plan Procurement
   Management process. The organizational process assets that can influence the Plan Procurement Management process
   include but are not limited to:
       Preapproved seller lists. Lists of sellers that have been properly vetted can streamline the steps needed to
      uu
          advertise the opportunity and shorten the timeline for the seller selection process.
       Formal procurement policies, procedures, and guidelines. Most organizations have formal procurement
      uu
          policies and buying organizations. When such procurement support is not available, the project team should
          supply both the resources and the expertise to perform such procurement activities.
       Contract types. All legal contractual relationships generally fall into one of two broad families: either fixed-price
      uu
          or cost-reimbursable. Also, there is a third hybrid type commonly used called the time and materials contract.
          The more popular contract types in use are discussed below as discrete types, but, in practice, it is not unusual
          to combine one or more types into a single procurement.
          nuFixed-price   contracts. This category of contracts involves setting a fixed total price for a defined product,
             service, or result to be provided. These contracts should be used when the requirements are well defined and
             no significant changes to the scope are expected. Types of fixed-price contract include:
             muFirm   fixed price (FFP). The most commonly used contract type is the FFP. It is favored by most buying
                 organizations because the price for goods is set at the outset and not subject to change unless the scope
                 of work changes.
             muFixed    price incentive fee (FPIF). This fixed-price arrangement gives the buyer and seller some flexibility
                 in that it allows for deviation from performance, with financial incentives tied to achieving agreed-upon
                 metrics. Typically, such financial incentives are related to cost, schedule, or technical performance of the
                 seller. Under FPIF contracts, a price ceiling is set, and all costs above the price ceiling are the responsibility
                 of the seller.
             muFixed price with economic price adjustments (FPEPA). This type is used whenever the seller's performance
                 period spans a considerable period of years, or if the payments are made in a different currency. It
                 is a fixed-price contract, but with a special provision allowing for predefined final adjustments to the
                 contract price due to changed conditions, such as inflation changes or cost increases (or decreases) for
                 specific commodities.






                                                                                                                              471
    Cost-reimbursable contracts. This category of contract involves payments (cost reimbursements) to the
   uu
      seller for all legitimate actual costs incurred for completed work, plus a fee representing seller profit. This type
      should be used if the scope of work is expected to change significantly during the execution of the contract.
      Variations can include:
      nuCost plus fixed fee (CPFF). The seller is reimbursed for all allowable costs for performing the contract work and
          receives a fixed-fee payment calculated as a percentage of the initial estimated project costs. Fee amounts
          do not change unless the project scope changes.
      nuCost plus incentive fee (CPIF). The seller is reimbursed for all allowable costs for performing the contract work
          and receives a predetermined incentive fee based on achieving certain performance objectives as set forth
          in the contract. In CPIF contracts, if the final costs are less or greater than the original estimated costs, then
          both the buyer and seller share costs from the departures based upon a prenegotiated cost-sharing formula,
          for example, an 80/20 split over/under target costs based on the actual performance of the seller.
      nuCost    plus award fee (CPAF). The seller is reimbursed for all legitimate costs, but the majority of the fee
          is earned based on the satisfaction of certain broad subjective performance criteria that are defined and
          incorporated into the contract. The determination of fee is based solely on the subjective determination of
          seller performance by the buyer and is generally not subject to appeals.
    Time and material contracts (T&M). Time and material contracts (also called time and means) are a hybrid
   uu
      type of contractual arrangement with aspects of both cost-reimbursable and fixed-price contracts. They are often
      used for staff augmentation, acquisition of experts, and any outside support when a precise statement of work
      cannot be quickly prescribed.

research includes examination of industry and specific seller capabilities. Procurement teams may leverage information
gained at conferences, online reviews, and a variety of sources to identify market capabilities. The team may also refine
specific procurement objectives to leverage maturing technologies while balancing risks associated with the breadth of
sellers who can provide the desired materials or services.

12.1.2.3 DATA ANALYSIS

   Data analysis techniques that can be used for this process include but are not limited to make-or-buy analysis.
A make-or-buy analysis is used to determine whether work or deliverables can best be accomplished by the project
team or should be purchased from outside sources. Factors to consider in the make-or-buy decision include the
organization's current resource allocation and their skills and abilities, the need for specialized expertise, the desire to
not expand permanent employment obligations, and the need for independent expertise. It also includes evaluating the
risks involved with each make-or-buy decision.
  Make-or-buy analysis may use payback period, return on investment (ROI), internal rate of return (IRR), discounted
cash flow, net present value (NPV), benefit/cost analysis (BCA), or other techniques in order to decide whether to include
something as part of the project or purchase it externally.

12.1.2.4 SOURCE SELECTION ANALYSIS

   It is necessary to review the prioritization of the competing demands for the project before deciding on the selection
method. Since competitive selection methods may require sellers to invest a large amount of time and resources
upfront, it is a good practice to include the evaluation method in the procurement documents so bidders know how they
will be evaluated. Commonly used selection methods include the following:
    Least cost. The least cost method may be appropriate for procurements of a standard or routine nature where
   uu
       well-established practices and standards exist and from which a specific and well-defined outcome is expected,
       which can be executed at different costs.
    Qualifications only. The qualifications only selection method applies when the time and cost of a full selection
   uu
       process would not make sense because the value of the procurement is relatively small. The buyer establishes
       a short list and selects the bidder with the best credibility, qualifications, experience, expertise, areas of
       specialization, and references.




                                                                                                                       473
    Quality-based/highest technical proposal score. The selected firm is asked to submit a proposal with both
   uu
       technical and cost details and is then invited to negotiate the contract if the technical proposal proves acceptable.
       Using this method, technical proposals are first evaluated based on the quality of the technical solution offered.
       The seller who submitted the highest-ranked technical proposal is selected if their financial proposal can be
       negotiated and accepted.
    Quality and cost-based. The quality and cost-based method allows cost to be included as a factor in the seller
   uu
       selection process. In general, when risk and/or uncertainty are greater for the project, quality should be a key
       element when compared to cost.
    Sole source. The buyer asks a specific seller to prepare technical and financial proposals, which are then
   uu
       negotiated. Since there is no competition, this method is acceptable only when properly justified and should be
       viewed as an exception.
    Fixed budget. The fixed-budget method requires disclosing the available budget to invited sellers in the RFP
   uu
       and selecting the highest-ranking technical proposal within the budget. Because sellers are subject to a cost
       constraint, they will adapt the scope and quality of their offer to that budget. The buyer should therefore ensure
       that the budget is compatible with the SOW and that the seller will be able to perform the tasks within the budget.
       This method is appropriate only when the SOW is precisely defined, no changes are anticipated, and the budget
       is fixed and cannot be exceeded.

12.1.2.5 MEETINGS

   Research alone may not provide specific information to formulate a procurement strategy without additional
information interchange meetings with potential bidders. By collaborating with potential bidders, the organization
purchasing the material or service may benefit while the seller can influence a mutually beneficial approach or product.
Meetings can be used to determine the strategy for managing and monitoring the procurement.

   12.1.3 PLAN PROCUREMENT MANAGEMENT: OUTPUTS

   12.1.3.1 PROCUREMENT MANAGEMENT PLAN

     The procurement management plan contains the activities to be undertaken during the procurement process. It
   should document whether international competitive bidding, national competitive bidding, local bidding, etc., should be
   done. If the project is financed externally, the sources and availability of funding should be aligned with the procurement
   management plan and the project schedule.
     The procurement management plan can include guidance for:
       How procurement will be coordinated with other project aspects, such as project schedule development and
      uu
          control processes;
       Timetable of key procurement activities;
      uu

       Procurement metrics to be used to manage contracts;
      uu

       Stakeholder roles and responsibilities related to procurement, including authority and constraints of the project
      uu
          team when the performing organization has a procurement department;
       Constraints and assumptions that could affect planned procurements;
      uu

       The legal jurisdiction and the currency in which payments will be made;
      uu

       Determination of whether independent estimates will be used and whether they are needed as evaluation criteria;
      uu

       Risk management issues including identifying requirements for performance bonds or insurance contracts to
      uu
          mitigate some forms of project risk; and
       Prequalified sellers, if any, to be used.
      uu

     A procurement management plan can be formal or informal, can be highly detailed or broadly framed, and is based
   upon the needs of each project.






                                                                                                                          475
12.1.3.2 PROCUREMENT STRATEGY

   Once the make-or-buy analysis is complete and the decision is made to acquire from outside the project, a procurement
strategy should be identified. The objective of the procurement strategy is to determine the project delivery method, the
type of legally binding agreement(s), and how the procurement will advance through the procurement phases.
    Delivery methods. Delivery methods are different for professional services versus construction projects.
   uu

       nuFor  professional services, delivery methods include: buyer/services provider with no subcontracting, buyer/
          services provider with subcontracting allowed, joint venture between buyer and services provider, and buyer/
          services provider acts as the representative.
       nuFor industrial or commercial construction, project delivery methods include but are not limited to: turnkey,
          design build (DB), design bid build (DBB), design build operate (DBO), build own operate transfer (BOOT),
          and others.
    Contract payment types. Contract payment types are separate from the project delivery methods and are
   uu
       coordinated with the buying organization's internal financial systems. They include but are not limited to these
       contract types plus variations: lump sum, firm fixed price, cost plus award fees, cost plus incentive fees, time
       and materials, target cost, and others.
       nuFixed-price contracts are suitable when the type of work is predictable and the requirements are well defined
          and not likely to change.
       nuCost plus contracts are suitable when the work is evolving, likely to change, or not well defined.
       nuIncentives and awards may be used to align the objectives of buyer and seller.

    Procurement phases. The procurement strategy can also include information on procurement phases.
   uu
       Information may include:
       nuSequencing   or phasing of the procurement, a description of each phase and the specific objectives
          of each phase;
       nuProcurement performance indicators and milestones to be used in monitoring;
       nuCriteria for moving from phase to phase;
       nuMonitoring and evaluation plan for tracking progress; and
       nuProcess for knowledge transfer for use in subsequent phases.




                                                                                                          Part 1 - Guide
476
   12.1.3.3 BID DOCUMENTS

     Bid documents are used to solicit proposals from prospective sellers. Terms such as bid, tender, or quotation are generally
   used when the seller selection decision is based on price (as when buying commercial or standard items), while a term
   such as proposal is generally used when other considerations such as technical capability or technical approach are the
   most important. Specific procurement terminology used may vary by industry and location of the procurement.
      Depending on the goods or services needed, the bidding documents can include a request for information, request
   for quotation, request for proposal, or other appropriate procurement documents. The conditions involving their use are
   presented below:
       Request for information (RFI). An RFI is used when more information on the goods and services to be acquired
      uu
          is needed from the sellers. It will typically be followed by an RFQ or RFP.
       Request for quotation (RFQ). An RFQ is commonly used when more information is needed on how vendors
      uu
          would satisfy the requirements and/or how much it will cost.
       Request for proposal (RFP). An RFP is used when there is a problem in the project and the solution is not easy
      uu
          to determine. This is the most formal of the "request for" documents and has strict procurement rules for content,
          timeline, and seller responses.
      The buyer structures procurement documents to facilitate an accurate and complete response from each prospective
   seller and to facilitate easy evaluation of the responses. These documents include a description of the desired form of
   the response, the relevant procurement SOW, and any required contractual provisions.
      The complexity and level of detail of the procurement documents should be consistent with the value of, and risks
   associated with, the planned procurement. Procurement documents are required to be sufficiently detailed to ensure
   consistent, appropriate responses, but flexible enough to allow consideration of any seller suggestions for better ways
   to satisfy the same requirements.

   12.1.3.4 PROCUREMENT STATEMENT OF WORK

      The statement of work (SOW) for each procurement is developed from the project scope baseline and defines only
   that portion of the project scope that is to be included within the related contract. The SOW describes the procurement
   item in sufficient detail to allow prospective sellers to determine if they are capable of providing the products, services,





   or results. Sufficient detail can vary based on the nature of the item, the needs of the buyer, or the expected contract
   form. Information included in a SOW can include specifications, quantity desired, quality levels, performance data, period





   of performance, work location, and other requirements.




                                                                                                                           477
   The procurement SOW should be clear, complete, and concise. It includes a description of any collateral services
required, such as performance reporting or post-project operational support for the procured item. The SOW can be
revised as required as it moves through the procurement process until incorporated into a signed agreement.
  The phrase terms of reference (TOR) is sometimes used when contracting for services. Similar to the procurement
SOW, a TOR typically includes these elements:
    Tasks the contractor is required to perform as well as specified coordination requirements;
   uu

    Standards the contractor will fulfill that are applicable to the project;
   uu

    Data that needs to be submitted for approval;
   uu

    Detailed list of all data and services that will be provided to the contractor by the buyer for use in performing the
   uu
       contract, if applicable; and
    Definition of the schedule for initial submission and the review/approval time required.
   uu


12.1.3.5 SOURCE SELECTION CRITERIA

   In choosing evaluation criteria, the buyer seeks to ensure that the proposal selected will offer the best quality for the
services required. The source selection criteria may include but are not limited to:
    Capability and capacity;
   uu

    Product cost and life cycle cost;
   uu

    Delivery dates;
   uu

    Technical expertise and approach;
   uu

    Specific relevant experience;
   uu

    Adequacy of the proposed approach and work plan in responding to the SOW;
   uu

    Key staff's qualifications, availability, and competence;
   uu

    Financial stability of the firm;
   uu

    Management experience; and
   uu

    Suitability of the knowledge transfer program, including training.
   uu




                                                                                                             Part 1 - Guide
478
  For international projects, evaluation criteria may include "local content" requirements, for example, participation by
nationals among proposed key staff.
   The specific criteria may be a numerical score, color-code, or a written description of how well the seller satisfies
the buying organization's needs. The criteria will be part of a weighting system that can be used to select a single seller
that will be asked to sign a contract and establish a negotiating sequence by ranking all the proposals by the weighted
evaluation scores assigned to each proposal.

12.1.3.6 MAKE-OR-BUY DECISIONS

   A make-or-buy analysis results in a decision as to whether particular work can best be accomplished by the project
team or needs to be purchased from outside sources.

12.1.3.7 INDEPENDENT COST ESTIMATES

   For large procurements, the procuring organization may elect to either prepare its own independent estimate or
have a cost estimate prepared by an outside professional estimator to serve as a benchmark on proposed responses.
Significant differences in cost estimates can be an indication that the procurement SOW was deficient or ambiguous, or
that the prospective sellers either misunderstood or failed to respond fully to the procurement SOW.

12.1.3.8 CHANGE REQUESTS

   Described in Section 4.3.3.4. A decision that involves procuring goods, services, or resources may require a change
request. Other decisions during procurement planning can also create the need for additional change requests. Changes
to the project management plan, its subsidiary plans, and other components may result in change requests that impact
procurement actions. Change requests are processed for review and disposition through the Perform Integrated Change
Control process (Section 4.6).




                                                                                                                       479
12.1.3.9 PROJECT DOCUMENTS UPDATES

  Project documents that may be updated as a result of carrying out this process include but are not limited to:
   Lessons learned register. Described in Section 4.4.3.1. The lessons learned register is updated with any relevant
  uu
      lessons regarding regulations and compliance, data gathering, data analysis, and source selection analysis.
   Milestone list. Described in Section 6.2.3.3. This list of major milestones shows when the sellers are expected
  uu
      to deliver their results.
   Requirements documentation. Described in Section 5.2.3.1. Requirements documentation may include:
  uu

      nuTechnical requirements that the seller is required to satisfy, and
      nuRequirements   with contractual and legal implications that may include health, safety, security, performance,
         environmental, insurance, intellectual property rights, equal employment opportunity, licenses, permits, and
         other nontechnical requirements.
   Requirements traceability matrix. Described in Section 5.2.3.2. The requirements traceability matrix links
  uu
      product requirements from their origin to the deliverables that satisfy them.
   Risk register. Described in Section 11.2.3.1. Each approved seller comes with its own unique set of risks,
  uu
      depending on the seller's organization, the duration of the contract, the external environment, the project delivery
      method, the type of contracting vehicle chosen, and the final agreed-upon price.
   Stakeholder register. Described in Section 13.1.3.1. The stakeholder register is updated with any additional
  uu
      information on stakeholders, particularly regulatory agencies, contracting personnel, and legal personnel.




                                                                                                           Part 1 - Guide
480
   12.1.3.10 ORGANIZATIONAL PROCESS ASSETS UPDATES

      Organizational process assets that are updated as a result of the Plan Procurement Management process include but
   are not limited to information on qualified sellers.
      For projects with few procurements and relatively simple procurements, some of these outputs may be combined.
   However, for projects with large, complex procurements and where much of the work is done by contractors, there are
   several different types of documentation. Table 12-1 is a representative list of common types of documents used in
   procurements and some of their contents. Given the legal nature of procurements, this list should not be considered
   prescriptive, but rather it should be used as a general outline of types of documents and contents needed to conduct
   procurement. The organization, environment, and legal constraints dictate the required procurement documents and
   information needed for the project.

                                              Table 12-1. Comparison of Procurement Documentation

   12.2 CONDUCT PROCUREMENTS
      Conduct Procurements is the process of obtaining seller responses, selecting a seller, and awarding a contract. The
   key benefit of this process is that it selects a qualified seller and implements the legal agreement for delivery. The end
   results of the process are the established agreements including formal contracts. This process is performed periodically
   throughout the project as needed. The inputs, tools and techniques, and outputs of the Conduct Procurements process
   are depicted in Figure 12-4. Figure 12-5 depicts the data flow diagram for the process.

      Requirements management plan. Described in Section 5.1.3.2. The requirements management plan describes
     uu
         how requirements will be analyzed, documented, and managed. The requirements management plan may
         include how sellers will manage the requirements they are under agreement to satisfy.
      Communications management plan. Described in Section 10.1.3.1. The communications management plan
     uu
         describes how communications between buyers and sellers will be conducted.
      Risk management plan. Described in Section 11.1.3.1. The risk management plan is a component of the
     uu
         project management plan and describes how risk management activities will be structured and performed for
         the project.
      Procurement management plan. Described in Section 12.1.3.1. The procurement management plan contains
     uu
         the activities to be undertaken during the Conduct Procurements process.
      Configuration management plan. Described in Section 5.6.1.1. The configuration management plan defines
     uu
         those items that are configurable, those items that require formal change control, and the process for controlling
         changes to such items. It includes formats and processes for how sellers will provide configuration management
         in a way that is consistent with the buyer's approach.
      Cost baseline. Described in Section 7.3.3.1. The cost baseline includes the budget for the procurement as well
     uu
         as costs associated with managing the procurement process and sellers.

   12.2.1.2 PROJECT DOCUMENTS

     Project documents that can be considered as inputs for this process include but are not limited to:
      Lessons learned register. Described in Section 4.4.3.1. Lessons learned earlier in the project with regard to
     uu





         conducting procurements can be applied to later phases in the project to improve the efficiency of this process.





      Project schedule. Described in Section 6.5.3.2. The project schedule identifies the start and end dates of project
     uu
         activities, including procurement activities. It also defines when contractor deliverables are due.




   484
       Requirements documentation. Described in Section 5.2.3.1. Requirements documentation may include:
      uu

         nuTechnical requirements the seller is required to satisfy, and
         nuRequirements   with contractual and legal implications that may include health, safety, security, performance,
            environmental, insurance, intellectual property rights, equal employment opportunity, licenses, permits, and
            other nontechnical requirements.
       Risk register. Described in Section 11.2.3.1. Each approved seller comes with its own unique set of risks,
      uu
         depending on the seller's organization, the duration of the contract, the external environment, the project delivery
         method, the type of contracting vehicle chosen, and the final agreed-upon price.
       Stakeholder register. Described in Section 13.1.3.1. This document contains all of the details about the
      uu
         identified stakeholders.

   12.2.1.3 PROCUREMENT DOCUMENTATION

     Procurement documentation provides a written record used in reaching the legal agreement, and may include older
   documents predating the current project. Procurement documentation can include:
       Bid documents. Described in Section 12.1.3.3. Procurement documents include the RFI, RFP, RFQ, or other
      uu
         documents sent to sellers so they can develop a bid response.
       Procurement statement of work. Described in Section 12.1.3.4. The procurement statement of work (SOW)
      uu
         provides sellers with a clearly stated set of goals, requirements, and outcomes from which they can provide
         a quantifiable response.
       Independent cost estimates. Described in Section 12.1.3.7. Independent cost estimates are developed either
      uu
         internally or by using external resources and provide a reasonableness check against the proposals submitted
         by bidders.
       Source selection criteria. Described in Section 12.1.3.5. These criteria describe how bidder proposals will be
      uu
         evaluated, including evaluation criteria and weights. For risk mitigation, the buyer may decide to sign agreements
         with more than one seller to mitigate damage caused by a single seller having problems that impact the
         overall project.






                                                                                                                         485
12.2.1.4 SELLER PROPOSALS

   Seller proposals, prepared in response to a procurement document package, form the basic information that will be
used by an evaluation body to select one or more successful bidders (sellers). If the seller is going to submit a price
proposal, good practice is to require that it be separate from the technical proposal. The evaluation body reviews each
submitted proposal according to the source selection criteria and selects the seller that can best satisfy the buying
organization's requirements.

12.2.1.5 ENTERPRISE ENVIRONMENTAL FACTORS

  The enterprise environmental factors that can influence the Conduct Procurements Process include:
    Local laws and regulations regarding procurements;

    List of preferred sellers that have been prequalified,
   uu

    Organizational policies that influence the selection of a seller,
   uu

    Specific organizational templates or guidelines that will determine the way agreements are drafted and built,
   uu
       and
    Financial policies and procedures regarding invoicing and payment processes.
   uu




                                                                                                         Part 1 - Guide

   12.2.2 CONDUCT PROCUREMENTS: TOOLS AND TECHNIQUES

   12.2.2.1 EXPERT JUDGMENT

      Described in Section 4.1.2.1 Expertise should be considered from individuals or groups with specialized knowledge
   or training in the following topics:
       Proposal evaluation;
      uu

       Technical or subject matter;
      uu

       Relevant functional areas such as finance, engineering, design, development, supply chain management, etc.;
      uu

       Industry regulatory environment;
      uu

       Laws, regulations, and compliance requirements; and
      uu

       Negotiation.
      uu


   12.2.2.2 ADVERTISING

      Advertising is communicating with users or potential users of a product, service, or result. Existing lists of potential
   sellers often can be expanded by placing advertisements in general circulation publications such as selected newspapers
   or in specialty trade publications. Most government jurisdictions require public advertising or online posting of pending
   government contracts.

   12.2.2.3 BIDDER CONFERENCES

      Bidder conferences (also called contractor conferences, vendor conferences, and pre-bid conferences) are meetings
   between the buyer and prospective sellers prior to proposal submittal. They are used to ensure that all prospective
   bidders have a clear and common understanding of the procurement and no bidders receive preferential treatment.

   12.2.2.4 DATA ANALYSIS

      A data analysis technique that can be used for this process includes but is not limited to proposal evaluation. Proposals





   are evaluated to ensure they are complete and respond in full to the bid documents, procurement statement of work,
   source selection criteria, and any other documents that went out in the bid package.





                                                                                                                          487
12.2.2.5 INTERPERSONAL AND TEAM SKILLS

   Interpersonal and team skills that can be used for this process include negotiation. Negotiation is a discussion aimed
at reaching an agreement. Procurement negotiation clarifies the structure, rights, and obligations of the parties and
other terms of the purchases so that mutual agreement can be reached prior to signing the contract. Final document
language reflects all agreements reached. Negotiation concludes with a signed contract document or other formal
agreement that can be executed by both buyer and seller.
   The negotiation should be led by a member of the procurement team that has the authority to sign contracts. The
project manager and other members of the project management team may be present during negotiation to provide
assistance as needed.



12.2.3 CONDUCT PROCUREMENTS: OUTPUTS

12.2.3.1 SELECTED SELLERS

   The selected sellers are those who have been judged to be in a competitive range based on the outcome of the proposal
or bid evaluation. Final approval of complex, high-value, high-risk procurements will generally require organizational
senior management approval prior to award.




                                                                                                          Part 1 - Guide
488
12.2.3.2 AGREEMENTS

   A contract is a mutually binding agreement that obligates the seller to provide the specified products, services, or
results; obligates the buyer to compensate the seller; and represents a legal relationship that is subject to remedy in the
courts. The major components in an agreement document will vary, and may include but are not limited to:
    Procurement statement of work or major deliverables;
   uu

    Schedule, milestones, or date by which a schedule is required;
   uu

    Performance reporting;
   uu

    Pricing and payment terms;
   uu

    Inspection, quality, and acceptance criteria;
   uu

    Warranty and future product support;
   uu

    Incentives and penalties;
   uu

    Insurance and performance bonds;
   uu

    Subordinate subcontractor approvals;
   uu

    General terms and conditions;
   uu

    Change request handling; and
   uu

    Termination clause and alternative dispute resolution mechanisms.
   uu


12.2.3.3 CHANGE REQUESTS

   Described in Section 4.3.3.4. Change requests to the project management plan, its subsidiary plans, and other
components are processed for review and disposition through the Perform Integrated Change Control process
(Section 4.6).




                                                                                                                       489
12.2.3.4 PROJECT MANAGEMENT PLAN UPDATES

   Any change to the project management plan goes through the organization's change control process via a change
request. Components of the project management plan that may require a change request for the project management
plan include but are not limited to:
    Requirements management plan. Described in Section 5.1.3.2. There may be changes to project requirements
   uu
      due to changes identified by sellers.
    Quality management plan. Described in Section 8.1.3.1. Sellers may offer alternative quality standards or
   uu
      alternative solutions that impact the quality approaches defined in the quality management plan.
    Communications management plan. Described in Section 10.1.3.1. As sellers are hired, the communications
   uu
      management plan is updated to incorporate their communications needs and approaches.
    Risk management plan. Described in Section 11.1.3.1. Each agreement and seller has its own set of risks that
   uu
      may require updates to the risk management plan. Specific risks are incorporated into the risk register.
    Procurement management plan. Described in Section 12.1.3.1. Updates may be required depending on the
   uu
      results of the contracting and negotiations processes.
    Scope baseline. Described in Section 5.4.3.1. The project WBS and deliverables documented in the scope
   uu
      baseline are considered when performing procurement activities. Any one or all of these may change during the
      procurement process.
    Schedule baseline. Described in Section 6.5.3.1. If there are delivery changes created by sellers that impact
   uu
      overall project schedule performance, the baseline schedule may need to be updated and approved to reflect the
      current expectations.
    Cost baseline. Described in Section 7.3.3.1. Contractor and materials prices can change frequently during the
   uu
      delivery of a project. These changes can occur because of fluctuating materials and labor prices created by the
      external economic environment and need to be incorporated into the cost baseline.




                                                                                                         Part 1 - Guide

12.2.3.5 PROJECT DOCUMENTS UPDATES

  Project documents that may be updated as a result of carrying out this process include but are not limited to:
    Lessons learned register. Described in Section 4.4.3.1. The lessons learned register is updated with information
   uu
      on challenges encountered while conducting procurements and how they could have been avoided as well as
      approaches that worked well.
    Requirements documentation. Described in Section 5.2.3.1. Requirements documentation may include:
   uu

      nuTechnical requirements that the seller is required to satisfy, and
      nuRequirements    with contractual and legal implications that may include health, safety, security, performance,
          environmental, insurance, intellectual property rights, equal employment opportunity, licenses, permits, and
          other nontechnical requirements.
    Requirements traceability matrix. Described in Section 5.2.3.2. As sellers are incorporated into the project's
   uu
      plan, the requirements register and the traceability matrix may change depending on the capabilities of the
      specific seller.
    Resource calendars. Described in Section 9.2.1.2. Schedule resource calendars may need to be updated
   uu
      depending on the availabilities of the sellers.
    Risk register. Described in Section 11.2.3.1. Each approved seller comes with its own unique set of risks,
   uu
      depending on the seller's organization, the duration of the contract, the external environment, the project delivery
      method, the type of contracting vehicle chosen, and the final agreed-upon price. Changes are made to the risk
      register during the contracting process, which reflect the specific risks of each seller.
    Stakeholder register. Described in Section 13.1.3.1. This document contains all the details about the identified
   uu
      stakeholders. The stakeholder register is updated as agreements are made with specific sellers.

                                                                                                                      491
12.3 CONTROL PROCUREMENTS
   Control Procurements is the process of managing procurement relationships; monitoring contract performance,
and making changes and corrections as appropriate; and closing out contracts. The key benefit of this process is
that it ensures that both the seller's and buyer's performance meet the project's requirements according to the
terms of the legal agreement. This process is performed throughout the project as needed. The inputs, tools and
techniques, and outputs of this process are depicted in Figure 12-6. Figure 12-7 depicts the data flow diagram
of the process.

   Both the buyer and the seller administer the procurement contract for similar purposes. Each is required to ensure
that both parties meet their contractual obligations and that their own legal rights are protected. The legal nature of
the relationship makes it imperative that the project management team is aware of the implications of actions taken
when controlling any procurement. On larger projects with multiple providers, a key aspect of contract administration is
managing communication among the various providers.
   Because of the legal aspect, many organizations treat contract administration as an organizational function that
is separate from the project. While a procurement administrator may be on the project team, this individual typically
reports to a supervisor from a different department.
   Control Procurements includes application of the appropriate project management processes to the contractual
relationship(s) and integration of the outputs from these processes into the overall management of the project. This
integration often occurs at multiple levels when there are multiple sellers and multiple products, services, or results involved.
   Administrative activities may include:
    Collection of data and managing project records, including maintenance of detailed records of physical and
   uu
       financial performance and establishment of measurable procurement performance indicators;
    Refinement of procurement plans and schedules;
   uu

    Set up for gathering, analyzing, and reporting procurement-related project data and preparation of periodic
   uu
       reports to the organization;
    Monitoring the procurement environment so that implementation can be facilitated or adjustments made; and
   uu

    Payment of invoices.
   uu

    The quality of the controls, including the independence and credibility of procurement audits, is critical to the reliability
of the procurement system. The organization's code of ethics, its legal counsel, and external legal advisory arrangements
including any ongoing anti-corruption initiatives can contribute to proper procurement controls.
   Control Procurements has a financial management component that involves monitoring payments to the seller. This
ensures that payment terms defined within the contract are met and that compensation is linked to the seller's progress
as defined in the contract. A principal concern when making payments is to ensure there is a close relationship of
payments made to the work accomplished. A contract that requires payments linked to project output and deliverables
rather than inputs such as labor hours has better controls.
  Agreements can be amended at any time prior to contract closure by mutual consent, in accordance with the change
control terms of the agreement. Such amendments are typically captured in writing.

   uu


12.3.1.8 ORGANIZATIONAL PROCESS ASSETS

   The organizational process assets that can influence the Control Procurements process include but are not limited
to, procurement policies.



12.3.2 CONTROL PROCUREMENTS: TOOLS AND TECHNIQUES

12.3.2.1 EXPERT JUDGMENT

   Described in Section 4.1.2.1 Expertise should be considered from individuals or groups with specialized knowledge
or training in the following topics:
    Relevant functional areas such as finance, engineering, design, development, supply chain management, etc.;
   uu

    Laws, regulations, and compliance requirements; and
   uu

    Claims administration.
   uu




                                                                                                                  497
12.3.2.2 CLAIMS ADMINISTRATION

   Contested changes and potential constructive changes are those requested changes where the buyer and seller
cannot reach an agreement on compensation for the change or cannot agree that a change has occurred. These
contested changes are called claims. When they cannot be resolved, they become disputes and finally appeals. Claims
are documented, processed, monitored, and managed throughout the contract life cycle, usually in accordance with the
terms of the contract. If the parties themselves do not resolve a claim, it may have to be handled in accordance with
alternative dispute resolution (ADR) typically following procedures established in the contract. Settlement of all claims
and disputes through negotiation is the preferred method.

12.3.2.3 DATA ANALYSIS

  Data analysis techniques that can be used to monitor and control procurements include but are not limited to:
    Performance Reviews. Performance reviews for contracts measure, compare, and analyze quality, resource,
   uu
       schedule, and cost performance against the agreement. This includes identifying work packages that are ahead
       or behind schedule, over or under budget, or have resource or quality issues.
    Earned Value Analysis (EVA). Described in Section 7.4.2.2. Schedule and cost variances along with schedule
   uu
       and cost performance indexes are calculated to determine the degree of variance from target.
    Trend Analysis. Described in Section 4.5.2.2. Trend analysis can develop a forecast estimate at completion
   uu
       (EAC) for cost performance to see if performance is improving or deteriorating. See 7.4.2.2 for more detail on
       EAC methods.

12.3.2.4 INSPECTION

   An inspection is a structured review of the work being performed by the contractor. This may involve a simple review
of the deliverables or an actual physical review of the work itself. On a construction/engineering/infrastructure project,
inspections involve walkthroughs of the site by both the buyer and the contractor to ensure a mutual understanding of
the work in progress.

12.3.2.5 AUDITS

   Audits are described in Section 8.2.2.5. Audits are a structured review of the procurement process. Rights and
obligations related to audits should be described in the procurement contract. Resulting audit observations should be
brought to the attention of the buyer's project manager and the seller's project manager for adjustments to the project,
when necessary.




                                                                                                           Part 1 - Guide
498
   12.3.3 CONTROL PROCUREMENTS: OUTPUTS

   12.3.3.1 CLOSED PROCUREMENTS

      The buyer, usually through its authorized procurement administrator, provides the seller with formal written notice
   that the contract has been completed. Requirements for formal procurement closure are usually defined in the terms
   and conditions of the contract and are included in the procurement management plan. Typically, all deliverables should
   have been provided on time and meet technical and quality requirements, there should be no outstanding claims or
   invoices, and all final payments should have been made. The project management team should have approved all
   deliverables prior to closure.

   12.3.3.2 WORK PERFORMANCE INFORMATION

      Described in Section 4.5.1.3. Work performance information includes information on how a seller is performing by
   comparing the deliverables received, the technical performance achieved, and the costs incurred and accepted against
   the SOW budget for the work performed.

   12.3.3.3 PROCUREMENT DOCUMENTATION UPDATES

      Procurement documentation that may be updated includes the contract with all supporting schedules, requested
   unapproved contract changes, and approved change requests. Procurement documentation also includes any
   seller-developed technical documentation and other work performance information such as deliverables, seller
   performance reports and warranties, financial documents including invoices and payment records, and the results of
   contract-related inspections.

   12.3.3.4 CHANGE REQUESTS

     Described in Section 4.3.3.4. Change requests to the project management plan, its subsidiary plans, and other
   components such as the cost baseline, schedule baseline, and procurement management plan, may result from the
   Control Procurements process. Change requests are processed for review and disposition through the Perform Integrated
   Change Control process (Section 4.6).





      Requested but unresolved changes can include direction provided by the buyer or actions taken by the seller, which
   the other party considers a constructive change to the contract. Since any of these constructive changes may be disputed





   by one party and can lead to a claim against the other party, such changes are uniquely identified and documented by
   project correspondence.




                                                                                                                       499
12.3.3.5 PROJECT MANAGEMENT PLAN UPDATES

   Any change to the project management plan goes through the organization's change control process via a change
request. Components that may require a change request for the project management plan include but are not limited to:
    Risk management plan. Described in Section 11.1.3.1. Each agreement and seller has its own set of risks
   uu
      that may require updates to the risk management plan. If significant unexpected risks occur during the
      execution of the contract, the risk management plan may require updating. Specific risks are incorporated
      into the risk register.
    Procurement management plan. Described in Section 12.1.3.1. The procurement management plan contains
   uu
      the activities to be undertaken during the procurement process. Updates may be required depending on the
      results of the performance of the sellers during execution of the work.
    Schedule baseline. Described in Section 6.5.3.1. If there are significant schedule changes created by sellers
   uu
      that impact overall project schedule performance, the baseline schedule may need to be updated and approved
      to reflect the current expectations. The buyer should be aware of any cascading impacts of schedule delays
      created by a seller that impact other sellers.
    Cost baseline. Described in Section 7.3.3.1. Contractor and material costs can change frequently during the
   uu
      delivery of a project. These changes can occur because of fluctuating materials and labor prices created by the
      external economic environment and need to be incorporated into the cost baseline.

12.3.3.6 PROJECT DOCUMENTS UPDATES

  Project documents that may be updated as a result of carrying out this process include but are not limited to:
    Lessons learned register. Described in Section 4.4.3.1. The lessons learned register can be updated with
   uu
      techniques that were effective in maintaining the scope, schedule, and cost of the procured items. Where
      variances occurred, the register should show the corrective actions that were used to respond to variances
      and how effective those actions were. If there are any claims, information should be documented to avoid
      recurrences. Additional information on how to improve the procurement process can also be recorded.
    Resource requirements. Described in Section 9.2.3.1. As the work progresses by the contractors, there may be
   uu
      changes to the resource requirements resulting from work being done that is not in accordance with the planned
      work schedule.




                                                                                                        Part 1 - Guide
500
       Requirements traceability matrix. Described in Section 5.2.3.2. The requirements traceability matrix is updated
      uu
         with information on requirements that have been satisfied.
       Risk register. Described in Section 11.2.3.1. Each approved seller comes with its own unique set of risks,
      uu
         depending on the seller's organization, the duration of the contract, the external environment, the project delivery
         method, the type of contracting vehicle chosen, and the final agreed-upon price. Changes are made to the risk
         register during the execution of the project, as early risks may no longer be applicable and new risks occur.
       Stakeholder register. Described in Section 13.1.3.1. As the work progresses through the execution phase,
      uu
         the contractors and suppliers may change. These changes should be reflected in the stakeholder register.

   12.3.3.7 ORGANIZATIONAL PROCESS ASSETS UPDATES

     Organizational process assets that can be updated as a result of the Control Procurements process include but are
   not limited to:
       Payment schedules and requests. All payments should be made in accordance with the procurement contract
      uu
         terms and conditions.
       Seller performance evaluation documentation. Seller performance evaluation documentation is prepared by
      uu
         the buyer and documents the seller's ability to continue to perform work on the current contract, indicates
         whether the seller can be allowed to perform work on future projects, or rates how well the seller is performing
         the project work or has performed in the past.
       Prequalified seller lists updates. Prequalified seller lists are lists of potential sellers who are previously qualified
      uu
         (approved). These lists will be updated according to the Procurement Control process outcomes because sellers
         could be disqualified and removed from the lists based on poor performance.
       Lessons learned repository. Lessons learned should be archived in the lessons learned repository to improve
      uu
         procurements on future projects. At the end of a contract, the actual results of the procurement are compared
         with the projected results in the original procurement management plan. These lessons learned state whether
         the project objectives were achieved and, if not, provides the reasons they were not.
       Procurement file. A complete set of indexed contract documentation, including the closed contract, is prepared
      uu
         for inclusion with the final project files.






                                                                                                                          501

      Project Stakeholder Management includes the processes required to identify the people, groups, or organizations that
   could impact or be impacted by the project, to analyze stakeholder expectations and their impact on the project, and to
   develop appropriate management strategies for effectively engaging stakeholders in project decisions and execution.
   The processes support the work of the project team to analyze stakeholder expectations, assess the degree to which
   they impact or are impacted by the project, and develop strategies to effectively engage stakeholders in support of
   project decisions and the planning and execution of the work of the project.
     The Project Stakeholder Management processes are:
     13.1 Identify Stakeholders--The process of identifying project stakeholders regularly and analyzing and
   documenting relevant information regarding their interests, involvement, interdependencies, influence, and potential
   impact on project success.
      13.2 Plan Stakeholder Engagement--The process of developing approaches to involve project stakeholders based
   on their needs, expectation, interests, and potential impact on the project.
      13.3 Manage Stakeholder Engagement--The process of communicating and working with stakeholders to meet
   their needs and expectations, address issues, and foster appropriate stakeholder engagement involvement.
      13.4 Monitor Stakeholder Engagement--The process of monitoring project stakeholder relationships and tailoring
   strategies for engaging stakeholders through the modification of engagement strategies and plans.
      Figure 13-1 provides an overview of the Project Stakeholder Management processes. The Project Stakeholder
   Management processes are presented as discrete processes with defined interfaces while, in practice, they overlap and
   interact in ways that cannot be completely detailed in the PMBOK(R) Guide.

KEY CONCEPTS FOR PROJECT STAKEHOLDER MANAGEMENT

   Every project has stakeholders who are impacted by or can impact the project in a positive or negative way. Some
stakeholders may have a limited ability to influence the project's work or outcomes; others may have significant influence
on the project and its expected outcomes. Academic research and analyses of high-profile project disasters highlight
the importance of a structured approach to the identification, prioritization, and engagement of all stakeholders. The
ability of the project manager and team to correctly identify and engage all stakeholders in an appropriate way can mean
the difference between project success and failure. To increase the chances of success, the process of stakeholder
identification and engagement should commence as soon as possible after the project charter has been approved, the
project manager has been assigned and the team begins to form.




                                                                                                                            Part 1 - Guide

     Stakeholder satisfaction should be identified and managed as a project objective. The key to effective stakeholder
   engagement is a focus on continuous communication with all stakeholders, including team members, to understand their
   needs and expectations, address issues as they occur, manage conflicting interests, and foster appropriate stakeholder
   engagement in project decisions and activities.
      The process of identifying and engaging stakeholders for the benefit of the project is iterative. Although the processes
   in Project Stakeholder Management are described only once, the activities of identification, prioritization, and engagement
   should be reviewed and updated routinely, and at least at the following times when:
       The project moves through different phases in its life cycle,
      uu

       Current stakeholders are no longer involved in the work of the project or new stakeholders become members of
      uu
          the project's stakeholder community, or
       There are significant changes in the organization or the wider stakeholder community.
      uu


   TRENDS AND EMERGING PRACTICES IN PROJECT STAKEHOLDER ENGAGEMENT

     Broader definitions of stakeholders are being developed that expand the traditional categories of employees, suppliers,
   and shareholders to include groups such as regulators, lobby groups, environmentalists, financial organizations, the
   media, and those who simply believe they are stakeholders--they perceive that they will be affected by the work or
   outcomes of the project.
     Trends and emerging practices for Project Stakeholder Management include but are not limited to:
       Identifying all stakeholders, not just a limited set;
      uu

       Ensuring that all team members are involved in stakeholder engagement activities;
      uu

       Reviewing the stakeholder community regularly, often in parallel with reviews of individual project risks;
      uu

       Consulting with stakeholders who are most affected by the work or outcomes of the project through the
      uu
          concept of co-creation. Co-creation places greater emphasis on including affected stakeholders in the team
          as partners; and
       Capturing the value of effective stakeholder engagement, both positive and negative. Positive value can be based
      uu
          on the consideration of benefits derived from higher levels of active support from stakeholders, particularly





          powerful stakeholders. Negative value can be derived by measuring the true costs of not engaging stakeholders
          effectively, leading to product recalls or loss of organizational or project reputation.





                                                                                                                          505
TAILORING CONSIDERATIONS

   Because each project is unique, the project manager may need to tailor the way Project Stakeholder Management
processes are applied. Considerations for tailoring include but are not limited to:
    Stakeholder diversity. How many stakeholders are there? How diverse is the culture within the
   uu
       stakeholder community?
    Complexity of stakeholder relationships. How complex are the relationships within the stakeholder community?
   uu
       The more networks a stakeholder or stakeholder group participates in, the more complex the networks of
       information and misinformation the stakeholder may receive.
    Communication technology. What communication technology is available? What support mechanisms are in
   uu
       place to ensure that best value is achieved from the technology?

CONSIDERATIONS FOR AGILE/ADAPTIVE ENVIRONMENTS

   Projects experiencing a high degree of change require active engagement and participation with project stakeholders.
To facilitate timely, productive discussion and decision making, adaptive teams engage with stakeholders directly rather
than going through layers of management. Often the client, user, and developer exchange information in a dynamic
co-creative process that leads to more stakeholder involvement and higher satisfaction. Regular interactions with the
stakeholder community throughout the project mitigate risk, build trust, and support adjustments earlier in the project
cycle, thus reducing costs and increasing the likelihood of success for the project.
   In order to accelerate the sharing of information within and across the organization, agile methods promote aggressive
transparency. The intent of inviting any stakeholders to project meetings and reviews or posting project artifacts in public
spaces is to surface as quickly as possible any misalignment, dependency, or other issue related to the changing project.




                                                                                                             Part 1 - Guide

   13.1 IDENTIFY STAKEHOLDERS
      Identify Stakeholders is the process of identifying project stakeholders regularly and analyzing and documenting
   relevant information regarding their interests, involvement, interdependencies, influence, and potential impact on
   project success. The key benefit of this process is that it enables the project team to identify the appropriate focus for
   engagement of each stakeholder or group of stakeholders. This process is performed periodically throughout the project
   as needed. The inputs, tools and techniques, and outputs of the process are depicted in Figure 13-2. Figure 13-3 depicts
   the data flow diagram for the process.

   This process frequently occurs for the first time in a project either prior to or at the same time the project charter is
developed and approved. It is repeated as necessary, but should be performed at the start of each phase and when a
significant change in the project or the organization occurs. Each time the identification process is repeated, the project
management plan components and project documents should be consulted to identify relevant project stakeholders.

   13.1.1 IDENTIFY STAKEHOLDERS: INPUTS

   13.1.1.1 PROJECT CHARTER

     Described in Section 4.1.3.1. The project charter identifies the key stakeholder list. It may also contain information
   about the responsibilities of the stakeholders.

   13.1.1.2 BUSINESS DOCUMENTS

     In the first iteration of the Identify Stakeholders process, the business case and the benefits management plan are
   sources of information about the project's stakeholders.
       Business case. Described in Section 1.2.6.1. The business case identifies the project objectives and identifies
      uu
          an initial list of stakeholders affected by the project.
       Benefits management plan. Described in Section 1.2.6.2. The benefits management plan describes the
      uu
          expected plan for realizing the benefits claimed in the business case. It may identify the individuals and groups
          that will benefit from the delivery of the outcomes of the project and are thus considered as stakeholders.

   13.1.1.3 PROJECT MANAGEMENT PLAN

     Described in Section 4.2.3.1. The project management plan is not available when initially identifying stakeholders;
   however, once it has been developed, project management plan components include but are not limited to:
       Communications management plan. Described in Section 10.1.3.1. Communications and stakeholder
      uu
          engagement are strongly linked. Information included in the communications management plan is a source of
          knowledge about the project's stakeholders.
       Stakeholder engagement plan. Described in Section 13.2.3.1. The stakeholder engagement plan identifies the
      uu
          management strategies and actions required to effectively engage stakeholders.






                                                                                                                       509
13.1.1.4 PROJECT DOCUMENTS

   It is unlikely that any project documents will be an input for the initial stakeholder identification. However, stakeholder
identification occurs throughout the project. Once the project is past the startup phase, more documents become
available and are used throughout the project. Project documents that can be considered as inputs for this process
include but are not limited to:
    Change log. Described in Section 4.6.3.3. The change log may introduce a new stakeholder or change the nature
   uu
       of an existing stakeholder's relationship to the project.

      uu

       Knowledge of individual team member contributions and expertise.
      uu


   13.1.2.2 DATA GATHERING

     Data-gathering techniques that can be used for this process include but are not limited to:
       Questionnaires and surveys. Described in Section 5.2.2.2. Questionnaires and surveys can include one-on-one
      uu
         reviews, focus group sessions, or other mass information collection techniques.
       Brainstorming. Described in Section 4.1.2.2. Brainstorming as used to identify stakeholders can include both
      uu
         brainstorming and brain writing.
         nuBrainstorming. A general data-gathering and creativity technique that elicits input from groups such as team
             members or subject matter experts.
         nuBrain writing. A refinement of brainstorming that allows individual participants time to consider the question(s)
             individually before the group creativity session is held. The information can be gathered in face-to-face
             groups or using virtual environments supported by technology.






                                                                                                                        511
13.1.2.3 DATA ANALYSIS

  Data analysis techniques that can be used for this process include but are not limited to:
    Stakeholder analysis. Stakeholder analysis results in a list of stakeholders and relevant information such as
   uu
       their positions in the organization, roles on the project, "stakes," expectations, attitudes (their levels of support
       for the project), and their interest in information about the project. Stakeholders' stakes can include but are not
       limited to a combination of:
       nuInterest. A person or group can be affected by a decision related to the project or its outcomes.
       nuRights   (legal or moral rights). Legal rights, such as occupational health and safety, may be defined in the
          legislation framework of a country. Moral rights may involve concepts of protection of historical sites or
          environmental sustainability.
       nuOwnership. A person or group has a legal title to an asset or a property.
       nuKnowledge.    Specialist knowledge, which can benefit the project through more effective delivery of project
          objectives, organizational outcomes, or knowledge of the power structures of the organization.
       nuContribution. Provision of funds or other resources, including human resources, or providing support for the
          project in more intangible ways, such as advocacy in the form of promoting the objectives of the project or
          acting as a buffer between the project and the power structures of the organization and its politics.
    Document analysis. Described in Section 5.2.2.3. Assessing the available project documentation and lessons
   uu
       learned from previous projects to identify stakeholders and other supporting information.

13.1.2.4 DATA REPRESENTATION

   A data representation technique that may be used in this process includes but is not limited to stakeholder mapping/
representation. Stakeholder mapping and representation is a method of categorizing stakeholders using various
methods. Categorizing stakeholders assists the team in building relationships with the identified project stakeholders.
Common methods include:
    Power/interest grid, power/influence grid, or impact/influence grid. Each of these techniques supports
   uu
       a grouping of stakeholders according to their level of authority (power), level of concern about the project's
       outcomes (interest), ability to influence the outcomes of the project (influence), or ability to cause changes to
       the project's planning or execution. These classification models are useful for small projects or for projects with
       simple relationships between stakeholders and the project, or within the stakeholder community itself.




                                                                                                             Part 1 - Guide
512
 Stakeholder cube. This is a refinement of the grid models previously mentioned. This model combines the
uu
   grid elements into a three-dimensional model that can be useful to project managers and teams in identifying
   and engaging their stakeholder community. It provides a model with multiple dimensions that improves the
   depiction of the stakeholder community as a multidimensional entity and assists with the development of
   communication strategies.
 Salience model. Describes classes of stakeholders based on assessments of their power (level of authority or
uu
   ability to influence the outcomes of the project), urgency (need for immediate attention, either time-constrained
   or relating to the stakeholders' high stake in the outcome), and legitimacy (their involvement is appropriate).
   There is an adaptation of the salience model that substitutes proximity for legitimacy (applying to the team and
   measuring their level of involvement with the work of the project). The salience model is useful for large complex
   communities of stakeholders or where there are complex networks of relationships within the community. It is
   also useful in determining the relative importance of the identified stakeholders.
 Directions of influence. Classifies stakeholders according to their influence on the work of the project or the
uu
   project team itself. Stakeholders can be classified in the following ways:
   nuUpward (senior management of the performing organization or customer organization, sponsor, and steering
      committee),
   nuDownward (the team or specialists contributing knowledge or skills in a temporary capacity),
   nuOutward  (stakeholder groups and their representatives outside the project team, such as suppliers,
      government departments, the public, end-users, and regulators), or
   nuSideward (the peers of the project manager, such as other project managers or middle managers who are in
      competition for scarce project resources or who collaborate with the project manager in sharing resources
      or information).
 Prioritization. Prioritizing stakeholders may be necessary for projects with a large number of stakeholders,
uu
   where the membership of the stakeholder community is changing frequently, or when the relationships between
   stakeholders and the project team or within the stakeholder community are complex.




                                                                                                                 513
13.1.2.5 MEETINGS

   Meetings are used to develop an understanding of significant project stakeholders. They can take the form of facilitation
workshops, small group guided discussions, and virtual groups using electronics or social media technologies to share
ideas and analyze data.



13.1.3 IDENTIFY STAKEHOLDERS: OUTPUTS

13.1.3.1 STAKEHOLDER REGISTER

  The main output of the Identify Stakeholders process is the stakeholder register. This document contains information
about identified stakeholders that includes but is not limited to:
    Identification information. Name, organizational position, location and contact details, and role on the project.
   uu

    Assessment information. Major requirements, expectations, potential for influencing project outcomes, and the
   uu
       phase of the project life cycle where the stakeholder has the most influence or impact.
    Stakeholder classification. Internal/external, impact/influence/power/interest, upward/downward/outward/
   uu
       sideward, or any other classification model chosen by the project manager.

13.1.3.2 CHANGE REQUESTS

   Described in Section 4.3.3.4. During the first iteration of identifying stakeholders, there will not be any change
requests. As stakeholder identification continues throughout the project, new stakeholders, or new information about
stakeholders, may result in a change request to the product, project management plan, or project documents.
   Change requests are processed for review and disposition through the Perform Integrated Change Control
(Section 4.6) process.




                                                                                                             Part 1 - Guide
514
   13.1.3.3 PROJECT MANAGEMENT PLAN UPDATES

      When stakeholders are identified at the very beginning of a project, there will not be updates to the project management
   plan. As the project progresses, any change to the project management plan goes through the organization's change
   control process via a change request. Components that may require a change request for the project management plan
   include but are not limited to:
       Requirements management plan. Described in Section 5.1.1.2. Newly identified stakeholders can impact how
      uu
          requirements activities will be planned, tracked, and reported.
       Communications management plan. Described in Section 10.1.3.1. Stakeholder communication requirements
      uu
          and agreed-upon communications strategies are recorded in the communications management plan.
       Risk management plan. Described in Section 11.1.3.1. Where stakeholder communication requirements and
      uu
          agreed-upon communications strategies affect the approach to managing risk on the project, this is reflected in
          the risk management plan.
       Stakeholder engagement plan. Described in Section 13.2.3.1. Agreed-upon communications strategies for
      uu
          identified stakeholders are recorded in the stakeholder engagement plan.

   13.1.3.4 PROJECT DOCUMENTS UPDATES

     Project documents that may be updated as a result of carrying out this process include but are not limited to:
       Assumption log. Described in Section 4.1.3.2. Much of the information about the relative power, interest, and
      uu
          engagement of stakeholders is based on assumptions. This information is entered into the assumption log.
          Additionally, any constraints associated with interacting with specific stakeholders are entered as well.
       Issue log. Described in Section 4.3.3.3. New issues raised as a result of this process are recorded in the
      uu
          issue log.
       Risk register. Described in Section 11.2.3.1. New risks identified during this process are recorded in the risk
      uu
          register and managed using the risk management processes.






                                                                                                                          515
13.2 PLAN STAKEHOLDER ENGAGEMENT
   Plan Stakeholder Engagement is the process of developing approaches to involve project stakeholders based on their
needs, expectations, interests, and potential impact on the project. The key benefit is that it provides an actionable plan
to interact effectively with stakeholders. This process is performed periodically throughout the project as needed.
   The inputs, tools and techniques, and outputs of the process are depicted in Figure 13-4. Figure 13-5 depicts the data
flow diagram for the process.

   An effective plan that recognizes the diverse information needs of the project's stakeholders is developed early in the
project life cycle and is reviewed and updated regularly as the stakeholder community changes. The first version of the
stakeholder engagement plan is developed after the initial stakeholder community has been identified by the Identify
Stakeholder process. The stakeholder engagement plan is updated regularly to reflect changes to the stakeholder
community. Typical trigger situations requiring updates to the plan include but are not limited to:
    When it is the start of a new phase of the project;
   uu

    When there are changes to the organization structure or within the industry;
   uu

    When new individuals or groups become stakeholders, current stakeholders are no longer part of the stakeholder
   uu
       community, or the importance of particular stakeholders to the project's success changes; and
    When outputs of other project process areas, such as change management, risk management, or issue
   uu
       management, require a review of stakeholder engagement strategies.
  The results of these adjustments may be changes to the relative importance of the stakeholders who have
been identified.

         the level of support of project stakeholders in order to select the appropriate strategy to improve their level
         of engagement.

   13.2.2.4 DECISION MAKING

      Decision-making techniques that can be used for this process include but are not limited to prioritization/ranking.
   Stakeholder requirements need to be prioritized and ranked, as do the stakeholders themselves. Stakeholders with the
   most interest and the highest influence are often prioritized at the top of the list.

   13.2.2.5 DATA REPRESENTATION

     Data representation techniques that may be used in this process include but are not limited to:
       Mind mapping. Described in Section 5.2.2.3. Mind mapping is used to visually organize information about
      uu
         stakeholders and their relationship to each other and the organization.
       Stakeholder engagement assessment matrix. A stakeholder engagement assessment matrix supports
      uu
         comparison between the current engagement levels of stakeholders and the desired engagement levels required
         for successful project delivery. One way to classify the engagement level of stakeholders is shown in Figure 13-6.
         The engagement level of stakeholders can be classified as follows:
         nuUnaware. Unaware of the project and potential impacts.
         nuResistant. Aware of the project and potential impacts but resistant to any changes that may occur as a result
             of the work or outcomes of the project. These stakeholders will be unsupportive of the work or outcomes of
             the project.
         nuNeutral. Aware of the project, but neither supportive nor unsupportive.





         nuSupportive. Aware of the project and potential impacts and supportive of the work and its outcomes.
         nuLeading.   Aware of the project and potential impacts and actively engaged in ensuring that the project





             is a success.




                                                                                                                       521
   In Figure 13-6, C represents the current engagement level of each stakeholder and D indicates the level that the
project team has assessed as essential to ensure project success (desired). The gap between current and desired for
each stakeholder will direct the level of communications necessary to effectively engage the stakeholder. The closing of
this gap between current and desired is an essential element of monitoring stakeholder engagement.


                Stakeholder       Unaware        Resistant       Neutral       Supportive     Leading
                Stakeholder 1         C                                             D
                Stakeholder 2                                        C              D
                Stakeholder 3                                                      DC

    IN TRODU CTION
      A standard is a document established by an authority, custom, or general consent as a model or example. This
   standard was developed using a process based on the concepts of consensus, openness, due process, and balance. This
   standard describes the processes considered to be good practice on most projects most of the time. These processes
   are organized by Process Group. It further defines key project management concepts including the relationship of project
   management to organizational strategy and objectives, governance, portfolio management, program management, the
   project environment, and project success. It also covers information on project life cycles, project stakeholders, and
   the role of the project manager. Section 1 discusses key concepts and provides contextual information about project
   management. Sections 2 through 6 provide definitions for each of the five Process Groups and describe the processes
   within those Process Groups. Sections 2 through 6 also describe the key benefits, inputs, and outputs for each project
   management process. This standard serves as the foundation and framework for A Guide to the Project Management
   Body of Knowledge (PMBOK(R) Guide).1 PMBOK(R) Guide expands on the information in this standard by providing a more
   in-depth description of the context, environment and influences on project management. In addition, the PMBOK(R) Guide
   provides descriptions of the project management process inputs and outputs, identifies tools and techniques, and
   discusses key concepts and emerging trends associated with each Knowledge Area.

1.1 PROJECTS AND PROJECT MANAGEMENT
   A project is a temporary endeavor undertaken to create a unique product, service, or result. The temporary nature of
projects indicates a definite beginning and end. Temporary does not necessarily mean a project has a short duration.
A project's end is reached when the objectives have been achieved or when the project is terminated because its
objectives will not or cannot be met, or when the need for the project no longer exists. The decision to terminate a project
requires approval and authorization by an appropriate authority.
   Project management is the application of knowledge, skills, tools, and techniques to project activities to meet project
requirements. Project management is accomplished through the appropriate application and integration of the project
management processes identified for the project.
  Managing a project typically includes but is not limited to:
    Identifying project requirements;
   uu

    Addressing the various needs, concerns, and expectations of stakeholders;
   uu

    Establishing and maintaining active communication with stakeholders;
   uu

    Managing resources; and
   uu

    Balancing the competing project constraints, which include but are not limited to:
   uu

       nuScope,
       nuSchedule,
       nuCost,
       nuQuality,
       nuResources, and
       nuRisk.

  Project circumstances will influence how each project management process is implemented and how the project
constraints are prioritized.




                                                                                                         Part 2 - Standard

   1.2 RELATIONSHIPS AMONG PORTFOLIOS, PROGRAMS, AND PROJECTS
      A portfolio is defined as projects, programs, subsidiary portfolios, and operations managed in a coordinated manner
   to achieve strategic objectives. Portfolio management is the centralized management of one or more portfolios to
   achieve strategic objectives. Portfolio management focuses on ensuring the portfolio is performing consistent with the
   organization's objectives and evaluating portfolio components to optimize resource allocation. Portfolios may include
   work that is operational in nature.
      A program is defined as related projects, subsidiary programs, and program activities managed in a coordinated
   manner to obtain benefits not available from managing them individually. Programs include program related work
   outside the scope of the discrete projects in the program. Program management is the application of knowledge,
   skills, and principles to a program to achieve the program objectives and to obtain benefits and control not available
   by managing related program components individually. Programs may also include work that is operational in nature.
     Program management supports organizational strategies by authorizing, changing, or terminating projects and
   managing their interdependencies. Managing project interdependencies may include, among other actions, the following:
       Resolving resource constraints and/or conflicts that affect components within the program;
      uu

       Aligning with the organization's strategies that impact and affect program goals and objectives
      uu

       Managing issues and employing change management within a shared governance structure;
      uu

       Addressing project and program risks that can impact one or more components; and
      uu

       Managing program benefits realization by effectively analyzing, sequencing and monitoring component
      uu
         interdependencies.
      A project may be managed in three separate scenarios: as a stand-alone project (outside a portfolio or program);
   within a program; or within a portfolio. Project management has interactions with portfolio and program management
   when a project is within a portfolio or program.






                                                                                                                     543
   Figure 1-1 illustrates a sample portfolio structure indicating relationships of the components, shared resources
and stakeholders. The portfolio components are grouped together in order to facilitate the effective governance and
management of that work and to achieve organizational strategies and priorities. Organizational and portfolio planning
impact the components by means of prioritization based on risk, funding, and other considerations. This allows
organizations to have an overall view of how the strategic goals are reflected in the portfolio; institute appropriate
portfolio, program, and project governance; and authorize human, financial, or physical resources. These resources
will be allocated based on expected performance and benefits. Figure 1-1 illustrates that organizational strategies
and priorities are linked and have relationships between portfolios and programs, between portfolios and projects, and
between programs and individual projects. These relationships are not always strictly hierarchical.
   Organizational project management (OPM) is a strategy execution framework utilizing portfolio, program, and project
management. It provides a framework that enables organizations to consistently and predictably deliver on organizational
strategy, producing better performance, better results, and a sustainable competitive advantage.

   1.3 LINKING ORGANIZATIONAL GOVERNANCE AND PROJECT GOVERNANCE
      There are various types of governance including organizational governance; organizational project management
   (OPM) governance; and portfolio, program, and project governance. Organizational governance is a structured way to
   provide direction and control through policies, and processes, to meet strategic and operational goals. Organizational
   governance is typically conducted by a board of directors to ensure accountability, fairness, and transparency to its
   stakeholders. Organizational governance principles, decisions, and processes may influence and impact the governance
   of portfolios, programs, and projects in the following ways:
       Enforcing legal, regulatory, standards, and compliance requirements,
      uu

       Defining ethical, social, and environmental responsibilities, and
      uu

       Specifying operational, legal, and risk policies.
      uu

      Project governance is the framework, functions, and processes that guide project management activities in order to
   create a unique product, service, or result to meet organizational, strategic, and operational goals. Governance at the
   project level includes:
       Guiding and overseeing the management of project work;
      uu

       Ensuring adherence to policies, standards, and guidelines;
      uu

       Establishing governance roles, responsibilities, and authorities;
      uu

       Decision-making regarding risk escalations, changes, and resources (e.g. team, financial, physical, facilities);
      uu

       Ensuring appropriate stakeholder engagement; and
      uu

       Monitoring performance.
      uu

      The project governance framework provides the project stakeholders with structure, processes, roles, responsibilities,
   accountabilities, and decision-making models for managing the project. Elements of a project governance framework
   include but are not limited to principles or processes for:
       Stage gate or phase reviews;
      uu

       Identifying, escalating, and resolving risks and issues;
      uu

       Defining roles, responsibilities, and authorities;
      uu





       Process for project knowledge management and capturing lessons learned;
      uu





       Decision making, problem solving and escalating topics that are beyond the project manager's authority; and
      uu

       Reviewing and approving changes to project, and product changes that are beyond the authority of the
      uu
          project manager.




                                                                                                                        545
1.4 PROJECT SUCCESS AND BENEFITS MANAGEMENT
   Projects are initiated to realize business opportunities that are aligned with an organization's strategic goals. Prior
to initiating a project, a business case is often developed to outline the project objectives, the required investment, and
financial and qualitative criteria for project success. The business case provides the basis to measure success and
progress throughout the project life cycle by comparing the results with the objectives and the identified success criteria.
  Projects are typically initiated as a result of one or more of the following strategic considerations:
    Market demand,
   uu

    Strategic opportunity/business need,
   uu

    Social need,
   uu

    Environmental consideration,
   uu

    Customer request,
   uu

    Technological advancement,
   uu

    Legal or regulatory requirement, and
   uu

    Existing or forecasted problem.
   uu

   A benefits management plan describes how and when the benefits of the project will be delivered and how they will
be measured. The benefits management plan may include the following:
    Target benefits. The expected tangible and intangible business value to be gained by the implementation of the
   uu
       product, service, or result.
    Strategic alignment. How the project benefits support and align with the business strategies of the organization.
   uu

    Timeframe for realizing benefits. Benefits by phase: short term, long term, and ongoing.
   uu

    Benefits owner. The accountable person or group that monitors, records, and reports realized benefits throughout
   uu
       the timeframe established in the plan.
    Metrics. The direct and indirect measurements used to show the benefits realized.
   uu

    Risks. Risks associated with achieving target benefits.
   uu




                                                                                                           Part 2 - Standard
546
   The success of the project is measured against the project objectives and success criteria. In many cases, the success
of the product, service, or result is not known until sometime after the project is complete. For example, an increase in
market share, a decrease in operating expenses, or the success of a new product may not be known when the project is
transitioned to operations. In these circumstances, the project management office (PMO), portfolio steering committee,
or some other business function within the organization should evaluate the success at a later date to determine if the
outcomes met the business objectives.
   Both the business case and the benefits management plan are developed prior to the project being initiated.
Additionally, both documents are referenced after the project has been completed. Therefore, they are considered
business documents rather than project documents or components of the project management plan. As appropriate,
these business documents may be inputs to some of the processes involved in managing the project, such as developing
the project charter.



1.5 THE PROJECT LIFE CYCLE
   A project life cycle is the series of phases that a project passes through from its start to its completion. A project
phase is a collection of logically related project activities that culminates in the completion of one or more deliverables.
The phases can be sequential, iterative, or overlapping. The names, number, and duration of the project phases are
determined by the management and control needs of the organization(s) involved in the project, the nature of the project
itself, and its area of application. Phases are time bound, with a start and end or control point (sometimes referred to
as a phase review, phase gate, control gate, or other similar term). At the control point, the project charter and business
documents are reexamined based on the current environment. At that time, the project's performance is compared to
the project management plan to determine if the project should be changed, terminated, or continue as planned.




                                                                                                                       547
   The project life cycle can be influenced by the unique aspects of the organization, industry, development method, or
technology employed. While every project has a start and end, the specific deliverables and work that take place vary
widely depending on the project. The life cycle provides the basic framework for managing the project, regardless of the
specific work involved.
    Though projects vary in size and the amount of complexity they contain, a typical project can be mapped to the
following project life cycle structure (see Figure 1-2):
    Starting the project,
   uu

    Organizing and preparing,
   uu

    Carrying out the work, and
   uu

    Closing the project.
   uu



                                                    Project Life Cycle



                        Starting     Organizing                     Carrying Out             Ending the
                      the Project   and Preparing                    the Work                 Project




                                                     Generic Phases


                                     Figure 1-2. Generic Depiction of a Project Life Cycle




                                                                                                          Part 2 - Standard
548
   A generic life cycle structure typically displays the following characteristics:
    Cost and staffing levels are low at the start, increase as the work is carried out, and drop rapidly as the project
   uu
       draws to a close.
    Risk is greatest at the start of the project as illustrated by Figure 1-3. These factors decrease over the life cycle
   uu
       of the project as decisions are reached and as deliverables are accepted.
    The ability of stakeholders to influence the final characteristics of the project's product, without significantly
   uu
       impacting cost and schedule, is highest at the start of the project and decreases as the project progresses
       toward completion. Figure 1-3 illustrates the cost of making changes and correcting errors typically increases
       substantially as the project approaches completion.

1.6 PROJECT STAKEHOLDERS
   A stakeholder is an individual, group, or organization that may affect, be affected by, or perceive itself to be affected
by a decision, activity, or outcome of a project. Project stakeholders may be internal or external to the project, they may
be actively involved, passively involved, or unaware of the project. Project stakeholders may have a positive or negative
impact on the project, or be positively or negatively impacted by the project. Examples of stakeholders include but are
not limited to:
    Internal stakeholders:
   uu

       nuSponsor,
       nuResource manager,
       nuProject management office (PMO),
       nuPortfolio steering committee,
       nuProgram manager,
       nuProject managers of other projects, and
       nuTeam members.

    External stakeholders:
   uu

       nuCustomers,
       nuEnd users,
       nuSuppliers,
       nuShareholders
       nuRegulatory bodies, and
       nuCompetitors




                                                                                                         Part 2 - Standard
550

                                                            Suppliers
                                                           Customers
                                                           End Users



                                                            Sponsors
                                                       Governing Bodies
                                                      Steering Committees

                                           Figure 1-4. Examples of Project Stakeholders



      Figure 1-4 shows examples of project stakeholders. Stakeholder involvement may range from occasional contributions
   in surveys and focus groups to full project sponsorship that includes the provision of financial, political, or other types
   of support. The type and level of project involvement can change over the course of the project's life cycle. Therefore,





   successfully identifying, analyzing, and engaging stakeholders and effectively managing their project expectations and
   participation throughout the project life cycle is critical to project success.





                                                                                                                         551
1.7 ROLE OF THE PROJECT MANAGER
   The project manager is the person assigned by the performing organization to lead the team responsible for achieving
the project objectives. The project manager's reporting relationships are based on the organizational structure and
project governance.
  In addition to any specific technical skills and general management proficiencies required for the project, project
managers should have at least the following attributes:
    Knowledge about project management, the business environment, technical aspects, and other information
   uu
       needed to manage the project effectively;
    Skills needed to effectively lead the project team, coordinate the work, collaborate with stakeholders, solve
   uu
       problems, and make decisions;
    Abilities to develop and manage scope, schedules, budgets, resources, risks, plans, presentations, and
   uu
       reports; and
    Other attributes required to successfully manage the project, such as personality, attitude, ethics, and leadership.
   uu

  Project managers accomplish work through the project team and other stakeholders. Project managers rely on
important interpersonal skills, including, but not limited to:
    Leadership,
   uu

    Team building,
   uu

    Motivating,
   uu

    Communicating,
   uu

    Influencing,
   uu

    Decision making,
   uu

   The project manager is successful when the project objectives have been achieved. Another aspect of success is
stakeholder satisfaction. The project manager should address stakeholder needs, concerns and expectations to satisfy
relevant stakeholders. To be successful, the project manager should tailor the project approach, life cycle, and project
management processes to meet the project and product requirements.

1.8 PROJECT MANAGEMENT KNOWLEDGE AREAS
  The Project Management Knowledge Areas are fields or areas of specialization that are commonly employed when
managing projects. A Knowledge Area is a set of processes associated with a particular topic in project management.
These 10 Knowledge Areas are used on most projects most of the time. The needs of a specific project may require
additional Knowledge Areas. The 10 Knowledge Areas are:
    Project Integration Management. Project Integration Management includes the processes and activities to
   uu
      identify, define, combine, unify, and coordinate the various processes and project management activities within
      the Project Management Process Groups.
    Project Scope Management. Project Scope Management includes the processes required to ensure that the
   uu
      project includes all the work required, and only the work required, to complete the project successfully.
    Project Schedule Management. Project Schedule Management includes the processes required to manage the
   uu
      timely completion of the project.
    Project Cost Management. Project Cost Management includes the processes involved in planning, estimating,
   uu
      budgeting, financing, funding, managing, and controlling costs so the project can be completed within the
      approved budget.
    Project Quality Management. Project Quality Management includes the processes for incorporating the
   uu
      organization's quality policy regarding planning, managing, and controlling project and product quality
      requirements, in order to meet stakeholders' expectations.
    Project Resource Management. Project Resource Management includes the processes to identify, acquire, and
   uu
      manage the resources needed for the successful completion of the project.
    Project Communications Management. Project Communications Management includes the processes required
   uu
      to ensure timely and appropriate planning, collection, creation, distribution, storage, retrieval, management,
      control, monitoring, and ultimate disposition of project information.
    Project Risk Management. Project Risk Management includes the processes of conducting risk management
   uu
      planning, identification, analysis, response planning, response implementation, and monitoring risk on a project.
    Project Procurement Management. Project Procurement Management includes the processes necessary to
   uu
      purchase or acquire products, services, or results needed from outside the project team.
    Project Stakeholder Management. Project Stakeholder Management includes the processes required to identify
   uu
      the people, groups, or organizations that could impact or be impacted by the project, to analyze stakeholder
      expectations and their impact on the project, and to develop appropriate management strategies for effectively
      engaging stakeholders in project decisions and execution.

1.9 PROJECT MANAGEMENT PROCESS GROUPS
   This standard describes the project management processes employed to meet project objectives. Project management
processes are grouped in five Project Management Process Groups:
    Initiating Process Group. The process(es) performed to define a new project or a new phase of an existing
   uu
       project by obtaining authorization to start the project or phase. Initiating processes are described in Section 2.
    Planning Process Group. The process(es) required to establish the scope of the project, refine the objectives,
   uu
       and define the course of action required to attain the objectives that the project was undertaken to achieve.
       Planning processes are described in Section 3.
    Executing Process Group. The process(es) performed to complete the work defined in the project management
   uu
       plan to satisfy the project requirements. Executing processes are described in Section 4.
    Monitoring and Controlling Process Group. The process(es) required to track, review, and regulate the progress
   uu
       and performance of the project; identify any areas in which changes to the plan are required; and initiate the
       corresponding changes. Monitoring and Controlling processes are described in Section 5.
    Closing Process Group. The process(es) performed to formally complete or close a project, phase, or contract.
   uu
       Closing processes are described in Section 6.
  These five Process Groups are independent of the application areas, (such as marketing, information services, or
accounting) or industry focus (such as construction, aerospace, telecommunications). Individual processes in the Process
Groups are often iterated prior to completing a phase or a project. The number of process iterations and interactions
between processes varies based on the needs of the project. Processes generally fall into one of three categories:
    Processes used once or at predefined points in the project. Developing the project charter and closing the
   uu
       project or phase are examples.
    Processes that are performed periodically as needed. Acquiring resources is performed when resources are
   uu
       needed. Conducting procurements will be performed prior to needing the procured item.
    Processes that are performed continuously throughout the project. Defining activities may occur throughout
   uu
       the project life cycle, especially when the project uses rolling wave planning or an adaptive development approach.
       Many of the monitoring and control processes are ongoing from the start of the project, until it is closed out.




                                                                                                        Part 2 - Standard
554
     The output of one process generally becomes an input to another process or is a deliverable of the project or project
   phase. For example, the project management plan and project documents (e.g., risk register, responsibility assignment
   matrix, etc.) produced in the Planning Process Group are provided to the Executing Process Group where updates are
   made. Figure 1-4 illustrates an example of how Process Groups can overlap during a project or phase.
      Process Groups are not project phases. If the project is divided into phases, the processes in the Process Groups
   interact within each phase. It is possible that all Process Groups could be represented within a phase, as illustrated
   in Figure 1-5. As projects are separated into distinct phases, such as concept development, feasibility study, design,
   prototype, build, or test, etc., processes in each of the Process Groups are repeated as necessary in each phase until the
   completion criteria for that phase have been satisfied.

   1.10 ENTERPRISE ENVIRONMENTAL FACTORS AND ORGANIZATIONAL
   PROCESS ASSETS
      Projects exist and operate in environments that may have an influence on them. These influences can have a favorable
   or unfavorable impact on the project. Two major categories of influences are enterprise environmental factors (EEFs) and
   organizational process assets (OPAs).
      EEFs originate from the environment outside of the project and often outside of the enterprise. These factors refer
   to conditions, which are not under the control of the project team, that influence, constrain, or direct the project. EEFs
   may have an impact at the enterprise, portfolio, program, or project level. (Refer to Section 2.2 in the PMBOK(R) Guide for
   additional information on EEFs.) One set of such factors are the internal organizational culture, structure and governance.
   Examples in this area include but are not limited to: vision, mission, values, beliefs, cultural norms, hierarchy, and
   authority relationships.
      OPAs are internal to the enterprise. These may arise from the enterprise itself, a portfolio, a program, another project,
   or a combination of these. OPAs are the plans, processes, policies, procedures, and knowledge bases specific to and
   used by the performing organization. These assets influence the management of the project. Examples include but
   are not limited to: change control procedures, templates, information from previous projects, and lessons learned
   repositories. (Refer to Section 2.3 in the PMBOK(R) Guide for additional information on OPAs).






                                                                                                                          557
   1.11 TAILORING THE PROJECT ARTIFACTS
      The term artifact in this context includes project management processes, inputs, tools, techniques, outputs, EEFs, and
   OPAs. The project manager and the project management team select and adapt the appropriate artifacts for use on their
   specific project. This selection and adaptation activity is known as tailoring. Tailoring is necessary because each project
   is unique; therefore, not every process, input, tool, technique, or output is required on every project.
      The project management plan is the most prevalent artifact. It has many components, such as the subsidiary
   management plans, baselines, and a description of the project life cycle. Subsidiary management plans are plans
   associated with a specific aspect or Knowledge Area of the project, for example, a schedule management plan,
   risk management plan and change management plan. Part of tailoring is identifying the project management plan
   components needed for a particular project. The project management plan is an input and project management plan
   updates are an output of many processes in this standard. Rather than listing the individual project management plan
   components in the input/output tables, examples of the components that may be inputs or may be updated as outputs
   are listed beneath the input/output tables for each process. The possible components are listed as examples only. These
   inputs and outputs are not required and are not the only inputs or updates to the project management plan that a project
   manager may use in that particular process.
      The project management plan is one of the primary project artifacts, but there are other documents that are not
   part of the project management plan that are used to manage the project. These other documents are called project
   documents. Similar to project management plan components, project documents needed for a process will depend on
   the individual project. The project manager is accountable for identifying the project documents needed for a process
   and the project documents that will be updated as an output of a process. The project documents listed beneath the
   input/output tables throughout this standard are possible examples of project documents, not a comprehensive list.
       Table 1-2 is a representative list of project management plan components and project documents. It is not complete
   list, but it does provide a representation of the types of documents that are often used to help manage a project.

      Business documents are documents that are generally originated outside of the project, and are used as inputs to
   the project. Examples of business documents include the business case and benefits management plan. The use of the
   business documents will depend on the company culture and project initiation process.
      The enterprise environmental factors that influence the project and the organizational process assets available to the
   project will depend on the project and project environment and are not listed in this standard.

    INITI ATI NG PR OCESS G ROU P
      The Initiating Process Group consists of those processes performed to define a new project or a new phase of an
   existing project by obtaining authorization to start the project or phase. The purpose of the Initiating Process Group is
   to align the stakeholders' expectations and the project purpose, inform stakeholders of the scope and objectives, and
   discuss how their participation in the project and its associated phases can help to ensure their expectations are met.
   Within the Initiating processes, the initial scope is defined and initial financial resources are committed. Stakeholders
   who will interact and influence the overall outcome of the project are identified. If not already assigned, the project
   manager is appointed. This information is captured in the project charter and stakeholder register. When the project
   charter is approved, the project is officially authorized, and the project manager is authorized to apply organizational
   resources to project activities.
      The key benefits of this Process Group are that only projects that are aligned with the organization's strategic
   objectives are authorized and that the business case, benefits, and stakeholders are considered from the start of
   the project. In some organizations, the project manager is involved in developing the business case and defining the
   benefits. In those organizations, the project manager generally helps write the project charter; in other organizations,
   the pre-project work is done by the project sponsor, project management office (PMO), portfolio steering committee,
   or other stakeholder group. This standard assumes the project has been approved by the sponsor or other governing
   body and they have reviewed the business documents prior to authorizing the project.
      Business documents are documents that are generally originated outside of the project, but are used as input to the
   project. Examples of business documents include the business case, and benefits management plan. Figure 2-1 shows
   the sponsor and the business documents in relation to the Initiating Processes.

   As described in Section 1.5, projects are often divided into phases. When this is done, information from processes
in the Initiating Process Group is reexamined to determine if the information is still valid. Revisiting the Initiating
processes at the start of each phase helps keep the project focused on the business need that the project was
undertaken to address. The project charter, business documents, and success criteria are verified. The influence,
drivers, expectations, and objectives of the project stakeholders are reviewed.
   Involving the sponsors, customers, and other stakeholders during initiation creates a shared understanding
of success criteria. It also increases the likelihood of deliverable acceptance when the project is complete, and
stakeholder satisfaction throughout the project.
  The Initiating Process Group includes the project management processes identified in Sections 2.1 through 2.2.

   2.1 DEVELOP PROJECT CHARTER
      Develop Project Charter is the process of developing a document that formally authorizes the existence of a project and
   provides the project manager with the authority to apply organizational resources to project activities. The key benefits of
   this process are that it provides a direct link between the project and the strategic objectives of the organization, creates
   a formal record of the project, and shows the organizational commitment to the project. This process is performed once,
   or at predefined points in the project. The inputs and outputs of this process are shown in Figure 2-3.

   2.2 IDENTIFY STAKEHOLDERS
      Identify Stakeholders is the process of identifying project stakeholders regularly and analyzing and documenting
   relevant information regarding their interests, involvement, interdependencies, influence, and potential impact on
   project success. The key benefit of this process is that it enables the project team to identify the appropriate focus for
   engagement of each stakeholder or group of stakeholders. This process is performed periodically throughout the project
   as needed. The inputs and outputs of this process are depicted in Figure 2-4.

    PLAN N I NG PR OCESS G RO U P
      The Planning Process Group consists of those processes that establish the total scope of the effort, define and
   refine the objectives, and develop the course of action required to attain those objectives. The processes in the
   Planning Process Group develop the components of the project management plan and the project documents used
   to carry out the project. The nature of a project may require the use of repeated feedback loops for additional
   analysis. As more project information or characteristics are gathered and understood, additional planning will likely
   be required. Significant changes that occur throughout the project life cycle may initiate a need to revisit one or
   more of the planning processes and, possibly, one or both of the Initiating processes. This ongoing refinement of the
   project management plan is called progressive elaboration, indicating that planning and documentation are iterative
   or ongoing activities. The key benefit of this Process Group is to define the course of action to successfully complete
   the project or phase.
      The project management team seeks input and encourages involvement from relevant stakeholders while planning
   the project and developing the project management plan and project documents. When the initial planning effort is
   completed, the approved version of the project management plan is considered a baseline. Throughout the project,
   the Monitoring and Controlling processes compare the project performance to the baselines.
      The Planning Process Group (Figure 3-1) includes the project management processes identified in Sections 3.1
   to 3.24.

   3.18 PLAN RISK MANAGEMENT
      Plan Risk Management is the process of defining how to conduct risk management activities for a project. The key
   benefit of this process is that it ensures that the degree, type, and visibility of risk management are proportionate to both
   the risks and the importance of the project to the organization and other stakeholders. This process is performed once
   or at predefined points in the project. The inputs and output of this process are depicted in Figure 3-19.

                                           Inputs                           Outputs

3.19 IDENTIFY RISKS
   Identify Risks is the process of identifying individual project risks as well as sources of overall project risk, and
documenting their characteristics. The key benefit of this process is the documentation of the existing individual project
risks and the sources of overall project risk. It also brings together information so the project team can to respond
appropriately to the identified risks. This process is performed throughout the project. The inputs and outputs of this
process are depicted in Figure 3-20.

      The Executing Process Group consists of those processes performed to complete the work defined in the project
   management plan to satisfy the project requirements. This Process Group involves coordinating resources, managing
   stakeholder engagement, and integrating and performing the activities of the project in accordance with the project
   management plan. The key benefit of this Process Group is that the work needed to meet the project requirements
   and objectives is performed according to plan. A large portion of the project budget, resources, and time is
   expended in performing the Executing Process Group processes. The processes in the Executing Process Group
   may generate change requests. If approved, the change requests may trigger one or more planning processes that
   result in a modified management plan, project documents, and possibly new baselines. The Executing Process Group
   (Figure 4-1) includes the project management processes identified in Sections 4.1 through 4.10.

    MON I TOR ING AND CO NTR OLLI NG P ROC ES S GROU P
      The Monitoring and Controlling Process Group consists of those processes required to track, review, and regulate
   the progress and performance of the project; identify any areas in which changes to the plan are required; and initiate
   the corresponding changes. Monitoring is collecting project performance data, producing performance measures,
   and reporting and disseminating performance information. Controlling is comparing actual performance with planned
   performance, analyzing variances, assessing trends to effect process improvements, evaluating possible alternatives,
   and recommending appropriate corrective action as needed. The key benefit of this Process Group is that project
   performance is measured and analyzed at regular intervals, appropriate events, or when exception conditions occur
   in order to identify and correct variances from the project management plan. The Monitoring and Controlling Process
   Group also involves:
       Evaluating change requests and deciding on the appropriate response;
      uu

       Recommending corrective or preventive action in anticipation of possible problems;
      uu

       Monitoring the ongoing project activities against the project management plan and project baselines; and
      uu

       Influencing the factors that could circumvent the change control process so only approved changes are
      uu
          implemented.
      Continuous monitoring provides the project team and other stakeholders with insight into the status of the project
   and identifies any areas that require additional attention. The Monitoring and Controlling Process Group monitors and
   controls the work being done within each Knowledge Area, each Process Group, each life cycle phase, and the project
   as a whole. The Monitoring and Controlling Process Group (Figure 5-1) includes the project management processes
   identified in Sections 5.1 through 5.12.

   5.1 MONITOR AND CONTROL PROJECT WORK
      Monitor and Control Project Work is the process of tracking, reviewing, and reporting the overall progress to meet
   the performance objectives defined in the project management plan. The key benefit of this process is that it allows
   stakeholders to understand the current state of the project, to recognize the actions taken to address any performance
   issues, and to have visibility into the future project status with cost and schedule forecasts. This process is performed
   throughout the project. The inputs and outputs for this process are depicted in Figure 5-2.

                                          Inputs                            Outputs

5.2 PERFORM INTEGRATED CHANGE CONTROL
    Perform Integrated Change Control is the process of reviewing all change requests; approving changes and managing
changes to deliverables, organizational process assets, project documents, and the project management plan; and
communicating the decisions. This process reviews all requests for changes to project documents, deliverables, or the
project management plan, and determines the resolution of the change requests. The key benefit of this process is that
it allows for documented changes within the project to be considered in an integrated manner while addressing overall
project risk, which often arises from changes made without consideration of the overall project objectives or plans. This
process is performed throughout the project. The inputs and outputs of this process are depicted in Figure 5-3.

                                       Inputs                            Outputs

   normally updated as a result of this process is the change log. The change log is used to document changes that occur
   during a project.






                                                                                                                    617

    C LOSI N G PRO CESS GR OU P
      The Closing Process Group consists of the process(es) performed to formally complete or close a project, phase,
   or contract. This Process Group verifies that the defined processes are completed within all of the Process Groups to
   close the project or phase, as appropriate, and formally establishes that the project or project phase is complete. The
   key benefit of this Process Group is that phases, projects, and contracts are closed out appropriately. While there is
   only one process in this Process Group, organizations may have their own processes associated with project, phase,
   or contract closure. Therefore, the term Process Group is maintained.
     This Process Group may also address the early closure of the project, for example, aborted projects or
   cancelled projects.
     The Closing Process Group (Figure 6-1) includes the project management process identified in Section 6.1.

6.1 CLOSE PROJECT OR PHASE
   Close Project or Phase is the process of finalizing all activities for the project, phase, or contract. The key benefits
of this process are the project or phase information is archived, the planned work is completed, and organizational
resources are released to pursue new endeavors. This process is performed once or at predefined points in the
project. The inputs and outputs of this process are depicted in Figure 6-2.

 APPE N DI X X1
 SI X TH EDITI ON CH ANG ES
  The purpose of this appendix is to provide an overview of the changes made to A Guide to the Project Management
Body of Knowledge (PMBOK(R) Guide)--Fifth Edition to create the PMBOK(R) Guide--Sixth Edition.



X1.1 SCOPE OF UPDATE
  The approved scope for the PMBOK(R) Guide--Sixth Edition includes:
    Review the following and determine whether the material will be included or excluded in the new editions, and
   uu
      track the disposition:
      nuAll  material relevant to Sections 1 through 13, Annex A1, and the Glossary that was deferred during the
          development of A Guide to the Project Management Body of Knowledge (PMBOK(R) Guide)--Fifth Edition
      nuAll  comments and feedback relevant to Sections 1 through 13, Annex A1, and the Glossary of A Guide to the
          Project Management Body of Knowledge (PMBOK(R) Guide)--Fifth Edition that have been received by PMI
          since the initial development and publication.
    Review, interpret, and ensure appropriate alignment with ISO 21500 in the development of the standard.
   uu

    Ensure harmonization with any other relevant PMI foundational standards.
   uu

    Consider the project manager role delineation study results and other PMI research studies for incorporation as
   uu
      appropriate.
    Review, conduct, and analyze research for significant additions, deletions, and changes to the Sixth Edition and
   uu
      possibly for strategic input to future editions.
   With that directive in mind, the update team focused on bringing greater consistency and clarity by refining and
standardizing the processes, inputs, tools and techniques, and outputs.




                                                                                                                639
X1.2 RULES FOR HARMONIZATION BETWEEN GLOSSARY TERMS AND THE PMI LEXICON
OF PROJECT MANAGEMENT TERMS
  To ensure that terms used in the PMBOK(R) Guide align with the PMI Lexicon of Project Management Terms 1 and
harmonize with other relevant PMI standards, the Sixth Edition followed these business rules:
    For terms found in both the PMBOK(R) Guide and the PMI Lexicon, the definition from the PMI Lexicon is used.
   uu

    Where terms used in the PMBOK(R) Guide are not found in the PMI Lexicon but are found in other relevant
   uu
      PMI standards, the definitions of the terms should be identical. If the definitions do not align with the
      respective standards, the term is elevated to the PMI Lexicon team for assistance in creating an acceptable
      common definition.



X1.3 RULES FOR HANDLING INPUTS AND OUTPUTS
  The following business rules were used to provide consistency in the order and information within the inputs and
outputs for each project management process:
    Fundamental Rules:
   uu

      nuInputs are any documents that are key to the process.
      nuOutputs    should become an input to another project management process unless the output is a terminal
          output or embedded within another input such as project documents.
      nuInputs   should come from an output from another project management process unless the input comes from
          outside the project.
    Project Documents Rules:
   uu

      nuWhen specific project documents are identified the first time, they are listed as a specific output. Subsequently,
          they are listed as "project documents updates" in the output list, and described in the section narrative.
      nuWhen   any project document is an input, the term "project documents" is listed and the specific project
          documents are described in the section narrative.
    Project Management Plan Rules:
   uu

      nuFor those planning processes that create a subsidiary plan, the project charter is the first input and the project
          management plan is the second input.
      nuThe    process that creates a component of the project management plan lists the component specifically.
          Subsequently, components are listed as "project management plan updates" in the output list, and described
          in the section narrative.
      nuWhen the project management plan serves as a process input, specific components of the project management
          plan that may be considered are described in the section narrative.

640
       Sequencing Rules:
      uu

          nuIf the project charter is an input, it is the first input.
          nuWhen   the project management plan is an input or output, the subsidiary management plans are listed in the
             order of the sections in the PMBOK(R) Guide where they are produced as an output, followed by baselines and
             then any other plans.
          nuProject documents are listed in alphabetical order.
          nuEnterprise environmental factors and organizational process assets are listed last in that order.
          nuWhen updates are an output they are listed in the following sequence:
             muProject    management plan updates,
             muProject    documents updates, and
             muOrganizational     process assets updates.



   X1.4 RULES FOR HANDLING TOOLS AND TECHNIQUES
      The Sixth Edition endeavored to reduce the number of tools and techniques by focusing on those that are currently
   used on most projects most of the time. Based on academic and market research a number of tools and techniques
   were eliminated. In order to reduce repetition a tool or technique is described the first time it is listed and subsequent
   processes using that tool or technique refer back to the earlier description.
       The Sixth Edition grouped some of the commonly used tools and techniques by their intent. Not all tools and techniques
   fall within a group, but for those tools or techniques that are part of a group, the group is listed and then examples of
   tools and techniques in that group are described in the narrative. The tools and techniques groups are:
       Data gathering,
      uu

       Data analysis,
      uu

       Data representation,
      uu

       Decision-making,
      uu

       Communication skills, and
      uu





       Interpersonal and team skills.
      uu





      Appendix X6 identifies all the tools and techniques in the PMBOK(R) Guide by group, where appropriate, and lists the
   processes where they are used.




                                                                                                                         641
X1.5 PROJECT MANAGEMENT PLAN
  Not every component of the project management plan is created in a separate process. Such components are
considered to be created in the Develop Project Management Plan process. They include the change management plan,
configuration management plan, performance measurement baseline, project life cycle, development approach, and
management reviews.



X1.6 SECTION 1--INTRODUCTION
    The Introduction section was significantly rewritten. Introductory information about projects, programs, and portfolios
that aligns with other PMI foundational standards remains. However, there is new information on project and development
life cycles, project phases, and phase gates. This information provides a high-level overview on selecting development
approaches from predictive, iterative, incremental and adaptive, based on the nature of the project. New information on
business documents includes the business case and the benefits management plan.



X1.7 SECTION 2--THE ENVIRONMENT IN WHICH PROJECTS OPERATE
   The content of Section 2 was significantly rewritten. Information on organizational process assets and enterprise
environmental factors remains. However, there is new content on governance, management elements, and organizational
structure types.



X1.8 SECTION 3--THE ROLE OF THE PROJECT MANAGER
   This is a new section that outlines the project manager's role on the team. It includes information on the project
manager's sphere of influence and competencies. PMI's Talent Triangle(R) is discussed with its emphasis on strategic
and business management skills, technical project management skills, and leadership skills. Leadership styles and
personality are also discussed as part of this section. The final part of this section focuses on the project manager as
an integrator.



X1.9 AGILE
   Since the Fifth Edition of the PMBOK(R) Guide there has been more adoption of agile and adaptive methodologies in the
management of projects. The Sixth Edition has included a subsection called Considerations for Adaptive Environments
at the beginning of Sections 4 through 13. Some agile-specific tools and techniques have been introduced into the
PMBOK(R) Guide, such as sprint and iteration planning. Appendix X3 describes the use of agile, adaptive, iterative, and
hybrid approaches from the perspective of the Project Management Process Groups.




                                                                                                     Part 3 - Appendix X1
642
X1.10 KNOWLEDGE AREA FRONT MATERIAL
   Each of the Knowledge Area sections includes standardized material prior to introducing the first process. The material
is presented in the following subsections:
    Key Concepts. Collects key concepts associated with the specific knowledge area. This information was
   uu
       presented in earlier editions; in this edition it is consolidated and presented for consistency between knowledge
       areas. These key concepts are compiled in Appendix X4.
    Trends and Emerging Practices. The profession of project management continues to evolve. However, the
   uu
       purpose of the PMBOK(R) Guide is not to lead the industry; it is to describe what is considered good practice on
       most projects most of the time. This subsection identifies some of the trends or emerging practices that are
       occurring, but that may not be practiced on most projects.
    Tailoring Considerations. The Sixth Edition emphasizes the importance of tailoring all aspects of the project
   uu
       to meet the needs of the organization, environment, stakeholders and other variables. This subsection identifies
       areas the project manager can consider when tailoring their project. These tailoring considerations are compiled
       in Appendix X5.
    Considerations for Agile/Adaptive Environments. This subsection identifies some of the areas where adaptive
   uu
       approaches may differ from predictive approaches in the particular Knowledge Area.



X1.11 KNOWLEDGE AREA AND PROCESS CHANGES
  Two Knowledge Areas names were changed to more closely reflect the work that is done.
    Project Time Management was changed to Project Schedule Management to reflect that the project schedule is
   uu
       defined and managed during the project, whereas time is not managed.
    Both team resources and physical resources are addressed in the Sixth Edition. Thus, the Knowledge Area Project
   uu
       Human Resource Management was changed to Project Resource Management.
   One process was removed and three new processes were added, to reflect changes in the way projects are managed
in practice. One process was moved between Knowledge Areas. These changes are summarized below, and discussed
in the relevant Knowledge Area section:
    Manage Project Knowledge (Section 4.4)--Added.
   uu

    Estimate Activity Resources (Section 6.4)--Moved to Project Resource Management.
   uu

    Control Resources (Section 9.6)--Added.
   uu

    Implement Risk Responses (Section 11.6)--Added.
   uu

    Close Procurements (Section 12.4)--Eliminated.
   uu




                                                                                                                      643
   Several process names were changed to improve consistency across the processes and to improve clarity. Research
indicates that project managers tend to monitor, facilitate, and manage rather than control, particularly in processes
that involve interactions with people. Therefore, process names for Control Communications, Control Risks, and
Control Stakeholder Engagement were changed to Monitor Communications, Monitor Risks, and Monitor Stakeholder
Engagement. The list below summarizes all the process name changes:
    Perform Quality Assurance (Section 8.2)--Changed to Manage Quality.
   uu

    Plan Human Resource Management (Section 9.1)--Changed to Plan Resource Management.
   uu

    Acquire Project Team (Section 9.2)--Changed to Acquire Resources.
   uu

    Develop Project Team (Section 9.3)--Changed to Develop Team.
   uu

    Manage Project Team (Section 9.4)--Changed to Manage Team.
   uu

    Control Communications (Section 10.3)--Changed to Monitor Communications
   uu

    Control Risks (Section 11.6)--Changed to Monitor Risks.
   uu

    Plan Stakeholder Management (Section 13.2)--Changed to Plan Stakeholder Engagement.
   uu

    Control Stakeholder Engagement (Section 13.4)--Changed to Monitor Stakeholder Engagement.
   uu



X1.12 SECTION 4--PROJECT INTEGRATION MANAGEMENT CHANGES
   A new process, Manage Project Knowledge, was added. This is a result of many deferred comments from the Fifth
Edition indicating the need to address knowledge management in projects. A key output of this process is the lessons
learned register. This register is used throughout many of the processes in the Sixth Edition. This emphasizes the need
to learn continually throughout the project rather than waiting until the end to reflect.
   Business documents are inputs to the Develop Project Charter and Close Project or Phase processes. The introduction
of business documents underscores the importance of staying attuned to the business case and benefits management
throughout the project. Administrative closure activities for procurements have been absorbed into the Close Project or
Phase process.
  Changes consistent with information described in Sections X1.1 through X1.11 were implemented. Table X1-1
summarizes the Section 4 processes:




                                                                                                 Part 3 - Appendix X1

                                                               4.7 Close Project or Phase




   X1.13 SECTION 5--PROJECT SCOPE MANAGEMENT CHANGES
      The Sixth Edition team collaborated with The Standard for Business Analysis to ensure that both foundational
   standards were aligned, though not duplicative. No changes to process names were necessary.
     Changes consistent with information described in Sections X1.1 through X1.11 were implemented.



   X1.14 SECTION 6--PROJECT SCHEDULE MANAGEMENT CHANGES
      Section 6 was renamed from Project Time Management to Project Schedule Management. Research indicated
   support for the name change as project managers do not manage time, they define and manage the project schedule.
   Due to the shift in focus and renaming of Project Human Resource Management to Project Resource Management, the
   process Estimate Activity Resources was moved from this Knowledge Area to Project Resource Management. Some
   agile concepts were incorporated into the Develop Schedule process. Figures and associated text were updated to
   clarify scheduling concepts addressed in the section.





     Changes consistent with information described in Sections X1.1 through X1.11 were implemented. Table X1-2
   summarizes the Section 6 processes:





                                                                                                               645

          6.7 Control Schedule




X1.15 SECTION 7--PROJECT COST MANAGEMENT CHANGES
  Changes consistent with information described in Sections X1.1 through X1.11 were implemented.



X1.16 SECTION 8--PROJECT QUALITY MANAGEMENT CHANGES
   Academic and market research was conducted regarding the Perform Quality Assurance process. Research indicated
that many of the quality tools and techniques that were identified previously are not widely used in today's projects.
The profession focuses more on managing quality through the quality management plan. Thus, the Perform Quality
Assurance process shifted focus and the name was changed to Manage Quality.
  Changes consistent with information described in Sections X1.1 through X1.11 were implemented. Table X1-3
summarizes the Section 8 processes:

646
   X1.17 SECTION 9--PROJECT RESOURCE MANAGEMENT CHANGES
      The Sixth Edition expanded the scope of this section from its previous focus on human resources to include all
   resources. To distinguish between human resources and other resources, the term team resources is used to refer to
   human resources and the term physical resources is used to refer to other resources. The Estimate Activity Resources
   process was transferred into this Knowledge Area from Project Schedule Management, and a new process Control
   Resources was added. The word "project" was eliminated from Develop Team and Manage Team as it is inferred that
   the only team the project manager is concerned about developing and managing is the project team.
     Changes consistent with information described in Sections X1.1 through X1.11 were implemented. Table X1-4
   summarizes the Section 9 processes:

   X1.18 SECTION 10--PROJECT COMMUNICATIONS MANAGEMENT CHANGES
      A subtle but important distinction was made in this section about project communication. The term "communication"
   indicates the act of communicating, such as facilitating a meeting, giving information and active listening. The term
   "communications" indicates the artifacts of communication, such as memos, presentations, and emails. Because it is
   not possible to control how and when people communicate, the name of the Control Communications process has been
   changed to Monitor Communications.

   summarizes the Section 10 processes:




                                                                                                                    647

          10.3 Control Communications                         10.3 Monitor Communications




X1.19 SECTION 11--PROJECT RISK MANAGEMENT CHANGES
   An increased emphasis on overall project risk was integrated throughout the risk management processes. A new
process, Implement Risk Responses, was added. This process is part of the Executing Process Group. The new process
emphasizes the importance of not just planning risk responses, but implementing them as well. A new risk response
"escalate" was introduced to indicate that if risks are identified that are outside the scope of the project objectives,
they should be passed to the relevant person or part of the organization. Because risks are uncertain future events or
conditions, they cannot be controlled; however, they can be monitored. Thus, the process Control Risks was renamed
to Monitor Risks.
  Changes consistent with information described in Sections X1.1 through X1.11 were implemented. Table X1-6
summarizes the Section 11 processes:

                                                                                                    Part 3 - Appendix X1
648
   X1.20 SECTION 12--PROJECT PROCUREMENT MANAGEMENT CHANGES
     Much of the information in this Knowledge Area was updated to reflect a more global perspective. Many projects are
   conducted with stakeholders in various countries, or by organizations with offices in multiple countries.
      Market research shows that very few project managers actually close out procurements. Someone in contracts,
   procurement or legal departments usually has that authority. Therefore, information from Close Procurements about
   evaluating all completed deliverables and comparing them to the contract was absorbed into Control Procurements.
   Information about administrative, communications, and records was moved to Close Project or Phase.
     Changes consistent with information described in Sections X1.1 through X1.11 were implemented. Table X1-7
   summarizes the Section 12 processes:

X1.21 SECTION 13--PROJECT STAKEHOLDER MANAGEMENT CHANGES
   In keeping with current research and practice, a shift was made to focus on stakeholder engagement rather than
stakeholder management. Because project managers rarely, if ever, have the ability to control stakeholders, Control
Stakeholder Engagement was renamed to Monitor Stakeholder Engagement.
  Changes consistent with information described in Sections X1.1 through X1.11 were implemented. Table X1-8
summarizes the Section 13 processes:

X1.22 GLOSSARY
  The glossary of the PMBOK(R) Guide--Sixth Edition was updated to clarify meaning and improve the quality and
accuracy of any translations. Terms that are not used in the Sixth Edition, or are not used differently from everyday
usage, were eliminated.

   This appendix explores the nuances of how the Project Management Process Groups described in The Standard for
Project Management are performed with respect to the project environment and life cycle.
   Section 1.4.2.1 of the PMBOK(R) Guide states that the "project life cycle needs to be flexible enough to deal with the
variety of factors included in the project." It is the nature of projects to evolve as more detailed and specific information
becomes available. This ability to evolve and adapt is more relevant in environments with a high degree of change and
uncertainty or with a wide variation of stakeholder interpretation and expectations.



X3.1 THE CONTINUUM OF PROJECT LIFE CYCLES
    To understand the application of the process in adaptive projects, the continuum of project life cycles should be defined.
The PMBOK(R) Guide Glossary describes the project life cycle as "the series of phases that a project passes through from
its start to its completion." Within a project life cycle, there are generally one or more phases that are associated with
the development of the product, service, or result. These are called a development life cycle. Development life cycles can
be predictive (plan-driven), adaptive (agile), iterative, incremental, or a hybrid.
   Figure X3-1 shows the various ways in which requirements and plans are handled, how risk and cost are managed,
schedule considerations, and how the involvement of key stakeholders is handled depending on the type of life cycle

                                              Figure X3-1. The Continuum of Project Life Cycles



  Predictive project life cycles are characterized by an emphasis on specification of requirements and detailed planning
during the beginning phases of a project. Detailed plans based on known requirements and constraints may reduce risk
and cost. Milestones for key stakeholder involvement are also planned. As execution of the detailed plan progresses, the
monitoring and controlling processes focus on constraining changes that might impact the scope, schedule, or budget.
   Highly adaptive or agile life cycles for projects are characterized by progressive elaboration of requirements based
on short iterative planning and executing cycles. Risk and cost are reduced by progressive evolution of initial plans.
Key stakeholders are continuously involved and provide frequent feedback which enables responding to changes more
quickly and also leads to better quality.
   The following considerations apply to the center of the life cycle continuum: (a) risk and cost are reduced by iterative
evolution of initial plans; and (b) key stakeholders have more opportunities to be involved in incremental, iterative, and
agile cycles than stakeholders at the project milestones of highly predictive life cycles.
   Project life cycles in the center of the life cycle continuum tend to align more closely with the predictive side or the
agile side of the continuum depending on the way requirements are specified, how risk and cost are handled, and the
nature of key stakeholder involvement. Projects in this part of the continuum may utilize hybrid project methods.
  It should be emphasized that development life cycles are complex and multidimensional. Often, the different
phases in a given project employ different life cycles, just as distinct projects within a given program may each be
executed differently.

X3.2 PROJECT PHASES
   Section 1.2.4.2 of the PMBOK(R) Guide defines phases as "a collection of logically related project activities that
culminates in the completion of one or more deliverables." Processes in each of the Process Groups are repeated as
necessary in each phase until the completion criteria for that phase have been satisfied.
   Projects on the more adaptive side of the continuum make use of two recurring patterns of project phase relationships
as described in Sections X3.2.1 and X3.2.2.



X3.2.1 SEQUENTIAL ITERATION-BASED PHASES
   Adaptive projects are often decomposed into a sequence of phases called Iterations. Each iteration utilizes the
relevant project management processes. These iterations create a cadence of predictable, timeboxed pre-agreed,
consistent duration that aids with scheduling.
    Performing the process groups repeatedly incurs overhead. The overhead is considered necessary to effectively
manage projects with high degrees of complexity, uncertainty, and change. The effort level for iteration-based phases
is illustrated in Figure X3-2.




                                                                                                        Effort per

X3.2.2 CONTINUOUS OVERLAPPING PHASES
    Projects that are highly adaptive will often perform all of the project management process groups continuously
throughout the project life cycle. Inspired by techniques from lean thinking, the approach is often referred to as "continuous
and adaptive planning," which acknowledges that once work starts, the plan will change, and the plan needs to reflect
this new knowledge. The intent is to aggressively refine and improve all elements of the project management plan,
beyond the prescheduled checkpoints associated with Iterations. The interaction of the Process Groups in this approach
is illustrated in Figure X3-3.




                            Initiating Processes

                                Figure X3-3. Relationship of Process Groups in Continuous Phases



   These highly adaptive approaches continuously pull tasks from a prioritized list of work. This aims to minimize the
overhead of managing Process Groups repeatedly, by removing the start and end of iteration activities. Continuous pull
systems can be viewed as microiterations with an emphasis on maximizing the time available on execution rather than
management. They do however need their own planning, tracking, and adjustment mechanisms to keep them on track
and adapt to changes.




                                                                                                       Part 3 - Appendix X3
668
X3.3 PROCESS GROUPS IN ADAPTIVE ENVIRONMENTS
   As shown in the previous section, each of the Project Management Process Groups occurs in projects across the
project life cycle continuum. There are some variations in how the Process Groups interact within adaptive and highly
adaptive life cycles.



X3.3.1 INITIATING PROCESS GROUP
   Initiating processes are those processes performed to define a new project or a new phase of an existing project
by obtaining authorization to start the project or phase. Adaptive projects revisit and revalidate the project charter on a
frequent basis. As the project progresses, competing priorities and changing dynamics may cause the project constraints
and success criteria to become obsolete. For this reason, the Initiating processes are performed regularly on adaptive
projects in order to ensure the project is moving within constraints and toward goals that reflect the latest information.
   Adaptive projects rely heavily on a knowledgeable customer or designated customer representative who can state
needs and desires, and provide feedback on the emerging deliverable on a continuous, ongoing basis. Identifying this
stakeholder or other stakeholders at the start of the project permits frequent interactions when performing Execution and
Monitoring and Controlling processes. The associated feedback ensures that the correct project outputs are delivered. As
indicated previously, an Initiating process is typically conducted on each iterative cycle of an adaptive life cycle project.



X3.3.2 PLANNING PROCESS GROUP
   Planning processes are those processes required to establish the scope of the project, refine the objectives, and
define the course of action required to attain the objectives that the project was undertaken to achieve.
    Highly predictive project life cycles are generally characterized by few changes to project scope and high stakeholder
alignment. These projects benefit from detailed up-front planning. Adaptive life cycles, on the other hand, develop a set
of high-level plans for the initial requirements and progressively elaborate requirements to an appropriate level of detail
for the planning cycle. Therefore, predictive and adaptive life cycles differ as to how much planning is done and when
it is done.
  Additionally, projects navigating high degrees of complexity and uncertainty should involve as many team members
and stakeholders as possible in the planning processes. The intent is to overcome uncertainty by incorporating a wide
band of input into planning.




                                                                                                                        669
   X3.3.3 EXECUTING PROCESS GROUP
      Executing processes are those processes performed to complete the work defined in the project management plan
   to satisfy the project requirements.
      Work in agile, iterative, and adaptive project life cycles is directed and managed through iterations. Each iteration
   is a short, fixed time period to undertake work followed by a demonstration of functionality or design. Based on the
   demonstration, relevant stakeholders and the team conduct a retrospective review. The demonstration and review helps
   check progress against the plan and determines if any changes to the project scope, schedule, or execution processes
   are necessary. These sessions also help manage stakeholder engagement by showing increments of work done and
   discussing future work. The retrospective allows issues with the execution approach to be identified and discussed in a
   timely fashion along with ideas for improvements. Retrospectives are a primary tool to manage project knowledge and
   develop the team through discussions of what is working well and team-based problem solving.
      While work is undertaken via short iterations, it is also tracked and managed against longer-term project delivery
   timeframes. Trends of development speed, spend, defect rates, and team capacity that are tracked at an iteration level
   are summed and extrapolated at a project level to track completion performance. Highly adaptive approaches aim
   to utilize specialized team knowledge for task completion. Rather than a project manager selecting and sequencing
   work, higher-level objectives are explained and the team members are empowered to self-organize specific tasks
   as a group to best meet those objectives. This leads to the creation of practical plans with high levels of buy-in from
   the team members.
     Junior teams working on highly adaptive projects typically need coaching and work assignments before reaching this
   empowered team state. However, with progressive trials within the confines of a short iteration, teams are reviewed as
   part of the retrospective to determine if they acquired the required skills to perform without coaching.






                                                                                                     Part 3 - Appendix X3
   670
X3.3.4 MONITORING AND CONTROLLING PROCESS GROUP
  Monitoring and Controlling processes are those processes required to track, review, and regulate the progress and
performance of the project; identify any areas in which changes to the plan are required; and initiate the corresponding
changes.
   Iterative, agile, and adaptive approaches track, review, and regulate progress and performance by maintaining a
backlog. The backlog is prioritized by a business representative with help from the project team who estimates and
provides information about technical dependencies. Work is pulled from the top of the backlog for the next iteration
based on business priority and team capacity. Requests for change and defect reports are evaluated by the business
representative in consultation with the team for technical input and are prioritized accordingly in the backlog of work.
   This single-list-of-work-and-changes approach originated in project environ-ments with very high rates of change
that tended to overwhelm any attempts to separate change requests from originally planned work. Combining these
work streams into a single backlog that can be easily resequenced provides a single place for stakeholders to manage
and control project work, perform change control, and validate scope.
   As prioritized tasks and changes are pulled from the backlog and completed via iterations, trends, and metrics on
work performed, change effort and defect rates are calculated. By sampling progress frequently via short iterations,
measures of team capacity and progress against the original scope are made by measuring the number of change
impacts and defect remediation efforts. This allows estimates of cost, schedule, and scope to be made based on real
progress rates and change impacts.
  These metrics and projections are shared with project stakeholders via trend graphs (information radiators) to
communicate progress, share issues, drive continuous improvement activities, and manage stakeholder expectations.



X3.3.5 CLOSING PROCESS GROUP
   The Closing processes are the processes performed to formally complete or close a project, phase, or contract. Work
on iterative, adaptive, and agile projects is prioritized to undertake the highest business value items first. So, if the
Closing Process Group prematurely closes a project or phase, there is a high chance that some useful business value
will already have been generated. This allows premature closure to be less of a failure due to sunk costs and more of
an early benefits realization, quick win, or proof of concept for the business.




                                                                                                                     671

 SUMMA RY OF KEY CO NCEP TS FOR K NOWLEDGE AREAS
   The purpose of this appendix is to provide a summary of the sections on Key Concepts for each of the Knowledge
Areas in Sections 4-13. It can be used as an aid for project practitioners, a checklist of learning objectives for providers
of project management training, or as a study aid by those preparing for certification.



X4.1 KEY CONCEPTS FOR PROJECT INTEGRATION MANAGEMENT
  Key concepts for Project Integration Management include:
    Project Integration Management is the specific responsibility of the project manager and it cannot be delegated
   uu
       or transferred. The project manager is the one that combines the results from all the other Knowledge Areas to
       provide an overall view of the project. The project manager is ultimately responsible for the project as a whole.
    Projects and project management are integrative by nature, with most tasks involving more than one
   uu
       Knowledge Area.
    The relationships of processes within the Project Management Process Groups and between the Project
   uu
       Management Process
    Project Integration Management is about:
   uu

       nuEnsuring   that the due dates of project deliverables, the project life cycle, and the benefits realization plan
          are aligned;
       nuProviding a project management plan to achieve the project objectives;
       nuEnsuring the creation and the use of appropriate knowledge to and from the project;
       nuManaging project performance and changes to the project activities;
       nuMaking integrated decisions regarding key changes impacting the project;
       nuMeasuring and monitoring progress and taking appropriate action;
       nuCollecting, analyzing and communicating project information to relevant stakeholders;
       nuCompleting all the work of the project and formally closing each phase, contract, and the project as a whole; and
       nuManaging phase transitions when necessary.




                                                                                                                       673
X4.2 KEY CONCEPTS FOR PROJECT SCOPE MANAGEMENT
  Key concepts for Project Scope Management include:
   Scope can refer to product scope (the features and functions that characterize a product, service, or result), or to
  uu
      project scope (the work performed to deliver a product, service, or result with the specified features and functions).
   Project life cycles range along a continuum from predictive to adaptive or agile. In a life cycle that uses a
  uu
      predictive approach, the project deliverables are defined at the beginning of the project and any changes to the
      scope are progressively managed. In an adaptive or agile approach, the deliverables are developed over multiple
      iterations where a detailed scope is defined and approved for each iteration when it begins.
   Completion of the project scope is measured against the project management plan. Completion of the product
  uu
      scope is measured against the product requirements.



X4.3 KEY CONCEPTS FOR PROJECT SCHEDULE MANAGEMENT
  Key concepts for Project Schedule Management include:
   Project scheduling provides a detailed plan that represents how and when the project will deliver the products,
  uu
      services, and results defined in the project scope.
   The project schedule is used as a tool for communication, managing stakeholder expectations, and a basis for
  uu
      performance reporting.
   When possible, the detailed project schedule should remain flexible throughout the project to adjust for knowledge
  uu
      gained, increased understanding of the risk, and value-added activities.



X4.4 KEY CONCEPTS FOR PROJECT COST MANAGEMENT
  Key concepts for Project Cost Management include:
   Project Cost Management is primarily concerned with the cost of the resources needed to complete project
  uu
      activities, but it should also consider the effect of project decisions on the subsequent recurring cost of using,
      maintaining, and supporting project deliverables.
   Different stakeholders will measure project costs in different ways and at different times. Stakeholder requirements
  uu
      for managing costs should be considered explicitly.
   Predicting and analyzing the prospective financial performance of the project's product may be performed outside
  uu
      the project, or it may be part of Project Cost Management.




                                                                                                     Part 3 - Appendix X4
674
X4.5 KEY CONCEPTS FOR PROJECT QUALITY MANAGEMENT
  Key concepts for Project Quality Management include:
    Project Quality Management addresses the management of the project and the deliverables of the project. It
   uu
      applies to all projects, regardless of the nature of their deliverables. Quality measures and techniques are specific
      to the type of deliverables being produced by the project.
    Quality and grade are different concepts. Quality is "the degree to which a set of inherent characteristics fulfills
   uu
      requirements" (ISO 9000).1 Grade is a category assigned to deliverables having the same functional use but
      different technical characteristics. The project manager and team are responsible for managing trade-offs
      associated with delivering the required levels of both quality and grade.
    Prevention is preferred over inspection. It is better to design quality into deliverables, rather than to find quality
   uu
      issues during inspection. The cost of preventing mistakes is generally much less than the cost of correcting
      mistakes when they are found by inspection or during usage.
    Project managers may need to be familiar with sampling. Attribute sampling (the result either conforms or does
   uu
      not conform) and variable sampling (the result is rated on a continuous scale that measures the degree of
      conformity).
    Many projects establish tolerances and control limits for project and product measurements. Tolerances (the
   uu
      specified range of acceptable results) and control limits (the boundaries of common variation in a statistically
      stable process or process performance).
    The cost of quality (COQ) includes all costs incurred over the life of the product by investment in preventing
   uu
      nonconformance to requirements, appraising the product or service for conformance to requirements, and
      failing to meet requirements (rework). Cost of quality is often the concern of program management, portfolio
      management, the PMO, or operations.
    The most effective quality management is achieved when quality is incorporated into the planning and designing
   uu
      of the project and product, and when organizational culture is aware and committed to quality.

X4.6 KEY CONCEPTS FOR PROJECT RESOURCE MANAGEMENT
  Key concepts for Project Resource Management include:
   Project resources include both physical resources (equipment, materials, facilities, and infrastructure) and team
  uu
      resources (individuals with assigned project roles and responsibilities).
   Different skills and competences are needed to manage team resources versus physical resources.
  uu

   The project manager should be both the leader and the manager of the project team, and should invest suitable
  uu
      effort in acquiring, managing, motivating, and empowering team members.
   The project manager should be aware of team influences such as the team environment, geographical location of
  uu
      team members, communication among stakeholders, organizational change management, internal and external
      politics, cultural issues, and organizational uniqueness.
   The project manager is responsible for proactively developing team skills and competences while retaining and

      improving team satisfaction and motivation.
   Physical resource management is concentrated on allocating and utilizing the physical resources needed for
  uu
      successful completion of the project in an efficient and effective way. Failure to manage and control resources
      efficiently may reduce the chance of completing the project successfully.



X4.7 KEY CONCEPTS FOR PROJECT COMMUNICATIONS MANAGEMENT
  Key concepts for Project Communications Management include:
   Communication is the process of exchanging information, intended or involuntary, between individuals and/
  uu
      or groups. Communications describes the means by which information can be sent or received, either through
      activities, such as meetings and presentations, or artifacts, such as emails, social media, project reports, or
      project documentation. Project Communications Management addresses both the process of communication, as
      well as management of communications activities and artifacts.
   Effective communication creates a bridge between diverse stakeholders whose differences will generally
  uu
      have an impact or influence upon the project execution or outcome, so it is vital that all communication is
      clear and concise.
   Communication activities include internal and external, formal and informal, written and oral.
  uu

   Communication can be directed upwards to senior management stakeholders, downwards to team members,
  uu
      or horizontally to peers. This will affect the format and content of the message.




                                                                                               Part 3 - Appendix X4
676
  Communication takes place consciously or unconsciously through words, facial expressions, gestures and other
 uu
    actions. It includes developing strategies and plans for suitable communications artifacts, and the application
    of skills to enhance effectiveness.
  Effort is required to prevent misunderstandings and miscommunication, and the methods, messengers, and
 uu
    messages should be carefully selected.
  Effective communication depends on defining the purpose of communication, understanding the receiver of the
 uu
    communications, and monitoring effectiveness.



X4.8 KEY CONCEPTS FOR PROJECT RISK MANAGEMENT
 Key concepts for Project Risk Management include:
  All projects are risky. Organizations choose to take project risk in order to create value, while balancing
 uu
    risk and reward.
  Project Risk Management aims to identify and manage risks that are not covered by other project
 uu
    management processes.
  Risk exists at two levels within every project: Individual project risk is an uncertain event or condition that, if
 uu
    it occurs, has a positive or negative effect on one or more project objectives. Overall project risk is the effect
    of uncertainty on the project as a whole, arising from all sources of uncertainty including individual risks,
    representing the exposure of stakeholders to the implications of variations in project outcome, both positive and
    negative. Project Risk Management processes address both levels of risk in projects.
  Individual project risks can have a positive or negative effect on project objectives if they occur. Overall project
 uu
    risk can also be positive or negative.
  Risks will continue to emerge during the lifetime of the project, so Project Risk Management processes should
 uu
    be conducted iteratively.
  In order to manage risk effectively on a particular project, the project team needs to know what level of risk
 uu
    exposure is acceptable in pursuit of project objectives. This is defined by measurable risk thresholds that reflect
    the risk appetite of the organization and project stakeholders.




                                                                                                                   677
X4.9 KEY CONCEPTS FOR PROJECT PROCUREMENT MANAGEMENT
  Key concepts for project procurement management include:
   The project manager should be familiar enough with the procurement process to make intelligent decisions
  uu
      regarding contracts and contractual relationships.
   Procurement involves agreements that describe the relationship between a buyer and a seller. Agreements can
  uu
      be simple or complex, and the procurement approach should reflect the degree of complexity. An agreement can
      be a contract, a service-level agreement, an understanding, a memorandum of agreement, or a purchase order.
   Agreements must comply with local, national, and international laws regarding contracts.
  uu

   The project manager should ensure that all procurements meet the specific needs of the project, while working
  uu
      with procurement specialists to ensure organizational policies are followed.
   The legally binding nature of an agreement means it will be subjected to a more extensive approval process, often
  uu
      involving the legal department, to ensure that it adequately describes the products, services, or results that the
      seller is agreeing to provide, while being in compliance with the laws and regulations regarding procurements.
   A complex project may involve multiple contracts simultaneously or in sequence. The buyer-seller relationship
  uu
      may exist at many levels on any one project, and between organizations internal to and external to the
      acquiring organization.



X4.10 KEY CONCEPTS FOR PROJECT STAKEHOLDER MANAGEMENT
  Key concepts for project stakeholder management include:
   Every project has stakeholders who are impacted by or can impact the project in a positive or negative way. Some
  uu
      stakeholders will have a limited ability to influence the project's work or outcomes; others will have significant
      influence on the project and its expected outcomes.
   The ability of the project manager and team to correctly identify and engage all of the stakeholders in an
  uu
      appropriate way can mean the difference between project success and failure.
   To increase the chances of success, the process of stakeholder identification and engagement should commence
  uu
      as soon as possible after the project charter has been approved, the project manager has been assigned, and
      the team begins to form.
   The key to effective stakeholder engagement is a focus on continuous communication with all stakeholders.
  uu
      Stakeholder satisfaction should be identified and managed as a key project objective.
   The process of identifying and engaging stakeholders for the benefit of the project is iterative, and should be
  uu
      reviewed and updated routinely, particularly when the project moves into a new phase, or if there are significant
      changes in the organization or the wider stakeholder community.




                                                                                                  Part 3 - Appendix X4

     Project complexity. Is a robust risk approach demanded by high levels of innovation, new technology,
    uu
        commercial arrangements, interfaces, or external dependencies that increase project complexity? Or is the
        project simple enough that a reduced risk process will suffice?
     Project importance. How strategically important is the project? Is the level of risk increased for this project
    uu
        because it aims to produce breakthrough opportunities, addresses significant blocks to organizational
        performance, or involves major product innovation?
     Development approach. Is this a waterfall project where risk processes can be followed sequentially and
    uu
        iteratively, or does the project follow an agile approach where risk is addressed at the start of each iteration as
        well as during execution?

    TOOLS AND TECHNIQU ES


   X6.1 INTRODUCTION
      The PMBOK(R) Guide - Sixth Edition presents tools and techniques differently from previous editions. Where appropriate,
   this edition groups tools and techniques by their purpose. The group name describes the intent of what needs to be
   done and the tools and techniques in the group represent different methods to accomplish the intent. For example, data
   gathering is a group with the intent of gathering data and information. Brainstorming, interviews, and market research
   are among the techniques that can be used to gather data and information.
      This approach reflects the emphasis in the Sixth Edition on the importance of tailoring the information presented in
   the PMBOK(R) Guide to the needs of the environment, situation, organization, or project.
      There are 132 individual tools and techniques in the PMBOK(R) Guide - Sixth Edition. These are not the only tools
   and techniques that can be used to manage a project. They represent those tools and techniques that are considered
   to be good practice on most projects most of the time. Some are mentioned once and some appear many times in the
   PMBOK(R) Guide.
      To assist practitioners in identifying where specific tools and techniques are used, this appendix identifies each tool
   and technique, the group to which it belongs (if appropriate), and the process(es) where it is listed in the PMBOK(R) Guide.
   The process in which a tool or technique is described in the guide is in boldface type. In other processes where the tool
   or technique is listed, it will reference the process in which it is described. Processes may provide additional verbiage
   on how a tool or technique is used in a particular process.

   uu
       and information. There are 15 data representation tools and techniques.
    Decision-making techniques. Used to select a course of action from different alternatives. There are two
   uu
       decision-making tools and techniques.

 PRE FACE


   The Project Management Institute and Agile Alliance(R) chartered this practice guide to create a greater
understanding of agile approaches in their communities. The vision for this practice guide is to equip project
teams with tools, situational guidelines, and an understanding of the available agile techniques and approaches
to enable better results.
   Project teams are using agile approaches in a variety of industries beyond software development. Both
organizations realize that expansion has created a need for a common language, open mindedness, and the
willingness to be flexible in how products and deliverables are brought to market. In addition, both organizations
realize there are multiple ways to achieve successful delivery. There are a broad range of tools, techniques, and
frameworks; teams have choices for approaches and practices that fit their project and the organizational culture
in order to achieve the desired outcome.
  The Agile Practice Guide core committee members are from varying backgrounds and use various approaches.
Some of the committee members are consultants and some work inside organizations. All have worked in agile
ways for many years.

    IN TRODUCTI ON
      Welcome to the Agile Practice Guide! This guide was developed as a collaborative effort by the Project Management
   Institute (PMI) and Agile Alliance(R). The members of the core writing team who developed this practice guide included
   volunteers from both organizations, drawing on subject matter expertise from a broad range of current practitioners and
   leaders from a diverse range of backgrounds, beliefs, and cultures.
      This practice guide provides practical guidance geared toward project leaders and team members adapting to an
   agile approach in planning and executing projects. While our core writing team recognizes there is staunch support
   to use predictive approaches and conversely, passion around shifting to an agile mindset, values, and principles, this
   practice guide covers a practical approach to project agility. This practice guide represents a bridge to understanding
   the pathway from a predictive approach to an agile approach. In fact, there are similar activities between the two, such
   as planning, that are handled differently but occur in both environments.
      Our core writing team used an agile mindset to collaborate and manage the development of this first edition of the
   practice guide. As technology and culture changes, future updates and refinements to the practice guide will reflect
   current approaches.
     Our core team adopted a more informal, relaxed writing style for this practice guide than is typical for PMI standards.
   The guide incorporates new elements, such as tips, sidebars, and case studies to better illustrate key points and
   concepts. Our team intends for these changes to make this practice guide more readable and user-friendly.
      This practice guide goes beyond addressing the use of agile in the computer software development industry, because
   agile has expanded into non-software development environments. Manufacturing, education, healthcare and other
   industries are becoming agile to varying degrees and this use beyond software is within the scope of this practice guide.

AGILE-BASED LEARNING                                So why an Agile Practice Guide and why now? Project teams have used

    AN IN TRO DUCTI ON TO A GI LE


   2.1 DEFINABLE WORK VS. HIGH-UNCERTAINTY WORK
      Project work ranges from definable work to high-uncertainty work. Definable work projects are characterized by clear
   procedures that have proved successful on similar projects in the past. The production of a car, electrical appliance, or
   home after the design is complete are examples of definable work. The production domain and processes involved are
   usually well understood and there are typically low levels of execution uncertainty and risk.
      New design, problem solving, and not-done-before work is exploratory. It requires subject matter experts to
   collaborate and solve problems to create a solution. Examples of people encountering high-uncertainty work include
   software systems engineers, product designers, doctors, teachers, lawyers, and many problem-solving engineers. As
   more definable work is automated, project teams are undertaking more high-uncertainty work projects that require the
   techniques described in this practice guide.
      High-uncertainty projects have high rates of change, complexity, and risk. These characteristics can present problems
   for traditional predictive approaches that aim to determine the bulk of the requirements upfront and control changes
   through a change request process. Instead, agile approaches were created to explore feasibility in short cycles and
   quickly adapt based on evaluation and feedback.

2.2 THE AGILE MANIFESTO AND MINDSET
   Thought leaders in the software industry formalized the agile movement in 2001 with the publication of the Manifesto
for Agile Software Development (see Figure 2-1).


                       We are uncovering better ways of developing software by doing it and
                       helping others do it. Through this work we have come to value:
                                 Individuals and interactions over processes and tools
                                 Working software over comprehensive documentation
                                   Customer collaboration over contract negotiation
                                      Responding to change over following a plan
                       That is, while there is value in the items on the right, we value the
                       items on the left more.

                                                                                                             Section 2

   Twelve clarifying principles flowed from these values as shown in Figure 2-2.



              1. Our highest priority is to satisfy the customer through early and continuous
                 delivery of valuable software.
              2. Welcome changing requirements, even late in development. Agile processes
                 harness change for the customer's competitive advantage.
              3. Deliver working software frequently, from a couple of weeks to a couple of months,
                 with a preference to the shorter timescale.
              4. Business people and developers must work together daily throughout the project.
              5. Build projects around motivated individuals. Give them the environment and
                 support they need, and trust them to get the job done.
              6. The most efficient and effective method of conveying information to and within a
                 development team is face-to-face conversation.
              7. Working software is the primary measure of progress.
              8. Agile processes promote sustainable development. The sponsors, developers, and
                 users should be able to maintain a constant pace indefinitely.
              9. Continuous attention to technical excellence and good design enhances agility.
              10. Simplicity--the art of maximizing the amount of work not done--is essential.
              11. The best architectures, requirements, and designs emerge from self-organizing
                  teams.
              12. At regular intervals, the team reflects on how to become more effective, then
                  tunes and adjusts its behavior accordingly.

                                                                                                      9
     Although originating in the software industry, these principles have since spread to many other industries.
   This embodiment of mindset, values, and principles defines what constitutes an agile approach. The various agile
approaches in use today share common roots with the agile mindset, value, and principles. This relationship is shown
in Figure 2-3.

             Mindset




            Agile is a mindset defined by values, guided by principles, and manifested through
            many different practices. Agile practitioners select practices based on their needs.




                 Figure 2-3. The Relationship Between the Agile Manifesto Values, Principles, and Common Practices



   As shown in Figure 2-3, the model, inspired by Ahmed Sidky, articulates agile as a mindset defined by the Agile
Manifesto values, guided by the Agile Manifesto principles, and enabled by various practices. It is worth noting that
while the term "agile" became popularized after the Manifesto, the approaches and techniques being used by project
teams today existed before the Agile Manifesto by many years and, in some cases, decades.




                                                                                                                     Section 2

      Agile approaches and agile methods are umbrella terms that cover a                     Is agile an approach, a method, a

   In general, there are two strategies to fulfill agile values and principles. The first is to adopt a formal agile approach,
intentionally designed and proven to achieve desired results. Then take time to learn and understand the agile approaches
before changing or tailoring them. Premature and haphazard tailoring can minimize the effects of the approach and thus
limit benefits. (See Appendix X2 for Tailoring Considerations).
   The second strategy is to implement changes to project practices in a manner that fits the project context to achieve
progress on a core value or principle. Use timeboxes to create features, or specific techniques to iteratively refine
features. Consider dividing up one large project into several releases, if that works for the specific project context.
Implement changes that will help the project succeed--the changes do not need to be part of the organization's formal
practices. The end goal is not to be agile for its own sake, but rather to deliver a continuous flow of value to customers
and achieve better business outcomes.



2.3 LEAN AND THE KANBAN METHOD
   One way to think about the relationship between lean, agile, and the Kanban Method is to consider agile and the
Kanban Method as descendants of lean thinking. In other words, lean thinking is a superset, sharing attributes with
agile and Kanban.
   This shared heritage is very similar and focuses on delivering value, respect for people, minimizing waste, being
transparent, adapting to change, and continuously improving. Project teams sometimes find it useful to blend various
methods--whatever works for the organization or team is what should be done regardless of its origin. The objective is
the best outcome regardless of the approach used.
    The Kanban Method is inspired by the original lean-manufacturing system and used specifically for knowledge work.
It emerged in the mid-2000s as an alternative to the agile methods that were prevalent at the time.




                                                                                                                   Section 2
12
   The Kanban Method is less prescriptive than some agile approaches and less disruptive, as it is the original "start-
where-you-are" approach. Project teams can begin applying the Kanban Method with relative ease and progress toward
other agile approaches if that is what they deem necessary or appropriate. For more details on the Kanban Method, see
Annex A3 on Overview of Agile and Lean Frameworks.
CASE




               There is and probably always will be a lot of discussion around the Kanban Method and whether
           it belongs to the lean or agile movement. It was conceived in and around lean manufacturing,
           but is widely used in agile settings.




2.4 UNCERTAINTY, RISK, AND LIFE CYCLE SELECTION
  Some projects have considerable uncertainty around project requirements and how to fulfill those requirements using
current knowledge and technology. These uncertainties can contribute to high rates of change and project complexity.
These characteristics are illustrated in Figure 2-5.
   As project uncertainty increases, so too does the risk of rework and the need to use a different approach. To mitigate
the impact of these risks, teams select life cycles that allow them to tackle projects with high amounts of uncertainty
via small increments of work.
   Teams can verify their work when they use small increments and can change what they do next. When teams deliver
small increments, they are better able to understand the true customer requirements faster and more accurately than
with a static written specification.

   difficulty. However, as the uncertainty in the project increases, the likelihood of changes, wasted work, and rework also
   increases, which is costly and time consuming.






                                                                                                                                                          Section 2

     Some teams have evolved project life cycles to use iterative and incremental approaches. Many teams discover that
   when they explore the requirements iteratively and deliver more often incrementally, the teams adapt to changes more
   easily. These iterative and incremental approaches reduce waste and rework because the teams gain feedback. These
   approaches use:

                 What do simple, complicated, and complex projects mean? Consider large projects, such as the
              Boston Big Dig construction project. On the surface, the project seemed fairly straightforward: move
              the elevated highway underground. There was high agreement on the requirements (see the Y axis in
              Figure 2-5). There was low uncertainty on how the project would proceed until the project started. And,





              as is the case for many large projects, the project encountered surprises along the way.





                  When a team works on a project where there is little opportunity for interim deliverables or little
      T IP




              opportunity for prototyping, the team most likely will use a predictive life cycle to manage it. The team can
              adapt to what it discovers, but will not be able to use agile approaches to manage the iterative discovery
              of requirements or incremental deliverables for feedback.

                  The Big Dig project was not simple by any means. However, many projects that start out in the lower
              left part of the Stacey Complexity Model have no real means of moving to other approaches. Assess the
              project, both in the requirements and the means of delivery, to determine the best approach for the life
              cycle of the project.




                                                                                                                              15
     These iterative, incremental, and agile approaches work well for projects that involve new or novel tools, techniques,
   materials, or application domains. (Refer to Section 3 on Life Cycle Selection). They also work well for projects that:
         Require research and development;
        uu

         Have high rates of change;
        uu

         Have unclear or unknown requirements, uncertainty, or risk; or
        uu

         Have a final goal that is hard to describe.
        uu

      By building a small increment and then testing and reviewing it, the team can explore uncertainty at a low cost in
   a short time, reduce risk, and maximize business value delivery. This uncertainty may be centered on suitability and
   requirements (is the right product being built?); technical feasibility and performance (can this product be built this
   way?); or process and people (is this an effective way for the team to work?). All three of these characteristics--product
   specification, production capability, and process suitability--typically have elements of high uncertainty.
      However, iterative and incremental approaches have their limits of applicability. When both technology
   uncertainty and requirements uncertainty are very high (the top right of Figure 2-5), the project moves beyond
   complex to chaotic. In order for the project to become reliably possible, it needs one of the variables (uncertainty
   or disagreement) to be contained.

   It is important to note that all projects have these characteristics--no project is completely devoid of considerations
around requirements, delivery, change, and goals. A project's inherent characteristics determine which life cycle is the
best fit for that project.
  Another way to understand how project life cycles vary is by using a continuum ranging from predictive cycles on one
end, to agile cycles on the other end, with more iterative or incremental cycles in the middle.
   Figure X3-1 of Appendix X3 of the PMBOK(R) Guide - Sixth Edition displays the continuum as a flat line. This view
emphasizes the shifting of project characteristics from one end to the other. Another way to visualize the continuum is
with a two-dimensional square, as shown in Figure 3-1.

         approaches, they iterate over the product to create finished deliverables. The team gains early feedback and

         project may provide an earlier return on investment because the team delivers the highest value work first.

       A key thing to remember about           Predictive life cycles expect to take advantage of high certainty around
   life cycles is that each of them         firm requirements, a stable team, and low risk. As a result, project activities
   share the element of planning.           often execute in a serial manner, as shown in Figure 3-2.
   What differentiates a life cycle is
                                               In order to achieve this approach, the team requires detailed plans to

   3.1.2 CHARACTERISTICS OF ITERATIVE LIFE CYCLES
      Iterative life cycles improve the product or result through successive prototypes or proofs of concept. Each new
   prototype yields new stakeholder feedback and team insights. Then, the team incorporates the new information by
   repeating one or more project activities in the next cycle. Teams may use timeboxing on a given iteration for a few
   weeks, gather insights, and then rework the activity based on those insights. In that way, iterations help identify and
   reduce uncertainty in the project.
      Projects benefit from iterative life cycles when complexity is high, when the project incurs frequent changes, or when
   the scope is subject to differing stakeholders' views of the desired final product. Iterative life cycles may take longer
   because they are optimized for learning rather than speed of delivery.
     Figure 3-3 illustrates some elements of an iterative project life cycle for a single product delivery.

      For example, builders may want to show a finished room or floor of a
   building before they continue with the remainder of the building. In that case,
   they may complete a floor with fixtures, paint, and everything else intended
   for the finished floor before proceeding to the next floor. The customer
   is able to see and approve of the style, color, and other details, allowing
   adjustments to be made before further investments of time and money are
   made. This reduces potential rework and/or customer dissatisfaction.

3.1.4 CHARACTERISTICS OF AGILE LIFE CYCLES
   In an agile environment, the team expects requirements to change. The iterative and incremental approaches provide
feedback to better plan the next part of the project. However, in agile projects, incremental delivery uncovers hidden
or misunderstood requirements. Figure 3-5 illustrates two possible ways to achieve incremental delivery so the project
aligns with customer needs and can be adapted as necessary.

      NOTE: In flow, the time it takes to complete a feature is not the same for each feature.

                                                                                                                                            Section 3

  In iteration-based agile, the team works in iterations (timeboxes of equal duration) to deliver completed features.
The team works on the most important feature, collaborating as a team to finish it. Then the team works on the next
most important feature and finishes it. The team may decide to work on a few features at a time, but the team does
not address all of the work for the iteration at once (i.e., does not address all of the requirements, followed by all of the
analyses, etc.).
   In flow-based agile, the team pulls features from the backlog based on its capacity to start work rather than on
an iteration-based schedule. The team defines its workflow with columns on a task board and manages the work in
progress for each column. Each feature may take a different amount of time to finish. Teams keep work-in-progress
sizes small to better identify issues early and reduce rework should changes be required. Without iterations to define
planning and review points, the team and business stakeholders determine the most appropriate schedule for planning,
product reviews, and retrospectives.
   Agile life cycles are those that fulfill the principles of the Agile Manifesto. In particular, customer satisfaction increases
with early and continuous delivery of valuable products. Moreover, an incremental deliverable that is functional and
provides value is the primary measure of progress. Agile life cycles combine both iterative and incremental approaches
in order to adapt to high degrees of change and deliver project value more often.



3.1.5 AGILE SUITABILITY FILTERS
   Various assessment models exist to help determine the likely fit or gaps for using agile approaches. These models
assess project and organizational factors associated with adoption and suitability and then provide scores indicating
alignment or potential risk areas. Appendix X3 provides a synthesis of popular assessment models for use as an agile
suitability filter.

   3.1.7 COMBINED AGILE AND PREDICTIVE APPROACHES
     Another approach is to use a combination of agile and predictive approaches throughout the life cycle.


                         Agile                               Agile                                  Agile

                             Figure 3-7. A Combined Agile and Predictive Approach Used Simultaneously



      In Figure 3-7, a combination of both predictive and agile approaches are used in the same project. Perhaps the team is
   incrementally transitioning to agile and using some approaches like short iterations, daily standups, and retrospectives,
   but other aspects of the project such as upfront estimation, work assignment, and progress tracking are still following
   predictive approaches.
      Using both predictive and agile approaches is a common scenario. It would be misleading to call the approach agile
   since it clearly does not fully embody the agile mindset, values, and principles. However, it would also be inaccurate to
   call it predictive since it is a hybrid approach.






                                                                                                                         27
3.1.8 PREDOMINANTLY PREDICTIVE APPROACH WITH SOME AGILE COMPONENTS
   Figure 3-8 shows a small agile element within a chiefly predictive project. In this case, a portion of the project with
uncertainty, complexity, or opportunity for scope creep is being tackled in an agile way, but the remainder of the project
is being managed using predictive approaches. An example of this approach would be an engineering firm that is
building a facility with a new component.

   While the majority of the project may be routine and predictable, like many other facility projects the organization
has undertaken before, this project incorporates a new roofing material. The contractor may plan for some small-scale
installation trials on the ground first to determine the best installation method and to uncover issues early while there is
plenty of time to solve them and incrementally improve processes through experimentation and adaptation.



3.1.9 A LARGELY AGILE APPROACH WITH A PREDICTIVE COMPONENT
   Figure 3-9 depicts a largely agile approach with a predictive component. This approach might be used when a
particular element is non-negotiable or not executable using an agile approach. Examples include integrating an external
component developed by a different vendor that cannot or will not partner in a collaborative or incremental way. A single
integration is required after the component is delivered.

   3.1.11 HYBRID LIFE CYCLES AS TRANSITION STRATEGY
      Many teams are not able to make the switch to agile ways of working overnight. Agile techniques look and feel
   very different to those who are accustomed to and have been successful in a predictive environment. The larger the
   organization and the more moving parts, the longer it will take to transition. For that reason, it makes sense to plan a
   gradual transition.
      A gradual transition involves adding more iterative techniques to improve learning and alignment among teams and
   stakeholders. Later, consider adding more incremental techniques to accelerate value and return on investment to
   sponsors. This combination of various approaches is considered a hybrid approach.
      Try these new techniques on a less risky project with a medium- to low-degree of uncertainty. Then, when the
   organization is successful with a hybrid approach, try more complex projects that require more of those techniques to
   be added. This is a way to tailor the progressive hybrid transition to the organization's situation and specific risks and
   the team's readiness to adapt and embrace the changes.

      Agile teams rarely limit their practices to one agile approach. Each project      As an example of tailoring agile

   4.1 START WITH AN AGILE MINDSET
      Managing a project using an agile approach requires that the project team adopt an agile mindset. The answers to
   the following questions will help to develop an implementation strategy:
       How can the project team act in an agile manner?
      uu

       What can the team deliver quickly and obtain early feedback to benefit the next delivery cycle?
      uu

       How can the team act in a transparent manner?

       How can a servant-leadership approach benefit the achievement of the team's goals?
      uu



   4.2 SERVANT LEADERSHIP EMPOWERS THE TEAM
      Agile approaches emphasize servant leadership as a way to empower teams. Servant leadership is the practice of
   leading through service to the team, by focusing on understanding and addressing the needs and development of team
   members in order to enable the highest possible team performance.
      The role of a servant leader is to facilitate the team's discovery and definition of agile. Servant leaders practice and





   radiate agile. Servant leaders approach project work in this order:





       Purpose. Work with the team to define the "why" or purpose so they can engage and coalesce around the goal
      uu
          for the project. The entire team optimizes at the project level, not the person level.
       People. Once the purpose is established, encourage the team to create an environment where everyone can
      uu
          succeed. Ask each team member to contribute across the project work.
       Process. Do not plan on following the "perfect" agile process, but instead look for the results. When a cross-
      uu
          functional team delivers finished value often and reflects on the product and process, the teams are agile. It does
          not matter what the team calls its process.




                                                                                                                           33
   The following characteristics of servant leadership enable project leaders to become more agile and facilitate the
team's success:
      Promoting self-awareness;
     uu

      Listening;
     uu

      Serving those on the team;
     uu

      Helping people grow;
     uu

      Coaching vs. controlling;
     uu

      Promoting safety, respect, and trust; and
     uu

      Promoting the energy and intelligence of others.
     uu

   Servant leadership is not unique to agile. But once having practiced it, servant leaders can usually see how well
servant leadership integrates into the agile mindset and value.
   When leaders develop their servant leadership or facilitative skills, they are more likely to become agile. As a result,
servant leaders can help their teams collaborate to deliver value faster.
  Successful agile teams embrace the growth mindset, where people believe they can learn new skills. When the team
and the servant leaders believe they can all learn, everyone becomes more capable.



4.2.1 SERVANT LEADER RESPONSIBILITIES
   Servant leaders manage relationships to build communication and coordination within the team and across the
organization. These relationships help the leaders navigate the organization to support the team. This kind of support
helps to remove impediments and facilitates the team to streamline its processes. Because servant leaders understand
agile and practice a specific approach to agile, they can assist in fulfilling the team's needs.




                                                                                                                 Section 4

4.2.1.1 SERVANT LEADERS FACILITATE

   When project managers act as servant leaders, the emphasis shifts from "managing coordination" to "facilitating
collaboration." Facilitators help everyone do their best thinking and work. Facilitators encourage the team's participation,
understanding, and shared responsibility for the team's output. Facilitators help the team create acceptable solutions.
   Servant leaders promote collaboration and conversation within the team and between teams. For example, a
servant leader helps to expose and communicate bottlenecks inside and between teams. Then the teams resolve
those bottlenecks.
   Additionally, a facilitator encourages collaboration through interactive meetings, informal dialog, and knowledge
sharing. Servant leaders do this by becoming impartial bridge-builders and coaches, rather than by making decisions
for which others should be responsible.

4.2.1.2 SERVANT LEADERS REMOVE ORGANIZATIONAL IMPEDIMENTS

   The first value of the Agile Manifesto is individuals and interactions over processes and tools. What better responsibility
for a servant leader to take on than to take a hard look at processes that are impeding a team's or organization's
agility and work to streamline them? For example, if a department requires extensive documentation, the role of the
servant leader could be to work with that department to review required documentation, assist with creating a shared
understanding of how agile deliverables meet those requirements, and evaluate the amount of documentation required
so teams are spending more time delivering a valuable product instead of producing exhaustive documentation.
   Servant leaders should also look at other processes that are lengthy, causing bottlenecks and impeding a team's or
organization's agility. Examples of processes or departments that may need to be addressed include finance, change
control boards, or audits. Servant leaders can partner and work with others to challenge them to review their processes
to support agile teams and leaders. For example, what good is it for the team to deliver working product every 2 weeks
only to have the product fall into a queue or process that could take 6 or more weeks to release due to lengthy release
processes? Far too many organizations have these "bottleneck" processes that prevent teams from quickly delivering
valuable products or services. The servant leader has the ability to change or remove these organizational impediments
to support delivery teams.




                                                                                                                           35

         team members gain confidence, take on larger roles, and contribute at higher levels within their organizations. A
         key role of the servant leader is to nurture and grow team members through and beyond their current roles, even
         if that means losing them from the team.

4.2.2 ROLE OF THE PROJECT MANAGER IN AN AGILE ENVIRONMENT
  The role of the project manager in an agile project is somewhat of an unknown, because many agile frameworks
and approaches do not address the role of the project manager. Some agile practitioners think the role of a project
manager is not needed, due to self-organizing teams taking on the former responsibilities of the project manager.
However, pragmatic agile practitioners and organizations realize that project managers can add significant value in
many situations. The key difference is that their roles and responsibilities look somewhat different.
   TIP




                The value of project managers is not in their position, but in their ability to make everyone else better.




                                                                                                                             37
4.2.3 PROJECT MANAGERS USE SERVANT LEADERSHIP
   The PMBOK(R) Guide - Sixth Edition, defines the project manager as "the person assigned by the performing
organization to lead the team that is responsible for achieving the project objectives."
   Many project managers are accustomed to being at the center of coordination for the project, tracking and
representing the team's status to the rest of the organization. This approach was fine when projects were decomposed
into siloed functions.
   However, in high-change projects, there is more complexity than one person can manage. Instead, cross-functional
teams coordinate their own work and collaborate with the business representative (the product owner).
   When working on an agile project, project managers shift from being the center to serving the team and the
management. In an agile environment, project managers are servant leaders, changing their emphasis to coaching
people who want help, fostering greater collaboration on the team, and aligning stakeholder needs. As a servant leader,
project managers encourage the distribution of responsibility to the team: to those people who have the knowledge to
get work done.



4.3 TEAM COMPOSITION
   A core tenet in both the values and the principles of the Agile Manifesto is the importance of individuals and
interactions. Agile optimizes the flow of value, emphasizing rapid feature delivery to the customer, rather than on how
people are "utilized."

   4.3.1 AGILE TEAMS
      Agile teams focus on rapid product development so they can obtain feedback. In practice, the most effective agile
   teams tend to range in size from three to nine members. Ideally, agile teams are colocated in a team space. Team
   members are 100% dedicated to the teams. Agile encourages self-managing teams, where team members decide who
   will perform the work within the next period's defined scope. Agile teams thrive with servant leadership. The leaders
   support the teams' approach to their work.
     Cross-functional agile teams produce functional product increments frequently. That is because the teams collectively
   own the work and together have all of the necessary skills to deliver completed work.
      Regardless of the overall agile approach, the more a team limits its work in progress, the more likely its members
   can collaborate to expedite work across the board. Team members in successful agile teams work to collaborate in
   various ways (such as pairing, swarming, and mobbing) so they do not fall into the trap of mini-waterfalls instead of
   collaborative work. Mini-waterfalls occur when the team addresses all of the requirements in a given period, then
   attempts to do all of the design, then moves on to do all of the building. Using this scenario, at some point in the building
   or the testing following the building, the team may realize it had assumptions that are no longer valid. In this case, the
   team wasted time in addressing all of the requirements. Instead, when team members collaborate to produce a small
   number of features across the board, they learn as they proceed and deliver smaller finished features.
     Agile projects benefit from project team structures that improve collaboration within and among the teams. Table 4-1
   shows how collaborative team members boost productivity and facilitate innovative problem solving.

     In agile, three common roles are used:
      Cross-functional team members,
     uu

      Product owner, and
     uu

      Team facilitator.
     uu

     Table 4-2 describes these team roles.

                   Role                                             Description

   Cross-functional team member   Cross-functional teams consist of team members with all the skills necessary to
                                  produce a working product. In software development, cross-functional teams
                                  are typically comprised of designers, developers, testers, and any other required
                                  roles. The cross-functional development teams consist of professionals who
                                  deliver potentially releasable product on a regular cadence. Cross-functional
                                  teams are critical because they can deliver finished work in the shortest
                                  possible time, with higher quality, without external dependencies.

   Product owner                  The product owner is responsible for guiding the direction of the product.
                                  Product owners rank the work based on its business value. Product owners work
                                  with their teams daily by providing product feedback and setting direction on
                                  the next piece of functionality to be developed/delivered. That means the work
                                  is small, often small enough to be described on one index card.
                                  The product owner works with stakeholders, customers, and the teams to define
                                  the product direction. Typically, product owners have a business background
                                  and bring deep subject matter expertise to the decisions. Sometimes, the
                                  product owner requests help from people with deep domain expertise, such as
                                  architects, or deep customer expertise, such as product managers. Product
                                  owners need training on how to organize and manage the flow of work through
                                  the team.
                                  In agile, the product owners create the backlog for and with the team. The
                                  backlog helps the teams see how to deliver the highest value without
                                  creating waste.
                                  A critical success factor for agile teams is strong product ownership. Without
                                  attention to the highest value for the customer, the agile team may create
                                  features that are not appreciated, or otherwise insufficiently valuable, therefore
                                  wasting effort.

   Team facilitator               The third role typically seen on agile teams is of a team facilitator, a servant
                                  leader. This role may be called a project manager, scrum master, project team
                                  lead, team coach, or team facilitator.
                                  All agile teams need servant leadership on the team. People need time to build
                                  their servant leadership skills of facilitation, coaching, and impediment removal.
                                  Initially, many organizations invite external agile coaches to help them when
                                  their internal coaching capability is not yet fully developed.





                                  External coaches have the advantage of experience, but the disadvantage of
                                  weak relationships in the client organization. Internal coaches, on the other





                                  hand, have strong relationships in their organization, but may lack the breadth
                                  of experience that would make them highly effective.




                                                                                                                       41

      Some people have deep                way. However, many successful agile teams are made up of generalizing

4.3.4 TEAM STRUCTURES
   Teams have adopted agile principles and practices across many industries. They organize people into cross-functional
teams to iteratively develop working products.




              The core team assembled to write this practice guide had varied backgrounds--some
           represented PMI and some represented Agile Alliance. They were self-organizing and worked in
CASE




           increments to complete the work. PMI assembled a group of subject matter experts to inspect
           the work, and this allowed the team to incorporate feedback and improve the product as it was
           developed. However the core team was not representative of a typical agile team because its
           members' time was not 100% dedicated to this endeavor.




   Some organizations have been able to create colocated, cross-functional teams; others have a different situation.
Instead of having all team members colocated, some organizations have distributed or dispersed teams. Distributed
teams have cross-functional teams in different locations. Dispersed teams may have each team member working in a
completely different location, either in an office or from home. While these arrangements are not ideal due to increased
communication costs, they may still be workable.




                                                                                                                     43
    In one large, U.S.-based financial institution there was a program with a set of teams where the team members
were based on the East Coast of the United States and several locations throughout India. When the team first started,
it was one large dispersed team (UX, analysts, developers, and testers) doing a "follow the sun"2 development practice
where some working time overlapped across the team members to do warm hand-offs with the work. Team members
conducted daily standups together and used webcams to include all team members. Key roles (analysts, product owners,
UX designers, and development leads) in the U.S. would come in early to answer any questions from their India-based
team members and help to resolve impediments.
   As the product started getting larger, and more funding came through, they decided to break into five smaller teams.
To do this, they decided to build colocated, distributed teams in various locations. They made the decision to build cross-
functional, colocated teams in each of these locations consisting of developers and testers.
   They also had a core set of analysts, based in the two U.S. locations, who worked with their U.S.-based product
manager and product owners and then worked with each of the teams, respectively. Although they had some structure
in place where they conducted product reviews as an entire program, most of the other activities were conducted at a
team level, based on what worked best for each team, to allow them to self-organize.




4.3.5 DEDICATED TEAM MEMBERS
  What happens when the team members' time is not 100% dedicated to the team? While this condition is not ideal,
unfortunately, it sometimes cannot be avoided.
   The key problem with having someone invest only a capacity of 25% or 50% on the team is that they will multitask
and task switch. Multitasking reduces the throughput of the team's work and impacts the team's ability to predict
delivery consistently.




               Multitasking slows the progress of the entire team, because team members waste time context
     T IP




            switching and/or waiting for each other to finish other work. When people are 100% dedicated to the
            team, the team has the fastest possible throughput.




    A follow-the-sun development process is one where work is handed off at the end of every day from one site to the
     2

next, many time zones away in order to speed up product development.

                                                                                                                  Section 4
44
  People experience productivity losses somewhere between 20% and 40% when task switching. The loss increases
exponentially with the number of tasks.
   When a person multitasks between two projects, that person is not 50% on each project. Instead, due to the cost of
task switching, the person is somewhere between 20% and 40% on each project.
  People are more likely to make mistakes when they multitask. Task-switching consumes working memory and
people are less likely to remember their context when they multitask.
  When everyone on the team is 100% allocated to one project, they can continuously collaborate as a team, making
everyone's work more effective.




               Since core team members developing this practice guide cannot dedicate 100% of their
           capacity to the team's efforts, their throughput is substantially lower than what it might be
           if they could afford to collocate and invest their attention full-time to the project. However,
CASE




           while it is economically viable to collaborate, even if dispersed and operating at a fraction of
           their full capacity, it is not feasible to colocate and focus at full capacity. Therefore, the team
           identified their dispersion as a potential risk. The team tracks and monitors the progress of
           their work through the use of collaborative tools and adjusts assignments based on individual
           capacity accordingly.




  See Table A1-2 on Project Management Process Group and Knowledge Area Mapping for more tips on teams in agile
environments, specifically the processes in the Project Resource Management Knowledge Area.




              Not all teams have all the roles that they need. For example, some teams need support from database
           administrators or research analysts. When a team has temporarily assigned specialists, it is important
   T IP




           to ensure that everyone has the same set of expectations. Is this specialist 100% allocated to the team
           and for how long? Set expectations with everyone (the specialist and the team) to clarify the level of
           commitment so the team can deliver. Part-time assignments create risks for the project.




                                                                                                                     45
4.3.6 TEAM WORKSPACES
   Teams need a space in which they can work together, to understand their state as a team, and to collaborate. Some
agile teams all work in one room together. Some teams have a team workspace for their standups and charts, and work
on their own in cubicles or offices.
   While companies are moving toward open, collaborative work environments, organizations also need to create quiet
spaces for workers who need uninterrupted time to think and work. Therefore, companies are designing their offices to
balance common and social areas (sometimes called "caves and common") with quiet areas or private spaces where
individuals can work without being interrupted.
   When teams have geographically distributed members, the team decides how much of their workplace is virtual and
how much is physical. Technology such as document sharing, video conferencing, and other virtual collaboration tools
help people collaborate remotely.
   Geographically distributed teams need virtual workspaces. In addition, consider getting the team together in person
at regular intervals so the team can build trust and learn how to work together.
  Some techniques to consider for managing communication in dispersed teams are fishbowl windows and
remote pairing:
      Create a fishbowl window by setting up long-lived video conferencing links between the various locations in
     uu
            which the team is dispersed. People start the link at the beginning of a workday, and close it at the end. In
            this way, people can see and engage spontaneously with each other, reducing the collaboration lag otherwise
            inherent in the geographical separation.
      Set up remote pairing by using virtual conferencing tools to share screens, including voice and video links. As
     uu
            long as the time zone differences are accounted for, this may prove almost as effective as face-to-face pairing.




                  Form teams by bringing people with different skills from different functions together. Educate managers
     T IP




                and leaders about the agile mindset and engage them early in the agile transformation.




                                                                                                                            Section 4

   4.3.7 OVERCOMING ORGANIZATIONAL SILOS
     The best place to start when forming agile teams is by building a foundational trust and a safe work environment to
   ensure that all team members have an equal voice and can be heard and considered. This, along with building the agile
   mindset is the underlying success factor--all other challenges and risks can be mitigated.
      Often, siloed organizations create impediments for forming cross-functional agile teams. The team members
   needed to build the cross-functional teams typically report to different managers and have different metrics by which
   managers measure their performance. Managers need to focus on flow efficiency (and team-based metrics) rather
   than resource efficiency.
      To overcome organizational silos, work with the various managers of these team members and have them dedicate the
   necessary individuals to the cross-functional team. This not only creates team synergy but also allows the organization
   to see how leveraging its people will optimize the project or product being built.
     For more information about teams see Appendix X2 on Attributes that Influence Tailoring.






                 As an agile project leader, first focus on how you can create a team that is cross-functional and 100%
      T IP




              dedicated to one team. Even if it means just getting key team members, such as the developers and testers,
              to work and communicate together on a daily basis, that is a step in the right direction toward agility.




                                                                                                                           47

    IMPLEMENTING AG I LE:
    D E LIVER I NG IN A N AG I LE ENV I RONM ENT


   5.1 CHARTER THE PROJECT AND THE TEAM
      Every project needs a project charter so the project team knows why this project matters, where the team is headed
   and what the project objective is. However, the project charter itself may not be enough for the team. Agile teams
   require team norms and an understanding of how to work together. In that case, the team might need a team charter.
     The chartering process helps the team learn how to work together and coalesce around the project.
     At a minimum, for an agile project, the team needs the project vision or purpose and a clear set of working agreements.
   An agile project charter answers these questions:
       Why are we doing this project? This is the project vision.
      uu

       Who benefits and how? This may be part of the project vision and/or project purpose.
      uu

       What does done mean for the project? These are the project's release criteria.
      uu

       How are we going to work together? This explains the intended flow of work.
      uu

     A servant leader may facilitate the chartering process. A team can coalesce by working together, and the project
   charter is a great way to start working. In addition, team members may want to collaborate to understand how they will
   work together.






                                                                                                                         49
   Teams do not need a formal process for chartering as long as the teams understand how to work together. Some
teams benefit from a team chartering process. Here are some chartering ideas for team members to use as a basis for
their social contract:
      Team values, such as sustainable pace and core hours;
     uu

      Working agreements, such as what "ready" means so the team can take in work; what "done" means so the
     uu
         team can judge completeness consistently; respecting the timebox; or the use of work-in-process limits;
      Ground rules, such as one person talking in a meeting; and
     uu

      Group norms, such as how the team treats meeting times.
     uu

     The servant leader together with the team may decide to address other behaviors.
   Remember that the team's social contract--its team charter--is how the team members interact with each other.
The goal of the team charter is to create an agile environment in which team members can work to the best of their
ability as a team.



5.2 COMMON AGILE PRACTICES
     Sections 5.2.1 through 5.2.8 describe a few of the most common agile project practices.



5.2.1 RETROSPECTIVES
    The single most important practice is the retrospective because it allows the team to learn about, improve, and adapt
its process.
   Retrospectives help the team learn from its previous work on the product and its process. One of the principles
behind the Agile Manifesto is: "At regular intervals, the team reflects on how to become more effective, then tunes and
adjusts its behavior accordingly."




                                                                                                               Section 5
50
   Many teams use iterations--especially 2-week iterations--because the iteration prompts a demonstration and a
retrospective at the end. However, the team does not need iterations in order to retrospect. Team members may decide
to retrospect at these key times:
    When the team completes a release or ships something. It does not have to be a monumental increment. It can
   uu
       be any release, no matter how small.
    When more than a few weeks have passed since the previous retrospective.
   uu

    When the team appears to be stuck and completed work is not flowing through the team.
   uu

    When the team reaches any other milestone.
   uu

    Teams benefit from allocating enough time to learn, either from an interim retrospective or an end-of-the-project
retrospective. Teams need to learn about their work product and work process. For example, some teams have trouble
finishing work. When teams plan enough time, they can structure their retrospective to gather data, process that data,
and decide what to try later as an experiment.
  First and foremost, a retrospective is not about blame; the retrospective is a time for the team to learn from previous
work and make small improvements.
   The retrospective is about looking at the qualitative (people's feelings) and quantitative (measurements) data, then
using that data to find root causes, designing countermeasures, and developing action plans. The project team may end
up with many action items to remove impediments.
   Consider limiting the number of action items to the team's capacity to address improvement in the upcoming iteration
or work period. Trying to improve too many things at once and not finishing any of them is much worse than planning to
complete fewer items and successfully completing all of them. Then, when time allows, the team can work on the next
improvement opportunity on the list. When the team selects the improvements, decide how to measure the outcomes.
Then, in the next time period, measure the outcomes to validate success or failure of each improvement.
   A facilitator from the team leads them through an activity to rank the importance of each improvement item. Once the
improvement items are ranked by the team, the team chooses the appropriate number to work on for the next iteration
(or adds work to the flow if flow-based).




                                                                                                                      51
5.2.2 BACKLOG PREPARATION
   The backlog is the ordered list of all the work, presented in story form, for a team. There is no need to create all of the
stories for the entire project before the work starts--only enough to understand the first release in broad brushstrokes
and then sufficient items for the next iteration.
    Product owners (or a product owner value team that includes the product manager and all relevant product owners
for that area of the product,) might produce a product roadmap to show the anticipated sequence of deliverables over
time. The product owner replans the roadmap based on what the team produces. (See Appendix X3 on Agile Suitability
Filter Tools for examples of roadmaps.)



5.2.3 BACKLOG REFINEMENT
   In iteration-based agile, the product owner often works with the team to prepare some stories for the upcoming
iteration during one or more sessions in the middle of the iteration. The purpose of these meetings is to refine enough
stories so the team understands what the stories are and how large the stories are in relation to each other.
     There is no consensus on how long the refinement should be. There is a continuum of:
      Just-in-time refinement for flow-based agile. The team takes the next card off the to-do column and discusses it.
     uu

      Many iteration-based agile teams use a timeboxed 1-hour discussion midway through a 2-week iteration. (The
     uu
            team selects an iteration duration that provides them frequent-enough feedback.)
      Multiple refinement discussions for iteration-based agile teams. Teams can use this when they are new to the
     uu
            product, the product area, or the problem domain.




                   Consider using impact mapping to see how the product fits together. Under normal circumstances,
     T IP




                the product owner leads this work. A servant leader can facilitate any necessary meetings as a way of
                serving the project.




                                                                                                                        Section 5
52
  Refinement meetings allow the product owner to present story ideas to the team and for the team to learn about the
potential challenges or problems in the stories. If the product owner is unsure of the dependencies, the product owner
can request the team to spike the feature in order to understand the risks.
   There are many ways for the product owner to conduct backlog preparation and refinement meetings, including
for example:
    Encourage the team to work as triads of developer, tester, business analyst/product owner to discuss and write
   uu
      the story.
    Present the overall story concept to the team. The team discusses and refines it into as many stories as required.
   uu

    Work with the team to find various ways to explore and write the stories together, making sure all of the stories
   uu
      are small enough so the team can produce a steady flow of completed work. Consider becoming able to complete
      a story at least once a day.
   Teams often have a goal of spending not more than 1 hour per week refining stories for the next batch of work.
Teams want to maximize the time spent doing work as opposed to planning work. If the team needs to spend more than
1 hour per week refining stories, the product owner could be overpreparing, or the team may be lacking some critical
skills needed to evaluate and refine the work.



5.2.4 DAILY STANDUPS
   Teams use standups to microcommit to each other, uncover problems, and ensure the work flows smoothly through
the team.
  Timebox the standup to no longer than 15 minutes. The team "walks" the Kanban or task board in some way, and
anyone from the team can facilitate the standup.
  In iteration-based agile, everyone answers the following questions in a round-robin fashion:
    What did I complete since the last standup?
   uu

    What am I planning to complete between now and the next standup?
   uu

    What are my impediments (or risks or problems)?
   uu




                                                                                                                   53
  Questions like these generate answers that allow the team to self-organize and hold each other accountable for
completing the work they committed to the day before and throughout the iteration.
  Flow-based agile has a different approach to standups, focusing on the team's throughput. The team assesses the
board from right to left. The questions are:
      What do we need to do to advance this piece of work?
     uu

      Is anyone working on anything that is not on the board?
     uu

      What do we need to finish as a team?
     uu

      Are there any bottlenecks or blockers to the flow of work?
     uu

  One of the antipatterns typically seen in standups is they become status meetings. Teams who have traditionally
worked in a predictive environment may tend to fall into this antipattern since they are used to providing a status.
   Another antipattern typically seen in standups is that the team begins to solve problems as they become apparent.
Standups are for realizing there are problems--not for solving them. Add the issues to a parking lot, and then create
another meeting, which might be right after the standup, and solve problems there.
  Teams run their own standups. When run well, standups can be very useful, provided the nature of the team's
work requires intense collaboration. Make a conscious decision about when the team needs, or can effectively
use, standups.




                 Encourage any team member to facilitate the standup instead of a project manager or leader to ensure
     T IP




             it does not turn into a status meeting, but instead is used as a time for the team to self-organize and make
             commitments to each other.




                                                                                                                            Section 5
54
5.2.5 DEMONSTRATIONS/REVIEWS
  As the team completes the features usually in the form of user stories, the team periodically demonstrates the
working product. The product owner sees the demonstration and accepts or declines stories.
  In iteration-based agile, the team demonstrates all completed work items at the end of the iteration. In flow-
based agile, the team demonstrates completed work when it is time to do so, usually when enough features have
accumulated into a set that is coherent. Teams, including the product owner, need feedback to decide how early to
ask for product feedback.
   As a general guideline, demonstrate whatever the team has as a working product at least once every 2 weeks. That
frequency is enough for most teams, so team members can get feedback that prevents them from heading in a wrong
direction. That is also frequent enough so that the teams can keep the product development clean enough to build a
complete product as often as they want or need to.
  A fundamental part of what makes a project agile is the frequent delivery of a working product. A team that does
not demonstrate or release cannot learn fast enough and is likely not adopting agile techniques. The team may require
additional coaching to enable frequent delivery.



5.2.6 PLANNING FOR ITERATION-BASED AGILE
   Each team's capacity is different. Each product owner's typical story size is different. Teams consider their story size
so they do not try to commit to more stories than there is team capacity to complete within one iteration.
   When people are unavailable (e.g., holidays, vacations, or anything that prevents people from participating in the next
set of work), the product owner understands that the team has reduced capacity. The team will not be able to finish the
same amount of work as it finished in the previous time period. When teams have a reduced capacity, they will only
plan for work that meets that capacity.
   Teams estimate what they can complete, which is a measure of capacity (see Section 4.10 for examples). Teams
cannot predict with 100% certainty what they can deliver, as they cannot know the unexpected. When product owners
make the stories smaller and teams see progress in the form of a finished product, teams learn what they are able to
do for the future.
    Agile teams do not plan just once in one single chunk. Instead, agile teams plan a little, deliver, learn, and then replan
a little more in an ongoing cycle.
   TIP




               Draw the team's attention to the antipattern and help the team to discover how to improve its standups.




                                                                                                                           55
5.2.7 EXECUTION PRACTICES THAT HELP TEAMS DELIVER VALUE
     If the team does not pay attention to quality, it will soon become impossible to release anything rapidly.
   The following technical practices, many of which come from eXtreme Programming, may help the team to deliver at
their maximum speed:
      Continuous integration. Perform frequent incorporation of work into the whole, no matter the product, and then
     uu
         retest to determine that the entire product still works as intended.
      Test at all levels. Employ system-level testing for end-to-end information and unit testing for the building
     uu
         blocks. In between, understand if there is a need for integration testing and where. Teams find smoke testing
         helpful as a first look at whether the work product is any good. Teams have found that deciding when to run
         regression tests and which ones helps them maintain product quality with good build performance. Agile teams
         have a strong preference for automated tests so they can build and maintain a momentum of delivery.
      Acceptance Test-Driven Development (ATDD). In ATDD, the entire team gets together and discusses the
     uu
         acceptance criteria for a work product. Then the team creates the tests, which allows the team to write just
         enough code and automated tests to meet the criteria. For non-software projects, consider how to test the work
         as the team completes chunks of value.
      Test-Driven Development (TDD) and Behavior-Driven Development (BDD). Writing automated tests before
     uu
         writing/creating the product actually helps people design and mistake-proof the product. For non-software
         projects, consider how to "test-drive" the team's designs. Hardware and mechanical projects often use
         simulations for interim tests of their designs.
      Spikes (timeboxed research or experiments). Spikes are useful for learning and may be used in circumstances
     uu
         such as: estimation, acceptance criteria definition, and understanding the flow of a user's action through the
         product. Spikes are helpful when the team needs to learn some critical technical or functional element.




                                                                                                                  Section 5
56
5.2.8 HOW ITERATIONS AND INCREMENTS HELP DELIVER WORKING PRODUCT
   Iterations help a team create a cadence for delivery and many kinds of feedback. Teams produce increments of
value for delivery and feedback. The first part of this delivery is a demonstration. Teams receive feedback about how
the product looks and operates through a demo. Team members retrospect to see how they can inspect and adapt their
process to succeed.
   Demonstrations or reviews are a necessary part of the agile project flow. Schedule the demonstration as appropriate
for the team's delivery cadence.



5.3 TROUBLESHOOTING AGILE PROJECT CHALLENGES
   Agile approaches were born out of the need to solve issues associated with high rates of change, uncertainty, and
complexity on projects. Due to these origins, they contain a variety of tools and techniques for dealing with issues that
present problems in predictive approaches. Refer to Table 5-1.




               Teams should demo often for feedback and to show progress. Encourage the PMO and other interested
   T IP




            parties to watch demonstrations so the people deciding on the project portfolio can see the actual progress.




                                                                                                                           57

                      Pain Point                                        Troubleshooting Possibilities

     Unclear purpose or mission for the team            Agile chartering for purpose--vision, mission, and mission tests

     Unclear working agreements for the team            Agile chartering for alignment--values, principles, and working
                                                        agreements

     Unclear team context                               Agile chartering for context--boundaries, committed assets,
                                                        and prospective analysis

     Unclear requirements                               Help sponsors and stakeholders craft a product vision. Consider
                                                        building a product roadmap using specification by example, user
                                                        story mapping, and impact mapping. Bring the team and product
                                                        owner together to clarify the expectations and value of a
                                                        requirement. Progressively decompose roadmap into backlog of
                                                        smaller, concrete requirements.

     Poor user experience                               User experience design practices included in the development
                                                        team involve users early and often.

     Inaccurate estimation                              Reduce story size by splitting stories. Use relative estimation with
                                                        the entire team to estimate. Consider agile modeling or spiking
                                                        to understand what the story is.

     Unclear work assignments or work progress          Help the team learn that they self-manage their work. Consider
                                                        kanban boards to see the flow of work. Consider a daily standup
                                                        to walk the board and see what work is where.

     Team struggles with obstacles                      A servant leader can help clear these obstacles. If the team
                                                        doesn't know the options they have, consider a coach.
                                                        Sometimes, the team needs to escalate stories the team
                                                        or servant leader has not been able to remove.

     Work delays/overruns due to insufficiently         Product owner and team workshop stories together. Create
     refined product backlog items                      a definition of ready for the stories. Consider splitting stories
                                                        to use smaller stories.

   5.4 MEASUREMENTS IN AGILE PROJECTS
      Transitioning to agile means using different measurements. Using agile means looking at new metrics that matter to
   the team and to management. These metrics matter because they focus on customer value.
      One problem with status reporting is the team's ability to predict completion or to use traffic light status to describe
   the project. For instance, project leaders describe the project as "90% done." At that point the team tries to integrate the
   pieces into a product. The team discovers missing requirements or surprises, or finds that the product doesn't integrate
   the way they thought it would.
      The project is only partway done, and the traffic light status reporting does not reflect the real state. Too often, the
   project team realizes it will need just as much time to complete the remainder of the project. For too many projects, the
   team realizes they are--at most--10% done because of issues the team discovered.
      The problem with predictive measurements is that they often do not reflect reality. It often happens that a project
   status light is green up until 1 month before the release date; this is sometimes referred to as a watermelon project
   (green on the outside, red on the inside). Oftentimes project status lights turn red with seemingly no warnings, because
   there is no empirical data about the project until 1 month before the release date.
      Metrics for agile projects contain meaningful information that provide a historical track record, because agile
   projects deliver value (finished work) on a regular basis. Project teams can use such data for improved forecasts and
   decision making.
      Surrogate measurements such as percent done are less useful than empirical measurements such as finished
   features. See Section 4.10 for more information on value management. Agile helps teams see problems and issues so
   the team can diagnose and address them.
      In addition to quantitative measures, the team can consider collecting qualitative measures. Some of these qualitative
   measures focus on practices the team has chosen and assess how well the team uses those practices, for example,
   the business satisfaction with delivered features, the morale of the team; and anything else the team wants to track as
   a qualitative measure.

   Because learning is such a large part of the project, the team needs to balance uncertainty and provide value to the
customers. The team plans the next small part of the project. The team reports empirical data and replans further small
increments to manage the project uncertainty.
   Some iteration-based projects use burndown charts to see where the project is going over time. Figure 5-1 shows an
example of a burndown chart where the team planned to deliver 37 story points. Story points rate the relative work, risk,
and complexity of a requirement or story. Many agile teams use story points to estimate effort. The dotted burndown
line is the plan. In Figure 5-1, the team can see by Day 3 that they are at risk for that delivery.

                                    Figure 5-2. Burnup Chart for Showing Story Points Completed



      Burnup charts show the work completed. The two charts in Figures 5-1 and 5-2 are based on the same data, but
   displayed in two different ways. Teams may prefer how to see their data.
      When a team sees what it has not yet completed as it works through an iteration, the team may become dispirited and
   possibly rush to complete the work without meeting the acceptance criteria. However, the team could have any number
   of good reasons for not completing work as it expected. Burndowns show the effect of team members multitasking,
   stories that are too large, or team members out of the office.






                                                                                                                      63
      Especially with teams new to agile, the burnup will show changes in scope during the iteration. Burnups allow teams
   to see what they have accomplished, which helps the team proceed to the next piece of work.
      Whether teams use burndown or burnup charts, they see what they have completed as the iteration progresses. At
   the end of the iteration, they might base their next measure of capacity (how many stories or story points) on what they
   completed in this iteration. That allows the product owner along with the team to replan what the team is more likely to
   succeed in delivering in the next iteration.
       Velocity, the sum of the story point sizes for the features actually completed in this iteration, allows the team to plan
   its next capacity more accurately by looking at its historical performance.
      Flow-based agile teams use different measurements: lead time (the total time it takes to deliver an item, measured
   from the time it is added to the board to the moment it is completed), cycle time (the time required to process an item),
   and response time (the time that an item waits until work starts). Teams measure cycle time to see bottlenecks and
   delays, not necessarily inside the team.






                  Teams might discover it can take four to eight iterations to achieve a stable velocity. The teams need
        T IP




               the feedback from each iteration to learn about how they work and how to improve.

                                                                                                                  65
   Lead time is useful to understand cycle time from the first look at a particular feature to the length of time it took to
release it to the customer. The work in progress (WIP) limits at the top of each column, shown in boxes here, allows the
team to see how to pull work across the board. When the team has met its WIP limits, the team cannot pull work from
the left into the next column. Instead, the team works from the right-most full column and asks, "What do we do as a
team to move this work into the next column?"
   Each feature is unique, so its cycle time is unique. However, a product owner might notice that smaller features
have smaller cycle times. The product owner wants to see throughput, so the product owner creates smaller features
or works with the team to do so.
    Burnups, burndowns (capacity measures) and lead time, and cycle time (predictability measures) are useful for in-
the-moment measurements. They help a team understand how much more work they have and whether the team might
finish on time.
   Measuring story points is not the same as measuring completed stories or features. Some teams attempt to measure
story points without completing the actual feature or story. When teams measure only story points, they measure
capacity, not finished work, which violates the principle of "the primary measure of progress is working software" (or,
other product if not software).
  Each team has its own capacity. When a team uses story points, be aware that the number of story points a team can
complete in a given time is unique to that team.




                When teams depend on external people or groups, measure cycle time to see how long it takes for the
            team to complete the work. Measure lead time to see the external dependencies after the team completes

            its work. Teams can also measure the reaction time, the time from ready to the first column, to see how
            long it takes them--on average--to respond to new requests.

     When teams provide their own units of measure, teams are better able to assess and estimate and deliver their work.
   The downside of relative estimation is that there is no way to compare teams or add velocity across teams.
     The team can measure completed work in a feature burnup/burndown chart and in a product backlog burnup chart.
   These charts provide trends of completion over time, as shown in Figure 5-4.

      Feature burnup/burndown charts may show that requirements grew during the project. The features complete line
   shows that the team completes features at a regular pace. The total features line shows how the project's total features
   changed over time. The features remaining burndown line shows that the rate of feature completion varies. Every time
   features are added to the project, the burndown line changes.
     Earned value in agile is based on finished features, as shown in Figure 5-5. The product backlog burnup chart shows





   completed work compared to total expected work at interval milestones or iterations.

  A team can only finish one story at a time. To complete a large feature that contains several stories, the team will
have remaining stories to complete and may not complete that entire feature until several more time periods have
passed. The team can show its completed value with a product backlog burnup chart as shown in Figure 5-5.
   If a team needs to measure earned value, it can consider using this burnup chart in Figure 5-6 as an example: Note
that the left Y axis represents story points as scope, and the right Y axis represents the project spend.

      Traditional EVM metrics like schedule performance index (SPI) and cost performance index (CPI) can be easily
   translated into agile terms. For example, if the team planned to complete 30 story points in an iteration, but only
   completed 25 then the SPI is 25/30 or 0.83 (the team is working at only 83% of the rate planned). Likewise, CPI is
   the earned value (completed features value) to date divided by the actual costs to date or, as shown in Figure 5-6,





   $2.2M / $2.8M = 0.79. This means a result of only 79 cents on the dollar compared to plan (but of course this
   assumes that the prediction is still correct.)





                                                                                                                                                                                   69
   A cumulative flow diagram, illustrated in Figure 5-7, shows the work in progress across a board. If a team has many
stories waiting for test, the testing band will swell. Work accumulation can be seen at a glance.
   Teams have trouble with accumulating work: the team has work in progress instead of work completed. When teams
have a lot of work in progress, they delay their overall feature delivery. The longer it takes for a team to deliver, the more
pressure a team will have for yet more features in the same period of time.

      Every project exists in an organizational context. Cultures, structures,       Project agility is more effective
   and policies can influence both the direction and the outcome of any           and sustained as the organization
   project. These dynamics can challenge project leaders.                         adjusts to support it.
      While project leaders may not have the ability to change
   organizational dynamics as they see fit, they are expected to navigate
   those dynamics skillfully.
      This section explores the way the organization and in some circumstances,
   the project context, influences projects. Leaders can explore options for
   change, to increase project success.



   6.1 ORGANIZATIONAL CHANGE MANAGEMENT
       Organizational change management covers the skills and techniques for
   influencing changes that support agility.
      The PMI publication, Managing Change in Organizations: A Practice
   Guide [2], describes a comprehensive and holistic approach for successfully
   introducing meaningful change. The recommendations offered there include:





       Models for describing change dynamics,
      uu





       Framework for achieving change, and
      uu

       Application of change management practices at the project,
      uu
          program, and portfolio levels.
     Sections 6.1.1 and 6.1.2 explore the considerations of change
   management specific to an agile context.
     Figure 6-1 shows the relationship between these two topics.




                                                                                                                   71

6.1.1 DRIVERS FOR CHANGE MANAGEMENT
   All projects are about change. However, there are two key factors that further motivate the use of change management
practices in an agile context:
    Changes associated with accelerated delivery. Agile approaches emphasize delivering project outputs
   uu
       early and often. However, the receiving organization may not be fully prepared to incorporate those outputs
       at an increased pace. Accelerating delivery will test the organization's ability to accommodate that delivery.
       Successfully discovering and delivering a project's features is not enough. If the organization resists the project's
       output, then the targeted return on investment is delayed. Customer acceptance of and alignment with project
       outputs becomes even more prevalent in an agile environment.
    Changes associated with agile approaches. Organizations just beginning to use agile approaches also
   uu
       experience high degrees of change. Higher degrees of collaboration may require more frequent handoffs
       between teams, departments, or vendors. Decomposing work into iterative prototypes involves rework that
       could be viewed negatively. Leaders should consider change management techniques to address the hurdles of
       transitioning to the use of agile approaches.


6.1.2 READINESS FOR CHANGE
    Organizations beginning to use agile approaches should understand the relative compatibility of those methods
with their current approaches. Some organizations will have characteristics that more easily support agile principles
of cross-department collaboration, continuous learning, and evolving internal processes. Examples of these change-
friendly characteristics include:
    Executive management's willingness to change;
   uu

    Organization's willingness to shift the way it views, reviews, and assesses employees;
   uu

    Centralization or decentralization of project, program, and portfolio management functions;
   uu

    Focus on short-term budgeting and metrics versus long-term goals; and
   uu

    Talent management maturity and capabilities.
   uu




                                                                                                                         73
   Conversely, there are other institutional characteristics that may be roadblocks to achieving the changes associated
with organizational agility. Examples of these include:
      Work is decomposed into departmental silos, creating dependencies that prevent accelerated delivery instead of
     uu
        building cross-functional teams with guidance from centers of competencies.
      Procurement strategies are based on short-term pricing strategies, rather than long-term competencies.
     uu

      Leaders are rewarded for local efficiencies rather than end-to-end flow of project delivery or optimizing the whole
     uu
        (in regard to the organization).
      Employees are specialized contributors with limited tools or incentives to diversify their skills instead of building
     uu
        T-shaped specialists.
      Decentralized portfolios pull employees simultaneously onto too many projects at once instead of keeping them
     uu
        focused on one project at a time.
   The degree to which an organization is willing to review and modify these practices will determine how quickly
and effectively agile approaches can be adopted. However, in response to these organizational impediments to agility,
project leaders can try various approaches to accelerate a cultural compatibility for:
      Visible and active executive sponsorship,
     uu

      Change management practices, including communication and coaching,
     uu

      Progressively pacing the adoption of agile practices on a project-by-project basis
     uu

      Incremental introduction of agile practices to the team; and
     uu

      Leading by example by using agile techniques and practices where possible.

   6.2 ORGANIZATIONAL CULTURE                                                            "Culture eats strategy        for

       An organization's culture is its DNA--its core identity. Culture will always
   influence the use of agile approaches. Organizational culture runs along a            This statement stresses the
   continuum, from highly predictive plans to lean startup where everything is an     importance of people's commitment

                                                                                      passionate about the change, or

      Only in a safe, honest, and transparent environment can team members            the change.
   and leaders truly reflect on their successes to ensure their projects continue
   to advance, or apply lessons learned on failed projects so they do not fall
   back into the same patterns.



   6.2.2 ASSESSING CULTURE
      Every project finds itself in tension with competing aspirations. How can
   the team go fast without compromising quality? How can the team preserve
   flexibility while also hitting a firm date? Most importantly, how does the
   team satisfy and meet the requirements of the customer?
      Project leaders may feel their job is to meet every expectation of every
   stakeholder; but, when compelled to make a choice, there is often a priority
   depending on the culture and requirements of the organization's business
   environment. For example, a mobile telecom project has a greater bias





   for speed, where a government program may have a greater bias for
   generalization and stability.





                                                                                                                       75
    To navigate these dynamics, project leaders should take the time to assess where emphasis is most often applied
in the organization. Figure 6-2 illustrates what an assessment might look like. In this example, a project leader initiates
a conversation about organizational priorities with stakeholders, team members, and senior management. Those
priorities are then recorded as positions on a sliding scale between two extremes. The results are then used to find agile
techniques that best fit with those priorities.

                                   Figure 6-2. Example of Assessing Organizational Culture



   Several models exist for assessing such dynamics; however, the model or method used is not that important. It is
more critical that project leaders invest the effort to understand the forces that shape their context. Understanding
the organization and the industry requirements that an organization needs to satisfy allows for choosing the right
conversations, the right tradeoffs, and, especially, the right techniques.




                                                                                                                 Section 6
76
6.3 PROCUREMENT AND CONTRACTS
   As mentioned earlier in this practice guide, the Agile Manifesto values "customer collaboration over contract
negotiation." Many project failures stem from breakdowns in the customer-supplier relationship. Projects incur more
risk when those involved in the contract take the perspective of winners vs. losers. A collaborative approach is one that
pursues a shared-risk-reward relationship, where all sides win. Some contracting techniques that can formalize this
dynamic include the following:
    Multi-tiered structure. Rather than formalizing an entire contracting relationship in a single document, project
   uu
          parties can achieve more flexibility by describing different aspects in different documents. Mostly fixed items
          (e.g., warranties, arbitration) can be locked in a master agreement. Meanwhile, all parties list other items subject
          to change (e.g., services rates, product descriptions) in a schedule of services. The contract can reference them
          in the master services agreement. Finally, more dynamic items such as scope, schedule, and budget can be
          formalized in a lightweight statement of work. Isolating the more changing elements of a contract into a single
          document simplifies modifications and thus flexibility.
    Emphasize value delivered. Many vendor relationships are governed by fixed milestones or "phase gates"
   uu
          focused on intermediate artifacts, rather than a full deliverable of incremental business value. Often, these
          controls limit the use of feedback to improve the product. Instead, milestones and payment terms can be
          structured based on value-driven deliverables in order to enhance the project's agility.
    Fixed-price increments. Rather than lock an entire project scope and budget into a single agreement, a project
   uu
          can decompose the scope into fixed-price microdeliverables, such as user stories. For the customer, this gives
          more control over how the money is spent. For the supplier, it limits the financial risk of over-commitment to a
          single feature or deliverable.




               Culture versus Structure

                  Some people insist new organizational structures be installed before any cultural shift can begin.
               Others maintain the opposite--those new organizational structures are only superficial adjustments until
   T IP




               the collective culture moves in a meaningful direction. In reality, one cannot progress without the other.
               Project leaders wanting to achieve agility should consider the current and future states of both of these
               aspects in their organization.




                                                                                                                            77
      Not-to-exceed time and materials. Customers incur unwanted risk from a traditional time and materials
     uu
        approach. One alternative is to limit the overall budget to a fixed amount. This allows the customer to incorporate
        new ideas and innovations into the project not originally planned. When customers want to incorporate new
        ideas, they will have to manage to a given capacity, replacing original work with new work. Work should be
        closely monitored as hours allocated reach their limit. Also, additional contingency hours could be planned into
        the maximum budget if considered helpful.
      Graduated time and materials. Another alternative is a shared financial risk approach. In agile, the quality criteria
     uu
        are part of what done means. Therefore, the supplier can be rewarded with a higher hourly rate when delivery is
        earlier than the contracted deadline. Conversely, the supplier would suffer a rate reduction for late delivery.
      Early cancellation option. When an agile supplier delivers sufficient value with only half of the scope completed,
     uu
        the customer should not be bound to pay the remaining half if the customer no longer needs it. Instead, a contract
        can offer the customer to buy the remainder of the project for a cancellation fee. The customer limits budget
        exposure and the supplier earns positive revenue for services no longer required.
      Dynamic scope option. For those contracts with a fixed budget, a supplier may offer the customer the option
     uu
        to vary the project scope at specified points in the project. The customer can adjust features to fit the capacity.
        Then the customer can leverage innovation opportunities, while limiting the supplier's risk of over commitment.
      Team augmentation. Arguably the most collaborative contracting approach is to embed the supplier's services
     uu
        directly into the customer organization. Funding teams instead of a specific scope preserves the customer's
        strategic discretion on what work should actually be done.




                                                                                                                 Section 6
78
    Favor full-service suppliers. In order to diversify risk, customers may seek a multisupplier strategy. However,
   uu
       the temptation will be to contract the work such that each supplier does only one thing, which creates a web of
       dependencies before any usable service or product emerges. Instead, place an emphasis on engagements that
       deliver full value (as in the idea of completed independent feature sets).
   It is possible to create agile contracts. Agile is built on a synergy of collaboration and trust. The supplier can help by
delivering value early and often. The customer can help by providing timely feedback.



6.4 BUSINESS PRACTICES
   The willingness and ability to create new competences within an organization when the need arises is a mark of
organizational agility. These do not have to be earth-shattering changes and could be less disruptive in an organization
that is focused on agility and the results it provides. Transparency and open collaboration are absolutely key.
   As cross-functional teams deliver value, the teams and individuals might encounter problems with various support
functions in the organization.
   As team delivers value on a regular basis, finance departments may have the opportunity to capitalize the product
differently. If the team has contracts with other organizations, procurement departments may need to change those
contracts to help the other organizations deliver value frequently and synchronize with the team.
   Once teams start to work in a cohesive and cooperative manner, they will challenge internal management policies.
Human resources may notice individual incentives make less sense, and managers may struggle with the performance
appraisals of self-organizing employees. In each case, these are opportunities to review the degree to which existing
practices support agile ways of working.
  As organizations progress to greater agility, there will be obvious needs for additional business units to change the
way they interact and perform their responsibilities. The changes that have benefited other areas of the organization
should now be embraced so the effectiveness of the entire organization can be realized.




                                                                                                                          79
6.5 MULTITEAM COORDINATION AND DEPENDENCIES (SCALING)
  Many projects incur dependencies, even when they are not managed within a given program. For this reason, it is
necessary to have an understanding of how agile works within an existing program and portfolio management context.



6.5.1 FRAMEWORKS
   The guidance of the most widespread agile methods such as Scrum and eXtreme Programming focus on the activities
of a single, small, usually colocated, cross-functional team. While this is very useful for efforts that require a single
team, it may provide insufficient guidance for initiatives that require the collaboration of multiple agile teams in a
program or portfolio.
   A range of frameworks (such as the Scaled Agile Framework, Large Scale Scrum, and Disciplined Agile) and approaches
(e.g., Scrum of Scrums) have emerged to cater to just such circumstances. More details on these can be found in Annex A3.



6.5.2 CONSIDERATIONS
   There is more than one way to scale work. The team might need to scale the work of several agile projects into a
single agile program. Alternatively, the organization can design a structure that supports agile approaches across the
entire portfolio.
  For example, it is helpful to start small and learn as rapidly as possible what works well in the organizational context.
Teams can achieve successful outcomes even when everything is not completely transformed into an agile approach.
   Regardless of the approach, a critical success factor is the healthy agile team. If using an agile approach for a single
team is not successful, do not try to scale up to using it more broadly; instead, address the organizational impediments
that prevent teams from working in an agile way.
   The goal of large-scale agile projects is to coordinate the efforts of different teams to bring value to customers. There
is more than one way to do that. Teams may use a formal framework or apply agile thinking to adjust existing program
management practices.




                                                                                                                  Section 6

6.6 AGILE AND THE PROJECT MANAGEMENT OFFICE (PMO)
   The PMO exists to shepherd business value throughout the organization. It might do this by helping projects achieve
their goals. Sometimes, the PMO educates teams (or arranges for training) and supports projects. Sometimes, the PMO
advises management about the relative business value for a given project or set of projects.
   Because agile creates cultural change, over time, the organization might need to change, including the PMO. For
example, managers make decisions about which projects to fund and when, and teams decide what they need for
training or advice.



6.6.1 AN AGILE PMO IS VALUE-DRIVEN
    Any project should deliver the right value, to the right audience, at the right time. The PMO's objective is to facilitate
and enable this goal. An agile-based PMO approach is based on a customer-collaboration mindset and is present in
all PMO programs. In many cases, this means the PMO operates as if it were a consulting business, tailoring its efforts
to meet specific needs requested by a given project. Some projects may need tools and templates, while others may
benefit from executive coaching. The PMO should strive to deliver what is needed and keep the pulse on its customers
to ensure that it knows and is able to adapt to their needs. This intrapreneur approach focuses on the PMO activities
that are perceived as the most valuable to the projects it supports.



6.6.2 AN AGILE PMO IS INVITATION-ORIENTED
    In order to accelerate progress on a value-based charter, a PMO may be tempted to mandate certain solutions or
approaches, for example, to make everyone do it the same way to get some quick wins. However, a more deliberate
perspective incorporates the desire for employee engagement. This is achieved by inviting only those interested to
engage with PMO services. Higher engagement with PMO practices makes it easier for those practices to be "sticky."
If the PMO is delivering value to its clients, it is more likely that clients will request its services and adopt its practices.




                                                                                                                             81
6.6.3 AN AGILE PMO IS MULTIDISCIPLINARY
   In order to support project-specific needs, the PMO needs to be conversant in several competencies beyond
project management itself, because different projects require distinct capabilities. For instance, one project may need
organizational design to address staffing challenges while another may require organizational change management
techniques for stakeholder engagement or unique business models to support customer goals.
     Some organizations have been transforming their PMOs into agile centers of excellence that provide such services as:
      Developing and implementing standards. Provide templates for user stories, test cases, cumulative flow
     uu
         diagrams, etc. Provide agile tools and educate supporting groups on iterative development concepts.
      Developing personnel through training and mentoring. Coordinate agile training courses, coaches, and
     uu
         mentors to help people transition to an agile mindset and upgrade their skills. Encourage and support people to
         attend local agile events.
      Multiproject management. Coordinate between agile teams by communicating between projects. Consider
     uu
         sharing items such as progress, issues, and retrospective findings and improvement experiments. Help
         manage major customer releases at the program level and investment themes at the portfolio level using an
         appropriate framework.
      Facilitating organizational learning. Gather project velocity profiles and capture, store, and index
     uu
         retrospective findings.
      Managing stakeholders. Provide product owner training, guidance on acceptance testing, and how to evaluate
     uu
         and give feedback on systems. Champion the importance of subject matter experts (SMEs) to projects.
      Recruiting, selecting, and evaluating team leaders. Develop guidelines for interviewing agile practitioners.
     uu

      Executing specialized tasks for projects. Train and provide retrospective facilitators, create agreements with
     uu
         agile project troubleshooters, and provide mentors and coaches.




                                                                                                               Section 6

6.7 ORGANIZATIONAL STRUCTURE
  The structure of an organization strongly influences its ability to pivot to new information or shifting market needs.
Here is a listing of key characteristics:
    Geography. Geographically distributed and dispersed project organizations may find several challenges impeding
   uu
       their work on any project. Project leaders and regional managers may have alternative or even competing goals.
       Additionally, cultural differences, language barriers, and lower visibility can slow down productivity. Fortunately,
       the use of agile approaches can encourage more collaboration and confidence than would otherwise exist.
       Project leaders in these contexts should encourage dialog at the team and executive level to tailor techniques for
       the context and to manage expectations about the effort required to do so.
    Functionalized structures. Some organizations are structured on a spectrum ranging from highly projectized
   uu
       to matrixed to highly functionalized. Projects with highly functionalized structures may find general resistance to
       collaboration across its organization.
    Size of project deliverable. Reducing the size of a project deliverable will motivate more frequent handoffs
   uu
       across departments, and thus more frequent interactions and a faster flow of value across the organization.
    Allocation of people to projects. Another approach is to ask for a single person from each department to be
   uu
       temporarily, yet fully allocated, to the highest priority project.
    Procurement-heavy organizations. Some organizations choose to implement projects primarily through
   uu
       vendors. Although project goals may be clear, vendors have a responsibility to look after their own financial
       viability. Moreover, once vendors complete their obligations and leave the engagement, the associated project
       knowledge goes with them. This limits the internal competencies needed for sustained flexibility and speed. Agile
       techniques such as retrospectives and follow up on possible improvement areas when the vendor is still engaged
       can help mitigate loss of product knowledge.




                                                                                                                        83
   6.8 EVOLVING THE ORGANIZATION
      When addressing an individual challenge area or implementing a new hybrid or agile approach, it is recommended
   to undertake the work incrementally. A common practice is to treat the change process as an agile project with its
   own backlog of changes that could be introduced and prioritized by the team, based on perceived value or other
   considerations. Each of the changes can be treated as an experiment, which is tested for a short period of time to
   determine suitability as-is or the need for further refinement/consideration.
      Use kanban boards to track progress, showing the new approaches already in use as "done," those being tried as "in
   progress," and those still waiting to be introduced as "to do." See Figure 6-3 for the initial board with a ranked backlog.
   Figure 6-4 shows an example of what a board might have as work progresses.

   Using these tools to organize and manage the change implementation provides visibility into progress and also
models the approaches being implemented. Rolling out changes in a transparent and appealing way improves the
likelihood of their success.

    A CALL TO ACTI ON
      The adoption of agile and its approaches for managing projects has increased dramatically since the Agile Manifesto
   was first published in 2001. Adoption and the desire to operate with an agile mindset is no longer limited to a certain sized
   organization or those specializing only in information technology. The mindset applies universally and the approaches
   are successful in many settings.
      Today, the demand for "being agile" is higher than ever. The debate over the best path to agility continues to keep
   the conversation and innovation evolving. One truth remains constant--inspection, adaptation, and transparency are
   critical to successfully delivering value.
      You may not see everything you expected to see in this practice guide. Our core team realizes you may disagree with
   some elements or approaches we did choose to present--and passionately so. We call on your passion to continue
   the conversation and improve the next iteration of this practice guide. This is your journey--learn, experiment, gain
   feedback, and experiment again. Then help us retrospect; give us feedback on the guidance and contribute to future
   editions of this practice guide. After all, inspection without adaptation is wasted effort.
      Lastly, we want to encourage you to be engaged in the broader communities of project management and agile to
   further conversations on these topics. Look for representatives from both PMI and Agile Alliance(R) at conferences and
   meetings and engage them in discussion. Use social media and blog your thoughts and opinions.

   Section 4                                      Iterative and agile approaches promote the engagement of team
   Project Integration Management                 members as local domain experts in integration management.
                                                  The team members determine how plans and components
                                                  should integrate.
                                                  The expectations of the project manager as noted in the Key
                                                  Concepts for Integration Management sections in the PMBOK(R)
                                                  Guide do not change in an adaptive environment, but control of
                                                  the detailed product planning and delivery is delegated to the
                                                  team. The project manager's focus is on building a collaborative
                                                  decision-making environment and ensuring the team has the
                                                  ability to respond to changes. This collaborative approach can
                                                  be further enhanced when team members possess a broad skill
                                                  base rather than a narrow specialization.

   Section 5                                      In projects with evolving requirements, high risk, or significant
   Project Scope Management                       uncertainty, the scope is often not understood at the beginning
                                                  of the project or it evolves during the project. Agile methods
                                                  deliberately spend less time trying to define and agree on scope
                                                  in the early stage of the project and spend more time
                                                  establishing the process for its ongoing discovery and
                                                  refinement. Many environments with emerging requirements find
                                                  that there is often a gap between the real business requirements
                                                  and the business requirements that were originally stated.
                                                  Therefore, agile methods purposefully build and review
                                                  prototypes and release versions in order to refine the
                                                  requirements. As a result, scope is defined and redefined
                                                  throughout the project. In agile approaches, the requirements
                                                  constitute the backlog.

     Section 6                                      Adaptive approaches use short cycles to undertake work, review
     Project Schedule Management                    the results, and adapt as necessary. These cycles provide rapid
                                                    feedback on the approaches and suitability of deliverables, and
                                                    generally manifest as iterative scheduling and on-demand,
                                                    pull-based scheduling, as discussed in the Key Trends and
                                                    Emerging Practices section for Project Schedule Management in
                                                    the PMBOK(R) Guide.
                                                    In large organizations, there may be a mixture of small projects
                                                    and large initiatives requiring long-term roadmaps to manage the
                                                    development of these programs using scaling factors (e.g., team
                                                    size, geographical distribution, regulatory compliance,
                                                    organizational complexity, and technical complexity). To address
                                                    the full delivery life cycle for larger, enterprise-wide systems,
                                                    a range of techniques utilizing a predictive approach, adaptive
                                                    approach, or a hybrid of both, may need to be adopted. The
                                                    organization may need to combine practices from several core
                                                    methods, or adopt a method that has already done so, and adopt
                                                    a few principles and practices of more traditional techniques.
                                                    The role of the project manager does not change based on
                                                    managing projects using a predictive development life cycle or
                                                    managing projects in adaptive environments. However, to be
                                                    successful in using adaptive approaches, the project manager will
                                                    need to be familiar with the tools and techniques to understand
                                                    how to apply them effectively.

     Section 7                                      Projects with high degrees of uncertainty or those where the
     Project Cost Management                        scope is not yet fully defined may not benefit from detailed cost
                                                    calculations due to frequent changes. Instead, lightweight
                                                    estimation methods can be used to generate a fast, high-level
                                                    forecast of project labor costs, which can then be easily adjusted
                                                    as changes arise. Detailed estimates are reserved for short-term
                                                    planning horizons in a just-in-time fashion.
                                                    In cases where high-variability projects are also subject to strict
                                                    budgets, the scope and schedule are more often adjusted to stay
                                                    within cost constraints.

   Section 8                                       In order to navigate changes, agile methods call for frequent
   Project Quality Management                      quality and review steps built in throughout the project rather
                                                   than toward the end of the project.
                                                   Recurring retrospectives regularly check on the effectiveness of
                                                   the quality processes. They look for the root cause of issues then
                                                   suggest trials of new approaches to improve quality. Subsequent
                                                   retrospectives evaluate any trial processes to determine if they
                                                   are working and should be continued or new adjusting or should
                                                   be dropped from use.
                                                   In order to facilitate frequent, incremental delivery, agile methods
                                                   focus on small batches of work, incorporating as many elements
                                                   of project deliverables as possible. Small batch systems aim to
                                                   uncover inconsistencies and quality issues earlier in the project
                                                   life cycle when the overall costs of change are lower.

   Section 9                                       Projects with high variability benefit from team structures that
   Project Resource Management                     maximize focus and collaboration, such as self-organizing teams
                                                   with generalizing specialists.
                                                   Collaboration is intended to boost productivity and facilitate
                                                   innovative problem solving. Collaborative teams may facilitate
                                                   accelerated integration of distinct work activities, improve
                                                   communication, increase knowledge sharing, and provide
                                                   flexibility of work assignments in addition to other advantages.
                                                   Although the benefits of collaboration also apply to other project
                                                   environments, collaborative teams are often critical to the
                                                   success of projects with a high degree of variability and rapid
                                                   changes, because there is less time for centralized tasking and
                                                   decision making.
                                                   Planning for physical and human resources is much less
                                                   predictable in projects with high variability. In these environments,
                                                   agreements for fast supply and lean methods are critical to
                                                   controlling costs and achieving the schedule.

     Section 10                                     Project environments subject to various elements of ambiguity
     Project Communications Management              and change have an inherent need to communicate evolving and
                                                    emerging details more frequently and quickly. This motivates
                                                    streamlining team member access to information, frequent team
                                                    checkpoints, and colocating team members as much as possible.
                                                    In addition, posting project artifacts in a transparent fashion,
                                                    and holding regular stakeholder reviews are intended to promote
                                                    communication with management and stakeholders.

     Section 11                                     High-variability environments, by definition, incur more
     Project Risk Management                        uncertainty and risk. To address this, projects managed using
                                                    adaptive approaches make use of frequent reviews of
                                                    incremental work products and cross-functional project teams to
                                                    accelerate knowledge sharing and ensure that risk is understood
                                                    and managed. Risk is considered when selecting the content of
                                                    each iteration, and risks will also be identified, analyzed, and
                                                    managed during each iteration.
                                                    Additionally, the requirements are kept as a living document
                                                    that is updated regularly, and work may be reprioritized as the
                                                    project progresses, based on an improved understanding of
                                                    current risk exposure.

   Section 12                                     In agile environments, specific sellers may be used to extend the
   Project Procurement Management                 team. This collaborative working relationship can lead to a
                                                  shared risk procurement model where both the buyer and the
                                                  seller share in the risk and rewards associated with a project.
                                                  Larger projects may use an adaptive approach for some
                                                  deliverables and a more stable approach for other parts. In these
                                                  cases, a governing agreement such as a master services
                                                  agreement (MSA) may be used for the overall engagement, with
                                                  the adaptive work being placed in an appendix or supplement.
                                                  This allows changes to occur on the adaptive scope without
                                                  impacting the overall contract.

   Section 13                                     Projects experiencing a high degree of change require active
   Project Stakeholder Management                 engagement and participation with project stakeholders. To
                                                  facilitate timely, productive discussion and decision making,
                                                  adaptive teams engage with stakeholders directly rather than
                                                  going through layers of management. Often the client, user, and
                                                  developer exchange information in a dynamic co-creative
                                                  process that leads to more stakeholder involvement and higher
                                                  satisfaction. Regular interactions with the stakeholder community
                                                  throughout the project mitigate risk, build trust, and support
                                                  adjustments earlier in the project cycle, thus reducing costs and
                                                  increasing the likelihood of success for the project.
                                                  In order to accelerate the sharing of information within and
                                                  across the organization, agile methods promote aggressive
                                                  transparency. The intent of inviting any stakeholders to project
                                                  meetings and reviews or posting project artifacts in public
                                                  spaces is to surface as quickly as possible any misalignment,
                                                  dependency, or other issue related to the changing project.

 OVE RVIEW O F A GIL E AND LEAN FRAM EWORK S
   This annex describes some of the commonly used agile approaches. These approaches can be used as is or combined
to adapt to what works best for a given environment or situation. It is not necessary to use any of these; an agile approach
can be developed from scratch as long as it adheres to the mindset, values, and principles of the Agile Manifesto. If the
agile principles are followed to deliver value at a sustainable pace, and the developed approach promotes collaboration
with the customer, a specific approach is not required. A link to more information regarding each approach can be found
in the Bibliography section of this guide.



A3.1 SELECTION CRITERIA FOR THE AGILE PRACTICE GUIDE
  There are too many agile approaches and techniques to be explicitly included in this practice guide. Figure A3-1
depicts a sample of agile approaches based on their depth of guidance and breadth of their life cycles. The specific
approaches selected for discussion are popular examples that are:
    Designed for holistic use. Some agile approaches are centered on a single project activity, such as estimation
   uu
       or reflecting. The listed examples include only the more holistic agile frameworks. Some are more full-featured
       than others, but all of the selected approaches are those intended to guide a broad set of project activities.
    Formalized for common use. Some agile frameworks are proprietary in nature and designed for specific use by
   uu
       a single organization or within a single context. The frameworks described in Sections A3.2 through A3.14 focus
       on those intended for common use in a variety of contexts.
    Popular in modern use. Some agile frameworks are holistically designed and well formalized, but are simply not
   uu
       commonly being used in most projects or organizations. The agile frameworks described in this annex have been
       adopted by a significant number of industries, as measured by a collection of recent industry surveys.

A3.2 SCRUM
   Scrum is a single-team process framework used to manage product development. The framework consists of Scrum
roles, events, artifacts, and rules, and uses an iterative approach to deliver working product. Scrum is run on timeboxes
of 1 month or less with consistent durations called sprints where a potentially releasable increment of product is
produced. Table A3-1 lists Scrum events and artifacts utilized for project execution.
  The Scrum team consists of a product owner, development team, and scrum master.
    The product owner is responsible for maximizing the value of the product.
   uu

    The development team is a cross-functional, self-organizing team consisting of team members who have
   uu
       everything they need within the team to deliver working product without depending on others outside of the team.
    The scrum master is responsible for ensuring the Scrum process is upheld and works to ensure the Scrum team
   uu
       adheres to the practices and rules as well as coaches the team on removing impediments.

A3.3 EXTREME PROGRAMMING
   eXtreme Programming (XP) is a software development method based on frequent cycles. The name is based on
the philosophy of distilling a given best practice to its purest, simplest form, and applying that practice continuously
throughout the project.
   XP is most known for popularizing a holistic set of practices intended to improve the results of software projects.
The method was first formalized as a set of twelve primary practices, but then gradually evolved to adopt several other
corollary practices. These are listed in Table A3-2.

   This evolution was the result of designing and adopting techniques through the filter of core values
(communication, simplicity, feedback, courage, respect), and informed by key principles (humanity, economics,
mutual benefit, self-similarity, improvement, diversity, reflection, flow, opportunity, redundancy, failure, quality,
baby steps, accepted responsibility).

A3.4 KANBAN METHOD
   Kanban in lean manufacturing is a system for scheduling inventory control and replenishment. This process of "just-
in-time" inventory replenishment was originally seen in grocery stores when shelves were restocked based on the gaps
in the shelves and not supplier inventory. Inspired by these just-in-time inventory systems, Taiichi Ohno developed
Kanban and it was applied at the main Toyota manufacturing facility in 1953.
   The word kanban is literally translated as "visual sign" or "card." Physical kanban boards with cards enable and
promote the visualization and flow of the work through the system for everyone to see. This information radiator (large
display) is made up of columns that represent the states the work needs to flow through in order to get to done. The
simplest of boards could have three columns (i.e., to do, doing, and done), but it is adaptable to whatever states are
deemed needed by the team utilizing it.
   The Kanban Method is utilized and applicable in many settings and allows for a continuous flow of work and value
to the customer. The Kanban Method is less prescriptive than some agile approaches and thus less disruptive to begin
implementing as it is the original "start where you are" method. Organizations can begin applying Kanban Methods with
relative ease and progress toward fully implementing the method if that is what they deem necessary or appropriate.
   Unlike most agile approaches, the Kanban Method does not prescribe the use of timeboxed iterations. Iterations
can be used within the Kanban Method, but the principle of pulling single items through the process continuously and
limiting work in progress to optimize flow should always remain intact. The Kanban Method may be best used when a
team or organization is in need of the following conditions:
    Flexibility. Teams are typically not bound by timeboxes and will work on the highest priority item in the backlog
   uu
       of work.
    Focus on continuous delivery. Teams are focused on flowing work through the system to completion and not
   uu
       beginning new work until work in progress is completed.
    Increased productivity and quality. Productivity and quality are increased by limiting work in progress.

                                                                                                                   103
    Increased efficiency. Checking each task for value adding or non-value-added activities and removing the non-
   uu
      value adding activities.
    Team member focus. Limited work in progress allows the team to focus on the current work.
   uu

    Variability in the workload. When there is unpredictability in the way that work arrives, and it becomes
   uu
      impossible for teams to make predictable commitments; even for short periods of time.
    Reduction of waste. Transparency makes waste visible so it can be removed.
   uu

  The Kanban Method is derived from lean thinking principles. The defining principles and the core properties of the
Kanban Method are listed in Table A3-3.
   The Kanban Method is a holistic framework for incremental, evolutionary process and systems change for
organizations. The method uses a "pull system" to move the work through the process. When the team completes an
item, the team can pull an item into that step.

      Kanban boards, such as the one shown in Figure A3-2, are a low-tech, high-touch technology that may seem overly
   simplistic at first, but those using them soon realize their power. Utilizing policies for entry and exit to columns, as well
   as constraints such as limiting work in process, kanban boards provide clear insight to workflow, bottlenecks, blockers,
   and overall status. Additionally the board acts as an information radiator to anyone who sees it, providing up-to-date
   information on the status of the work of the team.

      In the Kanban Method, it is more important to complete work than it is to start new work. There is no value derived
   from work that is not completed so the team works together to implement and adhere to the work in progress (WIP)





   limits and get each piece of work through the system to "done."

  Crystal is a family of methodologies. Crystal methodologies are designed to scale, and provide a selection of
methodology rigor based on project size (number of people involved in the project) and the criticality of the project.

      Crystal Methodology realizes that each project may require a slightly tailored set of policies, practices, and processes
   in order to meet the project's unique characteristics. The family of methodologies use different colors based on "weight"
   to determine which methodology to use. The use of the word crystal comes from the gemstone where the various
   "faces" represent underlying core principles and values. The faces are a representation of techniques, tools, standards,
   and roles listed in Table A3-4.

A3.6 SCRUMBAN
   Scrumban is an agile approach originally designed as a way to transition from Scrum to Kanban. As additional agile
frameworks and methodologies emerged, it became an evolving hybrid framework in and of itself where teams use
Scrum as a framework and Kanban for process improvement.
   In Scrumban, the work is organized into small "sprints" and leverages the use of kanban boards to visualize and
monitor the work. The stories are placed on the kanban board and the team manages its work by using work-in-
progress limits. Daily meetings are held to maintain the collaboration between the team and to remove impediments.
A planning trigger is set in place for the team to know when to plan next, typically when the work-in-progress level is
lower than a predetermined limit. There are no predefined roles in Scrumban--the team retains their current roles.



A3.7 FEATURE-DRIVEN DEVELOPMENT
   Feature-Driven Development (FDD) was developed to meet the specific needs of a large software development
project. Features relate to a small business value capability.
   There are six primary roles on a Feature-Driven Development project where individuals can take on one or more of
the following roles:
    Project manager,
   uu

    Chief architect,
   uu

    Development manager,
   uu

    Chief programmer,
   uu

    Class owner, and/or
   uu

    Domain expert.

108
   A Feature-Driven Development project is organized around five processes or activities, which are performed iteratively:
    Develop an overall model,
   uu

    Build a features list,
   uu

    Plan by feature,
   uu

    Design by feature, and
   uu

    Build by features.
   uu

   The life cycle flow and interaction of these five processes is illustrated in Figure A3-4.
   Feature-Driven Development activities are supported by a core set of software engineering best practices:
    Domain object modeling,
   uu

    Developing by feature,
   uu

    Individual class ownership,
   uu

    Feature teams,
   uu

    Inspections,

A3.8 DYNAMIC SYSTEMS DEVELOPMENT METHOD
   Dynamic Systems Development Method (DSDM) is an agile project delivery framework initially designed to add more
rigor to existing iterative methods popular in the 1990s. It was developed as a noncommercial collaboration among
industry leaders.
   DSDM is known best for its emphasis on constraint-driven delivery. The framework will set cost, quality, and time at
the outset, and then use formalized prioritization of scope to meet those constraints as shown in Figure A3-5.

   A3.9 AGILE UNIFIED PROCESS
      The Agile Unified Process (AgileUP) is an offshoot of the Unified Process (UP) for software projects. It features more
   accelerated cycles and less heavyweight processes than its Unified Process predecessor. The intent is to perform more
   iterative cycles across seven key disciplines, and incorporate the associated feedback before formal delivery. The
   disciplines along with guiding principles are listed in Table A3-5.

   A3.10 SCALING FRAMEWORKS

   A3.10.1 SCRUM OF SCRUMS
      Scrum of Scrums (SoS), also known as "meta Scrum," is a technique used when two or more Scrum teams consisting
   of three to nine members each need to coordinate their work instead of one large Scrum team. A representative
   from each team attends a meeting with the other team representative(s), potentially daily but typically two to three
   times a week. The daily meeting is conducted similar to the daily standup in Scrum where the representative reports
   completed work, next set of work, any current impediments, and potential upcoming impediments that might block
   the other team(s). The goal is to ensure the teams are coordinating work and removing impediments to optimize the
   efficiency of all the teams.





      Large projects with several teams may result in conducting a Scrum of Scrum of Scrums, which follows the same

A3.11 SCALED AGILE FRAMEWORK
  The Scaled Agile Framework (SAFe(R)) focuses on providing a knowledge base of patterns for scaling development
work across all levels of the enterprise.
  SAFe(R) is focused on the following principles:
    Take an economic view.
   uu

    Apply systems thinking.
   uu

    Assume variability; preserve options.
   uu

    Build incrementally with fast, integrated learning cycles.
   uu

    Base milestones on objective evaluation of working systems.
   uu




                                                                                                      Annex A3
112
    Visualize and limit work in progress, reduce batch sizes, and manage queue lengths.
   uu

    Apply cadence; synchronize with cross-domain planning.
   uu

    Unlock the intrinsic motivation of knowledge workers.
   uu

    Decentralize decision making.
   uu

   SAFe(R) focuses on detailing practices, roles, and activities at the portfolio, program, and team levels with an emphasis
on organizing the enterprise around value streams that focus on providing continuous value to the customer.



A3.12 LARGE SCALE SCRUM (LeSS)
   Large Scale Scrum (LeSS) is a framework for organizing several development teams toward a common goal extending
the Scrum method shown in Figure A3-6. The core organizing principle is to retain as much as possible of the elements
of the conventional single-team Scrum model. This helps minimize any extensions to the model that might create
unnecessary confusion or complexity. Table A3-6 shows a comparison of LeSS and Scrum.

                  One definition of done for all teams

                  One potentially shippable product increment
                  at the end of each sprint                        Overall cross-team refinement

                                                                   improvements
                  Complete, cross-functional teams
                  One sprint



   In order to extend Scrum without losing its essence, LeSS promotes the use of certain discerning principles, such as
systems thinking, whole product focus, transparency, and others.

A3.13 ENTERPRISE SCRUM
   Enterprise Scrum is a framework designed to apply the Scrum method on a more holistic organizational level rather
than a single product development effort. Specifically, the framework advises organization leaders to:
    Extend the use of Scrum across all aspects of the organization;
   uu

    Generalize the Scrum techniques to apply easily at those various aspects; and
   uu

    Scale the Scrum method with supplemental techniques as necessary.
   uu

  The intent is to use agile approaches beyond project execution by enabling disruptive innovation.



A3.14 DISCIPLINED AGILE (DA)
   Disciplined Agile (DA) is a process decision framework that integrates several agile best practices into a comprehensive
model. DA was designed to offer a balance between those popular methods deemed to be either too narrow in focus
(e.g., Scrum) or too prescriptive in detail (e.g., AgileUP). To achieve that balance, it blends various agile techniques
according to the following principles:
    People-first. Enumerating roles and organization elements at various levels.
   uu

    Learning-oriented. Encouraging collaborative improvement.
   uu

    Full delivery life cycle. Promoting several fit-for-purpose life cycles.
   uu

    Goal-driven. Tailoring processes to achieve specific outcomes.
   uu

    Enterprise awareness. Offering guidance on cross-departmental governance.
   uu

    Scalable. Covering multiple dimensions of program complexity.

      Tailoring is an advanced topic that should be undertaken by experienced    and practice at the Shu level before
   practitioners who have been successful using agile approaches as originally   we are ready to move to the Ha level
   described in multiple environments before they consider tailoring them. In    to tailor the process or the Ri level to
   other words, gain experience and be successful with one approach before       invent a new custom process.
   attempting to tailor the approach.


      A common response when struggling to adopt an agile practice is to
   consider whether to do it or not. A statement like "Retrospectives were





   unpopular so we decided to drop them" illustrates this issue and indicates
   a more fundamental problem on the team that is unlikely to be addressed





   by tailoring the method. The situation will be made worse by omitting the
   retrospective activity that aims to improve the process.




                                                                                                                    119
   Finally, tailoring should be undertaken in collaboration with the teammates or whoever the change is likely to impact.
People need to be engaged in the thinking and decision-making process about changing processes in order for them to
commit and buy-in to the changes in order to have a successful transition. Omitting people from tailoring a process is
likely to result in resistance and resentment to the change, even if it makes good sense technically. Often, experienced
coaches or leaders can help to engage people effectively.



X2.3 HOW TO USE THIS APPENDIX
   To benefit from the guidance listed in this appendix, we recommend first successfully using the agile approaches
as designed. Then review the tailoring guidelines in Table X2-1 that match the situation and read the associated
recommendations. Next, discuss the change with the people it will impact and agree on a course of action.
  As discussed in Section 5, a good way to evaluate a change is try it for an iteration or two first before adopting it
permanently. Or, consider a flow-based approach to try to deliver several features. Then, reflect with a retrospective
and reassess.
  When people know they can experiment and provide feedback on the experiment, they are more likely to try something
new. Having tried it for a timeboxed period, the team should review its effectiveness at a retrospective to determine
whether it should be continued as-is, modified to improve it, or dropped from use.
   Finally, successfully adopted, tailored approaches can be institutionalized into the standard processes used for
projects that share these characteristics. It is also recommended that guidelines from Section 5 be followed that
describe adopting (or tailoring) new approaches.



X2.4 TAILORING RECOMMENDATIONS
  Listed below are some good practices to consider before tailoring an approach.




                                                                                                           Appendix X2

X2.4.1 BEWARE OF TAKING THINGS AWAY
   Many of the agile practices act as self-supporting pairs. For instance, colocation and frequent business conversations
allow for lightweight requirements since gaps in understanding can be filled quickly. Likewise, XP's ruthless testing
allows for courageous refactoring as one practice supports the other. Removing something without understanding or
addressing its counterbalanced practice will likely create more problems than it solves.



X2.4.2 USE THE TAILORING GUIDELINES TABLE
    Using Table X2-1, find the circumstances that match a given situation and consider recommendations for tailoring.
Discuss any changes with those who will be impacted by the change and plan a short trial first, along with an honest
follow-up review before committing to the change.

                                               Table X2-1. Tailoring Guidelines


                 Situation                                               Tailoring Recommendation

        Very large project teams        Restructure large projects as multiple smaller projects. Try a technology trial
                                        project first and then an implementation project.
                                        Consider more frequent releases of fewer features each, which allows for the
                                        creation of smaller project teams.
                                        Consider reducing the team down to its critical core members. Often too many
                                        people hinder a process, not help it. Reducing a team size can reduce churn as
                                        well as costs.
                                        Break large teams into multiple smaller teams and use program management to
                                        synchronize and coordinate.
                                        Use agile and lean program management to organize the larger effort.
                                        Consider a scaled agile or lean framework such as DA, SAFe(R), or LeSS. Each
                                        offers some useful ideas, and each carries implementation risks and process
                                        weight/cost.

      Dispersed teams                 Many projects have (some) dispersed team members. Tools like instant
                                      messaging, video conferencing, and electronic team boards help bridge many
                                      of the communication gaps.
                                      When teams are likely to remain stable, set up face-to-face meetings as soon as
                                      possible to make future remote conversations more effective. People who have
                                      met face-to-face are more likely to enter unfiltered debate because of higher trust.
                                      When conducting meetings with remote participants where there is a loss of
                                      facial and body-language cues, consider round-robin check-ins to ensure
                                      participation and check consensus for decisions.
                                      Also, consider the use of iteration-based agile approaches. When team members
                                      are many time zones apart, consider using whole-project interactions less
                                      frequently, while encouraging more personal meetings (two or three people
                                      at a time) more frequently.

      Some safety critical products   Agile approaches can still be used in these environments, but they need to have
      may require additional          the appropriate additional layers of conformance review, documentation, and
      documentation and               certification that is required by the domain. In that case, documentation could
      conformance checks beyond       be part of what the team delivers along with finished features. Features may not
      what agile processes suggest    be done until the documentation is completed.
      out-of-the-box                  Consider using a hybrid approach (multiple agile approaches) to get the benefits
                                      of improved collaboration and communication brought by agile with the added
                                      rigor required by the product environment. Aircraft flight system developers and
                                      drug companies use agile approaches coupled with their own additional
                                      processes to leverage the benefits and retain appropriate controls.

      Stable requirements and         Is agile really needed? If uncertainty in requirements is low, low rates of change,
      execution process               or minimal execution risk, the full suite of agile approaches may not be needed.
                                      While any project benefits from increased collaboration and transparency; some
                                      of the iterative build and review cycles might be overkill.
                                      If build/feedback cycles do not routinely uncover or refine requirements,
                                      consider extending their durations to minimize the cost impact of review time.
                                      If the project has high rates of change during design and development, but
                                      rolling it out to customers is a defined and repeatable process, hybrid
                                      approaches that use the appropriate life cycle model for each project phase
                                      may make more sense.

      Teams are in functional         Agile is built on the idea of cross-functional teams. Consider asking people to
      silos inside functional         create cross-functional teams themselves, without management involvement and
      organizations                   see what happens.
                                      If the compensation system is organized to recognize and reward functional
                                      areas, consider changing that first. People might not act in the interest of the
                                      product or the team until it affects their compensation in some way.

   Transparency can cause fear    Agile creates a culture of transparency: people show and share their work
                                  throughout development. This sharing of interim deliverables and being open and
                                  honest about successes, failures, and current state is transparency. Transparency
                                  requires courage.
                                  Lead by example and demonstrate transparency in decision-making processes
                                  by using a status board or whiteboard.

   Many of the team members       Agile approaches encourage and make use of self-directing teams to make local
   have little technical domain   decisions about work items, such as task sequencing and which approach to use
   knowledge                      when solving a problem. When the majority of team members are inexperienced,
                                  consensus-based approaches may lead to problems and rework. So, for these
                                  teams, additional help "assigning" and "directing" may be necessary until the
                                  team gains the necessary skills. In other words, do not just declare that agile will
                                  be used and let an inexperienced team try to figure everything out because they
                                  are empowered and self-directing. Consider building centers of competencies
                                  to help provide guidance and build domain knowledge.

   Lack of executive buy-in       When executive buy-in is missing, teams will encounter a clash between the
                                  agile mindset and approaches and the more predictive mindset and approaches.
                                  Find common ground, areas for improvement based on the organization's needs,
                                  and then use experiments and retrospectives to progress.
                                  Consider education/training for executives. Consider explaining agile in terms of
                                  lean thinking: short cycles, small batch sizes, frequent reviews, and retrospectives
                                  with small improvements.

   Agile terms and language do    Modify the terms so people will understand and agree to the activities, if not the
   not fit the organizational     agile language. Be specific about what each term means.
   culture                        For example, if the organization finds the word "game" unprofessional, don't
                                  use terms such as "planning game." Instead, consider using the term "planning
                                  workshop."

    AGILE SUI TA BIL I TY FIL TE R TOOLS


   X3.1 INTRODUCTION
      Agile literature contains many agile suitability filter tools to help assess under what circumstances an agile approach
   is appropriate to use. In 1994, the Dynamic Systems Development Method (DSDM) developed an Agile Project Suitability
   Questionnaire and an Organizational Suitability Questionnaire to help gauge likely fit and potential problem areas.
      The Crystal family of approaches also employed suitability criteria, ranking projects by team size and the criticality
   of the product or service being developed. Crystal recommends that smaller, less critical projects be undertaken with
   lighter controls and simpler approaches. Large, mission or life critical projects were recommended to use more rigor
   and validation.
      Since the development of these approaches, there have been many more models created to help determine
   where and when to employ agile approaches. Boehm and Turner adopted some of the elements from DSDM and
   Crystal to develop a popular assessment model to help determine if projects should be undertaken with agile or more
   traditional approaches.
      Based on these previous models and expanded to consider the middle ground of hybrid approaches, the following
   model is proposed. It represents a synthesis of several suitability filter attributes to help organizations assess and
   discuss whether projects should be undertaken using predictive, hybrid, or agile approaches.






                                                                                                                         125
X3.2 OVERVIEW OF THE MODEL
  Organizational and project attributes are assessed under three main categories:
    Culture. Is there a supportive environment with buy-in for the approach and trust in the team?
   uu

    Team. Is the team of a suitable size to be successful in adopting agile, do its members have the necessary
   uu
       experience and access to business representatives to be successful?
    Project. Are there high rates of change? Is incremental delivery possible? How critical is the project?
   uu

   Questions in each of these categories are answered and the results plotted on a radar chart. Clusters of values
around the center of the chart indicate a good fit for agile approaches. Results around the outside indicate a predictive
approach may be more suitable. Values in the middle portion (between agile and predictive) indicate a hybrid approach
could work well. An example is shown in Figure X3-1.

X3.3 INSTRUCTIONS FOR USE


X3.3.1 COMPLETE THE QUESTIONNAIRE AS A GROUP
   For small projects, this group may simply be the sponsor, technical lead, and a customer. For large projects, this
may include representatives from the sponsoring group, project execution team, impacted business group(s), project
governance group(s), and customer community. The idea is that just as no single stakeholder should estimate or plan a
project because of representing only one viewpoint and having personal bias; so too should no single person assess the
suitability of an approach since any one person will also have a limited view with a bias.
    Instead, the value of the tool is the conversation it encourages with the invested parties of the project. Even if the
results point to a hybrid approach, but the stakeholders want to proceed with a largely agile or predictive approach,
follow the stakeholder consensus. This tool is a high-level diagnostic only, the final decision should rest and be supported
by the people involved.



X3.3.2 SCORE THE QUESTIONS FROM 1 TO 10
   As a group, discuss and agree (or compromise) on a score that most accurately reflects the subjective evaluation
of the question. While definitive options are only provided for the start, middle, and end points of the answer spectrum
representing scores of 1, 5, and 10, it is fine (and desirable) to use scores such as 2 for "almost a 1, but not quite,"
or 7 for "somewhere between a 5 and a 10." Again, the assessment is a discussion tool--views will be subjective
and shades of gray are to be expected.
    When the group cannot agree on a score, discuss the issues openly and honestly. Before suggesting compromises
(i.e., using average scores or marking PMO scores with a blue "X" and the development team with a green "O"), consider
how successful is the project likely to be when the participants cannot agree on completing a simple assessment?
When discussing the issues, if the differences of opinion can be identified--then great, it is working; now come to an
agreement. Likewise, if the assessment indicates a predictive approach but everyone wants to try an agile approach (or
vice versa) that is fine too, just understand the issues and discuss how the impacts of the approach will be handled.




                                                                                                              Appendix X3
128
   X3.3.3 INTERPRET THE RESULTS
      Mark the answers from the questions on a blank suitability assessment chart and connect the points. Results clustered
   around the center in the agile zone indicate a good fit for a purely agile approach.
      Results predominantly in the hybrid zone indicate some combination of agile and predictive approaches might work
   best. However, it is also possible that an agile approach with some additional risk reduction steps such as extra
   education and training or extra validation and documentation rigor in the case of high criticality projects may suffice.
   Alternatively, a predictive approach with some proof-of-concept work or extra processes could also work.
       Results predominantly in the predictive zone indicate a good fit for a purely predictive approach. As mentioned in
   Section X3.3.2 (Score the Questions step), this diagnostic tool is aimed at starting meaningful conversations with the
   impacted parties about the most appropriate approach to use. If the approach suggested by the tool is not acceptable it
   is allowed to use a different approach. Use the results as inputs to the risk management process, since the tool indicates
   mismatches that will need to be managed.

X3.4.1.2 TRUST IN TEAM

  Considering the sponsors and the business representatives who will be working with the team. Do these stakeholders
have confidence that the team can transform their vision and needs into a successful product or service--with ongoing
support and feedback going both directions? See Figure X3-3.



                 Yes                                   Probably                              Unlikely

   X3.4.2.2 EXPERIENCE LEVELS

      Considering the experience and skill levels of the core team roles. While it is normal to have a mix of experienced and
   inexperienced people in roles, for agile projects to go smoothly; it is easier when each role has at least one experienced
   member. See Figure X3-6.

   X3.4.3.2 CRITICALITY OF PRODUCT OR SERVICE

      To help determine likely levels of additional verification and documentation rigor that may be required, assess the
   criticality of the product or service being built. Using an assessment that considers loss due to possible impact of
   defects, determine what a failure could result in. See Figure X3-9.

   X3.5.1 CASE STUDIES
      To illustrate how the radar chart works, here are two examples of using the model to score very different types of
   projects. The first is an example of an online drug store project (see Figure X3-12) and the second (Figure X3-13) is
   an example of a military messaging system. These two case studies illustrate some of the variances seen on projects.
   Central clustering indicates a good fit for agile approaches, peripheral scores indicate predictive approaches might be
   more suitable. Some projects are centered around the middle but then spike out on one or two axes. These projects may
   be best solved with a hybrid approach.

X3.5.1.1 DRUG STORE EXAMPLE

   The project was to develop an online drug store to sell cheaper Canadian prescription drugs to (primarily) U.S.
customers. The sale of these drugs is a contentious subject in Canada as well as the U.S. and as a result the industry
is characterized by swift regulation changes and fierce competition. The project faced extremely volatile requirements
with major changes week on week. It used very short (2-day) iterations and weekly releases to tackle the high rates
of change.
   As shown in Figure X3-12, high levels of buy-in and trust are evident for those who worked in an empowered way.
The visual nature of the website made it easy to show new increments of functionality, but the system criticality was
fairly high with essential funds for the pharmacy at stake. As mentioned, there were very high rates of change, but
the small experienced team handled them well and had easy access to a knowledgeable business representative. The
approach was very successful and extremely agile.

X3.5.1.2 MILITARY MESSAGING SYSTEM EXAMPLE

   Contrast the first example with a large project to develop military messaging system that had already been running
for 5 years when the assessment was made. See Figure X3-13.

   Buy-in for an agile approach was lacking because an agile approach was not being considered. Trust in the vendors
was mixed but generally respected. Decision making was not local, but instead made by architecture and requirements
committees. While elements of the design could be tested incrementally in a laboratory, they could not be gathered
together for an end to end demonstration of functionality. Many lives were potentially at risk, so criticality was very
high. Requirements were locked down because changes impacted so many subcontractor organizations.
   The project was large with more than 300 people from one vendor alone, but each role had many experienced
practitioners. Finally, access to the business/customer was not possible, but contract analysts were available to ask
specification questions to and they usually replied or asked clarifying questions within 10 days. Parts of the project
could have been carved off and run as agile projects, but at the heart of the initiative was a single large project.



X3.6 SUMMARY
  Agile suitability filters are useful tools for identifying potential fits and gaps for agile approaches. They should not be
used as definitive inclusion or exclusion gates, but instead as topics for objective discussion with all interested parties.
