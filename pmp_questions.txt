Change is inevitable on projects. The number of interested stakeholders, technology, the difficulty in obtaining resources, and the difficulty in motivating people to be on the team are just a few changes that may occur on projects. Projects also cause changes in the development of a new product, service, or result. The project manager wants to minimize changes on the project. Uncontrolled changes are often referred to as-
