Acknowledgments
Thank you for buying the PMP Project Management Professional Study Guide Fifth Edition
to help you study and prepare for the PMP(R) exam. Thousands of readers worldwide have
used previous editions of this book to help them study for and pass the exam. Because of their
success and their recommendations to friends and co-workers, we've been able to keep this
study guide up-to-date to match the changes made in the PMBOK(R) Guide Fourth Edition.
    I would also like to thank the countless instructors who use my book in their PMP prep
classes. I've heard from many of you over the past few months wondering when this edition
would be available. Thank you for your continued interest in using the Study Guide in your
classes. A big thanks to all the PMI chapters who use this book in their classes as well.
    A huge thank you goes to Neil Edde, vice president and publisher at Sybex, for giving me
the opportunity to revise and update this edition. Neil took a chance way back when on the
first edition of this book. I can't thank him enough for having the foresight at that time to
believe in this little known exam.
    This book clearly fits the definition of a project, and the team at Sybex is one of the best
project teams you'll ever find. I appreciate all the hard work and dedication everyone on
the team put into producing this book. A special thanks goes to Jeff Kellum, acquisitions
editor. Jeff and I have worked on several editions of this book together and I appreciate his
diligence and insightful ideas for updates to the book over the years. It's always a pleasure to
work with Jeff.
    Next I'd like to thank Alexa Murphy, development editor, for her diligent work in help-
ing me make this edition the best it can be. Her recommendations and clarifications helped
make the text much stronger. A big thanks also goes to Christine O'Connor, production
editor, for her insightful suggestions and comments and for keeping the latter stages of the
book on track. And thanks also to Judy Flynn, copyeditor, for all her help.
    There were many folks involved behind the scenes who also deserve my thanks. They are
Publication Services, Inc., proofreaders, and Nancy Guenther, indexer.
    Next I'd like to thank Terri Wagner, technical editor, for her keen eye and valuable sug-
gestions for improvements to the text. Terri is the president of Mentor Source, Inc. and
uses this book in her classes. Her suggestions came from years of classroom exposure and
student questions and suggestions. I have had the pleasure of working with Terri on several
occasions and would recommend her classes. Thanks, Terri, for helping make this the best
edition of the Study Guide ever!
    I have a special heartfelt thanks for Brett Feddersen, who served as the final technical editor
on the book. I have had the great pleasure of working with Brett over the last several years and
have delighted in our friendship and in watching him stretch and grow professionally while
dealing with the many challenges that came his way. If you are ever in need of the best project
manager in the world, Brett is your man (but you can't have him because he works for me!).
    Last, but always the first on my list, is my best friend for a couple of decades and counting,
BB. I love you and I would never have accomplished what I have to date without your love
and support. You're the best! And I'd be remiss if I didn't also thank Jason and Leah, Noelle,
Amanda and Steve, and of course the two best granddaughters on the planet, Kate and
Juliette, for their support and understanding.

Introduction
This book was designed for anyone thinking of taking the Project Management Profes-
sional (PMP(R)) exam sponsored by the Project Management Institute (PMI(R)). This certifi-
cation is growing in popularity and demand in all areas of business. PMI has experienced
explosive growth in membership over the last few years, and more and more organizations
are recognizing the importance of project management certification.


                 Although this book is written primarily for those of you taking the PMP (R)
                 exam, you can also use this book to study for the Certified Associate in
                 Project Management (CAPM(R) ) exam. The exams are similar in style, and
                 the information covered in this book will help you with either exam.

   This book has been updated to reflect the latest edition of A Guide to the Project Manage-
ment Body of Knowledge (PMBOK(R) Guide), Fourth Edition. It assumes you have knowledge
of general project management practices, although not necessarily specific to the PMBOK(R)
Guide. It's written so that you can skim through areas you are already familiar with, picking
up the specific PMBOK(R) Guide terminology where needed to pass the exam. You'll find that
the project management processes and techniques discussed in this book are defined in such
a way that you'll recognize tasks you've always done and be able to identify them with the
PMBOK(R) Guide process names or methodologies.
   PMI offers the most recognized certification in the field of project management, and
this book deals exclusively with its procedures and methods. Project management consists
of many methods, each with its own terminology, tools, and procedures. If you're familiar
with another organized project management methodology, don't assume you already know
the PMBOK(R) Guide processes. I strongly recommend that you learn all of the processes--
their key inputs, tools and techniques, and outputs. Take the time to memorize the key
terms found at the end of every chapter as well. Sometimes just understanding the defini-
tion of a term will help you answer a question. It might be that you've always done that
particular task or used the methodology described but called it by another name. Know
the name of each process and its primary purpose.


                 All of the process group names--including their inputs, tools and tech-
                 niques, outputs, and descriptions--found throughout this book are from
                 the PMBOK(R) Guide.




What Is the PMP Certification?
The PMI is the leader and the most widely recognized organization in terms of promoting
project management best practices. The PMI strives to maintain and endorse standards
xxiv          Introduction



and ethics in this field and offers publications, training, seminars, chapters, special interest
groups, and colleges to further the project management discipline.
   The PMI was founded in 1969 and first started offering the PMP(R) certification exam
in 1984. PMI is accredited as an American National Standards Institute (ANSI) standards
developer and also has the distinction of being the first organization to have its certification
program attain International Organization for Standardization (ISO) 9001 recognition.
   The PMI boasts a worldwide membership of more than 265,000, with members from
170 different countries. Local PMI chapters meet regularly and allow project managers to
exchange information and learn about new tools and techniques of project management or
new ways to use established techniques. I encourage you to join a local chapter and get to
know other professionals in your field.



Why Become PMP Certified?
The following benefits are associated with becoming PMP certified:
NN     It demonstrates proof of professional achievement.
NN     It increases your marketability.
NN     It provides greater opportunity for advancement in your field.
NN     It raises customer confidence in you and in your company's services.


Demonstrates Proof of Professional Achievement
PMP(R) certification is a rigorous process that documents your achievements in the field of
project management. The exam tests your knowledge of the disciplined approaches, method-
ologies, and project management practices as described in the PMBOK(R) Guide.
   You are required to have several years of experience in project management before sitting
for the exam, as well as 35 hours of formal project management education. Your certification
assures employers and customers that you are well grounded in project management practices
and disciplines. It shows that you have the hands-on experience and a mastery of the processes
and disciplines to manage projects effectively and motivate teams to produce successful results.


Increases Your Marketability
Many industries are realizing the importance of project management and its role in the orga-
nization. They are also seeing that simply proclaiming a head technician to be a "project
manager" does not make it so. Project management, just like engineering, information tech-
nology, and a host of other trades, has its own specific qualifications and skills. Certification
tells potential employers that you have the skills, experience, and knowledge to drive success-
ful projects and ultimately improve the company's bottom line.
                                                                         Introduction          xxv




   A certification will always make you stand out above the competition. If you're certified
and you're competing against a project manager without certification, chances are you'll come
out as the top pick. As a hiring manager, all other things being equal, I will usually opt for
the candidate who has certification over the candidate who doesn't have it. Certification tells
potential employers you have gone the extra mile. You've spent time studying techniques and
methods as well as employing them in practice. It shows dedication to your own professional
growth and enhancement and to adhering to and advancing professional standards.


Provides Opportunity for Advancement
PMP(R) certification displays your willingness to pursue growth in your professional career and
shows that you're not afraid of a little hard work to get what you want. Potential employers
will interpret your pursuit of this certification as a high-energy, success-driven, can-do attitude
on your part. They'll see that you're likely to display these same characteristics on the job,
which will help make the company successful. Your certification displays a success-oriented,
motivated attitude that will open up opportunities for future career advancements in your
current field as well as in new areas you might want to explore.


Raises Customer Confidence
Just as the PMP certification assures employers that you've got the background and expe-
rience to handle project management, it assures customers that they have a competent,
experienced project manager at the helm. Certification will help your organization sell
customers on your ability to manage their projects. Customers, like potential employers,
want the reassurance that those working for them have the knowledge and skills necessary
to carry out the duties of the position and that professionalism and personal integrity are of
utmost importance. Individuals who hold these ideals will translate their ethics and profes-
sionalism to their work. This enhances the trust customers will have in you, which in turn
will give you the ability to influence them on important project issues.



How to Become PMP Certified
You need to fulfill several requirements in order to sit for the PMP exam. The PMI has
detailed the certification process quite extensively at its website. Go to www.pmi.org , and
click the Professional Development and Careers tab to reveal the Certifications selection
and get the latest information on certification procedures and requirements.
    As of this writing, you are required to fill out an application to sit for the PMP exam. You
can submit this application online at the PMI's website. You also need to document 35 hours
of formal project management education. This might include college classes, seminars, work-
shops, and training sessions. Be prepared to list the class titles, location, date, and content.
xxvi          Introduction



   In addition to filling out the application and documenting your formal project management
training, there is one set of criteria you'll need to meet to sit for the exam. The criteria in this
set fall into two categories. You need to meet the requirements for only one of these categories:
NN     Category 1 is for those who have a baccalaureate degree. You'll need to provide proof,
       via transcripts, of your degree with your application. In addition, you'll need to complete
       verification forms--found at the PMI website--that show 4,500 hours of project manage-
       ment experience that spans a minimum of three years and no more than six years.
NN     Category 2 is for those who do not have a baccalaureate degree but do hold a high
       school diploma or equivalent. You'll need to complete verification forms documenting
       7,500 hours of project management experience that spans a minimum of five years and
       no more than eight years.
   The exam fee at the time this book is being published is $405 for PMI members in good
standing and $555 for non-PMI members. Testing is conducted at Thomson Prometric centers.
You can find a center near you on the PMI website. You have six months from the time PMI
receives and approves your completed application to take the exam. You'll need to bring a
form of identification such as a driver's license with you to the Thomson Prometric center on
the test day. You will not be allowed to take anything with you into the testing center. You will
be given a calculator, pencils, and scrap paper. You will turn in all scrap paper, including the
notes and squiggles you've jotted during the test, to the center upon completion of the exam.
   The exam is scored immediately, so you will know whether you've passed at the conclusion
of the test. You're given four hours to complete the exam, which consists of 200 randomly
generated questions. Only 175 of the 200 questions are scored. A passing score requires you
to answer 106 of the 175 questions correctly. Twenty-five of the 200 questions are "pretest"
questions that will appear randomly throughout the exam. These 25 questions are used
by PMI to determine statistical information and to determine whether they can or should
be used on future exams. The questions on the exam cover the following process groups
and areas:
NN     Initiating
NN     Planning
NN     Executing
NN     Monitoring and Controlling
NN     Closing
NN     Professional Responsibility
   All unanswered questions are scored as wrong answers, so it benefits you to guess at an
answer if you're stumped on a question.
   After you've received your certification, you'll be required to earn 60 professional develop-
ment units (PDUs) every three years to maintain certification. Approximately one hour of
structured learning translates to one PDU. The PMI website details what activities constitute a
PDU, how many PDUs each activity earns, and how to register your PDUs with PMI to main-
tain your certification. As an example, attendance at a local chapter meeting earns one PDU.
                                                                       Introduction           xxvii




How to Become CAPM Certified

If you find you don't have quite enough experience or education to sit for the PMP exam,
you should consider sitting for the Certified Associate in Project Management (CAPM)
exam. The CAPM exam is structured like the PMP exam only the requirements are not as
strict as they are for the PMP. CAPM candidates typically work in a supporting role with a
project manager or as a subproject manager. Like the PMP, CAPM has two categories of
requirements; each category requires 23 hours of project management education:

NN   Category 1 is for those who have a baccalaureate degree. You'll need to provide proof,
     via transcripts, of your degree with your application. In addition, you'll need to complete
     verification forms that show 1,500 hours of project management experience that spans
     a minimum of two years and no more than three years.
NN   Category 2 is for those who do not have a baccalaureate degree but do have a high
     school diploma or equivalent. You'll need to complete verification forms documenting
     2,500 hours of project management experience that spans a minimum of two years
     and no more than three years.

The CAPM (R) exam fee at the time of this publication is $225 for PMI members in good
standing and $300 for non-PMI members.

Included on the CD with this book is a sample CAPM exam. If you're sitting for the CAPM
exam, I encourage you to answer all of the end-of-chapter questions and take the bonus
exams in addition to the sample CAPM exam. You'll get a much broader sense of the types
of questions and the topics you'll encounter on the actual exam by using all of the sample
questions provided in this book and on the CD.




Who Should Buy This Book?
If you are serious about passing the PMP exam (or the CAPM exam for that matter),
you should buy this book and use it to study for the exam. This book is unique in that
it walks you through the project processes from beginning to end, just as projects are
performed in practice. When you read this book, you will benefit by learning specific
PMBOK(R) Guide processes and techniques coupled with real-life scenarios that describe
how project managers in different situations handle problems and the various issues all
project managers are bound to encounter during their career. This study guide describes
in detail the exam objective topics in each chapter and has attempted to cover all of the
important project management concepts.
xxviii       Introduction




How to Use This Book and CD
We've included several testing features, both in the book and on the companion CD. Following
this introduction is an assessment test that you can use to check your readiness for the actual
exam. Take this test before you start reading the book. It will help you identify the areas you
may need to brush up on. The answers to the assessment test appear after the last question
of the test. Each answer includes an explanation and a note telling you in which chapter this
material appears.
   An Exam Essentials section appears at the end of every chapter to highlight the topics
you'll most likely find on the exam and help you focus on the most important material
covered in the chapter so that you'll have a solid understanding of those concepts. How-
ever, it isn't possible to predict what questions will be covered on your particular exam,
so be sure to study everything in the chapter.


                 Like the exam itself, this Study Guide is organized in terms of process groups
                 and the natural sequence of events a project goes through in its life cycle. By
                 contrast, in other study guides, material is organized by Knowledge Area--
                 Human Resource Management, Communications Management, and so on--
                 and it can be confusing when studying for the exam to map the processes in
                 each Knowledge Area to process groups.

   Review questions are also provided at the end of every chapter. You can use these to
gauge your understanding of the subject matter before reading the chapter and to point out
the areas in which you need to concentrate your study time. As you finish each chapter,
answer the review questions and then check to see whether your answers are right--the cor-
rect answers appear on the pages following the last question. You can go back to reread the
section that deals with each question you got wrong to ensure that you answer the question
correctly the next time you are tested on the material. If you can answer at least 80 percent
of the review questions correctly, you can probably feel comfortable moving on to the next
chapter. If you can't answer that many correctly, reread the chapter, or the section that seems
to be giving you trouble, and try the questions again. You'll also find more than 200 flashcard
questions on the CD for on-the-go review. Download them right onto your PDA device for
quick and convenient reviewing.


                 Don't rely on studying the review questions exclusively as your study
                 method. The questions you'll see on the exam will be different from the
                 questions presented in the book. There are 200 randomly generated ques-
                 tions on the PMP exam and 150 on the CAPM, so it isn't possible to cover
                 every potential exam question in the Review Questions section of each
                 chapter. Make sure you understand the concepts behind the material pre-
                 sented in each chapter and memorize all the formulas as well.
                                                                      Introduction          xxix




   In addition to the assessment test and the review questions, you'll find bonus exams on the
CD. Take these practice exams just as if you were actually taking the exam (that is, without
any reference material). When you have finished the first exam, move on to the next exam to
solidify your test-taking skills. If you get more than 85 percent of the answers correct, you're
ready to take the real exam.
   The CD also contains an audio file that you can download to your favorite MP3 player
to hear a recap of the key elements covered in each chapter.
   Finally, you will notice various Real-World Scenario sidebars throughout each chapter.
These are designed to give you insight into how the various processes and topic areas apply
to real-world situations.
   Additionally, if you are going to travel but still need to study for the PMP exam and you
have a laptop with a CD drive, you can take this entire book with you just by taking the CD.
This book is available in PDF (Adobe Acrobat), so it can be easily read on any computer.


                  Also on the CD in PDF is the appendix, "Process Inputs and Outputs."



   For those of you who purchased the Deluxe Edition, you'll find a series of scenarios and
exercises that map to each chapter. These workbook exercises are designed to help you put
the theories you've learned in each chapter into practice.



The Exam Objectives
Behind every certification exam, you can be sure to find exam objectives--the broad topics in
which the exam developers want to ensure your competency. The official PMP exam objectives
are listed at the beginning of every chapter in this book.


                  Exam objectives are subject to change at any time without prior
                  notice and at PMI's sole discretion. Please visit the Certification
                  page of the PMI's website, www.pmi.org, for the most current listing
                  of exam objectives.

                               Congratulations on your decision to study for and take the
                               Project Management Institute (PMI(R)) Project Management
                               Professional (PMP) certification exam (PMP(R) Exam). This book
was written with you in mind. The focus and content of this book revolve heavily around
the information contained in A Guide to the Project Management Body of Knowledge
(PMBOK(R) Guide), Fourth Edition, published by PMI. I will refer to this guide throughout
this book and elaborate on those areas that appear on the test. Keep in mind that the test
covers all the project management processes, so don't skip anything in your study time.
   When possible, I'll pass on hints and study tips that I collected while studying for the
exam. My first tip is to familiarize yourself with the terminology used in PMBOK(R) Guide.
Volunteers from differing industries from around the globe worked together to come up with
the standards and terms used in the guide. These folks worked hard to develop and define
project management terms, and these terms are used interchangeably among industries. For
example, resource planning means the same thing to someone working in construction, infor-
mation technology, or telecommunications. You'll find many of the PMBOK(R) Guide terms
explained throughout this book. Even if you are an experienced project manager, you might
find you use specific terms for processes or actions you regularly perform but the PMBOK(R)
Guide calls them by another name. So, the first step is to get familiar with the terminology.
   The next step is to become familiar with the processes as defined in the PMBOK(R) Guide.
The process names are unique to PMI, but the general principles and guidelines underlying
the processes are used for most projects across industry areas.
   This chapter lays the foundation for building and managing your project. I'll address
project and project management definitions as well as organizational structures. Good luck!



Is It a Project?
Let's start with an example of how projects come about, and later in this section, we'll look
at a definition of a project. Consider the following scenario: You work for a wireless phone
provider, and the VP of marketing approaches you with a fabulous idea--"fabulous" because
he's the big boss and because he thought it up. He wants to set up kiosks in local grocery and
big-box stores as mini-offices. These offices will offer customers the ability to sign up for new
wireless phone services, make their wireless phone bill payments, and purchase equipment
and accessories. He believes that the exposure in grocery stores will increase awareness of the
company's offerings. After all, everyone has to eat, right? He told you that the board of direc-
tors has already cleared the project, and he'll dedicate as many resources to this as he can.
He wants the new kiosks in place in 12 stores by the end of this year. The best news is he has
assigned you to head up this project.
                                                                          Is It a Project?         3




   Your first question should be "Is it a project?" This might seem elementary, but confus-
ing projects with ongoing operations happens often. Projects are temporary in nature; have
definite start and end dates; produce a unique product, service, or result; and are completed
when their goals and objectives have been met and signed off by the stakeholders.
   When considering whether you have a project on your hands, you need to keep some
issues in mind. First, is it a project or an ongoing operation? Next, if it is a project, who
are the stakeholders? And third, what characteristics distinguish this endeavor as a project?
We'll look at each of these next.


Projects versus Operations
Projects are temporary in nature and have definitive start dates and definitive end dates. The
project is completed when its goals and objectives are accomplished to the satisfaction of the
stakeholders. Sometimes projects end when it's determined that the goals and objectives can-
not be accomplished or when the product, service, or result of the project is no longer needed
and the project is canceled. Projects exist to bring about a product, service, or result that didn't
exist before. This might include tangible products, services such as consulting or project man-
agement, and business functions that support the organization. Projects might also produce a
result or an outcome, such as a document that details the findings of a research study. In this
sense, a project is unique. However, don't get confused by the term unique. For example, Ford
Motor Company is in the business of designing and assembling cars. Each model that Ford
designs and produces can be considered a project. The models differ from each other in their
features and are marketed to people with various needs. An SUV serves a different purpose
and clientele than a luxury sedan or a hybrid. The initial design and marketing of these three
models are unique projects. However, the actual assembly of the cars is considered an opera-
tion--a repetitive process that is followed for most makes and models.
    Determining the characteristics and features of the different car models is carried out
through what the PMBOK(R) Guide terms progressive elaboration. This means the character-
istics of the product, service, or result of the project (the hybrid, for example) are determined
incrementally and are continually refined and worked out in detail as the project progresses.
More information and better estimates become available the further you progress in the proj-
ect. Progressive elaboration improves the project team's ability to manage greater levels of
detail and allows for the inevitable change that occurs throughout a project's life cycle. This
concept goes along with the temporary and unique aspects of a project because when you first
start the project, you don't know all the minute details of the end product. Product charac-
teristics typically start out broad-based at the beginning of the project and are progressively
elaborated into more and more detail over time until they are complete and finalized.



Exam Spotlight

Progressive elaboration is most often used when creating the project or product scope,
developing requirements, determining human resources, scheduling, and defining risks
and their mitigation plans.
4        Chapter 1   n   What Is a Project?




The New Website Project

You've just been charged with creating a new intranet site for your organization. At the
beginning of the project, you don't know a lot of detail other than the high-level purpose
of the project. One of the next steps is to discover the elements that should be included
on the website. For example, you might need to make available human resources policies
and procedures, travel request forms, expense reimbursement forms, and so on. At this
point, you are progressively elaborating the scope of the project. Each of these elements
will need its own progressive elaboration process to further define its requirements and
develop estimates. For example, as you interview stakeholders, you discover that travel
request forms require two electronic signatures, one from the employee's supervisor and
one from the section manager. Progressive elaboration continues throughout the project
life cycle, including defining the requirements and scope, delivering the end product or
result, and obtaining acceptance from the stakeholders.



    Operations are ongoing and repetitive. They involve work that is continuous without
an ending date, and you often repeat the same processes and produce the same results.
The purpose of operations is to keep the organization functioning, while the purpose of a
project is to meet its goals and to conclude. At the completion of a project, the end product
(or result) may get turned over to the organization's operational areas for ongoing care and
maintenance. For example, let's say your company implements a new human resources
software package that tracks employees' time, expense reports, benefits, and so on, like the
example described in the sidebar, "The New Website Project." Defining the requirements
and implementing the software is a project. The ongoing maintenance of the site, updating
content, and so on are ongoing operations.
    It's a good idea to include some members of the operational area on the project team when
certain deliverables or the end product of the project will be incorporated into their future
work processes. They can assist the project team in defining requirements, developing scope,
creating estimates, and so on, helping to assure that the project will meet their needs. This isn't
a bad strategy in helping to gain buy-in from the end users of the product or service either.
Often, business units are resistant to new systems or services, but getting them involved early
in the project rather than simply throwing the end product over the fence when it's completed
may help gain their acceptance.
    According to the PMBOK(R) Guide, there are several examples where the deliverables
from a project may integrate with business processes:
NN   Developing new products or services that the organization will market
NN   Implementing products or services that the organization will have to support as part of
     their ongoing operations
                                                                        Is It a Project?            5



NN   Implementing projects that impact the culture, organizational structure, or staffing
     levels of the organization
NN   Implementing or enhancing an information system
   The preceding list isn't all inclusive. Whenever you find yourself working on a project
that ultimately impacts your organization's business processes, I recommend you get people
from the business units to participate on the project.


Stakeholders
A project is successful when it achieves its objectives and meets or exceeds the expectations
of the stakeholders. Stakeholders are those folks (or organizations) with a vested interest in
your project. They are the people who are actively involved with the work of the project or
have something to either gain or lose as a result of the project. Stakeholder identification is
not a one-time process. You should continue to ask fellow team members and stakeholders
if there are other stakeholders who should be a part of the project.


                  Key stakeholders can make or break the success of a project. Even if all the
                  deliverables are met and the objectives are satisfied, if your key stakeholders
                  aren't happy, nobody is happy.

   The project sponsor, generally an executive in the organization with the authority to assign
resources and enforce decisions regarding the project, is a stakeholder. The project sponsor
generally serves as the tie-breaker decision maker and is one of the people on your escalation
path. The customer is a stakeholder, as are contractors and suppliers. The project manager,
the project team members, and the managers from other departments in the organization are
stakeholders as well. It's important to identify all the stakeholders in your project up front. If
you leave out an important stakeholder or their department's function and don't discover the
error until well into the project, it could be a project killer.
   Figure 1.1 shows a sample listing of the kinds of stakeholders involved in a typical project.
   Many times, stakeholders have conflicting interests. It's the project manager's respon-
sibility to understand these conflicts and try to resolve them. It's also the project man-
ager's responsibility to manage stakeholder expectations. Be certain to identify and meet
with all key stakeholders early in the project to understand their needs and constraints.
And when in doubt, you should always resolve stakeholder conflicts in favor of the
customer.


                  I'll talk more about identifying key stakeholders and their needs in Chapter 2,
                  "Creating the Project Charter." I'll discuss managing stakeholder expecta-
                  tions in Chapter 9, "Conducting Procurements and Sharing Information."

Project Characteristics
You've just learned that a project has several characteristics:
NN   Projects are unique.
NN   Projects are temporary in nature and have a definite beginning and ending date.
NN   Projects are completed when the project goals are achieved or it's determined the project
     is no longer viable.
NN   A successful project is one that meets or exceeds the expectations of your stakeholders.
  Using these criteria, let's examine the assignment from the VP of marketing to determine
whether it is a project:
Is it unique? Yes, because the kiosks don't exist now in the local grocery stores. This is a
new way of offering the company's services to its customer base. Although the service the
company is offering isn't new, the way it is presenting its services is.
Does the project have a limited time frame? Yes, the start date of this project is today, and
the end date is the end of this year. It is a temporary endeavor.
Is there a way to determine when the project is completed? Yes, the kiosks will be installed,
and services will be offered from them. Once all the kiosks are intact and operating, the proj-
ect will come to a close.

Is there a way to determine stakeholder satisfaction? Yes, the expectations of the stake-
holders will be documented in the form of deliverables and requirements during the plan-
ning processes. Some of the requirements the VP noted are that customers can sign up for
new services, pay their bills, and purchase equipment and accessories. These deliverables
and requirements will be compared to the finished product to determine whether it meets
the expectations of the stakeholder.
   Houston, we have a project.



What Is Project Management?
You've determined that you indeed have a project. What now? The notes you scratched on
the back of a napkin during your coffee break might get you started, but that's not exactly
good project management practice.
    We have all witnessed this scenario--an assignment is made, and the project team
members jump directly into the project, busying themselves with building the product,
service, or result requested. Often, careful thought is not given to the project-planning
process. I'm sure you've heard co-workers toss around statements like "That would be a
waste of valuable time" or "Why plan when you can just start building?" Project progress
in this circumstance is rarely measured against the customer requirements. In the end, the
delivered product, service, or result doesn't meet the expectations of the customer! This
is a frustrating experience for all those involved. Unfortunately, many projects follow this
poorly constructed path.
    Project management brings together a set of tools and techniques--performed by people--
to describe, organize, and monitor the work of project activities. Project managers are the
people responsible for managing the project processes and applying the tools and techniques
used to carry out the project activities. All projects are composed of processes, even if they
employ a haphazard approach. There are many advantages to organizing projects and teams
around the project management processes endorsed by PMI. We'll be examining those pro-
cesses and their advantages in depth throughout the remainder of this book.
    According to the PMBOK(R) Guide, project management involves applying knowledge,
skills, tools, and techniques during the course of the project to accomplish the project's
objective. It is the responsibility of the project manager to ensure that project management
techniques are applied and followed.

Remember that according to the PMBOK(R) Guide, the definition of project management
is applying tools, techniques, skills, and knowledge to project activities to bring about
successful results and meet the project requirements.

   Project management is a process that includes initiating a new project, planning, putting
the project plan into action, and measuring progress and performance. It involves identify-
ing the project requirements, establishing project objectives, balancing constraints, and
taking the needs and expectations of the key stakeholders into consideration. Planning is
one of the most important functions you'll perform during the course of a project. It sets
the standard for the remainder of the project's life and is used to track future project per-
formance. Before we begin the planning process, let's look at some of the ways the work of
project management is organized.


Programs
Programs are groups of related projects that are managed using the same techniques in a
coordinated fashion. When projects are managed collectively as programs, it's possible to
capitalize on benefits that wouldn't be achievable if the projects were managed separately.
This would be the case where a very large program exists with many subprojects under
it--for example, building a new shopping mall. Many subprojects exist underneath this
program, such as excavation, construction, interior design, store placement, marketing,
facilities management, and so on. Each of the subprojects is really a project unto itself. Each
subproject has its own project manager, who reports to a project manager with respon-
sibility over several of the areas, who in turn reports to the head project manager who is
responsible for the entire program. All the projects are related and are managed together so
that collective benefits are realized and controls are implemented and managed in a coordi-
nated fashion. Sometimes programs involve aspects of ongoing operations as well. After the
shopping mall in our example is built, the management of the facility becomes an ongoing
operation. The management of this collection of projects--determining their interdepen-
dencies, managing among their constraints, and resolving issues among them--is called
program management. Program management also involves centrally managing and coordi-
nating groups of related projects to meet the objectives of the program.


Portfolios
Portfolios are collections of programs and projects that support a specific business goal or
objective. Let's say our company is in the construction business. Our organization has several
business units: retail, single-family residential, and multifamily residential. Collectively, the
projects within all of these business units make up the portfolio. The program I talked about
in the preceding section (the collection of projects associated with building the new shopping
mall) is a program within our portfolio. Other programs and projects could be within this
portfolio as well. Programs and projects within a portfolio are not necessarily related to one
another in a direct way. However, the overall objective of any program or project in this port-
folio is to meet the strategic objectives of the portfolio, which in turn should meet the objec-
tives of the department and ultimately the business unit or corporation.
    Portfolio management encompasses managing the collections of programs, projects, other
work, and sometimes other portfolios. This includes weighing the value of each project, or
                                                       What Is Project Management?               9




potential project, against the business's strategic objectives. It also concerns monitoring active
projects for adherence to objectives, balancing the portfolio among the other investments of
the organization, and assuring the efficient use of resources. Portfolio management is gener-
ally performed by a senior manager who has significant experience in both project and pro-
gram management.



Exam Spotlight

Programs are collections of related projects. Portfolios consist of programs, projects, and
other portfolios that meet a business objective. Projects or programs within a portfolio
are not necessarily related or dependent on each other.




Project Management Offices
The project management office (PMO) is usually a centralized organizational unit that
oversees the management of projects and programs throughout the organization. The most
common reason a company starts a project management office is to establish and maintain
procedures and standards for project management methodologies and to manage resources
assigned to the projects in the PMO. In some organizations, project managers and team
members might report directly to the PMO and are assigned to projects as they are initi-
ated. In other organizations, the PMO may provide support functions for projects and
train employees in project management procedures and techniques. Still others, depending
on their size and function, have experts available that assist project managers in project
planning, estimating, and business assumption verification tasks. They serve as mentors to
junior-level project managers and act as consultants to the senior project managers.


                  A PMO can exist in all organizational structures--functional, projectized,
                  or matrix. (These structures will be discussed later in this chapter.) It
                  might have full authority to oversee projects, including the authority to
                  cancel projects, or it might serve only in an advisory role. PMOs might
                  also be called project offices or program management offices or Centers
                  of Excellence.

    The PMO usually has responsibility for maintaining and archiving project documenta-
tion for future reference. This office compares project goals with project progress and gives
feedback to the project teams. It also measures the project performance of active projects
and suggests corrective actions. The PMO evaluates completed projects for their adherence
to the project plan and asks questions like, "Did the project meet the time frames estab-
lished?" and "Did it stay within budget?" and "Was the quality acceptable?"
10        Chapter 1   n   What Is a Project?




                  Project managers are typically responsible for meeting the objectives of
                  the project they are managing, controlling the resources within the proj-
                  ect, and managing the individual project constraints. The PMO is respon-
                  sible for managing the objectives of a collective set of projects, managing
                  resources across the projects, and managing the interdependencies of all
                  the projects within the PMOs authority.

   Project management offices are common in organizations today, if for no other reason
than to serve as a collection point for project documentation. Some PMOs are fairly sophis-
ticated and prescribe the standards and methodologies to be used in all project phases across
the enterprise. Still others provide all these functions and also offer project management
consulting services. However, the establishment of a PMO is not required in order for you to
apply good project management practices to your next project.



There Ought to Be a Law

The importance of practicing sound project management techniques has grown significantly
over the past several years. The state of Colorado recently passed legislation requiring proj-
ect managers on large projects conducted by state employees or vendors working on behalf
of the state to be certified in project management best practices. This was an attempt to
increase the probability of project success and reduce risk. We all know that certified project
managers are not a guarantee of project success. But the state of Colorado will likely see
more projects delivered on time, on budget, and within scope because of the application of
best practices in this area and because their project managers are highly trained and have a
great deal of experience at managing projects.




Skills Every Good Project Manager Needs
Many times, organizations will knight their technical experts as project managers. The
skill and expertise that made them stars in their technical fields are mistakenly thought to
translate into project management skills. This is not necessarily so.
    Project managers are generalists with many skills in their repertoires. They are also prob-
lem solvers who wear many hats. Project managers might indeed possess technical skills, but
technical skills are not a prerequisite for sound project management skills. Your project team
should include a few technical experts, and these are the people on whom the project manager
will rely for technical details. Understanding and applying good project management tech-
niques, along with a solid understanding of general management skills, are career builders for
all aspiring project managers.

   Project managers have been likened to small-business owners. They need to know a little bit
about every aspect of management. General management skills include every area of manage-
ment, from accounting to strategic planning, supervision, personnel administration, and more.
General management skills are called into play on every project. But some projects require
specific skills in certain application areas. Application areas consist of categories of projects
that have common elements. These elements, or application areas, can be defined several ways:
by industry group (automotive, pharmaceutical), by department (accounting, marketing), and
by technical (software development, engineering) or management (procurement, research
and development) specialties. These application areas are usually concerned with disciplines,
regulations, and the specific needs of the project, the customer, or the industry. For example,
most governments have specific procurement rules that apply to their projects that wouldn't
be applicable in the construction industry. The pharmaceutical industry is acutely interested in
regulations set forth by the Food and Drug Administration. The automotive industry has little
or no concern for either of these types of regulations. Having experience in the application
area you're working in will give you a leg up when it comes to project management. Although
you can call in the experts who have application area knowledge, it doesn't hurt for you to
understand the specific aspects of the application areas of your project.
   The general management skills listed in the following sections are the foundation of
good project management practices. Your mastery of them (or lack thereof) will likely
affect project outcomes. The various skills of a project manager can be broken out in a
more or less declining scale of importance. We'll look at an overview of these skills now,
and I'll discuss each in more detail in subsequent chapters.


Communication Skills
One of the single most important characteristics of a first-rate project manager is excellent
communication skills. Written and oral communications are the backbone of all successful
projects. Many forms of communication will exist during the life of your project. As the cre-
ator or manager of most of the project communication (project documents, meeting updates,
status reports, and so on), it's your job to ensure that the information is explicit, clear, and
complete so that your audience will have no trouble understanding what has been communi-
cated. Once the information has been distributed, it is the responsibility of the person receiving
the information to make sure they understand it.


                  Many forms of communication and communication styles exist. I'll discuss
                  them more in depth in Chapter 8, "Acquiring the Project Team."




Organizational and Planning Skills
Organizational and planning skills are closely related and probably the most important
skills, after communication skills, a project manager can possess. Organization takes on
many forms. As project manager, you'll have project documentation, requirements infor-
mation, memos, project reports, personnel records, vendor quotes, contracts, and much
12        Chapter 1   n   What Is a Project?



more to track and be able to locate at a moment's notice. You will also have to organize
meetings, put together teams, and perhaps manage and organize media-release schedules,
depending on your project.
   Time management skills are closely related to organizational skills. It's difficult to stay
organized without an understanding of how you're managing your time. I recommend you
attend a time management class if you've never been to one. They have some great tips and
techniques to help you prioritize problems and interruptions, prioritize your day, and manage
your time.
   I discuss planning extensively throughout the course of this book. There isn't any aspect
of project management that doesn't first involve planning. Planning skills go hand in hand
with organizational skills. Combining these two with excellent communication skills is
almost a sure guarantee of your success in the project management field.


Budgeting Skills
Project managers establish and manage budgets and therefore need some knowledge of
finance and accounting principles. Especially important in this skill area is the ability to
perform cost estimates for project budgeting. Different methods are available to determine
the project costs. They range from estimating individual activities and rolling the estimates
up to estimating the project's cost in one big chunk. I'll discuss these methods more fully in
later chapters.
    After a budget is determined, you can start spending. This sounds more exciting than
it actually is. Reading and understanding vendor quotes, preparing or overseeing purchase
orders, and reconciling invoices are budgeting skills that the project manager will use on
most projects. These costs will be linked back to project activities and expense items in the
project's budget.


Conflict Management Skills
Show me a project, and I'll show you problems. All projects have some problems, as does,
in fact, much of everyday life. Isn't that what they say builds character? But I digress.
    Conflict management involves solving problems. Problem solving is really a twofold pro-
cess. First, you must define the problem by separating the causes from the symptoms. Often
when defining problems, you end up just describing the symptoms instead of really getting
to the heart of what's causing the problem. To avoid that, ask yourself questions like "Is it
an internal or external problem? Is it a technical problem? Are there interpersonal problems
between team members? Is it managerial? What are the potential impacts or consequences?"
These kinds of questions will help you get to the cause of the problem.
    Next, after you have defined the problem, you have some decisions to make. It will take
a little time to examine and analyze the problem, the situation causing it, and the alterna-
tives available. After this analysis, the project manager will determine the best course of
action to take and implement the decision. The timing of the decision is often as important
as the decision itself. If you make a good decision but implement it too late, it might turn
into a bad decision.
                                        Skills Every Good Project Manager Needs                 13




Negotiation and Influencing Skills
Effective problem solving requires negotiation and influencing skills. We all utilize negotia-
tion skills in one form or another every day. For example, on a nightly basis I am asked,
"Honey, what do you want for dinner?" Then the negotiations begin, and the fried chicken
versus swordfish discussion commences. Simply put, negotiating is working with others to
come to an agreement.
   Negotiation on projects is necessary in almost every area of the project, from scope defini-
tion to budgets, contracts, resource assignments, and more. This might involve one-on-one
negotiation or with teams of people, and it can occur many times throughout the project.
   Influencing is convincing the other party that swordfish is a better choice than fried
chicken, even if fried chicken is what they want. It's also the ability to get things done
through others. Influencing requires an understanding of the formal and informal struc-
ture of all the organizations involved in the project.
   Power and politics are techniques used to influence people to perform. Power is the
ability to get people to do things they wouldn't do otherwise. It's also the ability to change
minds and the course of events and to influence outcomes.


                  I'll discuss power further in Chapter 8.



   Politics involve getting groups of people with different interests to cooperate creatively
even in the midst of conflict and disorder.
   These skills will be utilized in all areas of project management. Start practicing now
because, guaranteed, you'll need these skills on your next project.


Leadership Skills
Leaders and managers are not synonymous terms. Leaders impart vision, gain consensus
for strategic goals, establish direction, and inspire and motivate others. Managers focus on
results and are concerned with getting the job done according to the requirements. Even
though leaders and managers are not the same, project managers must exhibit the charac-
teristics of both during different times on the project. Understanding when to switch from
leadership to management and then back again is a finely tuned and necessary talent.


Team-Building and Motivating Skills
Project managers will rely heavily on team-building and motivational skills. Teams are
often formed with people from different parts of the organization. These people might or
might not have worked together before, so some component of team-building groundwork
might involve the project manager. The project manager will set the tone for the project
team and will help the team members work through the various stages of team development
to become fully functional. Motivating the team, especially during long projects or when
14        Chapter 1   n   What Is a Project?



experiencing a lot of bumps along the way, is another important role the project manager
fulfills during the course of the project.
   An interesting caveat to the team-building role is that project managers many times are
responsible for motivating team members who are not their direct reports. This has its own set
of challenges and dilemmas. One way to help this situation is to ask the functional manager to
allow you to participate in your project team members' performance reviews. Use the negotia-
tion and influencing skills I talked about earlier to make sure you're part of this process.



Multiple Dimensions

Project managers are an interesting bunch. They know a little bit about a lot of topics
and are excellent communicators. They have the ability to motivate people, even those
who have no reason to be loyal to the project, and they can make the hard-line calls
when necessary. Project managers can get caught in sticky situations that occasionally
require making decisions that are good for the company (or the customer) but aren't
good for certain stakeholders. These offended stakeholders will then drag their feet, and
the project manager has to play the heavy in order to motivate and gain their coopera-
tion again. Some organizations hire contract project managers to run their large, com-
pany-altering projects just because they don't want to burn out a key employee in this
role. Fortunately, that doesn't happen often.



   Now that you've been properly introduced to some of the skills you need in your tool
kit, you'll know to be prepared to communicate, solve problems, lead, and negotiate your
way through your next project.



Understanding Organizational Structures
Just as projects are unique, so are the organizations in which they're carried out. Organiza-
tions have their own styles and cultures that influence how project work is performed. One
of the keys to determining the type of organization you work in is measuring how much
authority senior management is willing to delegate to project managers. Although unique-
ness abounds in business cultures, all organizations are structured in one of three ways:
functional, projectized, or matrix. It's helpful to know and understand the organizational
structure and the culture of the entity in which you're working. Companies with aggressive
cultures that are comfortable in a leading-edge position within their industries are highly
likely to take on risky projects. Project managers who are willing to suggest new ideas and
projects that have never been undertaken before are likely to receive a warm reception in
this kind of environment. Conversely, organizational cultures that are risk averse and prefer
the follow-the-leader position within their industries are highly unlikely to take on risky
endeavors. Project managers with risk-seeking, aggressive styles are likely to receive a cool
reception in a culture like this.

   The level of authority the project manager enjoys is denoted by the organizational struc-
ture. For example, a project manager within a functional organization has little to no formal
authority. And their title might not be project manager; instead, they might be called a project
leader, a project coordinator, or perhaps a project expeditor.
   We'll now take a look at each of these types of organizations individually to better
understand how the project management role works in each one.


Functional Organizations
One common type of organization is the functional organization. Chances are you have
worked in this type of organization. This is probably the oldest style of organization and is
therefore known as the traditional approach to organizing businesses.
    Functional organizations are centered on specialties and grouped by function, which
is why it's called functional organization. As an example, the organization might have a
human resources department, finance department, marketing department, and so on. The
work in these departments is specialized and requires people who have the skill sets and
experiences in these specialized functions to perform specific duties for the department.
Figure 1.2 shows a typical organizational chart for a functional organization.
    You can see that this type of organization is set up to be a hierarchy. Staff personnel report
to managers who report to department heads who report to vice presidents who report to the
CEO. In other words, each employee reports to only one manager; ultimately, one person at
the top is in charge. Many companies today, as well as governmental agencies, are structured
in a hierarchical fashion. In organizations like this, be aware of the chain of command. A
strict chain of command might exist, and the corporate culture might dictate that you follow
it. Roughly translated: Don't talk to the big boss without first talking to your boss who talks
to their boss who talks to the big boss. Wise project managers should determine whether
there is a chain of command, how strictly it's enforced, and how the chain is linked before
venturing outside it.

16       Chapter 1   n   What Is a Project?



    Each department or group in a functional organization is managed independently and
has a limited span of control. Marketing doesn't run the finance department or its projects,
for example. The marketing department is concerned with its own functions and projects.
If it were necessary for the marketing department to get input from the finance department
on a project, the marketing team members would follow the chain of command. A market-
ing manager would speak to a manager in finance to get the needed information and then
pass it back down to the project team.

Human Resources in a Functional Organization
Commonalities exist among the personnel assigned to the various departments in a func-
tional organization. In theory, people with similar skills and experiences are easier to man-
age as a group. Instead of scattering them throughout the organization, it is more efficient
to keep them functioning together. Work assignments are easily distributed to those who
are best suited for the task when everyone with the same skill works together. Usually, the
supervisors and managers of these workers are experienced in the area they supervise and
are able to recommend training and career enrichment activities for their employees.


                 Workers in functional organizations specialize in an area of expertise--
                 finance or personnel administration, for instance--and then become very
                 good at their specialty.

  People in a functional organization can see a clear upward career path. An assistant
budget analyst might be promoted to a budget analyst and then eventually to a department
manager over many budget analysts.

The Downside of Functional Organizations
Functional organizations have their disadvantages. If this is the kind of organization you
work in, you probably have experienced some of them.
   One of the greatest disadvantages for the project manager is that they have little to
no formal authority. This does not mean project managers in functional organizations
are doomed to failure. Many projects are undertaken and successfully completed within
this type of organization. Good communication and interpersonal and influencing skills
on the part of the project manager are required to bring about a successful project under
this structure.
   In a functional organization, the vice president or senior department manager is usually
the one responsible for projects. The title of project manager denotes authority, and in a
functional structure, that authority rests with the VP.

Managing Projects in a Functional Organization
Projects are typically undertaken in a divided approach in a functional organization. For
example, the marketing department will work on its portion of the project and then hand it
                                        Understanding Organizational Structures               17




off to the manufacturing department to complete its part, and so on. The work the market-
ing department does is considered a marketing project, while the work the manufacturing
department does is considered a manufacturing project.
   Some projects require project team members from different departments to work
together at the same time on various aspects of the project. Project team members in this
structure will more than likely remain loyal to their functional managers. The functional
manager is responsible for their performance reviews, and their career opportunities lie
within the functional department--not within the project team. Exhibiting leadership
skills by forming a common vision regarding the project and the ability to motivate people
to work toward that vision are great skills to exercise in this situation. As previously men-
tioned, it also doesn't hurt to have the project manager work with the functional manager
in contributing to the employee's performance review.

Resource Pressures in a Functional Organization
Competition for resources and project priorities can become fierce when multiple projects are
undertaken within a functional organization. For example, in my organization, it's common
to have competing project requests from three or more departments all vying for the same
resources. Thrown into the heap is the requirement to make, for example, mandated tax law
changes, which automatically usurps all other priorities. This sometimes causes frustration
and political infighting. One department thinks their project is more important than another
and will do anything to get that project pushed ahead of the others. Again, it takes great skill
and diplomatic abilities to keep projects on track and functioning smoothly. In Chapter 2,
"Creating the Project Charter," I'll discuss the importance of gaining stakeholder buy-in, and
in Chapter 5, "Developing the Project Budget," I'll talk about the importance of communica-
tion to avert some of these problems.
   Project managers have little authority in functional organizations, but with the right
skills, they can successfully accomplish many projects. Table 1.1 highlights the advantages
and disadvantages of this type of organization.

Projectized Organizations
Projectized organizations are nearly the opposite of functional organizations. The focus of
this type of organization is the project itself. The idea behind a projectized organization is
to develop loyalty to the project, not to a functional manager.
   Figure 1.3 shows a typical organizational chart for a projectized organization.

   Organizational resources are dedicated to projects and project work in purely projec-
tized organizations. Project managers almost always have ultimate authority over the proj-
ect in this structure and report directly to the CEO. In a purely projectized organization,
supporting functions such as human resources and accounting might report directly to the
project manager as well. Project managers are responsible for making decisions regard-
ing the project and acquiring and assigning resources. They have the authority to choose
and assign resources from other areas in the organization or to hire them from outside if
needed. For example, if there isn't enough money in the budget to hire additional resources,
the project manager will have to come up with alternatives to solve this problem. This is
known as a constraint. Project managers in all organizational structures are limited by
constraints such as scope, schedule, and cost (or budget). Quality is sometimes considered a
constraint, and it's generally affected by scope, schedule, and/or cost. We'll talk more about
constraints in Chapter 2, "Creating the Project Charter."


                  You may come across the term triple constraints in your studies. The term
                  refers to scope, schedule, and cost, and there is a potential you may see
                  a question regarding the triple constraints on the exam. However, please
                  note that the PMBOK(R) Guide lists the constraints of a project as scope,
                  schedule, cost, and quality.

   Teams are formed and often co-located, which means team members physically work
at the same location. Project team members report to the project manager, not to a func-
tional or departmental manager. One obvious drawback to a projectized organization is
that project team members might find themselves out of work at the end of the project. An
example of this might be a consultant who works on a project until completion and then is
put on the bench or let go at the end of the project. Some inefficiency exists in this kind of
organization when it comes to resource utilization. If you have a situation where you need a
highly specialized skill at certain times throughout the project, the resource you're using to
perform this function might be idle during other times in the project.
   In summary, you can identify projectized organizations in several ways:
NN   Project managers have ultimate authority over the project.
NN   The focus of the organization is the project.
NN   The organization's resources are focused on projects and project work.
NN   Team members are co-located.
NN   Loyalties are formed to the project, not to a functional manager.
NN   Project teams are dissolved at the conclusion of the project.



The Projectized Graphic Artist

You've been appointed project manager for your company's website design and implemen-
tation. You're working in a projectized organization, so you have the authority to acquire
and assign resources. You put together your team, including programmers, technical writ-
ers, testers, and business analysts. Julianne, a highly qualified graphic arts designer, is
also part of your team. Julianne's specialized graphic arts skills are needed only at certain
times throughout the project. When she has completed the graphic design portion of the
screen she's working on, she doesn't have anything else to do until the next page is ready.
Depending on how involved the project is and how the work is structured, days or weeks
might pass before Julianne's skills are needed. This is where the inefficiency occurs in a
purely projectized organization. The project manager will have to find other duties that Juli-
anne can perform during these down times. It's not practical to let her go and then hire her
back when she's needed again.

In this situation, you might assign Julianne to other project duties when she's not working
on graphic design. Perhaps she can edit the text for the web pages or assist with the design
of the upcoming marketing campaign. You might also share her time with another project
manager in the organization.

During the planning process, you will discover the skills and abilities of all your team
members so that you can plan their schedules accordingly and eliminate idle time.

Matrix Organizations
Matrix organizations came about to minimize the differences between, and take advantage
of, the strengths and weaknesses of functional and projectized organizations. The idea at
play here is that the best of both organizational structures can be realized by combining
them into one. The project objectives are fulfilled and good project management techniques
are utilized while still maintaining a hierarchical structure in the organization.
    Employees in a matrix organization report to one functional manager and to at least one
project manager. It's possible that employees could report to multiple project managers if
they are working on multiple projects at one time. Functional managers pick up the admin-
istrative portion of the duties and assign employees to projects. They also monitor the work
of their employees on the various projects. Project managers are responsible for executing
the project and giving out work assignments based on project activities. Project managers
and functional managers share the responsibility of performance reviews for the employee.


                 In a nutshell, in a matrix organization, functional managers assign employees
                 to projects, while project managers assign tasks associated with the project.

   Matrix organizations have unique characteristics. We'll look at how projects are con-
ducted and managed and how project and functional managers share the work in this orga-
nizational structure next.

Project Focus in a Matrix Organization
Matrix organizations allow project managers to focus on the project and project work just
as in a projectized organization. The project team is free to focus on the project objectives
with minimal distractions from the functional department.
   Project managers should take care when working up activity and project estimates for the
project in a matrix organization. The estimates should be given to the functional managers for
input before publishing. The functional manager is the one in charge of assigning or freeing
up resources to work on projects. If the project manager is counting on a certain employee to
work on the project at a certain time, the project manager should determine their availability
up front with the functional manager. Project estimates might have to be modified if it's dis-
covered that the employee they were counting on is not available when needed.

Balance of Power in a Matrix Organization
As we've discussed, a lot of communication and negotiation takes place between the project
manager and the functional manager. This calls for a balance of power between the two, or
one will dominate the other.
   In a strong matrix organization, the balance of power rests with the project manager. They
have the ability to strong-arm the functional managers into giving up their best resources for
projects. Sometimes, more resources than necessary are assembled for the project, and then
project managers negotiate these resources among themselves, cutting out the functional man-
ager altogether, as you can see in Figure 1.4.

   On the other end of the spectrum is the weak matrix (see Figure 1.5). As you would
suspect, the functional managers have all the power in this structure. Project managers are
really project coordinators or expeditors with part-time responsibilities on projects in a
weak matrix organization. Project managers have little to no authority, just as in the func-
tional organization. On the other hand, the functional managers have a lot of authority and
make all the work assignments. The project manager simply expedites the project.
   In between the weak matrix and the strong matrix is an organizational structure called
the balanced matrix (see Figure 1.6). The features of the balanced matrix are what I've
been discussing throughout this section. The power is balanced between project managers
and functional managers. Each manager has responsibility for their parts of the project or
organization, and employees get assigned to projects based on the needs of the project, not
the strength or weakness of the manager's position.

    Matrix organizations have subtle differences, and it's important to understand their dif-
ferences for the PMP exam. The easiest way to remember them is that the weak matrix has
many of the same characteristics as the functional organization, while the strong matrix has
many of the same characteristics as the projectized organization. The balanced matrix is
exactly that--a balance between weak and strong, where the project manager shares author-
ity and responsibility with the functional manager. Table 1.2 compares all three structures.

   Most organizations today use some combination of the organizational structures
described here. They're a composite of functional, projectized, and matrix structures. It's
rare that an organization would be purely functional or purely projectized. For example,
projectized structures can coexist within functional organizations.
   In the case of a high-profile, critical project, the functional organization might appoint a
special project team to work only on that project. The team is structured outside the bounds
of the functional organization, and the project manager has ultimate authority for the project.
This is a workable project management approach and ensures open communication between
the project manager and team members. At the end of the project, the project team is dis-
solved, and the project members return to their functional areas to resume their usual duties.



Exam Spotlight

Understand the characteristics of each organizational structure and their strengths and
weaknesses for the exam.



   Organizations are unique, as are the projects they undertake. Understanding the orga-
nizational structure will help you, as a project manager, with the cultural influences and
communication avenues that exist in the organization to gain cooperation and successfully
bring your projects to a close.



Understanding Project Life Cycles and
Project Management Processes
Project life cycles are similar to the life cycle that parents experience raising their children
to adulthood. Children start out as infants and generate lots of excitement wherever they
go. However, not much is known about them at first. So, you study them as they grow, and
you assess their needs. Over time, they mature and grow (and cost a lot of money in the
process), until one day the parents' job is done.
   Projects start out just like this and progress along a similar path. Someone comes up
with a great idea for a project and actively solicits support for it. The project, after being
approved, progresses through the intermediate phases to the ending phase, where it is com-
pleted and closed out.


Project Phases and Project Life Cycles
Most projects are divided into phases, and all projects, large or small, have a similar project
life cycle structure. Project phases generally consist of segments of work that allow for easier
management, planning, and control of the work. The work and the deliverables produced
24        Chapter 1    n   What Is a Project?



during the phase are typically unique to that phase. Some projects may consist of one phase
and others may have many phases.
    The number of phases depends on the project complexity and the industry. For example,
information technology projects might progress through phases such as requirements, design,
program, test, and implement. All the collective phases the project progresses through in
concert are called the project life cycle. Project life cycles are similar for all projects regardless
of their size or complexity. The phases that occur within the project life cycle are sequential
and sometimes overlap each other. Most projects include at least the following four project
life cycles (not to be confused with the project process groups that we'll discuss in the section
titled "Project Management Process Groups"):
NN   Beginning the project
NN   Planning and organizing the work of the project
NN   Performing the work of the project
NN   Closing out the project
    The end of each phase within the life cycle structure allows the project manager, stake-
holders, and project sponsor the opportunity to determine whether the project should
continue to the next phase. In order to progress to the next phase, the deliverable from the
phase before it must be reviewed for accuracy and approved. As each phase is completed,
it's handed off to the next phase. We'll look at handoffs and progressions through these
phases next.

Handoffs
Project phases evolve through the life cycle in a series of phase sequences called handoffs,
or technical transfers. For projects that consist of sequential phases, the end of one phase
typically marks the beginning of the next. For example, in the construction industry, feasi-
bility studies often take place in the beginning phase of a project and are completed prior to
the beginning of the next phase.
   The purpose of the feasibility study is to determine whether the project is worth under-
taking and whether the project will be profitable to the organization. A feasibility study is a
preliminary assessment of the viability of the project; the viability or perhaps marketability
of the product, service, or result of the project; and the project's value to the organization.
It might also determine whether the product, service, or result of the project is safe and
meets industry or governmental standards and regulations. The completion and approval of
the feasibility study triggers the beginning of the requirements phase, where requirements
are documented and then handed off to the design phase, where blueprints are produced.
The feasibility might also show that the project is not worth pursuing and the project is
then terminated; thus, the next phase never begins.

Phase Completion
You will recognize phase completion because each phase has a specific deliverable, or multiple
deliverables, that marks the end of the phase. A deliverable is an output that must be pro-
duced, reviewed, and approved to bring the phase or project to completion. Deliverables are
         Understanding Project Life Cycles and Project Management Processes                      25




tangible and can be measured and easily proved. For instance, a deliverable produced in the
beginning phase of a construction industry project might be the feasibility study. Deliverables
might also include things such as design documents, project budgets, blueprints, project sched-
ules, prototypes, and so on.
   A phase-end review allows those involved with the work to determine whether the project
should continue to the next phase. The successful conclusion of one phase does not guarantee
authorization to begin the next phase. The feasibility study mentioned earlier might show
that environmental impacts of an enormous nature would result if the construction project
were undertaken at the proposed location. Based on this information, a go or no-go decision
can be made at the end of the phase. Phase-end reviews give the project manager the ability to
discover, address, and take corrective action against errors discovered during the phase.


                  The PMBOK(R)Guide states that phase-ending reviews are also known by
                  a few other names: phase exits, phase gates, milestones, stage gates,
                  decision gates, and kill points.



Multi-Phased Projects
Projects may consist of one or more phases. The phases of a project are often performed
sequentially, but there are situations where performing phases concurrently, or overlapping
the start date of a sequential phase, can benefit the project. According to the PMBOK(R)
Guide there are three types of phase-to-phase relationships:
Sequential relationships    One phase must finish before the next phase can begin.
Overlapping relationships     One phase starts before the prior phase completes.
Iterative relationships Work for subsequent phases are planned as the work of the previous
phase is performed.
   Sometimes phases are overlapped to shorten or compress the project schedule. This is
called fast tracking. Fast tracking means that a later phase is started prior to completing
and approving the phase, or phases, that come before it. This technique is used to shorten
the overall duration of the project.
   Project phases are performed within a project life cycle as I mentioned earlier in this sec-
tion. Project life cycles typically consist of initiating the project, performing the work of the
project, and so on. As a result, most projects have the following characteristics in common:
NN   In the beginning of the project life cycle, when the project is initiated, costs are low,
     and few team members are assigned to the project.
NN   As the project progresses, costs and staffing increase and then taper off at closing.
NN   The potential that the project will come to a successful ending is lowest at the begin-
     ning of the project; its chance for success increases as the project progresses through its
     phases and life cycle stages.
NN   Risk is highest at the beginning of the project and gradually decreases the closer the
     project comes to completion.
26        Chapter 1   n   What Is a Project?



NN   Stakeholders have the greatest chance of influencing the project and the characteristics
     of the product, service, or result of the project in the beginning phases and have less
     and less influence as the project progresses.
   This same phenomenon exists within the project management processes as well. We'll
look at those next.


Project Management Process Groups
Project management processes organize and describe the work of the project. The
PMBOK(R) Guide describes five process groups used to accomplish this end. These pro-
cesses are performed by people and, much like project phases, are interrelated and
dependent on one another.
   These are the five project management process groups that the PMBOK(R)Guide documents:
NN   Initiating
NN   Planning
NN   Executing
NN   Monitoring and Controlling
NN   Closing
   All these process groups have individual processes that collectively make up the group. For
example, the Initiating process group has two processes called Develop Project Charter and
Identify Stakeholders. Collectively, these process groups--including all their individual pro-
cesses--make up the project management process. Projects start with the Initiating process
and progress through all the processes in the Planning process group, the Executing process
group, and so on, until the project is successfully completed or it's canceled. All projects must
complete the Closing processes, even if a project is killed.


                  Don't confuse project phases and life cycles with the project management
                  process groups. Project phases and life cycles describe how the work
                  associated with the product of the project will be completed. For example,
                  a construction project might have phases such as feasibility study, design,
                  build, inspection, and turnover. The five project management process
                  groups (Initiating, Planning, Executing, Monitoring and Controlling, and
                  Closing) organize and describe how the project activities will be conducted
                  in order to meet the project requirements. These processes are generally
                  performed for each phase of a large project. The five process groups are
                  the heart of the PMBOK(R) Guide and the exam. As you progress through
                  this book, be certain you understand each of these processes as they're
                  described in the PMBOK(R)Guide.

   Let's start with a high-level overview of each process group. The remainder of this book
will cover each of these processes in detail. If you want to peek ahead, Appendix A lists
each of the process groups, the individual processes that make up each process group, and

the Knowledge Areas in which they belong. (I'll introduce Knowledge Areas in the section
"Exploring the Project Management Knowledge Areas" in Chapter 2.)
Initiating The Initiating process group, as its name implies, occurs at the beginning of the
project and at the beginning of each project phase for large projects. Initiating acknowl-
edges that a project, or the next project phase, should begin. This process group grants the
approval to commit the organization's resources to working on the project or phase and
authorizes the project manager to begin working on the project. The outputs of the Initi-
ating process group, including the project charter and identification of the stakeholders,
become inputs into the Planning process group.
Planning The Planning process is the process group of formulating and revising project
goals and objectives and creating the project management plan that will be used to achieve
the goals the project was undertaken to address. The Planning process group also involves
determining alternative courses of action and selecting from among the best of those to
produce the project's goals. This process group is where the project requirements are fleshed
out and stakeholders are identified. Planning has more processes than any of the other
project management process groups. In order to carry out their functions, the Executing,
Monitoring and Controlling, and Closing process groups all rely on the Planning processes
and the documentation produced during the Planning processes. Project managers will
perform frequent iterations of the Planning processes prior to project completion. Projects
are unique and, as such, have never been done before. Therefore, Planning must encompass
all areas of project management and consider budgets, activity definition, scope planning,
schedule development, risk identification, staff acquisition, procurement planning, and
more. The greatest conflicts a project manager will encounter in this process group are
project prioritization issues.
Executing The Executing process group involves putting the project management plan into
action. It's here that the project manager will coordinate and direct project resources to meet
the objectives of the project plan. The Executing processes keeps the project plan on track
and ensures that future execution of project plans stays in line with project objectives. This
process group is typically where approved changes are implemented. The Executing process
group will utilize the most project time and resources, and as a result, costs are usually high-
est during the Executing processes. Project managers will experience the greatest conflicts
over schedules in this cycle.
Monitoring and Controlling The Monitoring and Controlling process group is where
project performance measurements are taken and analyzed to determine whether the project
is staying true to the project plan. The idea is to identify problems as soon as possible and
apply corrective action to control the work of the project and assure successful outcomes. For
example, if you discover that variances exist, you'll apply corrective action to get the project
activities realigned with the project plan. This might require additional passes through the
Planning processes to adjust project activities, resources, schedules, budgets, and so on.


                  Monitoring and Controlling is used to track the progress of work being
                  performed and identify problems and variances within a process group as
                  well as the project as a whole.
28         Chapter 1   n   What Is a Project?



Closing The Closing process group is probably the most often skipped process group
in project management. Closing brings a formal, orderly end to the activities of a project
phase or to the project itself. Once the project objectives have been met, most of us are
ready to move on to the next project. However, Closing is important because all the project
information is gathered and stored for future reference. The documentation collected dur-
ing the Closing process group can be reviewed and utilized to avert potential problems on
future projects. Contract closeout occurs here, and formal acceptance and approval are
obtained from project stakeholders.



Exam Spotlight

The project manager and project team are responsible for determining which processes
within each process group are appropriate for the project on which you're working. This
is called tailoring. You should consider the size and complexity of the project and the vari-
ous inputs and outputs of each of the processes when determining which processes to
implement and perform. Small, independent projects might not require the rigor of each
of the processes within a process group, but every process should be addressed and its
level of implementation determined. Use your judgment when deciding which processes
to follow, particularly for small projects.




Characteristics of the Process Groups
The progression through the project management process groups exhibits the same char-
acteristics as progression through the project phases. That is, costs are lowest during the
Initiating processes, and few team members are involved. Costs and staffing increase in the
Executing process group and then decrease as you approach the Closing process group. The
chances for success are lowest during Initiating and highest during Closing. The chances
for risks occurring are higher during Initiating, Planning, and Executing, but the impacts of
risks are greater during the later processes. Stakeholders have the greatest influence during
the Initiating and Planning processes and less and less influence as you progress through
Executing, Monitoring and Controlling, and Closing. To give you a better idea of when
certain characteristics influence a project, refer to Table 1.3.

The Process Flow
You should not think of the five process groups as one-time processes that are performed as
discrete elements. Rather, these processes interact and overlap with each other. They are itera-
tive and might be revisited and revised throughout the project's life several times as the project
is refined. The PMBOK(R)Guide calls this process of going back through the process groups an
iterative process. The conclusion of each process group allows the project manager and stake-
holders to reexamine the business needs of the project and determine whether the project is
satisfying those needs. And it is another opportunity to make a go or no-go decision.
    Figure 1.7 shows the five process groups in a typical project. Keep in mind that during
phases of a project, the Closing process group can provide input to the Initiating process
group. For example, once the feasibility study discussed earlier is accepted or closed, it
becomes an input to the Initiating process group of the design phase.
    It's important to understand the flow of these processes for the exam. If you remember
the processes and their inputs and outputs, it will help you when you're trying to decipher
an exam question. The outputs of one process group may in some cases become the inputs
into the next process group (or the outputs might be a deliverable of the project). Sometimes
just understanding which process the question is asking about will help you determine the
answer. One trick you can use to memorize these processes is to remember syrup of ipecac.
You probably have some of this poison antidote in your medicine cabinet at home. If you
think of the Monitoring and Controlling process group as simply "Controlling," when you
sound out the first initial of each of the processes, it sounds like "ipecac"--IPECC (Initiat-
ing, Planning, Executing, Monitoring and Controlling, and Closing).
    As I stated earlier, individual processes make up each of the process groups. For exam-
ple, the Closing life cycle process group consists of two processes: Close Project and Phase
and Close Procurements. Each process takes inputs and uses them in conjunction with vari-
ous tools and techniques to produce outputs.

                 It's outside the scope of this book to explain all the inputs, tools and tech-
                 niques, and outputs for each process in each process group (although each
                 is listed in Appendix A). You'll find all the inputs, tools and techniques, and
                 outputs detailed in the PMBOK(R) Guide, and I highly recommend you get
                 familiar with them.




Exam Spotlight

Understand each project management process group and all the processes that make up
these groups. Appendix A contains a table of all the processes, their inputs, their tools
and techniques, their outputs, and the Knowledge Area in which they each belong. (I'll
introduce Knowledge Areas in the section "The Project Management Knowledge Areas"
in Chapter 2.)



   You'll see test questions regarding inputs, tools and techniques, and outputs of many of
the processes within each process group. One way to keep them all straight is to remember
that tools and techniques usually require action of some sort, be it measuring, applying some
skill or technique, planning, or using expert judgment. Outputs are usually in the form of a
deliverable. Remember that a deliverable is characterized with results or outcomes that can
be measured, are tangible, and are provable. Last but not least, outputs from one process
sometimes serve as inputs to another process.

Process Interactions
We've covered a lot of material, but I'll explain one more concept before concluding. As
stated earlier, project managers must determine the processes that are appropriate for
effectively managing a project based on the complexity and scope of the project, available
resources, budget, and so on. As the project progresses, the project management processes
might be revisited and revised to update the project management plan as more informa-
tion becomes known. Underlying the concept that process groups are iterative is a cycle the
PMBOK(R)Guide describes as the Plan-Do-Check-Act cycle, which was originally defined by
Walter Shewhart and later modified by Edward Deming. The idea behind this concept is that
each element in the cycle is results oriented. The results from the Plan cycle become inputs
into the Do cycle, and so on, much like the way the project management process groups
interact. The cycle interactions can be mapped to work in conjunction with the five project
management process groups. For example, the Plan cycle maps to the Planning process group.
Before going any further, here's a brief refresher:
NN   Project phases describe how the work required to produce the product of the project
     will be completed.
NN   Project management process groups organize and describe how the project activities
     will be completed in order to meet the goals of the project.
NN   The Plan-Do-Check-Act cycle is an underlying concept that shows the integrative
     nature of the process groups.
   Figure 1.8 shows the relationships and interactions of the concepts you've learned so far.
Please bear in mind that a simple figure can't convey all the interactions and iterative nature
of these interactions; however, I think you'll see that the figure ties the basic elements of
these concepts together.



Understanding How This Applies
to Your Next Project
As you can tell from this first chapter, managing projects is not for the faint of heart. You
must master multiple skills and techniques in order to complete projects successfully. In
your day-to-day work environment, it probably doesn't matter much if you're working in a
functional or strong matrix organization. More important are your communication, con-
flict management, and negotiation and influencing skills. And good communications are
the hallmark of successful projects. (We'll talk more about communication and give you
some communication tips in the coming chapters.)
    In any organizational structure, you'll find leaders, and you'll find people who have
the title of leader. Again, the organizational structure itself probably isn't as important as
knowing who the real leaders and influencers are in the organization. These are the people
you'll lean on to help with difficult project decisions and hurdles.

    I talked about the definition of a project in this chapter. You'd be surprised how many
people think ongoing operations are projects. Here's a tip to help you explain the definition to
your stakeholders: projects involve the five project process groups (Initiating through Closing).
Ongoing operations typically involve the Planning, Executing, and Monitoring and Control-
ling processes. But here's the differentiator--ongoing operations don't include Initiating or
Closing process groups because ongoing operations don't have a beginning or an end.
    Most projects I've ever worked on involved more than one stakeholder. And stakeholders
often have conflicting interests. On your next project, make certain to find out what those
stakeholder interests are. It's easier to resolve conflicts at the beginning of the project than
it is at the end. Resolving conflicts will likely involve negotiating and influencing skills.
    I've made the mistake of thinking the project process groups are overkill for a small project.
My team once embarked on a small project and thought that within a matter of weeks we'd
have it wrapped up and delivered. We neglected to get signatures from the project requestor
on the agreed-upon scope, and you guessed it, the scope grew and grew and changed several
times before we were able to get the project back under control. If you're reading between the
lines here, you can also tell we didn't have adequate change control in place. As you progress
                                                                    Exam Essentials            33




through the book, I'll highlight the important processes you'll want to include on all projects,
large and small, so you don't get caught in this trap.



Summary
Phew! I covered a lot of ground in this chapter. You learned that projects exist to bring about
a unique product, service, or result. Projects are temporary in nature and have definite begin-
ning and ending dates.
    Stakeholders are those people or organizations that have a vested interest in the outcome
of the project. Stakeholders include people such as the project sponsor, the customer, key
management personnel, the project manager, contractors, suppliers, and more. Projects are
considered complete when the project meets or exceeds the expectations of the stakeholders.
    Project management is a discipline that brings together a set of tools and techniques to
describe, organize, and monitor the work of project activities. Project managers are the ones
responsible for carrying out these activities. Projects might be organized into programs or
portfolios and might be managed centrally by a PMO.
    Project managers have a wide variety of skills. They should they be versed not only in
the field they're working in but in general management skills as well. Communication is the
most important skill a project manager will use in the course of a project.
    Organizational structures come in variations of three forms: functional, projectized, and
matrix. Functional organizations are traditional with hierarchical reporting structures. Project
managers have little to no authority in this kind of organization. Projectized organizations are
structured around project work, and staff personnel report to project managers. Project man-
agers have full authority in this organizational structure. Matrix organizations are a combina-
tion of the functional and projectized. A project manager's authority varies depending on the
structure of the matrix, be it a weak matrix, a balanced matrix, or a strong matrix.
    Projects progress through phases along a life cycle path to complete the product of the
project. The project management process groups are performed throughout the project's
life cycle. The process groups described in the PMBOK(R) Guide are Initiating, Planning,
Executing, Monitoring and Controlling, and Closing.



Exam Essentials
Be able to describe the difference between projects and operations. A project is temporary in
nature with a definite beginning and ending date. Projects produce unique products, services,
or results. Operations are ongoing and use repetitive processes that typically produce the same
result over and over.
Be able to denote some of the skills every good project manager should possess. Commu-
nication, budgeting, organizational, problem solving, negotiation and influencing, leading,
and team building are skills a project manager should possess.
34        Chapter 1   n   What Is a Project?



Be able to differentiate the different organizational structures and the project manager's
authority in each. Organizations are usually structured in some combination of the follow-
ing: functional, projectized, and matrix (including weak matrix, balanced matrix, and strong
matrix). Project managers have the most authority in a projectized organization and the least
amount of authority in a functional organization.
Be able to name the five project management process groups. The five project management
process groups are Initiating, Planning, Executing, Monitoring and Controlling, and Closing.

Key Terms
I've introduced the processes you'll use while managing projects. You need to understand
each of these processes to be an effective project manager and know them by the names
used in the PMBOK(R) Guide to be successful on the exam. I will discuss each in greater
detail in the chapters to come.

Closing
Executing
Initiating
Monitoring and Controlling
Planning

   You've learned many new key words in this chapter. PMI has worked hard to develop
and define standard project management terms that apply across industries. Here is a list
of some of the terms you came across in this chapter:

balanced matrix                              power
co-located                                   product scope
deliverable                                  program management
fast tracking                                programs
feasibility study                            progressive elaboration
functional organization                      project life cycle
handoffs                                     project management
iterative                                    project management office
leaders                                      project managers
managers                                     project scope
matrix organizations                         project sponsor
operations                                   projectized organizations
politics                                     projects
portfolio management                         stakeholders
portfolios                                   tailoring

     the following is true?
     A. This is a project because this new product line has never been manufactured and sold
        by this company before.
     B.   This is an ongoing operation because the company is in the business of manufacturing
          kitchen appliances. Introducing designer colors and features is simply a new twist on
          an existing process.
     C.   This is an ongoing operation because the new product line will be sold indefinitely. It's
          not temporary.
     D.   This is not a project or an ongoing operation. This is a new product introduction not
          affecting ongoing operations.

4.   Your company manufactures small kitchen appliances. It is introducing a new product
     line of appliances in designer colors with distinctive features for kitchens in small spaces.
     These new products will be offered indefinitely starting with the spring catalog release. To

     additional equipment to staff his customer service center. The cost was not taken into con-
     sideration in the project budget. The project sponsor insists that the project must go for-
     ward as originally planned or the customer will suffer. Which of the following is true?
     A. The VP of customer service is correct. Since the cost was not taken into account at the
        beginning of the project, the project should not go forward as planned. Project initiation
        should be revisited to examine the project plan and determine how changes can be made
        to accommodate customer service.
     B.   The conflict should be resolved in favor of the customer.

     A. Establish the business analyst's duties well ahead of due dates, and tell her you'll be
        reporting on her performance to her functional manager.
     B.   Establish the business analyst's duties well ahead of due dates, and tell her you are expect-

Answers to Review Questions
1.   C. The Project Management Institute (PMI) is the industry-recognized standard for project
     management practices.

2.   B. Projects exist to create a unique product, service, or result. The logon screen in this
     question is not a unique product. A minor change has been requested, indicating that this is
     an ongoing operations function. Some of the criteria for projects are that they are unique,
     temporary with definitive start and end dates, and considered complete when the project
     goals are achieved.

3.   A. This is a project. The product line is new, which implies that this is a unique product--it
     hasn't been done before. You can discern a definite start and end date by the fact that the new
     appliances must be ready by the spring catalog release.

4.   D. Progressive elaboration is the process of determining the characteristics and features of
     the product of the project. Progressive elaboration is carried out via steps in detailed fashion.

5.   D. A project is considered successful when stakeholder needs and expectations are met
     or exceeded.

6.   B. Conflicts between stakeholders should always be resolved in favor of the customer. This
     question emphasizes the importance of identifying your stakeholders and their needs as
     early as possible in the project.

7.   C. Project management brings together a set of tools and techniques to organize project
     activities. Project managers are the ones responsible for managing the project processes.

8.   B. Phase-end reviews can occur for all phase-to-phase relationships. Handoffs are typical
     of a sequentially phased project, not an overlapping phased project. Fast tracking occurs in
     an overlapping relationship.

9.   D. Portfolios are collections of projects or programs. The projects or programs do not have
     to be directly related or interdependent on each other to reside within the portfolio.

10. A. Negotiation and influencing skills are needed to convince Jack's boss and come to
    agreement concerning his assignment.

11. A. The storyboard is a deliverable. Since the phases are performed sequentially, the deliver-
    able must be approved before the next phase of the project can begin.

12. C. The best answer to this question according to the PMBOK(R) Guide is to negotiate with
    the functional manager to participate in the business analyst's annual performance review.
    D is an appropriate response but doesn't include the direction that the project manager
    should participate in the performance review.

13. B. The level of authority the project manager has is determined by the organizational
    structure. For instance, in a functional organization, the project manager has little to no
    authority, but in a projectized structure, the project manager has full authority.
42        Chapter 1   n   What Is a Project?



14. A. Advantages for employees in a functional organization are that they have only one
    supervisor and a clear chain of command exists.

15. D. Employees in a balanced matrix often report to two or more managers. Functional man-
    agers and project managers share authority and responsibility for projects. There is a balance
    of power between the functional managers and project managers.

16. C. Projectized organizations are focused on the project itself. One issue with this type of
    structure is determining what to do with project team members when they are not actively
    involved in the project. One alternative is to release them when they are no longer needed.

17. D. Remember the acronym that sounds like syrup of ipecac: IPECC (Initiating, Planning,
    Executing, Monitoring and Controlling, and Closing).

18. B. An iterative phase-to-phase relationship allows you to begin planning for the next phase
    before the phase you're working on is completed. Fast tracking is where the work of the
    next phase begins during the current phase. This question describes planning for the next
    phase, not performing the work of the phase.

19. C. The Initiating process group is where stakeholders have the greatest ability to influence
    outcomes of the project. Risk is highest during this stage because of the high degree of
    unknown factors.

20. A. The Planning process is where requirements are fleshed out, stakeholders are identified,
    and estimates on project costs and time are made.
Chapter   Creating the

 2        Project Charter

          The PMP(R) exam content from the
          Initiating the Project performance
          domain covered in this chapter
          includes the following:

           Conduct Project Selection Methods
          UU

           Define Scope
          UU

           Document Project Risks, Assumptions, and Constraints
          UU

           Develop Project Charter
          UU

           Obtain Project Charter Approval
          UU

           Identify and Perform Stakeholder Analysis
          UU
                                Now that you're armed with a detailed overview of project
                                management, you can easily determine whether your next
                                assignment really is a project or an ongoing operation. You've
also learned some of the basics of good project management techniques. You'll now start
putting those techniques into practice during the Initiating process group, which is where
all projects start. And, as you've probably already guessed, you'll be using some of the gen-
eral management skills outlined in Chapter 1, "What Is a Project?"
    One of the first skills you will put to use will be your communication skills. Are you
surprised? Of course you're not. It all starts with communication. You can't start defining
the project until you've first talked to the project sponsor, key stakeholders, and manage-
ment personnel. All good project managers have honed their communication skills to a nice
sharp edge.
    You'll remember from Chapter 1 that Initiating is the first process group in the five
project management process groups. You can think of it as the official project kickoff. Ini-
tiating acknowledges that the project, or the next phase in an active project, should begin.
This process group culminates in the publication of a project charter and a stakeholder
register. I'll cover each in this chapter. But before we dive into the Initiating processes, we
have one more preliminary topic to cover regarding the nine Knowledge Areas.
    At the end of this chapter, I'll introduce a case study that will illustrate the main points
of the chapter. I'll expand on this case study from chapter to chapter, and you'll begin
building a project using each of the skills you learn.



Exploring the Project Management
Knowledge Areas
We talked about the five process groups in Chapter 1. They are Initiating, Planning, Execut-
ing, Monitoring and Controlling, and Closing. Each process group is made up of a collection
of processes used throughout the project life cycle The PMBOK(R) Guide groups these processes
into nine categories that it calls The Project Management Knowledge Areas. These group-
ings, or Knowledge Areas, bring together processes that have characteristics in common. For
example, the Project Cost Management Knowledge Area involves all aspects of the budgeting
process, as you would suspect. Therefore, processes such as Estimate Costs, Determine Bud-
get, and Control Costs belong to this Knowledge Area. Here's the tricky part--these processes
don't belong to the same project management process groups (Estimate Costs and Determine
Budget are part of the Planning process group, and Control Costs is part of the Monitoring
                          Exploring the Project Management Knowledge Areas                  45




and Controlling process group). Think of it this way: Knowledge Areas bring together pro-
cesses by commonalities, whereas project management process groups are more or less the
order in which you perform the project management processes (although remember that you
can come back through these processes more than once). The nine Knowledge Areas are
as follows:
NN   Project Integration Management
NN   Project Scope Management
NN   Project Time Management
NN   Project Cost Management
NN   Project Quality Management
NN   Project Human Resource Management
NN   Project Communications Management
NN   Project Risk Management
NN   Project Procurement Management
   Let's take a closer look at each Knowledge Area so you understand how they relate to
the process groups. Included in each of the following sections are tables that illustrate the
processes that make up the Knowledge Area and the project management process group to
which each process belongs. This will help you see the big picture in terms of process groups
compared to Knowledge Areas. I'll discuss each of the processes in the various Knowledge
Areas throughout the book, but for now, you'll take a high-level look at each of them.



Exam Spotlight

The PMP exam may have a question or two regarding the processes that make up a
Knowledge Area. Remember that Knowledge Areas bring together processes by com-
monalities, so thinking about the Knowledge Area itself should tip you off to the pro-
cesses that belong to it. Projects are executed in process group order, but the Knowledge
Areas allow a project manager to think about groups of processes that require specific
skills. This makes the job of assigning resources easier because team members with spe-
cific skills might be able to work on and complete several processes at once. To broaden
your understanding of the Knowledge Areas, cross-reference the purposes and the pro-
cesses that make up each Knowledge Area with the PMBOK(R) Guide.




Project Integration Management
The Project Integration Management Knowledge Area comprises six processes, as shown
in Table 2.1.
46        Chapter 2   n   Creating the Project Charter



Ta b l e 2 .1 Project Integration Management


Process Name                                    Project Management Process Group

Develop Project Charter                         Initiating

Develop Project Management Plan                 Planning

Direct and Manage Project Execution             Executing

Monitor and Control Project Work                Monitoring and Controlling

Perform Integrated Change Control               Monitoring and Controlling

Close Project or Phase                          Closing



    The Project Integration Management Knowledge Area is concerned with coordinating
all aspects of the project plan and is highly interactive. This Knowledge Area involves iden-
tifying and defining the work of the project and combining, unifying, and integrating the
appropriate processes. This Knowledge Area also takes into account satisfactorily meeting
the requirements of the customer and stakeholder and managing their expectations.
    Project planning, project execution, project work monitoring, and change control occur
throughout the project and are repeated continuously while you're working on the project.
Project planning and execution involve weighing the objectives of the project against the alter-
natives to bring the project to a successful completion. This includes making choices about
how to effectively use resources and coordinating the work of the project on a continuous
basis. Monitoring the work of the project involves anticipating potential problems and issues
and dealing with them before they reach the critical point. Change control impacts the project
plan, which in turn impacts the work of the project, which in turn can impact the project man-
agement plan, so you can see that these processes are tightly linked. The processes in this area,
as with all the Knowledge Areas, also interact with other processes in the remaining Knowl-
edge Areas. For example, the Identify Stakeholders process uses an output from the Develop
Project charter process as an input.
    The Project Integration Management Knowledge Area has two tools for assisting with
process integration: earned value management (EVM) and project management software.
EVM is a project-integrating methodology used in this Knowledge Area to integrate the
processes and measure project performance through a project's life cycle. I'll further define
EVM and talk more about project management software tools in Chapter 4, "Creating the
Project Schedule."


Project Scope Management
The Project Scope Management Knowledge Area has five processes, as shown in Table 2.2.
                            Exploring the Project Management Knowledge Areas                     47



Ta b l e 2 . 2 Project Scope Management


Process Name                                   Project Management Process Group

Collect Requirements                           Planning

Define Scope                                   Planning

Create WBS                                     Planning

Verify Scope                                   Monitoring and Controlling

Control Scope                                  Monitoring and Controlling



   Project Scope Management is concerned with defining all the work of the project and
only the work needed to successfully produce the project goals. These processes are highly
interactive. They define and control what is and what is not part of the project. Each process
occurs at least once--and often many times--throughout the project's life.
   Project Scope Management encompasses both product scope and project scope. Product
scope concerns the characteristics of the product, service, or result of the project. It's measured
against the product requirements to determine successful completion or fulfillment. The appli-
cation area usually dictates the process tools and techniques you'll use to define and manage
product scope. Project scope involves managing the work of the project and only the work of
the project. Project scope is measured against the project management plan, the project scope
statement, the work breakdown structure (WBS), and the WBS dictionary.


                   To ensure a successful project, both product and project scope must be
                   well integrated. This implies that Project Scope Management is well inte-
                   grated with the other Knowledge Area processes.

     Define Scope, Create WBS, Verify Scope, and Control Scope involve the following:
NN    Defining and detailing the deliverables and requirements of the product of the project
NN    Creating a project scope management plan
NN    Creating a WBS
NN    Verifying deliverables using measurement techniques
NN    Controlling changes to these processes


Project Time Management
The Project Time Management Knowledge Area has six processes, as shown in Table 2.3.
48        Chapter 2   n   Creating the Project Charter



Ta b l e 2 . 3 Project Time Management


Process Name                                 Project Management Process Group

Define Activities                            Planning

Sequence Activities                          Planning

Estimate Activity Resources                  Planning

Estimate Activity Durations                  Planning

Develop Schedule                             Planning

Control Schedule                             Monitoring and Controlling



   This Knowledge Area is concerned with estimating the duration of the project plan
activities, devising a project schedule, and monitoring and controlling deviations from the
schedule. Collectively, this Knowledge Area deals with completing the project in a timely
manner. Time management is an important aspect of project management because it con-
cerns keeping the project activities on track and monitoring those activities against the
project plan to ensure that the project is completed on time.
   Although each process in this Knowledge Area occurs at least once in every project
(and sometimes more), in many cases, particularly on small projects, Sequence Activities,
Estimate Activity Durations, and Develop Schedule are completed as one activity. Only
one person is needed to complete these processes for small projects, and they're all worked
on at the same time.


Project Cost Management
As its name implies, the Project Cost Management Knowledge Area centers around costs
and budgets. Table 2.4 shows the processes that make up this Knowledge Area.

Ta b l e 2 . 4 Project Cost Management


Process Name                                 Project Management Process Group

Estimate Costs                               Planning

Determine Budget                             Planning

Control Costs                                Monitoring and Controlling
                           Exploring the Project Management Knowledge Areas                   49




    The activities in The Project Cost Management Knowledge Area establish cost estimates
for resources, establish budgets, and keep watch over those costs to ensure that the project
stays within the approved budget. This Knowledge Area is primarily concerned with the
costs of resources, but you should think about other costs as well. For example, make cer-
tain to examine ongoing maintenance and support costs for software you're considering for
the project.
    Depending on the complexity of the project, these processes might need the involvement
of more than one person. For example, the finance person might not have expertise about
the resources documented in the staffing management plan, so the project manager will
need to bring in a staff member with those skills to assist with the activities in this process.
    Two techniques are used in this Knowledge Area to decide among alternatives and
improve the project process: life cycle costing and value engineering. The life cycle costing
technique considers a group of costs collectively (such as acquisition, operations, disposal,
and so on) when deciding among or comparing alternatives. The value engineering tech-
nique helps improve project schedules, profits, quality, and resource usage and optimizes
life cycle costs, among others. Value engineering, in a nutshell, involves optimizing project
performance and cost and is primarily concerned with eliminating unnecessary costs. By
examining the project processes, performance, or even specific activities, the project man-
ager can identify those elements that are not adding value and could be eliminated, modi-
fied, or reduced to realize cost savings. These techniques can improve decision making,
reduce costs, reduce activity durations, and improve the quality of the deliverables. Some
application areas require additional financial analysis to help predict project performance.
Techniques such as payback analysis, return on investment, and discounted cash flows are a
few of the tools used to accomplish this.


Project Quality Management
The Project Quality Management Knowledge Area is composed of three processes, as
shown in Table 2.5.

Ta b l e 2 . 5 Project Quality Management


Process Name                                    Project Management Process Group

Plan Quality                                    Planning

Perform Quality Assurance                       Executing

Perform Quality Control                         Monitoring and Controlling



   The Project Quality Management Knowledge Area assures that the project meets the
requirements that it was undertaken to produce. This Knowledge Area focuses on product
quality as well as on the quality of the project management process used during the project.
50        Chapter 2   n   Creating the Project Charter



These processes measure overall performance and monitor project results and compare them
to the quality standards set out in the project-planning process to ensure that the customers
will receive the product, service, or result they commissioned.


Project Human Resource Management
The Project Human Resource Management Knowledge Area consists of four processes, as
shown in Table 2.6.

Ta b l e 2 . 6 Project Human Resource Management


Process Name                                    Project Management Process Group

Develop Human Resource Plan                     Planning

Acquire Project Team                            Executing

Develop Project Team                            Executing

Manage Project Team                             Executing



   Project Human Resource Management involves all aspects of people management and per-
sonal interaction, including leading, coaching, dealing with conflict, conducting performance
appraisals, and more. These processes ensure that the human resources assigned to the project
are used in the most effective way possible. Some of the project participants whom you'll get to
practice these skills on are stakeholders, team members, and customers. Each requires the use
of different communication styles, leadership skills, and team-building skills. A good project
manager knows when to enact certain skills and communication styles based on the situation.
   Projects are unique and temporary and so usually are project teams. Teams are put
together based on the skills and resources needed to complete the activities of the project,
and many times project team members might not know one another. Because the makeup
of each team is different and the stakeholders involved in the various stages of the project
might change, you'll use different techniques at different times throughout the project to
manage the processes in this Knowledge Area.


Project Communications Management
The processes in The Project Communications Management Knowledge Area are related to
general communication skills, but they encompass much more than an exchange of informa-
tion. Communication skills are considered general management skills that the project man-
ager utilizes on a daily basis. The processes in the Process Communications Management
Knowledge Area seek to ensure that all project information--including project plans, risk
assessments, meeting notes, and more--is collected, documented, archived, and disposed of
                           Exploring the Project Management Knowledge Areas                    51




at the proper time. These processes also ensure that information is distributed and shared
with stakeholders, management, and project members at appropriate times. When the proj-
ect is closed, the information is archived and used as a reference for future projects. This is
referred to as historical information in several project processes.
    Everyone on the project has some involvement with this Knowledge Area because all
project members will send and/or receive project communication throughout the life of
the project. It is important that all team members and stakeholders understand how com-
munication affects the project.
    Five processes make up The Project Communications Management Knowledge Area, as
shown in Table 2.7.

Ta b l e 2 . 7 Project Communication Management


Process Name                                   Project Management Process Group

Identify Stakeholders                          Initiating

Plan Communications                            Planning

Distribute Information                         Executing

Manage Stakeholder Expectations                Executing

Report Performance                             Monitoring and Controlling




Time to Communicate

Project Communication Management is probably the most important Knowledge Area on
any project. And most project managers understand the importance of good communica-
tion skills and making sure stakeholders are informed of project status. I know a project
manager who had difficulties getting time with the project sponsor. The project sponsor
agreed to meet with the project manager, even set up the meetings himself, and then can-
celed or simply didn't show up. The poor project manager was at wits end about how to
communicate with the sponsor and get some answers to the questions she had. Her desk
was not far outside the project sponsor's office. One day as she peeked around the corner of
her cube, she decided if the sponsor wouldn't come to her, she would go to him. From then
on, every time the sponsor left his office, she would jump up from her chair and ride with
him on the elevator. He was a captive audience. She was able to get some easy questions
answered and finally convince him, after the fourth or fifth elevator ride, that they needed
regular face-to-face meetings. She understood the importance of communication and went
to great lengths to make certain the sponsor did too.

Project Risk Management
Project Risk Management, as shown in Table 2.8, contains six processes.

Ta b l e 2 . 8 Project Risk Management


Process Name                                    Project Management Process Group

Plan Risk Management                            Planning

Identify Risks                                  Planning

Perform Qualitative Risk Analysis               Planning

Perform Quantitative Risk Analysis              Planning

Plan Risk Responses                             Planning

Monitor and Control Risk                        Monitoring and Controlling



   Risks include both threats to and opportunities within the project. The processes in
this Knowledge Area are concerned with identifying, analyzing, and planning for potential
risks, both positive and negative, that might impact the project. This means minimizing the
probability and impact of negative risks while maximizing the probability and impact of
positive risks. These processes are also used to identify the positive consequences of risks
and exploit them to improve project objectives or discover efficiencies that might improve
project performance.
   Organizations will often combine several of these processes into one step. For example,
Identify Risks and Perform Qualitative Risk Analysis might be performed at the same time.
The important factor of The Project Risk Management Knowledge Area is that you should
strive to identify all the risks and develop responses for those with the greatest consequences
to the project objectives.


Project Procurement Management
Four processes are in The Project Procurement Management Knowledge Area, as shown in
Table 2.9.

Ta b l e 2 . 9 Project Procurement Management


Process Name                                    Project Management Process Group

Close Procurements                              Closing



   The Project Procurement Management Knowledge Area includes the processes involved
with purchasing goods or services from vendors, contractors, suppliers, and others outside the
project team. When discussing the Project Procurement Management processes, it's assumed
that the discussion is taking place from your perspective as a buyer, while sellers are external
to the project team. Interestingly, the seller might manage their work as a project, particularly
when the work is performed on contract, and you as the buyer become a key stakeholder in
their project.
   The remainder of this book will deal with processes and process groups as they occur in
order (that is, Initiating, Planning, Executing, Monitoring and Controlling, and Closing),
because this is the way you will encounter and manage them during a project.



Understanding How Projects
Come About
Your company's quarterly meeting is scheduled for today. You take your seat, and each
of the department heads gets up and gives their usual "We can do it" rah-rah speech, one
after the other. You sit up a little straighter when the CEO takes the stage. He starts his
part of the program pretty much the same way the other department heads did, and before
long, you find yourself drifting off. You are mentally reviewing the status of your current
project when suddenly your daydreaming trance is shattered. You perk up as you hear the
CEO say, "And the new phone system will be installed by Thanksgiving."
   Wait a minute. You work in the telecom department and haven't heard a word about
this project until today. You also have a funny feeling that you've been elected to man-
age this project. It's amazing how good communication skills are so important for project
managers but not for, well, we won't go there.
   Project initiation is the formal recognition that a project, or the next phase in an existing
project, should begin and resources should be committed to the project. Unfortunately, many
projects are initiated the way the CEO did in this example. Each of us, at one time or another,
has experienced being handed a project with little to no information and told to "make it hap-
pen." The new phone system scenario is an excellent example of how not to initiate a project.
   Taking one step back leads you to ask, "How do projects come about in the first place?
Do CEOs just make them up like in this example?" Even though your CEO announced
this new project at the company meeting with no forewarning, no doubt it came about as a
54        Chapter 2   n   Creating the Project Charter



result of a legitimate need. Believe it or not, CEOs don't just dream up projects just to give
you something to do. They're concerned about the future of the company and the needs of
the business and its customers.
   The business might drive the need for a project, customers might demand changes to
products, or legal requirements might create the need for a new project. According to the
PMBOK(R) Guide, projects come about as a result of one of seven needs or demands. Once
those needs and demands are identified, the next logical step might include performing a
feasibility study to determine the viability of the project. I'll cover these topics next.


Needs and Demands
Organizations exist to generate profits or serve the public. To stay competitive, organizations
are always examining new ways of creating business, new ways of gaining efficiencies, or new
ways of serving their customers. Sometimes laws are passed to force organizations to make
their products safer or to make them less harmful to the environment. Projects might result
from any of these needs as well as from business requirements, opportunities, or problems.
Most projects will fit one of the seven needs and demands described next. Let's take a closer
look at each of these areas:
Market demand The demands of the marketplace can drive the need for a project. For
example, a bank initiates a project to offer customers the ability to apply for mortgage
loans over the Internet because of a drop in interest rates and an increase in demand for
refinancing and new home loans.
Strategic opportunity/business need The new phone system talked about earlier that was
announced at the quarterly meeting came about as a result of a business need. The CEO,
on advice from his staff, was advised that call volumes were maxed on the existing system.
Without a new system, customer service response times would suffer, and that would even-
tually affect the bottom line.
Customer request Customer requests run the gamut. Generally speaking, most companies
have customers, and their requests can drive new projects. Customers can be internal or
external to the organization. Government agencies don't have external customers per se
(we're captive customers at any rate), but there are internal customers within departments
and across agencies.
Perhaps you work for a company that sells remittance-processing equipment and you've just
landed a contract with a local utility company. This project is driven by the need of the utility
company to automate its process or upgrade its existing process. The utility company's request
to purchase your equipment and consulting services is the project driver.
Technological advance Many of us own a multifunctioning cell phone that keeps names and
addresses handy along with a calendar and a to-do list of some kind. I couldn't live without
mine. However, a newer, better version is always coming to market. Satellite communications
now allows these devices to also act as GPS units. The introduction of satellite communica-
tions is an example of a technological advance. Because of this introduction, electronics man-
ufacturers revamped their products to take advantage of this new technology.

Legal requirement Private industry and government agencies both generate new projects
as a result of laws passed during every legislative season. For example, new sales tax laws
might require new programming to the existing sales tax system. The requirement that
food labels appear on every package describing the ingredients and the recommended daily
allowances is another example of legal requirements that drive a project.
Ecological impacts Many organizations today are undergoing a "greening" effort to
reduce energy consumption, save fuel, reduce their carbon footprint, and so on. These are
examples of ecological impacts that result in projects.
Social need The last need is a result of social demands. For example, perhaps a developing
country is experiencing a fast-spreading disease that's infecting large portions of the popula-
tion. Medical supplies and facilities are needed to vaccinate and treat those infected with the
disease. Another example might include manufacturing or processing plants that voluntarily
remove their waste products from water prior to putting the water back into a local river or
stream to prevent contamination.



Exam Spotlight

Understand the needs and demands that bring about a project for the exam.



   All of these needs and demands represent opportunities, business requirements, or prob-
lems that need to be solved. Management must decide how to respond to these needs and
demands, which will more often than not initiate new projects.




Project Initiation

Corey is an information technology manager who works for the National Park Service.
One warm spring Sunday morning he was leafing through the newspaper and came
across an article about new services being offered at some of the national parks. He
really perked up when he saw his boss's name describing the changing nature of technol-
ogy and how it impacted the types of services the public would like to see at the parks.
Corey knew that the public had been asking when wireless Internet services would be
available in some of the larger parks. He had also been involved in the discussions about
the resources needed to make this happen. But the project never seemed to get off the
ground. A higher-priority project always took precedence. However, all that changed
when Corey saw the next sentence in the paper, which was his boss promising wire-
less access in two of the largest parks in their region by July 4. It looks like the customer
requests finally won out, and Corey just learned he has a new project on his hands.
56        Chapter 2    n   Creating the Project Charter




Feasibility Studies
After the opportunity for a project becomes evident, the next step might be to initiate it,
which means you're ready to jump right into creating a project charter for the project. But
before you take that plunge, you should know that some organizations will require a feasi-
bility study prior to making a final decision about starting the project.
   Feasibility studies are undertaken for several reasons. One is to determine whether the
project is a viable project. A second reason is to determine the probability of the project
succeeding. Feasibility studies can also examine the viability of the product, service, or
result of the project. For example, the study might ask, "Will the new lemon-flavored soda
be a hit? Is it marketable?" The study might also look at the technical issues related to
the project and determine whether the technology proposed is feasible, reliable, and easily
assimilated into the organization's existing technology structure.
   Feasibility studies might be conducted as separate projects, as subprojects, or as the first
phase of a project. When you don't know the outcome of the study, it's best to treat it as
a separate project. The group of people conducting the feasibility study should not be the
same people who will work on the project. Project team members might have built-in biases
toward the project and will tend to influence the feasibility outcome toward those biases.




The Interactive Voice Response (IVR) Tax-Filing System

Jason, Sam, and Kate are web programmers working for the Department of Revenue in
the State of Bliss. Ron, their manager, approaches them one day with an idea.

"Team, business unit managers are thinking it would be a great idea to offer taxpayers the
ability to file their income tax returns over the telephone. We already offer them the ability to
file on the Internet, thanks to all your efforts on that project last year. It has been a fabulous
success. No other state has had the success that Bliss has had with our Internet system.

"Kate, I know you've had previous experience with IVR technology, but I'm not sure about
you guys, so this is new territory for us. I'd like to hear what each of you thinks about this
project."

Jason speaks up first. "I think it's a great idea. You know me, I'm always up for learning
new things, especially when it comes to programming. When can we start?"

Sam echoes Jason's comments.

"This technology is pretty sophisticated," Kate says. "Jason and Sam are excellent coders
and could work on the programming side of things, but I would have to pick up the tele-
phony piece on my own. After we're up and running, we could go over the telephony por-
tions step by step, so Jason and Sam could help me support it going forward. I'd really like
to take on this project. It would be good for the team and good for the department."

Ron thinks for a minute. "Let's not jump right into this. I know you're anxious to get
started, but I think a feasibility study is in order. The senior director of the tax business
unit doesn't know whether this project is cost justified and has some concerns about its
life span. A feasibility study will tell us the answers to those questions. It should also help
us determine whether we're using the right technology to accomplish our goals, and it
will outline alternative ways of performing the project that we haven't considered. I don't
want Kate going it alone without first examining all the issues and potential impacts to
the organization."




Selecting and Prioritizing Projects
Most organizations don't have the luxury of performing every project that's proposed. Even
consulting organizations that sell their project management services must pick and choose
the projects on which they want to work. Selection methods help organizations decide among
alternative projects and determine the tangible benefits to the company of choosing or not
choosing the project.
   Project selection methods will vary depending on the company, the people serving on the
selection committee, the criteria used, and the project. Sometimes the criteria for selection
methods will be purely financial, sometimes purely marketing, and sometimes they'll be
based on public perception or political perception. In most cases, the decision is based on a
combination of all these and more.
   Most organizations have a formal, or at least semiformal, process for selecting and
prioritizing projects. In my organization, a steering committee is responsible for project
review, selection, and prioritization. A steering committee is a group of folks comprising
senior managers and sometimes midlevel managers who represent each of the functional
areas in the organization.
   Here's how our process works: The steering committee requests project ideas from the
business staff prior to the beginning of the fiscal year. These project ideas are submitted in
writing and contain a high-level overview of the project goals, a description of the deliv-
erables, the business justification for the project, a desired implementation date, what the
organization stands to gain from implementing the project, a list of the functional business
areas affected by the project, and (if applicable) a cost-benefit analysis (I'll talk about that
in a bit).
   A meeting is called to review the projects, and a determination is made on each project
about whether it will be included on the upcoming list of projects for the new year. Once
the no-go projects have been weeded out, the remaining projects are prioritized according
to their importance and benefit to the organization. The projects are documented on an
official project list, and progress is reported on the active projects at the regular monthly
steering committee meetings.
   In theory, it's a great idea. In practice, it works only moderately well. Priorities can and
do change throughout the year. New projects come up that weren't originally submitted
58        Chapter 2   n   Creating the Project Charter



during the call for projects, and they must be added to the list. Reprioritization begins
anew, and resource alignment and assignments are shuffled. But again, I'm getting ahead
of myself. Just be aware that organizations usually have a process to recognize and screen
project requests, accept or reject those requests based on some selection criteria, and priori-
tize the projects based on some criteria.
    The project selection methods I'll talk about next are ones you should know and under-
stand for the exam. However, keep in mind they are only one aspect of project selection in
the real world. The individual opinion, and power, of selection committee members also plays
a part in the projects the organization chooses to perform. Don't underestimate the impor-
tance of the authority, political standing, and individual aspirations of selection committee
members. Those committee members who happen to carry a lot of weight in company circles,
so to speak, are likely to get their projects approved just because they are who they are. This
is sometimes how project selection works in my organization. How about yours?


Using Project Selection Methods
Project selection methods are concerned with the advantages or merits of the product of the
project. In other words, selection methods measure the value of what the product, service, or
result of the project will produce and how it will benefit the organization. Selection methods
involve the types of concerns executive managers are typically thinking about. This includes
factors such as market share, financial benefits, return on investment, customer retention
and loyalty, and public perceptions. Most of these are reflected in the organization's strategic
goals. Projects, whether large or small, should always be weighed against the strategic plan. If
the project doesn't help the organization reach its goals (increased market share, for example),
then the project probably shouldn't be undertaken.
   There are generally two categories of selection methods: mathematical models (also known
as calculation methods) and benefit measurement methods (also known as decision models).
Decision models examine different criteria used in making decisions regarding project selec-
tion, while calculation methods provide a way to calculate the value of the project, which is
then used in project selection decision making.

Mathematical Models
For the exam, all you need to understand about mathematical models is that they use
linear, dynamic, integer, nonlinear, and/or multi-objective programming in the form of
algorithms--or in other words, a specific set of steps to solve a particular problem. These
are complicated mathematical formulas and algorithms that are beyond the scope of this
book and require an engineering, statistical, or mathematical background to fully under-
stand. Organizations considering undertaking projects of enormous complexity might
use mathematical modeling techniques to make decisions regarding these projects. Math-
ematical models are also known as constrained optimization methods. The vast majority
of project selection techniques will use the benefit measurement methods to make project
selection decisions.

Exam Spotlight

Project selection methods are also used to evaluate and choose between alternative ways
of performing the project.



Benefit Measurement Methods
Benefit measurement methods employ various forms of analysis and comparative approaches
to make project decisions. These methods include comparative approaches such as cost-bene-
fit analysis, scoring models, and benefit contribution methods that include various cash flow
techniques and economic models. You'll examine several of these methods, starting with
cost-benefit analysis.

Cost-Benefit Analysis
One common benefit measurement method is the cost-benefit analysis. The name of this
method implies what it does--it compares the cost to produce the product, service, or result
of the project to the benefit (usually financial in the form of savings or revenue generation)
that the organization will receive as a result of executing the project. Obviously, a sound
project choice is one where the costs to implement or produce the product of the project are
less than the financial benefits. How much less is the organization's decision. Some compa-
nies are comfortable with a small margin, while others are comfortable with a much larger
margin between the two figures.


                  Cost-benefit analysis is also known as benefit/cost analysis. The techniques
                  are the same. Benefit/cost has a more positive connotation because it shows
                  the benefit, or the good stuff, before the cost, which is the not-so-good stuff.

   When examining costs for a cost-benefit analysis, include the costs to produce the product
or service, the costs to take the product to market, and the ongoing operational support costs.
For example, let's say your company is considering writing and marketing a database soft-
ware product that will allow banks to dissect their customer base, determine which types of
customers buy which types of products, and then market more effectively to those customers.
You will take into account some of the following costs:
NN   The costs to develop the software, such as programmer costs, hardware costs, and
     testing costs
NN   Marketing costs such as advertising, traveling costs to perform demos at potential
     customer sites, and so on
NN   Ongoing costs such as having a customer support staff available during business hours
     to assist customers with product questions and problems
   Let's say the cost to produce this software plus the ongoing support costs total $5 million.
Initial projections look like the demand for this product is high. Over a three-year period,
60          Chapter 2   n    Creating the Project Charter



which is the potential life of the software in its proposed form, projected revenues are $12
million. Taking only the financial information into account, the benefits outweigh the costs
of this project. This project should receive a go recommendation.


                   Projects of significant cost or complexity usually involve more than one
                   benefit measurement method when go or no-go decisions are being made
                   or one project is being chosen over another. Keep in mind that selection
                   methods can take subjective considerations into account as well--the project
                   is a go because it's the new CEO's pet project; nothing else needs to be said.


Scoring Models
Another project selection technique in the benefit measurement category is a scoring
model, or weighted scoring model. My organization uses weighted scoring models not
only to choose between projects but also as a method to choose between competing bids
on outsourced projects.
   Weighted scoring models are quite simple. The project selection committee decides on
the criteria that will be used on the scoring model--for example, profit potential, market-
ability of the product or service, ability of the company to quickly and easily produce the
product or service, and so on. Each of these criteria is assigned a weight depending on its
importance to the project committee. More important criteria should carry a higher weight
than less important criteria.
   Then each project is rated on a scale from 1 to 5 (or some such assignment), with the
higher number being the more desirable outcome to the company and the lower number
having the opposite effect. This rating is then multiplied by the weight of the criteria factor
and added to other weighted criteria scores for a total weighted score. Table 2.10 shows an
example that brings this together.

     In this example, Project A is the obvious choice.

Cash Flow Analysis Techniques
The remaining benefit measurement methods involve a variety of cash flow analysis tech-
niques, including payback period, discounted cash flows, net present value, and internal
rate of return. We'll look at each of these techniques individually, and I'll provide you with
a crash course on their meanings and calculations.
Payback Period
The payback period is the length of time it takes the company to recoup the initial
costs of producing the product, service, or result of the project. This method compares
the initial investment to the cash inflows expected over the life of the product, service,
or result. For example, say the initial investment on a project is $200,000, with expected
cash inflows of $25,000 per quarter every quarter for the first two years and $50,000
per quarter from then on. The payback period is two years and can be calculated
as follows:
    Initial investment = $200,000
    Cash inflows = $25,000 * 4 (quarters in a year) = $100,000 per year total inflow
    Initial investment ($200,000) - year 1 inflows ($100,000) = $100,000
    remaining balance
    Year 1 inflows remaining balance - year 2 inflows = $0
    Total cash flow year 1 and year 2 = $200,000
    The payback is reached in two years.
The fact that inflows are $50,000 per quarter starting in year 3 makes no difference because
payback is reached in two years.
   The payback period is the least precise of all the cash flow calculations. That's because the
payback period does not consider the value of the cash inflows made in later years, commonly
called the time value of money. For example, if you have a project with a five-year payback
period, the cash inflows in year 5 are worth less than they are if you received them today. The
next section will explain this idea more fully.
Discounted Cash Flows
As I just stated, money received in the future is worth less than money received today.
The reason for that is the time value of money. If I borrowed $2,000 from you today and
promised to pay it back in three years, you would expect me to pay interest in addition
to the original amount borrowed. OK, if you were a family member or a really close
friend, maybe you wouldn't, but ordinarily this is the way it works. You would have
had the use of the $2,000 had you not lent it to me. If you had invested the money (does
this bring back memories of your mom telling you to save your money?), you'd receive a
return on it. Therefore, the future value of the $2,000 you lent me today is $2,315.25 in
three years from now at 5 percent interest per year. Here's the formula for future value
calculations:
    FV = PV(1 + i)n
62          Chapter 2   n   Creating the Project Charter



   In English, this formula says the future value (FV) of the investment equals the present
value (PV) times (1 plus the interest rate) raised to the value of the number of time periods
(n) the interest is paid. Let's plug in the numbers:
      FV = 2,000(1.05)3
      FV = 2,000(1.157625)
      FV = $2,315.25
   The discounted cash flow technique compares the value of the future cash flows of the
project to today's dollars. In order to calculate discounted cash flows, you need to know
the value of the investment in today's terms, or the PV. PV is calculated as follows:
      PV = FV / (1 + i)n
  This is the reverse of the FV formula talked about earlier. So, if you ask the question,
"What is $2,315.25 in three years from now worth today given a 5 percent interest rate?"
you'd use the preceding formula. Let's try it:
      PV = $2,315.25 / (1 + .05)3
      PV = $2,315.25 / 1.157625
      PV = $2,000
$2,315.25 in three years from now is worth $2,000 today.
   Discounted cash flow is calculated just like this for the projects you're comparing for
selection purposes or when considering alternative ways of doing the project. Apply the PV
formula to the projects you're considering, and then compare the discounted cash flows of all
the projects against each other to make a selection. Here is an example comparison of two
projects using this technique:
      Project A is expected to make $100,000 in two years.
      Project B is expected to make $120,000 in three years.
     If the cost of capital is 12 percent, which project should you choose?
     Using the PV formula used previously, calculate each project's worth:
      The PV of Project A = $79,719.
      The PV of Project B = $85,414.
Project B is the project that will return the highest investment to the company and should
be chosen over Project A.
Net Present Value
Projects might begin with a company investing some amount of money into the project to
complete and accomplish its goals. In return, the company expects to receive revenues, or
cash inflows, from the resulting project. Net present value (NPV) allows you to calculate
an accurate value for the project in today's dollars. The mathematical formula for NPV is
complicated, and you do not need to memorize it in that form for the test. However, you do
need to know how to calculate NPV for the exam, so I've given you some examples of a less
complicated way to perform this calculation in Table 2.11 and Table 2.12 using the formu-
las you've already seen.

   Net present value works like discounted cash flows in that you bring the value of future
monies received into today's dollars. With NPV, you evaluate the cash inflows using the
discounted cash flow technique applied to each period the inflows are expected instead of in
one sum. The total present value of the cash flows is then deducted from your initial invest-
ment to determine NPV. NPV assumes that cash inflows are reinvested at the cost of capital.
   Here's the rule: If the NPV calculation is greater than zero, accept the project. If the
NPV calculation is less than zero, reject the project.
   Look at the two project examples in Tables 2.11 and 2.12. Project A and Project B have
total cash inflows that are the same at the end of the project, but the amount of inflows at
each period differs for each project. We'll stick with a 12 percent cost of capital. Note that
the PV calculations were rounded to two decimal places.
64        Chapter 2   n   Creating the Project Charter



   Project A has an NPV greater than zero and should be accepted. Project B has a NPV
less than zero and should be rejected. When you get a positive value for NPV, it means that
the project will earn a return at least equal to or greater than the cost of capital.
   Another note on NPV calculations: projects with high returns early in the project are bet-
ter projects than projects with lower returns early in the project. In the preceding examples,
Project A fits this criterion also.
Internal Rate of Return
The internal rate of return (IRR) is the most difficult equation to calculate of all the cash
flow techniques we've discussed. It is a complicated formula and should be performed on
a financial calculator or computer. IRR can be figured manually, but it's a trial-and-error
approach to get to the answer.
    Technically speaking, IRR is the discount rate when the present value of the cash inflows
equals the original investment. When choosing between projects or when choosing alterna-
tive methods of doing the project, projects with higher IRR values are generally considered
better than projects with low IRR values.



Exam Spotlight

For the exam, you need to know three facts concerning IRR:

NN   IRR is the discount rate when NPV equals zero.
NN   IRR assumes that cash inflows are reinvested at the IRR value.
NN   You should choose projects with the highest IRR value.




Exam Spotlight

Although the PMBOK(R) Guide doesn't specifically address project selection methods or
cash flow techniques, you may see exam questions on these topics.




Applying Project Selection Methods
Now that we've discussed some of the project selection techniques, let's look at how to
apply them when choosing projects or project alternatives. You can use one, two, or several
of the benefit measurement methods alone or in combination to come up with a selection
decision. Remember that payback period is the least precise of all the cash flow techniques,
NPV is the most conservative cash flow technique, and NPV and IRR will generally bring
you to the same accept/reject conclusion.

   You can use project selection methods, and particularly the benefit measurement
methods, to evaluate multiple projects or a single project. You might be weighing one
project against another or simply considering whether the project you're proposing is
worth performing.




Fun Days Vacation Resorts

Jerry is a project manager for Fun Days Vacation Resorts. He is working on three different
project proposals to present to the executive steering committee for review. As part of the
information-gathering process, Jerry visits the various resorts pretending to be a guest.
This gives him a feel for what Fun Days guests experience on their vacations, and it better
prepares him to present project particulars and alternatives.

Jerry has prepared the project overviews for three projects and called upon the experts in
marketing to help him out with the projected revenue figures. He works up the numbers
and finds the following:

NN   Project A: payback period = 5 years; IRR = 8 percent
NN   Project B: payback period = 3.5 years; IRR = 3 percent
NN   Project C: payback period = 2 years; IRR = 3 percent

Funding exists for only one of the projects. Jerry recommends Project A and predicts this
is the project the steering committee will choose since the projects are mutually exclusive.

Jerry's turn to present comes up at the steering committee. Let's listen in on the action:

"And, on top of all the benefits I've just described, Project A provides an IRR of 8 percent,
a full 5 percent higher than the other two projects we discussed. I recommend the com-
mittee choose Project A."

"Thank you Jerry," Colleen says. "Good presentation." Colleen is the executive chairper-
son of the steering committee and has the authority to break ties or make final decisions
when the committee can't seem to agree.

"However, here at Fun Days we like to have our fun sooner rather than later." Chuckles
ensue from the steering committee. They've all heard this before. "I do agree that an 8
percent IRR is a terrific return, but the payback is just too far out into the future. There are
too many risks and unknowns for us to take on a project with a payback period this long.
As you know, our industry is directly impacted by the health of the economy. Anything
can happen in five years' time. I think we're much better off going with Project C. I recom-
mend we accept Project C. Committee members, do you have anything to add?"

Kicking Off the Project Charter
Your first stop in the Initiating group is a process called Develop the Project Charter. As the
name of the process suggests, your purpose is to create a project charter. As I talked about in
Chapter 1, the purpose for the Initiating group is to authorize a project, or the next phase of
a project, to begin. It also gives the project manager the authority to apply resources to the
project. These are also the purposes of a project charter: formally authorizing the project to
begin and committing resources.


                 The charter contains several elements that I'll discuss in the section
                 "Formalizing and Publishing the Project Charter" later in this chapter.




Exam Spotlight

The project charter (which is an output of the Develop the Project Charter process) is the
written acknowledgment that the project exists. The project charter documents the name of
the project manager and gives that person the authority to assign organizational resources
to the project. The project is officially authorized when the project charter is signed.



   As you'll discover, every process has inputs, tools and techniques, and outputs, and this
one is no exception. You'll start with the inputs. Let's get to it.
   Inputs to the project processes are typically informational in nature, or they are outputs
from previously completed processes. Inputs are used in combination with the tools and
techniques to produce the outputs of each process. Process outputs are usually tangible,
such as a report or an update or a list, for example. To get to the output, you have to start
with the inputs. Let's take a look at the Develop Project Charter process inputs:
NN   Project statement of work
NN   Business case
NN   Contract
NN   Enterprise environmental factors
NN   Organizational process assets
   The contract input is applicable only when the organization you are working for is per-
forming a project for a customer external to the organization. The contract is used as an
input to this process because it typically documents the conditions under which the project
will be executed, the time frame, and a description of the work.

Project Statement of Work
The project statement of work (SOW) describes the product, service, or result the project
was undertaken to complete. When the project is internal, this document is usually written
by either the project sponsor or the initiator of the project. When the project is external to
the organization, the buyer typically writes the SOW. For example, suppose you work for a
consulting firm and have been assigned as the project manager for a project your company
is performing on contract. The customer, the organization you'll be performing the project
for, is the one who writes the SOW.
    According to the PMBOK(R) Guide, a project SOW should contain or consider the
following elements:
Business need The business need for the project here relates to the needs of the organization
itself. The need might be based on governmental regulation, technological advances, market
demands, or a legal requirement.
Product scope description The product scope description describes the characteristics of
the product, service, or result of the project. The product scope description should be docu-
mented and should also include a description of the relationship between the business need
or demand that's driving the project and the products being created.
Product descriptions contain less detail in the early phases of a project and more detail
as the project progresses. Product scope descriptions, like the work of the project, are
progressively elaborated. They will contain the greatest amount of detail in the project
Executing processes.
When a project is performed under contract, typically the buyer of the product or service
will provide the product description to the vendor or contractor. The product description
can serve as a statement of work when the project is contracted to a vendor. A statement of
work describes the product, service, or result in enough detail so that the vendor can accu-
rately price the contract and satisfactorily fulfill the requirements of the project.
Strategic plan Part of the responsibility of a project manager during the Initiating processes
is to take into consideration the company's strategic plan. Perhaps the strategic plan states
that one of the company goals is to build 15 new stores by the end of the next fiscal year.
If your project entails installing a new human resources software system, it makes sense to
write the requirements for your project with the 15 new stores in mind. Your management
team will refer to the strategic plan when choosing which new projects to initiate and which
ones to drop, depending on their relationship to the strategic vision of the company.


Business Case
The purpose of a business case is to understand the business need for the project and deter-
mine whether the investment in the project is worthwhile. The business case often describes
the cost-benefit analysis as well. The project comes about and the business case is written as
a result of one of the needs or demands listed in the section "Needs and Demands."

Enterprise Environmental Factors
The enterprise environmental factors input shows up as an input to many of the other pro-
cesses we'll discuss throughout the book. This input refers to the factors outside the project
that have (or might have) significant influence on the success of the project. According to
the PMBOK(R) Guide, the environmental factors include the following:
Organizational culture, structure, and processes I talked about organizational structures
and their influence on the organization in Chapter 1.
Governmental or industry standards These include elements such as regulatory standards
and regulations (for instance, doctors must be licensed to practice medicine on people or
pets), quality standards (International Standards Organization standards, for example),
product standards, and workmanship standards.
Infrastructure This refers to the organization's facilities and capital equipment. I'll also
include information technology in this category.
Human resources       This refers to the existing staff's skills and knowledge.
Personnel administration These are guidelines for hiring and firing, training, and
employee performance reviews.
Organization's work authorization system        This defines how the work of the project is
authorized.
Marketplace conditions The old supply-and-demand theory applies here along with
economic and financial factors.
Stakeholder risk tolerances This is the level of risk stakeholders are willing to take on.
I'll talk more about this in Chapter 6, "Risk Planning."
Political climate This concerns both the internal and external political climate or influences
on the project or organization.
Organization's established communications channels These are the mechanisms the
organization uses to communicate both internally and externally
Commercial databases         These refer to industry-specific information, risk databases, and
so on.
   These factors can influence the way you manage the project and, in some cases, the out-
comes of the project. For example, perhaps the folks assigned to your project are junior level
and don't have the skills, experience, or knowledge needed to complete the work of the proj-
ect. It's up to the project manager to understand the organization's environmental factors and
account for and consider how they can influence the management and outcomes of the project.


Organizational Process Assets
Organizational process assets are the organization's policies, guidelines, procedures, plans,
approaches, and standards for conducting work, including project work. This includes a
                                                  Kicking Off the Project Charter          69




wide range of elements that might affect several aspects of the project, such as project man-
agement policies, safety policies, performance measurement criteria, templates, financial
controls, communication requirements, issue and defect management procedures, change
control procedures, risk control procedures, and the procedures used for authorizing work.
Organizational process assets are divided into two categories: processes and procedures
and corporate knowledge base.
   Organizational process assets also include the information the organization has
learned on previous projects (including how to store and retrieve that information). For
example, previous project risks, performance measurements, earned value data, and
schedules for past projects are valuable resources of knowledge for the current project.
This information is also known as historical information and it falls into the corporate
knowledge base category. If you don't capture and store this information, however, it
won't be available when you're starting a new project. You'll want to capture and store
information such as project financial data (budgets, costs, overruns), historical informa-
tion, lessons learned, project files, issues and defects, process measurements, and configu-
ration management knowledge.


                 There are too many organizational process assets to cover in this chapter.
                 I'll discuss many of them throughout the Planning chapters when a certain
                 organizational process asset pertains to a specific process.

   Organizational process assets and historical information should be reviewed and
examined when a new project is starting. Historical information can be very useful to
project managers and to stakeholders. When you're evaluating new projects, historical
information about previous projects of a similar nature can be handy in determining
whether the new project should be accepted and initiated. Historical information gath-
ered and documented during an active project is used to assist in determining whether
the project should proceed to the next phase. Historical information will help you with
the project charter, project scope statement, development of the project management
plan, the process of defining and estimating activities, and more during the project-
planning processes.
   Understanding previous projects of a similar nature--their problems, successes,
issues, and outcomes--will help you avoid repeating mistakes while reusing successful
techniques to accomplish the goals of this project to the satisfaction of the stakeholders.
Many of the processes in the project management process groups have organizational
process assets as an input, implying that you should review the pertinent organizational
assets that apply for the process you're about to start. For example, when performing
the Estimating Costs process, you might find it helpful to review the activity estimates
and budgets on past projects of similar size and scope before estimating the costs for the
activities on the new project.
70        Chapter 2   n   Creating the Project Charter




Exam Spotlight

Remember that organizational process assets encompass many elements, including poli-
cies, guidelines, standards, historical information, and so on, and that they're divided into
two categories: processes and procedures and corporate knowledge base. Make certain
you understand what the organizational process assets entail for the exam and that you
can differentiate them from the enterprise environmental factors input.




Expert Judgment Tool and Technique
Expert judgment is the only tool and technique in this process. The concept behind expert
judgment is to rely on individuals, or groups of people, who have training, specialized knowl-
edge, or skills in the areas you're assessing. These folks might be stakeholders, consultants,
other experts in the organization, subject matter experts, the PMO, industry experts, or
technical or professional organizations. Expert judgment is a tool and technique used in other
planning processes as well.
   In the case of developing a project charter, expert judgment would be helpful in assessing
the inputs of this process, the environmental factors, organizational assets, and historical
information. For example, as the project manager, you might rely on the expertise of your
executive committee to help you understand how the proposed project gels with the strategic
plan. Or you might rely on team members who have participated on similar projects in the
past to make recommendations regarding the proposed project.



Formalizing and Publishing
the Project Charter
The project charter is the official, written acknowledgment and recognition that a project
exists. It ties the work of the project with the ongoing operations of the organization. It's
usually signed by a senior manager or project sponsor, and it gives the project manager the
authority to assign organizational resources to the project.
   The charter documents the business need or demand that the project was initiated to
address, and it includes a description of the product, service, or result of the project. It is
usually the first official document of the project once acceptance of the project has been
granted. Project charters are often used as a means to introduce a project to the organiza-
tion. Since this document outlines the high-level project description, the business opportu-
nity or need, and the project's purpose, executive managers can get a "first-glance" look
at the benefits of the project. Good project charters that are well documented will address
many of the questions your stakeholders are likely to have up front.
                                   Formalizing and Publishing the Project Charter                71




  Let's take a brief look at the key stakeholders who might be involved with the project
charter and the role they'll play in its development and on the project in the future.


Key Stakeholders
The PMBOK(R) Guide states that the project charter forms a partnership between the orga-
nization requesting the project and the one performing the project. The project charter
should always be written before beginning the Planning process group. The signature of the
project initiator signifies the formal authorization of the project. In practice, my experience
has been that the project charter requires input from the key stakeholders and is published
under the name of the project sponsor. Let's take a look at the roles of some of the key
stakeholders in the project process next.

Project Manager
The project manager is the person who assumes responsibility for the success of the project.
The project manager should be identified as early as possible in the project and ideally should
participate in writing the project charter.
   The project charter identifies the project manager and describes the authority the project
manager has in carrying out the project. The project manager's primary responsibilities are
project planning and then executing and managing the work of the project. By overseeing the
project charter and the project planning documents created later in the project, the project
manager is assured that everyone knows and understands what's expected of them and what
constitutes a successful project.
   Project managers are responsible for setting the standards and policies for the projects
on which they work. As a project manager, it is your job to establish and communicate the
project procedures to the project team and stakeholders.
   Project managers will identify activities and tasks, resource requirements, project costs,
project requirements, performance measures, and more. Communication and documentation
must become the project manager's best friends. Keeping stakeholders, the project sponsor,
the project team, and all other interested parties informed is "job one," as the famous car
manufacturer's ads say.

Project Sponsor
Have you ever attended a conference or event that was put on by a sponsor? In the infor-
mation technology field, software development companies often sponsor conferences and
seminars. The sponsor pays for the event, the facilities, and the goodies and provides an
opportunity for vendors to display their wares. In return, the sponsor comes out looking
like a winner. Because it is footing the bill for all this fun, the sponsor gets to call the shots
on conference content, and it gets the prime spots for discussing its particular solutions.
And last but not least, it usually provides the keynote speaker and gets to present its infor-
mation to a captive audience.
   Project sponsors are similar to this in that they rally support from stakeholders and the
executive management team for the project. The project sponsor is usually an executive in
the organization who has the power and authority to make decisions and settle disputes
72        Chapter 2   n   Creating the Project Charter



or conflicts regarding the project. The sponsor takes the project into the limelight, so to
speak, and gets to call the shots regarding project outcomes. The project sponsor is also the
one with the big bucks who provides funds for your project. The project sponsor should be
named in the project charter and identified as the final authority and decision maker for
project issues.
   Sponsors are actively involved in the Initiating and Planning phases of the project
and tend to have less involvement during the Execution and Monitoring and Controlling
phases. It's up to the project manager to keep the project sponsor informed of all project
activities, project progress, and any conflicts or issues that arise. The sponsor is the one
with the authority to resolve conflicts and set priorities when these things can't be dealt
with any other way.

Project Champion
The project champion is another strong project supporter. Unlike the sponsor, the project
champion doesn't necessarily have a lot of authority or executive powers. The champion
helps focus attention on the project from a technical perspective. The project champion is
usually someone with a great deal of technical expertise or industry knowledge regarding
the project. They can lend credibility to the viability of the project and to the skills and
abilities of the key project team members to carry out project activities. Sometimes, the
project manager might act as project champion.
   The project champion isn't necessarily identified in the project charter. But as a project
manager, you'll want to know who this person is because the person is a strong project advo-
cate, and because you might need them later to help rally support for project decisions.

Functional Managers
I covered functional managers briefly in Chapter 1. Project managers must work with and
gain the support of functional managers in order to complete the project. Functional man-
agers fulfill the administrative duties of the organization, provide and assign staff members
to projects, and conduct performance reviews for their staff. It's a good idea to identify the
functional managers who will be working on project tasks or assigned project responsibili-
ties in the charter.
   It's also a good idea to identify the key project stakeholders in the project charter.
Although this isn't explicitly stated as part of this process, you'll see in the next section that
stakeholder influences make up one of the components of the project charter. To identify
stakeholder influences, it's also necessary to identify the stakeholders and describe their
roles in high-level terms as I've done here.


Pulling the Project Charter Together
According to the PMBOK(R) Guide, to create a useful and well-documented project charter,
you should include at least these elements:
NN   Purpose or justification for the project
NN   Project objectives that are measurable
                                     Formalizing and Publishing the Project Charter             73



NN   High-level list of requirements
NN   High-level description of the project
NN   High-level list of risks
NN   Summary milestone schedule
NN   Summary budget
NN   Criteria for project approval
NN   Name of the project manager and their authority levels
NN   Name of the sponsor (or authorizer of the project) and their authority levels
   The important factors to remember for the exam about the project charter are that it
authorizes the project to begin, it authorizes the project manager to assign resources to the
project, it documents the business need and justification, it describes the customer's require-
ments, and it ties the project to the ongoing work of the organization.



Exam Spotlight

In some organizations, the project manager might write the project charter. However, if you
(as the project manager) are asked to write the charter, remember that your name should
not appear as the author. Since the project charter authorizes the project and authorizes
you as the project manager, it doesn't make sense for you to write a document authorizing
yourself to manage the project. The author of the charter should be an executive man-
ager in your organization (external to the project) with the power and authority to assign
resources to this project. This is usually the project sponsor or initiator. Remember for the
exam that the charter is authorized by someone external to the project.




Project Charter Sign-Off
The project charter isn't complete until you've received sign-off from the project sponsor,
senior management, and key stakeholders. Sign-off indicates that the document has been
read by those signing it (let's hope so, anyway), and that they agree with its contents and
are on board with the project. It also involves the major stakeholders right from the begin-
ning and should win their continued participation in the project going forward. If someone
has a problem with any of the elements in the charter, now is the time to raise the red flag.
   Prior to publishing the charter, I like to hold a kickoff meeting with the key stakeholders
to discuss the charter and then obtain their sign-off. I think it's imperative you identify your
key stakeholders as soon as possible and involve them in the creation of the project charter.
Remember that stakeholder identification is an ongoing activity.


                   I'll talk more about key stakeholder roles in Chapter 3.
74        Chapter 2    n   Creating the Project Charter



   Signing the project charter document is the equivalent of agreeing to and endorsing the
project. This doesn't mean the project charter is set in stone, however. Project charters will
change throughout the course of the project. As more details are uncovered and outlined
and as the Planning processes begin, more project issues will come to light. This is part of
the iterative process of project management and is to be expected. The charter will occa-
sionally be revised to reflect these new details, project plans will be revised, and project
execution will change to incorporate the new information or direction.
   The last step in this process is publishing the charter. Publishing, in this case, simply
means distributing a copy of the project charter to the key stakeholders, the customer, the
management team, and others who might be involved with the project. Publication can take
several forms, including printed format or electronic format distributed via the company
email system or on the company's intranet.
   Next, we'll look at the Identify Stakeholders process.



Identifying Stakeholders
Think of stakeholders and project participants as a highly polished orchestra. Each partici-
pant has a part to play. Some play more parts than others, and, alas, some don't play their
parts as well as others. An integral part of project management is getting to know your
stakeholders and the parts they play. You'll remember from Chapter 1 that stakeholders are
those people or organizations who have a vested interest in the outcome of the project. They
have something to either gain or lose as a result of the project, and they have the ability to
influence project results.


Identify Stakeholders Inputs
The Identify Stakeholders process involves identifying and documenting all the stakeholders on
the project, including their interests and potential positive or negative impacts on the project.
   Identifying key stakeholders seems like it should be fairly easy, but once you get
beyond the obvious stakeholders, the process can get difficult. Sometimes stakeholders,
even key stakeholders, will change throughout the project's life. The key stakeholders
on a project might include the project sponsor, the customer (who might also be the
project sponsor), the project manager, project team members, management personnel,
contractors, suppliers, and so on. The stakeholders involved in the project charter and
the contract are obvious picks to be included in the stakeholder register, one output of
this process.
   The inputs of this process are as follows:
NN   Project charter
NN   Procurement documents
                                                          Identifying Stakeholders            75



NN   Enterprise environmental factors
NN   Organizational process assets
   According to the PMBOK(R) Guide, the environmental factors you'll want to pay particu-
lar attention to during this process are company culture, organizational structure, and gov-
ernmental or industry standards. The organization structure will help you understand who
has influence and power based on position and where they reside in the organization. The
organizational process assets you should be concerned about include stakeholder register
templates, lessons learned, and the stakeholder registers from previous projects. We'll talk
more about stakeholder register templates later in this chapter.
   Don't forget important stakeholders. That could be a project killer. Leaving out an
important stakeholder, or one whose business processes weren't considered particularly
during the Initiating and Planning processes, could spell disaster for your project.



Exam Spotlight

Stakeholder identification should occur as early as possible in the project and continue
throughout its life. Likewise, the stakeholder analysis and strategy should be reviewed
periodically throughout the project and updated as needed.




Stakeholder Analysis
The tools and techniques of Identify Stakeholders are stakeholder analysis and expert
judgment.
   During stakeholder analysis, you'll want to identify the influences stakeholders
have in regard to the project and understand their expectations, needs, and desires.
From there, you'll derive more specifics regarding the project goals and deliverables. Be
warned that stakeholders are mostly concerned about their own interests and what they
(or their organizations) have to gain or lose from the project. In all fairness, we all fall
into the stakeholder category, so we're all guilty of focusing on those issues that impact
us most.
   According to the PMBOK(R) Guide, there are three steps involved in stakeholder analysis:
identifying stakeholders, identifying potential impact, and assessing how stakeholders are
likely to react to given situations. Let's look at each step independently.
   The first step is identifying all potential stakeholders and capturing general information
about them such as the department they work in, contact information, knowledge levels, and
influence levels. Since the output of this process is the stakeholder register, I would devise a
stakeholder register template now and capture all information about the stakeholders in one
place. Table 2.13 is an example of a stakeholder register template.
76        Chapter 2   n   Creating the Project Charter



Ta b l e 2 .1 3 Stakeholder Register Template


Name     Department       Knowledge Level Expectations      Influence Levels    Phone    Email




   When we discuss the stakeholder register output later in this section, I'll tell you what
additional elements you need to add to your chart.
   Stakeholders can be internal or external to the organization. One way to uncover
stakeholders whom you might not have thought about at the start is to ask known stake-
holders if they're aware of anyone else who might be impacted by this project. Ask team
members whether they're aware of stakeholders who haven't been identified. Stakeholders
might also come to the forefront once you start uncovering some of the goals and deliver-
ables of the project.

Understanding Stakeholder Roles
The second step in identifying stakeholders is identifying the potential impact on or sup-
port for the project each may have and then classifying them according to impact so that
you can devise a strategy to deal with those impacts should they arise.
   In order to determine potential impact, it's important for the project manager to under-
stand each stakeholder's role in the project and in the organization. Get to know them and
their interests. Determine the relationship structure among the various stakeholders. Start
cultivating partnerships with these stakeholders now, because it's going to get pretty cozy
during the course of your project. If you establish good working relationships up front and
learn a little about their business concerns and needs, it might be easier to negotiate or moti-
vate them later when you have a pressing issue that needs action. Knowing which stakehold-
ers work well together and which don't can also help you in the future. One stakeholder
might have the authority or influence to twist the arm of another, figuratively speaking, of
course. Or, conversely, you might know of two stakeholders who are like oil and water when
put into the same room together. This can be valuable information to keep under your hat for
future reference.
   Some stakeholders may have a significant amount of influence over the project and its
outcomes. Understanding the organizational structure, and where the stakeholders fit in
that structure, should be your first step in determining the level of influence they have. For
example, if Melanie in accounting wields a significant amount of power and influence over
the organization, when you need input or decisions from her regarding costs or budgets
for the project, you better believe that those decisions are not likely to be overridden. Con-
versely, if stakeholders with little influence provide direction that you don't verify, that
input could be overridden at a later date by a more powerful stakeholder, causing changes
to the project.
                                                          Identifying Stakeholders           77




   You can essentially classify the power and influence of each stakeholder on a simple
four-square grid. The PMBOK(R) Guide lists four classification models for this task:
NN   Power/Interest grid
NN   Power/Influence grid
NN   Influence/Impact grid
NN   Salience model
   The first three grids are self-explanatory. The Salience model is more complicated than
a four-square grid because it charts three factors: stakeholder power, urgency, and legiti-
macy. Urgency refers to a stakeholders level of need for attention as immediate, occasional,
or rarely. Legitimacy concerns the appropriateness of the stakeholder's participation at
given times during the project.

Assessing Stakeholders
The third step in stakeholder analysis is assessing the influence and potential negative
impacts key stakeholders may have on the project. As I said earlier, some stakeholders
may have a significant amount of influence over the project and its outcomes. And as with
assessing a stakeholder's role, your first step in determining the level of influence they have
should be to understand the organizational structure and where they fit in. Once the stake-
holder assessment is complete, you should devise a plan to deal with any potential impacts
like the case mentioned earlier where a stakeholder with little influence makes a decision
that could later be overturned.


                  Remember that the definition of a successful project is one that accom-
                  plishes the goals of the project and meets or exceeds stakeholders' expec-
                  tations. Understand and document those expectations, and you're off to a
                  good start.




Stakeholder Register and Strategy
Stakeholder register and stakeholder management strategy are the two outputs of this
process. The stakeholder register contains the information we discussed earlier in this sec-
tion in the stakeholder register template. In addition to the elements we already discussed,
the stakeholder register should also contain at least the following details according to the
PMBOK(R) Guide:
Identifying information      This includes items like contact information, department, role in
the project, and so on.
Assessment information This includes elements regarding influence, expectations, key
requirements, and when the stakeholder involvement is most critical.
78        Chapter 2   n   Creating the Project Charter



Stakeholder classification Stakeholders can be classified according to their relationship
to the organization (internal or external for example) and, more importantly, whether they
support the project, are resistant to the project, or have no opinion.
   The stakeholder management strategy is the documented approach you'll use to mini-
mize negative impacts or influences that stakeholders may have throughout the life of the
project. You could use a spreadsheet approach similar to the stakeholder register template
to document this information. I would most likely combine the stakeholder register infor-
mation with the stakeholder management strategy so all the information is contained in
one place.
   According to the PMBOK(R) Guide, you'll want to include the following elements in the
stakeholder management strategy:
NN   Name of key stakeholders who could have a significant impact on the project
NN   Stakeholders' anticipated level of participation
NN   Stakeholder groups
NN   Assessment of impact
NN   Potential strategies for gaining support


                  Remember that project documents are usually easily accessible by the
                  project team and stakeholders. Use caution when documenting sensitive
                  information regarding a stakeholder and your strategy for dealing with that
                  stakeholder because it could become public knowledge.




Introducing the Kitchen Heaven
Project Case Study
This chapter introduces a case study that we'll follow throughout the remainder of the book.
The case study is updated at the end of every chapter. It's designed to show you how a project
manager might apply the material covered in the chapter to a real-life project. As happens in
real life, not every detail of every process is followed during all projects. Remember that the
processes from the PMBOK(R) Guide that I'll cover in the remaining chapters are project man-
agement guidelines. You will often combine processes during your projects, which will allow
you to perform several steps at once. The case studies will present situations or processes that
you might find during your projects and describe how one project manager resolves them.

Project Case Study: New Kitchen Heaven Retail Store

You are a project manager for Kitchen Heaven, a chain of retail stores specializing in kitchen
utensils, cookware, dishes, small appliances, and some gourmet foodstuffs, such as bottled
sauces and spices. You're fairly new to the position, having been hired to replace a project
manager who recently retired.

Kitchen Heaven currently owns 49 stores in 34 states and Canada. The world headquarters
for Kitchen Heaven is in Denver, Colorado. Counting full-time and part-time employees,
the company employs 1,500 people, 200 of whom work at headquarters.

The company's mission statement reads, "Great gadgets for people interested in
great food."

Recently, the vice president of marketing paid you a visit. Dirk Perrier is a very nice,
well-dressed man with the formal air you would expect a person in his capacity might
have. He shakes your hand and gives you a broad, friendly smile.

"We've decided to go forward with our 50th store opening! Sales are up, and our new line
of ceramic cookware is a hot seller, no pun intended. I don't know if you're familiar with
our store philosophy, so let me take a moment to explain it. We like to place our stores in
neighborhoods that are somewhat affluent. The plain fact is that most of our shoppers
have incomes of more than $150,000 a year. So, we make an effort to place our stores in
areas where those folks usually shop.

"We're targeting the type of customer who watches the Food Network channel and must
have all the gadgets and tools they see the famous chefs using. So, the stores are upbeat
and convey a fun, energetic feel, if you will.

"Our next store is going to be right here in our home area--Colorado Springs. Because
this is going to be our 50th store, we plan on having a 50th grand-opening celebration,
with the kind of surprises and activities you might expect for such a notable opening.

"Our stores generally occupy from 1,500 to 2,500 square feet of retail space, and we
typically use local contractors for the build-out. A store build-out usually takes 120 days
from the date the property has been procured until the doors open to the public. I can
give you our last opening's project plan so you have a feel for what happens. Your job
will be to procure the property, negotiate the lease, procure the shelving and associated
store furnishings, get a contractor on the job, and prepare the 50th store festivities. My
marketing folks will assist you with that last part.

"You have six months to complete the project. Any questions?"
80        Chapter 2   n   Creating the Project Charter




You take in a deep breath and collect your thoughts. Dirk has just given you a lot of infor-
mation with hardly a pause in between thoughts. A few initial ideas drift through your
head while you're reaching for your notebook.

You work in a functional organization with a separate projectized department responsible
for carrying out projects of this nature. You've been with the company long enough to
know that Dirk is high up there in the executive ranks and carries the authority and power
to make things happen. Therefore, Dirk is the perfect candidate for project sponsor.

You grab your notebook and start documenting some of the things Dirk talked about,
clarifying with him as you write:

NN   The project objective is to open a new store in Colorado Springs six months from today.
NN   The store should be located in an affluent area.
NN   The store will carry the full line of products from utensils to gourmet food items.
NN   The grand opening will be accompanied by lots of fanfare because this is the 50th
     store opening.

You have a question or two for Dirk.

"Is there a special reason we have to open, let's see, six months from now, which is
February 1?"

He responds, "Yes, we want the store open the first week in February. Early February is
when the Garden and Home Show conference hits the Springs area. We'll have a trade
show booth there. We know from experience in other areas that our stores generally see
a surge in sales during this month as a result of the trade show. It's a great way to get a
lot of advertising out there and let folks know where we're located."

"Another question, Dirk. Is there a budget set for this project yet?"

"We haven't set a hard figure," Dirk replies. "But again, from past experience we know it
takes anywhere from $1.5 to $2 million to open a new store. And we don't want to forget
the big bash for the grand opening."

"Thanks, Dirk. I'll get started writing the project charter right away. I'll be putting your
name on the document since you're the project sponsor."

Dirk concludes with, "Feel free to come to me with questions or concerns at any time."

One week later.

You review your notes and reread the project charter you've prepared for the Kitchen
Heaven retail store one last time before looking for Dirk. You finally run across Dirk in a
hallway near the executive washroom.
                               Introducing the Kitchen Heaven Project Case Study                  81




"Dirk, I'm glad I caught you. I'd like to go over the project charter with you before the kick-
off meeting tomorrow. Do you have a few minutes?"

"Sure," Dirk says to you. "Let's have it."

"The project charter states the purpose of the project, which of course is to open the
50th Kitchen Heaven store in Colorado Springs. I also documented some of the high-
level requirements, many of which we talked about last time we met. I documented the
assumptions and constraints you gave me with the understanding that we'll define these
much more closely when I create the scope statement. I've included a section that out-
lines a preliminary milestone schedule, and I've included some preliminary return on
investment calculations. Using your estimate of $2 million as our initial budget request
and based on the projected inflows you gave me last week, I've calculated a payback
period of 19 months, with an IRR of 6 percent."

"That's impressive," replies Dirk. "That's even better than our Phoenix store. If I recall,
the payback period there was just over two years. Let's hope those numbers hold true."

"I think they're reliable figures," you say. "I researched our data based on recent store
openings in similar-sized cities and factored in the economic conditions of the Colorado
Springs area. Since they're on a growth pattern, we think the timing is perfect.

"As you know, the project kickoff is scheduled for tomorrow. What I'll need, then, is for
you to talk about the project and the goals, talk about the commitment you'll need from
the management team to support this project, and introduce me as the project manager.
I've already forwarded a copy of the project charter to the meeting attendees so that they
can review it before the meeting. And I included a list of the assumptions we've made so
far as an appendix to the charter. Lastly, I'll need you to ask everyone present to sign a
copy of the project charter."

"Sounds like you've covered everything," Dirk says. "I don't anticipate any problems
tomorrow, because everyone is looking forward to this store opening."

Understanding How This Applies
to Your Next Project
There are as many ways to select and prioritize projects as there are organizations. You might
be profit driven, so money will be king. You might have a stakeholder committee that weighs
the pros and cons, or you might have an executive director who determines which project is
up next. Scoring models and cash flow analysis techniques are useful on the job. Whether you
use these methods or others, you'll need an organized, consistent way to select and prioritize
projects. I know I could work the next 100 years straight and probably still not get all the
projects completed my organization would like to see implemented. What I've found is that
the selection method must be fair and reasonable. If you have an arbitrary method--say you
like Tara better than Joe, so Tara's projects always end up on the "yes" list--it won't be long
before your stakeholders demand that you devise a way to select projects that everyone can
understand. Whatever method you're using, stick to it consistently.
    If you're like me, when I'm faced with a new project, I want to get right to the heart of the
matter and understand the purpose of the project. Projects come about for many reasons.
Most of the time, understanding the reason it came about will give you some insight into
its purpose. For example, if a new law is passed that requires anyone applying for a driver's
license to show two forms of identification but the existing system has the space to record
verification of only one document, you immediately have a firm grasp on the purpose of the
project--you'll have to update the system to include additional space for recording the sec-
ond document.
                                                                          Summary            83




   It has been my experience in working with project teams that when the team understands
the reason or the need that brought about the project and it understands the goal of the
project, the project is more successful. Now I don't have any scientific evidence for this, but
when the teams have a clear understanding of what they're working on and why, they tend
to stay more focused and fewer unplanned changes make their way into the project. Don't
assume everyone on the project team understands the goal of the project. It's good prac-
tice to review the project goal early in the project and again once the work of the project is
underway. Reminding the team of the goal helps keep the work on track.
   I usually write a project charter for all but the smallest of projects. I believe the most
important sections of the charter are the objectives of the project, the summary milestone
schedule, and the summary budget. If the project is so small that a charter seems like too
much, I'll write a statement of work. It's important that the goal or objective of the project
is written down, no matter how small the project is, so that the team and the stakeholders
know what they're working toward.
   Identifying the stakeholders early in the project is imperative to project success. You
won't really want to write the charter without their involvement. The two processes described
in this chapter are almost performed simultaneously when you're conducting a project. I
won't begin writing the charter without stakeholder input first. And it's just as important
to understand the role stakeholders will play in the project as well as their influence. If the
CFO has ultimate influence over which projects proceed and what they'll include, you'll want
the CFO's buy-in as soon as possible. Involvement in writing the charter and developing the
future Planning process outputs helps to assure their buy-in. At a minimum, it helps reduce
surprises midway through the project.
   Always, and I mean always, get approval and signatures on the project charter. You
will use this document as your basis for project planning, so you want to make certain the
sponsor, key stakeholders, and the project manager understand the goals of the project
the same way.



Summary
This chapter started with a discussion of the nine Knowledge Areas. The Knowledge Areas
bring together processes that have characteristics in common. And they help you understand
what types of skills and resources are needed to complete the processes within them.
   Next I detailed how projects are initiated. Projects come about as a result of one of seven
needs or demands: market demands, organizational needs, customer requests, technological
advances, legal requirements, ecological impacts, or social needs.
   Project selection methods include decision models in the form of benefit measurement
methods and mathematical models (also called constrained optimization methods). The
mathematical methods utilize mathematical models. Benefit measurement methods come
in the form of cost-benefit analyses, scoring models, and economic analyses. These are
primarily comparative approaches. Besides cost-benefit analysis, the most commonly used
form of benefit measurement methods is cash flow analysis.
84        Chapter 2   n   Creating the Project Charter



    Analysis of cash flows includes payback period, discounted cash flows, net present value
(NPV), and internal rate of return (IRR). These last three methods are concerned with the
time value of money--or, in other words, converting future dollars into today's value. Gen-
erally, projects with a shorter payback period are desired over those with longer payback
periods. Projects that have an NPV greater than zero should be accepted. Projects with the
highest IRR value are considered a better benefit to the organization than projects with
lower IRR values.
    The Develop the Project Charter process is the first process within the Initiating process
group. The project statement of work is an input to this process that describes the product,
service, or result the project was undertaken to complete. The SOW should include the
business needs of the organization and a product scope description and should map to the
organization's strategic plan.
    Enterprise environmental factors are factors outside the project that might have signifi-
cant influence on the success of the project. Organizational process assets refer to policies,
guidelines, and procedures for conducting the project work.
    Expert judgment is the only tool and technique of this process. Experts usually have spe-
cialized knowledge or skills and can include staff from other departments in the company,
external or internal consultants, and members of professional and technical associations or
industry groups.
    The output of this process is the project charter, which is the formal recognition that a
project, or the next project phase, should begin. The charter authorizes the project to begin,
it authorizes the project manager to assign resources to the project, it documents the business
need and justification, it describes the customer's requirements, and it ties the project to the
ongoing work of the organization.
    The Identify Stakeholders process concerns identifying, assessing, and classifying
stakeholders in a stakeholder register and developing a stakeholder management strategy.
Stakeholder involvement is critical to the success of the project. The more the project
manager understands stakeholder influences, expectations, and impacts, the easier it is to
prepare a strategy plan to deal with the impacts or issues, sometimes before they occur.



Exam Essentials
Be able to name the nine Project Management Knowledge Areas. The nine Project Man-
agement Knowledge Areas are Project Integration Management, Project Scope Manage-
ment, Project Time Management, Project Cost Management, Project Quality Management,
Project Human Resource Management, Project Communications Management, Project
Risk Management, and Project Procurement Management.
Be able to distinguish between the seven needs or demands that bring about project
creation. The seven needs or demands that bring about project creation are market
demand, organizational need, customer requests, technological advances, legal require-
ments, ecological impacts, and social needs.
                                                                    Exam Essentials            85




Be able to define decision models. Decision models are project selection methods that are
used prior to the Develop Project Charter process to determine the viability of the project.
Decision models include benefit measurement methods and mathematical models.
Be able to describe and calculate payback period. Payback period is the amount of time it
will take the company to recoup its initial investment in the product of the project. It's calcu-
lated by adding up the expected cash inflows and comparing them to the initial investment
to determine how many periods it takes for the cash inflows to equal the initial investment.
Be able to denote the decision criteria for NPV and IRR. Projects with an NPV greater than
zero should be accepted, and those with an NPV less than zero should be rejected. Projects
with high IRR values should be accepted over projects with lower IRR values. IRR is the dis-
count rate when NPV is equal to zero, and IRR assumes reinvestment at the IRR rate.
Be able to denote the Develop Project Charter inputs. The inputs for Develop the Project
Charter are project statement of work, business case, contract, enterprise environmental
factors, and organizational process assets.
Be able to describe the importance of the project charter. The project charter is the
document that officially recognizes and acknowledges that a project exists. The charter
authorizes the project to begin, it authorizes the project manager to assign resources to the
project, it documents the business need and justification, it describes the customer's require-
ments, and it ties the project to the ongoing work of the organization.
Understand the Identify Stakeholders process. The purpose of this process is to identify the
project stakeholders, assess their influence and level of involvement, devise a plan to deal with
potential negative impacts, and record stakeholder information in the stakeholder register.

Key Terms
You've learned just how important a charter is to every project. Be sure you understand the
elements essential to the document and the processes used to ensure that your charter is
complete. Skimping on the planning steps is almost certain to spell disaster down the road.
Know these processes, and know them by the names used in the PMBOK(R) Guide:

Develop Project Charter

Answers to Review Questions
1.   A. The buyer provides the SOW when projects are performed under contract.

2.   B. This came about because of an organizational need. Staff members were spending
     unproductive hours producing information for the management report that wasn't consis-
     tent or meaningful.

3.   A. Develop Project Charter has five inputs, and they are project SOW, business case, con-
     tract, enterprise environmental factors, and organizational process assets.

4.   C. The most correct answer is to perform a feasibility study. Since this project is taking the
     company into a new, unknown market, there's lots of potential for error and failure. A fea-
     sibility study would help the stakeholders determine whether the project is viable and cost
     effective and whether it has a high potential for success.

5.   D. Project Time Management involves the following processes: Define Activities, Sequence
     Activities, Estimate Activity Resources, Estimate Activity Durations, Develop Schedule,
     and Control Schedule.

6.   B. The project SOW should contain the business need for the project and the product scope
     description and should support the organization's strategic plan.

7.   B. Historical information on projects of a similar nature can be helpful when initiating new
     projects. They can help in formulating project deliverables and identifying constraints and
     assumptions and will be helpful later in the project Planning processes as well.

8.   B. The Project Integration Management Knowledge Area consists of the following pro-
     cesses: Develop Project Charter, Develop Project Management Plan, Direct and Manage
     Project Execution, Monitor and Control Project Work, Perform Integrated Change Control,
     and Close Project or Phase.

9.   A. Benefit measurement methods include comparative methods, scoring models, and cash
     flow analysis. They are used as project selection tools to determine which project to proceed
     with or to determine which project among a list of projects should be undertaken.

10. B. Projects with NPV greater than zero should be given an accept recommendation.

11. B. Projects with the highest IRR value are favored over projects with lower IRR values.

12. A. Net present value (NPV) assumes reinvestment is made at the cost of capital.

13. C. Year 1 and 2 inflows are each $100,000 for a total of $200,000. Year 3 inflows are an
    additional $300,000. Add one more quarter to this total, and the $575,000 is reached in
    three years and three months, or 39 months.

14. D. IRR assumes reinvestment at the IRR rate and is the discount rate when NPV is equal
    to zero.

15. C. Mathematical models can be used to determine which projects are worth undertaking.

16. A. Benefit measurement methods include comparative methods and scoring models, among
    others, to make project selections.

17. B. Project B has a payback period of 21 months; $50,000 is received in the first 12 months,
    with another $75,000 coming in over each of the next three quarters, or nine months.

18. C. Payback period does not consider the time value of money and is therefore the least pre-
    cise of all the cash flow analysis techniques.

19. C. The project should be kicked off with a project charter that authorizes the project to
    begin, assigns the project manager, and describes the project objectives and purpose for the
    project. This ensures that everyone is working with the same purposes in mind.

20. A. According to the PMBOK(R) Guide, the project charter should be published by a man-
    ager external to the project (usually the project sponsor) but with sufficient power and
    authority to carry it off.

                               Great job! You've successfully completed the project Initiating
                               processes and published the project charter, the stakeholder
                               register, and stakeholder management strategy. The project
is officially underway. Stakeholders have been identified and informed of the project, you
have management buy-in on the project, the project manager has been assigned, and the
project objectives and description have been identified. A solid foundation for the planning
process is in place.
    In this chapter, we will begin the Planning processes for the project. In fact, I will con-
tinue discussing the Planning processes through Chapter 7, "Planning Project Resources."
Planning is a significant activity in any project and, if done correctly, will go a long way
toward ensuring project success.
    This chapter begins with the Develop Project Management Plan process. This process
will describe the overall approach you'll use to manage the project. The result of this pro-
cess is the project management plan document that describes how you'll execute, monitor,
and control the project outcomes as the project progresses and how you'll close out the
project once it concludes.
    Then you'll move on to the Collect Requirements process. It's during this process that
quantified requirements are gathered and documented to assure stakeholder needs are met
and expectations are managed.
    During the Define Scope process, you'll use the project charter and the requirements
documentation--plus some other inputs--and then apply the tools and techniques of this
process to come up with the project scope statement. I'll talk in depth about project objec-
tives, requirements, constraints, assumptions, and other elements of writing the project
scope statement, which is an output of this process.
    Once you have the deliverables and requirements well defined, you'll begin the process
of breaking down the work of the project via a work breakdown structure (WBS). You'll
accomplish this task in the Create WBS process. The WBS defines the scope of the project
and breaks the work down into components that can be scheduled and estimated as well as
easily monitored and controlled.
    We have a lot to cover in this chapter so let's get started.



Developing the Project Management Plan
The first process in the Planning process group is the Develop Project Management Plan pro-
cess. It's first for good reason. This process is part of the Integration Management Knowledge
Area and is concerned with defining, coordinating, and integrating all the various subsidiary
project plans.
                                         Developing the Project Management Plan               97




   This process involves defining and documenting the processes you're going to use to man-
age this project. For example, let's say you and the project team have determined you will use
project management processes involving costs, human resources, risks, and a project sched-
ule. (Warning: This is a demonstration only--don't try this at home. In reality, professionals
perform many more processes than this on a typical project.) Each particular process might
have a management plan that describes it. For instance, a cost management plan (an example
of a subsidiary plan) would describe how costs will be managed and controlled and how
changes to costs will be approved and managed throughout the project. The Develop Project
Management Plan process brings all these subsidiary plans together, along with the outputs
of the Planning group processes, into one document called the project management plan.


                   In Chapter 1, "What Is a Project?", I talked about tailoring--determining
                   which processes within each process group are appropriate for the project
                   on which you're working. Tailoring is used in the Develop Project Manage-
                   ment Plan process because it's here you'll determine what processes to
                   use to best manage the project.

   To create and document the plan, you need to gather some inputs and build on the
information you've already collected.


Developing Inputs
The Develop Project Management Plan has four inputs:
NN    Project charter
NN    Outputs from planning processes
NN    Enterprise environmental factors
NN    Organizational process assets
     Let's take a look at each next.
Project charter You'll recall that the project charter describes the objectives of the project
and the high-level requirements needed to satisfy stakeholder expectations. The reason it's
an input into this process is because the content of the project charter--including project
objectives, project description, high-level requirements, summary milestone schedule, sum-
mary budget, and so on--will help you and the team determine exactly which project man-
agement processes to use on the project.
Outputs from Planning processes The project management processes include all the individ-
ual processes that make up the process groups we're talking about throughout this book. The
Initiating group, for example, has two processes, Planning has a zillion (OK, not that many,
but it seems like it), and so on. The outputs from the Planning processes you use on the project
become inputs to the Develop Management Plan. For example, the cost management plan we
talked about in the introduction is an input. Any processes you use that produce a baseline
(such as schedule or cost) or a subsidiary management plan (such as a risk management plan,
communication management plan, and so on) are included as inputs to this process.
98        Chapter 3   n   Developing the Project Scope Statement




                  I'll talk more about baselines and the makeup of individual subsidiary
                  management plans as we discuss the various Planning processes from
                  now throughout Chapter 7 of this book.


Enterprise environmental factors You've seen enterprise environmental factors before.
Some of the key elements of the environmental factors you should consider when choosing
the processes to perform for this project include company culture and organizational struc-
ture, personnel administration, and the project management information system (PMIS).
Organizational process assets Some of the key elements of the organizational process
assets input you should consider when choosing the processes to perform for this project
include standards and regulations (both industry and governmental), project management
plan template, change control procedures, historical information, and the configuration
management knowledge database that contains the official company policies, standards,
procedures, and other project documents.
    The PMIS is an automated (or manual) system used to document the project management
plan and subsidiary plans, to facilitate the feedback process, and to revise the documents.
It incorporates the configuration management system and the change control system, both
of which I'll cover in Chapter 10, "Measuring and Controlling Project Performance." Later
in the project, the PMIS can be used to control changes to any of the plans. When you're
thinking about the PMIS as an input (that is, as part of the enterprise environmental fac-
tors), think of it as a collection and distribution point for information as well as an easy
way to revise and update documents. When you're thinking about the PMIS as a tool and
technique, think of it just that way--as a tool to facilitate the automation, collection, and
distribution of data and to help monitor processes such as scheduling, resource leveling,
budgeting, and web interfaces.



Exam Spotlight

Be aware that the PMBOK(R) Guide describes the PMIS as a tool in the glossary but in this
process it's listed as an organizational process assets input. The PMIS in the Develop Project
Management Plan process includes a subsystem called the configuration management sys-
tem (I'll cover this topic in Chapter 10) and the change control system, which is a subsystem
of the configuration management system.



   As I talked about in Chapter 1, the processes you choose to perform for the project
will be based on the complexity of the project, the project scope, and the type of industry
in which you work. Your organization's standards, guidelines, and policies or the project
management office (PMO) might also dictate the types of processes you'll use for the proj-
ect. You should also consider whether your organization has existing change control pro-
cesses in place, templates that you're required to use, or financial controls and processes.
                                         Developing the Project Management Plan                  99




Historical information and past project files are useful in helping you decide which pro-
cesses to use for this project.
   The only tool and technique of this project is expert judgment. According to the PMBOK(R)
Guide, the types of expert judgment you'll need to complete this process include the following:
NN   Tailoring techniques
NN   Understanding technical and management details that need included in the project
     management plan
NN   Determining resources and assessing skill levels needed for project work
NN   Determining and defining the amount of configuration management to apply on
     the project
NN   Determining which project documents require formal change control processes


Documenting the Project Management Plan
The purpose of most processes is, of course, to produce an output. Outputs are usu-
ally a report or document of some type or a deliverable. In this case, you end up with a
document--the project management plan--that describes, integrates, and coordinates
baselines and subsidiary plans for the processes you've determined to use for the project.
The project management plan can be detailed or it can be a high-level summary based on
the needs of the project.
    According to the PMBOK(R) Guide, the project management plan defines how the project
is executed, how it's monitored and controlled, and how it's closed. It also documents the
outputs of the Planning group processes, which I'll cover over the next several chapters.
The project management plan should include or discuss the following elements:
NN   Processes you'll use to perform each phase of the project
NN   The life cycle you'll use for the project and for each phase of the project if applicable
NN   The tailoring results the project team defines
NN   Methods for executing the work of the project to fulfill the objectives
NN   Change management plan describing methods for monitoring and controlling change
NN   Configuration management
NN   Methods for determining and maintaining the validity of performance baselines
NN   Communication needs of the stakeholders and techniques to fulfill those needs
NN   Management reviews of content, issues, and pending decisions
   In addition to the elements just listed, the subsidiary plans that are associated with the
processes you'll be using for this project should be documented in the project management
plan. Each of these subsidiary management plans might contain the same elements as the
overall project management plan does, but they're specifically related to the topic at hand.
For example, the cost management plan should define how changes to cost estimates will
be reflected in the project budget and how changes or variances with a significant impact
100         Chapter 3     n   Developing the Project Scope Statement



should be communicated to the project sponsor and stakeholders. The schedule manage-
ment plan describes how changes to the schedule will be managed, and so on.
   The subsidiary plans might be detailed or simply a synopsis, depending on the needs of
the project. I've listed the subsidiary plans along with a brief description next. I will cover
each of these plans in more detail throughout the remainder of this book. According to the
PMBOK(R) Guide, the subsidiary plans are as follows:
Scope management plan Describes the process for determining project scope, facilitates
creating the work breakdown structure (WBS), describes how the product or service of the
project is verified and accepted, and documents how changes to scope will be handled.
Requirements management plan Describes how requirements will be analyzed, documented,
traced, reported, and managed throughout the project.
Schedule management plan Describes how the project schedule will be developed and
controlled and how changes will be incorporated into the project schedule.
Cost management plan Describes how costs will be managed and controlled and how
changes to costs will be approved and managed.
Quality management plan Describes how the organization's quality policy will be imple-
mented. It should address and describe quality control procedures and measures, quality
assurance procedures and measures, and continuous process improvement.
Communications management plan Describes the communication needs of the stakeholders,
including timing, frequency, and methods of communications.
Risk management plan Describes how risks will be managed and controlled during the
project. This should include risk management methodology; roles and responsibilities;
definitions of probability and impact; when project management will be performed; and
the categories of risk, risk tolerances, and reporting and tracking formats.
Procurement management plan Describes how the procurement processes will be managed
throughout the project. This might include elements such as type of contract, procurement
documents, and lead times for purchases.
   The project management plan is not limited to the subsidiary plans listed here. You
might include other plans and documentation that help describe how the project will be
executed or monitored and controlled. Perhaps you're working on a project that requires
precise calculations and exact adherence to requirements. You could include a plan that
describes these calculations, how they'll be monitored and measured, and the processes
you'll use to make changes or corrections.
   The project management plan also includes other project planning documents, such
as these:
NN    Milestone list
NN    Resource calendar
NN    Schedule baseline
                                                         Collecting Requirements             101



NN    Cost baseline
NN    Quality baseline
NN    Risk register
NN    Scope baseline
     I'll talk about each of these documents in the remaining chapters as well.



Exam Spotlight

Understand that the purpose of the project management plan is to define how the project
is executed, monitored and controlled, and closed as well as to document the processes
you'll use during the project.



   As the project progresses and more and more processes are performed, the subsidiary
plans and the project management plan itself might change. These changes should be
reviewed, and the project management plan should be updated to reflect the approved
changes. Depending on the nature of the changes, the project manager, stakeholders, or
sponsor (or some combination) should review and approve the changes.



Exam Spotlight

In practice, you'll find that you'll prepare the project management plan after you've pro-
gressed through several of the other Planning processes. It's difficult to create some of
these subsidiary plans without performing the process they're associated with first. How-
ever, for the exam, remember that Develop Project Management Plan is the first process
in the Planning group, and it should be performed first. Updates can and should occur to
the Project Management Plan as subsidiary plans are created or changed.




Collecting Requirements
Collect Requirements is the first process in the Project Scope Management Knowledge Area
and the second process in the Planning process group. You might recall from Chapter 1 that
the purpose of the Project Scope Management Knowledge Area is to describe and control what
is and what is not work of the project. This is the first process where we get into the meat of
the Planning processes and get down to defining what the final product or service of the proj-
ect looks like--thus we're starting off defining what is included in the work of the project.
102        Chapter 3   n   Developing the Project Scope Statement




                  In practice, you will likely perform the Define Scope process before the Col-
                  lect Requirements process. Deliverables must be identified before you can
                  document their detailed requirements. The project charter, an input to this
                  process, does capture some of the high-level requirements of the project,
                  but they are not usually sufficient enough to jump into requirements gather-
                  ing. For the exam, remember that Collect Requirements comes before Define
                  Scope. We'll discuss Define Scope in the section "Defining Scope" later in
                  this chapter.

   Requirements describe the characteristics of the deliverables. They might also describe
functionality that a deliverable must have or specific conditions a deliverable must meet in
order to satisfy the objective of the project. Requirements are typically conditions that must
be met or criteria that the product or service of the project must possess in order to satisfy
the objectives of the project. Requirements quantify and prioritize the wants, needs, and
expectations of the project sponsor and stakeholders. According to the PMBOK(R) Guide and
lots of personal experience, you must be able to measure, trace, and test requirements. It's
important that they're complete and accepted by your project sponsor and key stakeholders.
   The primary purpose of the Collect Requirements process is to define and document the
project sponsor, the customer, and the stakeholder's expectations and needs for meeting
the project objective. In my experience, understanding, documenting, and agreeing upon
requirements is a critical factor to project success. Recording the requirements and attain-
ing stakeholder approval of the requirements will help you define and manage their expec-
tations throughout the project.



Exam Spotlight

Requirements must be documented, analyzed, and quantified in enough detail that they
can be measured once the work of the project begins. Requirements become the basis for
developing the WBS and are essential in estimating costs, developing the project schedule,
and quality planning.



   You've already learned about the two inputs to this process, the project charter and
stakeholder register, so we'll move on to tools and techniques.


Using the Tools and Techniques of Collect Requirements
Your communication skills are about to come in handy. Gathering and documenting require-
ments is not a task for the faint of heart. Since defining and producing requirements are so
critical to the success of the project, I recommend using team members with excellent com-
munication skills to perform this task. If they have the ability to read minds, all the better.
Stakeholders almost always know what they want the end product to look like but often have
                                                         Collecting Requirements             103




difficulty articulating their needs. An expert communicator can read between the lines and ask
the probing questions that will draw the information out of the stakeholder.
   Business process owners are those people who are experts in their particular area of the
business. They are invaluable resources to the project manager and in gathering requirements
for the project. They are usually the midlevel managers and line managers who still have
their fingers in the day-to-day portion of the business. For example, it takes many experts
in various areas to produce and market a great bottle of beer. Machinists regulate and keep
the stainless steel and copper drums in top working order. Chemists check and adjust the
secret formulas brewing in the vats daily. Graphic artists must develop colorful and inter-
esting labels and ads to attract the attention of those thirsty patrons. And of course, those
great TV commercials advertising the tasty brew are produced by yet another set of business
experts. These are the kinds of people you'll interview and ask to assist you in identifying
requirements.
   There are several tools and techniques in this process you can use to help identify the
requirements of the project. Some of these tools and techniques can also be used during
the Identify Risk process and the Plan Quality Process. We'll cover those processes in
Chapter 6 and Chapter 7, respectively. The following tools and techniques are used for
Collect Requirements:
Interviews Interviews are typically one-on-one conversations with stakeholders. Interviews
can be formal or informal and generally consist of questions prepared ahead of time. The
advantages to this tool are that subject matter experts and experienced project participants can
impart a lot of information in a short amount of time and typically have a good understand-
ing of the features and functions needed from the project deliverables. You should record the
responses during the interviews and don't be afraid to ask spontaneous questions as they occur
to you during the interview.
Focus groups Focus groups are usually conducted by a trained moderator. The key to
this tool lies in picking the subject matter experts and stakeholders to participate in the
focus group.
Facilitated workshops Cross-functional stakeholders come together in a facilitated work-
shop to discuss and define requirements that affect more than one department. For example,
if you're implementing a software package that impacts several business units, you'll need
representatives from each unit together in a workshop so that each of their needs are repre-
sented and prioritized. This way, all the participants understand the various needs and have
a facilitated forum to discuss and resolve their issues.



Exam Spotlight

The primary difference between focus groups and facilitated workshops are that focus
groups are gatherings of prequalified subject matter experts and stakeholders and facili-
tated workshops consist of cross-functional stakeholders who can define cross-functional
requirements. Differences among stakeholders can be resolved more quickly and consen-
sus is more easily attained in a facilitated workshop environment.
104        Chapter 3   n   Developing the Project Scope Statement



Group creativity techniques Group creativity involves several techniques, like brainstorming,
Nominal group technique, the Delphi technique, and affinity diagrams. We will cover each of
these techniques in either the Risk Planning process (Chapter 6) or the Plan Quality process
(Chapter 7).
Idea/mind mapping is a group creativity technique where participants first use brainstorming
techniques to record their ideas. White boards or flip charts are a great tool to use with this
process. The facilitator uses the white board to map ideas and, using a mind-mapping layout,
group similar topics together. There are a few mind-mapping software packages available on
the market that can greatly assist with this process. Mind mapping allows the participants
to get an understanding of common ideas and themes, create new ideas, and understand
differences.
Group decision making techniques According to the PMBOK(R) Guide, there are many
methods groups can use to reach decisions. These methods can also be used with the group
creativity techniques. The four methods mentioned include unanimity, where everyone
agrees on the resolution or course of action; majority, where more than 50 percent of the
members support the resolution; plurality, where the largest subgroup within the group
makes the decision if majority is not reached; and dictatorship, where one person makes
the decision on behalf of the group.
Questionnaires and surveys This technique involves querying a large group of participants
via questionnaires or surveys. These tools allow you to gather information quickly and apply
statistical analysis, if needed, to the results.
Observations This technique is typically a one-on-one experience where an observer sits
side by side with the participant to observe how the participant interacts with the product
or service. This technique is also known as job shadowing. For example, you may use this
technique to determine requirements for an upgrade to a software product. Sitting with
the user and watching their interactions with the product enables the observer to uncover
requirements they would not have ordinarily discovered. This technique can also involve
participant observers who perform the job themselves in order to ascertain requirements.
Prototypes Prototyping is a technique involving constructing a working model or mock-
up of the final product for participants to experiment with. The prototype does not usually
contain all the functionality the end product does, but it gives participants enough infor-
mation that they can provide feedback regarding the mock-up. This is an iterative process
where participants experiment and provide feedback and the prototype is revised and the
cycle starts again.


Documenting Requirements
Now that you've employed the tools and techniques of this process to gather requirements,
you'll want to record them in a requirements document. Stakeholders sometimes have
short memories, particularly on long-term projects, so documenting requirements and
obtaining their approval is essential for project success. And you will use the requirements
                                                          Collecting Requirements            105




documentation throughout the project to manage stakeholder and customer expectations.
This is a lot easier to accomplish when they've agreed to the requirements ahead of time
and you have their approval documented.
    I've already mentioned the first output of this process, which is requirements documenta-
tion. The remaining two outputs are the requirements management plan (this could be a
subsidiary plan to the project management plan) and the requirements traceability matrix.
I'll describe each in detail next.

Requirements Documentation
As I mentioned in the opening to this section, requirements quantify and prioritize the wants,
needs, and expectations of the project sponsor and stakeholders. Requirements typically start
out high-level and are progressively elaborated as the project progresses. You must be able to
track, measure, test, and trace the requirements of the project. If you can't measure or test
whether the requirement satisfies the business need of the project, the definition of success is
left to the subjective opinions of the stakeholders and team members.
    You're worked hard to gather and define requirements and you don't want all that effort
going to waste. This output involves recording the requirements in a requirements docu-
ment. The PMBOK(R) Guide does not dictate the format of this document and acknowledges
it can be formal with lots of detail or a simple list categorized by stakeholder and priority.
However, it does state that the requirements document may include at least the following
elements:
NN   Business need for the project and why it was undertaken
NN   Objectives of the project and the business objectives the project hopes to fulfill
NN   Functional requirements
NN   Nonfunctional requirements
NN   Quality requirements
NN   Acceptance criteria
NN   Business rules
NN   Organizational areas and outside entities impacted
NN   Support and training requirements
NN   Assumptions and constraints


                  Functional requirements is a term used often in software development. It
                  typically describes a behavior, such as calculations or processes that should
                  occur once data is entered. In non-software terms, functional requirements
                  might describe specifications, quantities, colors, and more. Nonfunctional
                  requirements refer to elements that are related to the product but don't
                  describe the product directly. In the case of a software product, this could
                  be a security requirement or performance criteria.
106         Chapter 3   n   Developing the Project Scope Statement



   One of the most important elements of the requirements document that isn't in the
preceding list is the signatures of the key stakeholders indicating their acceptance of
the requirements. They will also sign the scope statement, which we'll talk about in the
section "Defining Scope" later in this chapter.

Creating the Requirements Management Plan
The requirements management plan defines how the requirements will be analyzed, doc-
umented, and managed throughout all phases of the project. The type of phase relation-
ship you choose to manage the project will determine how requirements are managed
throughout the project. For example, in a sequentially phased project, it's possible to
define requirements in later phases of the project after some work has been completed.
In an overlapping phased relationship, you'll need to define and document most all the
requirements early in the life cycle.


                   We talked about phase-to-phase relationships in Chapter 2. There are three
                   types: sequential, overlapping, and iterative.




Exam Spotlight

Make certain you document the phase-to-phase relationship you'll use during the project
life cycle in the requirements management plan.



   There are several components of a sound requirements management plan. According to
the PMBOK(R) Guide, you should include the following factors in the plan:
NN    How planning, tracking, and reporting of requirements activities will occur
NN    How changes to the requirements will be requested, tracked, and analyzed along with
      other configuration management activities
NN    How requirements will be prioritized
NN    What metrics will be used to trace product requirements
NN    What requirements attributes will be documented in the traceability matrix (the last
      output of this process)
  Remember that the requirements management plan can be considered a subsidiary
management plan and be included in the project management plan.

Documenting the Requirements Traceability Matrix
The last output of the Collect Requirements process is the requirements traceability
matrix. The idea behind the traceability matrix is to document where the requirement

originated, document what the requirement will be traced to, and then follow it through
to delivery or completion. Table 3.1 shows a sample traceability matrix with several attri-
butes that identify the requirement.

Ta b l e 3 .1 Requirements Traceability Matrix

   Each requirement should have its own unique identifier. You could devise a numbering
system that defines both the category of the requirement and a unique, ascending number--
for example, HR (for human resources) 001. Or, a simple numbering system as shown in
this example may suffice.
   The description should be brief but have enough information to easily identify the
requirement.
   The source column refers to where the requirement originated. Requirements may come
from many sources, including project objectives, business needs, product design, the work
breakdown structure, deliverables, and so on.
   Priority refers to the priority of the requirement. You can use any prioritization process
like a simple numbering system or an alpha system as the example shows here. The defini-
tion of a "B" priority should be included in the requirements management plan. Perhaps an
"A" is essential to project success and a "B" is highly desirable.
   The test scenario in this example is where you record how the requirement will be tested
or during which project phase, and test verification indicates if it passes or fails the test.
   Status may capture information about the requirement that refers to whether the
requirement has been approved to be included in the project; if it was added, deferred,
canceled; and so on.



Exam Spotlight

According to the PMBOK(R) Guide, the requirements traceability matrix helps assure that
business value is realized when the project is complete because each requirement is
linked to a business and project objective.



   The next process in the Planning process group is the Define Scope process. Before we
jump into that process, I want to talk a little about the scope management plan. We'll look
at that next.
108         Chapter 3   n   Developing the Project Scope Statement




Documenting the Scope
Management Plan
The scope management plan describes how the project team will go about defining project
scope, verifying the work of the project, and managing and controlling scope. The PMBOK(R)
Guide does not go into detail regarding this plan, but there are some things you may need to
know about this plan for the exam.
   The project scope management plan should contain the following:
NN    The process you'll use to prepare the project scope statement. The project scope
      statement (which I'll define later in this chapter) contains a detailed description of
      the project deliverables.
NN    A process for creating the work breakdown structure (WBS). The WBS further defines
      the work of the project (as defined in the scope statement) by breaking down the deliv-
      erables into smaller pieces of work. We'll talk about the WBS at the end of this chapter.
NN    A definition of how the deliverables will be verified for accuracy and the process used
      for accepting deliverables.
NN    A description of the process for controlling scope change requests, including the proce-
      dure for requesting changes and how to obtain a change request form.



Exam Spotlight

The project scope management plan is a planning tool that documents how the project
team will go about defining project scope, how the work breakdown structure will be
developed, how changes to scope will be controlled, and how the work of the project will
be verified and accepted. And don't forget, the scope management plan is a subsidiary of
the project management plan.




Defining Scope
Scope is collectively the product, service, or result of the project. Scope can refer to product
scope (the features and characteristics that describe the product, service, or result of the proj-
ect) or project scope (the project management work). We'll look at both product and project
scope in this section.
   Now that you've documented the project requirements, you're ready to further define the
needs of the project in the Define Scope process. The project scope statement (an output of
this process) is what you'll use to develop and document a detailed description of the deliv-
erables of the project and the work needed to produce them. This process is progressively
elaborated as more detail becomes known.
                                                                    Defining Scope             109




Scope Management Plan Requirements

Phil Reid is a gifted engineer. He works as an accident reconstructionist and has a
90 percent success rate at assisting his clients (who are attorneys) at winning court
cases. Phil can intuitively and scientifically determine whether the scene of an accident
is real or is insurance fraud. Most cases Phil works on are managed as projects because
each accident is unique, the cause of each accident is unique, and each investigation
has a definite beginning and ending. The attorneys that Phil's organization works with
want the final results of the investigation delivered in different formats. Although Phil
is exceptionally good at determining the forensic evidence needed to prove or disprove
how the accident occurred, he is not at all gifted in oral communication skills. As a
result, the scope management plan requires the client to define how the outcome of
the investigation should be presented and whether the engineer might be required to
testify regarding the results of the investigation. That way, Phil's organization can plan
in advance how to use his talents on the project and assign a resource to work with him
who has the communication skills and ability to testify if that's required.




Exam Spotlight

You'll want to pay particular attention to the accuracy and completeness of this process.
Defining project scope is critical to the success of the project since it spells out exactly
what the product or service of the project looks like. Conversely, poor scope definition
might lead to cost increases, rework, schedule delays, and poor morale.



     First you'll examine the inputs and tools and techniques of this process.
     The inputs to the Define Scope process are as follows:
NN    Project charter
NN    Requirements documentation
NN    Organizational process assets
   One of the important elements from the project charter that you'll want to consider when
writing the project scope statement (we'll cover this output later) is the project objectives.
   Objectives are quantifiable criteria used to measure project success. They describe the
"what" you're trying to do, accomplish, or produce. Quantifiable criteria should at least
include schedule, cost, and quality measures. You might use business measures or quality tar-
gets as well. These objectives will be broken down shortly into deliverables that will describe
the objectives outlined in the charter.
110          Chapter 3    n   Developing the Project Scope Statement



   Some of the other important information you'll want to key in on from these inputs are
historical information; the product description; and the project objectives, assumptions,
and constraints. (I'll cover each of these in the section "Writing the Project Scope State-
ment" later in this chapter.)



Exam Spotlight

If the project charter is missing or was not created, you'll need to develop the information
normally found in the charter (or obtain it from other sources) to use as the foundation
for creating the project scope statement .



      You'll see some new tools and techniques in this process:
NN     Expert judgment
NN     Product analysis
NN     Alternatives identification
NN     Facilitated workshops
  I covered expert judgment and facilitated workshops in Chapter 2. I'll discuss product
analysis and alternatives identification in the following sections.


Product Analysis
Product analysis goes hand in hand with the product scope description and therefore is
most useful when the project's end result is a product. Product analysis is a method for con-
verting the product description and project objectives into deliverables and requirements.
According to the PMBOK(R) Guide, product analysis might include performing value analy-
sis, functional analysis, requirements analysis, systems-engineering techniques, systems
analysis, product breakdown, or value-engineering techniques to further define the product
or service.



Exam Spotlight

It's beyond the scope of this book to go into the various analysis techniques used in product
analysis. For exam purposes, remember that product analysis is a tool and technique of the
Define Scope process, and memorize the list of analysis techniques that might be performed
in this process.
                                                                    Defining Scope              111




Alternatives Identification
Alternatives identification is a technique used for discovering different methods or ways
of accomplishing the work of the project. For example, brainstorming might be used to
discover alternative ways of achieving one of the project objectives. Perhaps the project's
budget doesn't allow for a portion of the project that the stakeholders really think needs to
be included. Brainstorming might uncover an alternative that would allow the needed por-
tion to be accomplished.
   Lateral thinking is a form of alternatives identification that can be used to help define
scope. Edward de Bono created this term and has done extensive research and writing on
the topic of lateral thinking. The simplest definition is that it's thinking outside the box.
Lateral thinking is a process of separating the problem--or in our case the components of
project scope (the deliverables and requirements)--looking at them from angles other than
their obvious presentation and encouraging team members to come up with ways to solve
problems or look at scope that are not apparently obvious.



Outside the Box

Lateral thinking is a way of reasoning and thinking about problems from perspectives
other than the obvious. It challenges our perceptions and assumptions. Consider these
two examples of lateral thinking that I crafted based on some puzzles I found at this web-
site: www.folj.com/lateral/. Use your favorite search engine and run a query on "lateral
thinking puzzles" to find many more examples.

    Question: How could your pet Yorkie fall from the window of an 18-story building
    and live?
    Answer: The question asks how your pet could fall from an 18-story building and
    live; however, the question doesn't state your pet fell from the 18th floor. So, your pet
    Yorkie fell from the basement-level window.
    Question: Eight chocolates are arranged in an antique candy dish. Eight people each
    take one chocolate. There is one chocolate remaining in the dish. How can that be?
    Answer: If there are eight chocolates in an antique dish, how can the last person take
    the last chocolate yet one remains in the dish? Well, the last person to take a chocolate
    took the dish as well--therefore, the last chocolate remained in the dish.

Remember these examples the next time you're defining scope or looking for alternative
answers to a problem.
112         Chapter 3   n   Developing the Project Scope Statement




Writing the Project Scope Statement
The purpose of the project scope statement is to document the project objectives, deliver-
ables, and the work required to produce the deliverables so that it can be used to direct the
project team's work and as a basis for future project decisions. The scope statement is an
agreement between the project and the project customer that states precisely what the work
of the project will produce. Simply put, the scope statement tells everyone concerned with
the project exactly what they're going to get when the work is finished.



Exam Spotlight

Understand that the purpose of the scope statement, according to the PMBOK(R) Guide,
is to provide all the stakeholders with a foundational understanding of the project scope.
Also remember that the scope statement defines and progressively elaborates the work
of the project. It guides the work of the project team during the Executing process, and all
change requests will be evaluated against the scope statement. If the change request is
outside the bounds of the project scope as documented in the project scope statement, it
should be denied.



   Since the scope statement serves as a baseline for the project, if questions arise or
changes are proposed later in the project, they can be compared to what's documented in
the scope statement. Making change decisions is easier when the original deliverables and
requirements are well documented. You'll also know what is out of scope for the project
simply because the work isn't documented in the scope statement (or conversely, deliver-
ables or other elements are documented and noted as being specifically out of scope). The
criteria outlined in the scope statement will also be used to determine whether the project
was completed successfully. I hope you're already seeing the importance of documenting
project scope.


Understanding the Scope Statement Components
According to the PMBOK(R) Guide, the project scope statement should include all of the
following:
NN    Product scope description
NN    Product acceptance criteria
NN    Project deliverables
NN    Project exclusions
NN    Project constraints
NN    Project assumptions
                                              Writing the Project Scope Statement              113




   If the details surrounding these are spelled out in other documents, you don't have to
reenter all the information in the scope statement. Simply reference the other document in
the scope statement so that readers know where to find it.

Product Scope Description
The product scope description describes the characteristics of the product, service, or result
of the project. I talked about this in Chapter 2. If the product scope description is contained in
the project charter, you can reference the project charter in the project scope statement or you
can copy and paste the information from the project charter into the scope statement. It won't
hurt anything to have it in both places and will make reading the scope statement easier.



Exam Spotlight

You'll use the project management plan as your measurement of project scope completion,
and product scope completion will be measured against product requirements.




Product Acceptance Criteria
Product acceptance criteria include the process and criteria that will be used to determine
whether the deliverables and the final product, service, or results of the project are accept-
able and satisfactory. Product acceptance criteria help you describe project success because
it defines the specifications the deliverables must meet in order to be acceptable to the stake-
holder. Acceptance criteria might include any number of elements, such as quality criteria,
fitness for use, and performance criteria. This component should also describe the process
stakeholders will use to indicate their acceptance of the deliverables.

Project Deliverables
Deliverables are measurable outcomes, measurable results, or specific items that must be
produced to consider the project or project phase completed. Deliverables should be specific
and verifiable. For example, one of your deliverables might include widgets with a three-
inch diameter that will in turn be assembled into the final product. This deliverable, a
three-inch-diameter widget, is specific and measurable. However, if the deliverable was not
documented or not communicated to the manager or vendor responsible for manufacturing
the widgets, there could be a disaster waiting to happen. If they deliver two-inch widgets
instead of the required three-inch version, it would throw the entire project off schedule or
perhaps cause the project to fail. This could be a career-limiting move for the project man-
ager because it's the project manager's responsibility to document deliverables and monitor
the progress of those deliverables throughout the project. Most projects have multiple deliv-
erables. As in this example, if you are assembling a new product with many parts, each of
the parts might be considered independent deliverables.
114        Chapter 3   n   Developing the Project Scope Statement



   A project deliverable is typically a unique and verifiable product or result or a service
that's performed. The product or service must be produced or performed in order to con-
sider the project complete. The deliverables might also include supplementary outcomes
such as documentation or project management reports.
   The bottom line is this: no matter how well you apply your project skills, if the wrong
deliverables are produced or the project is managed to the wrong objectives, you will have
an unsuccessful project on your hands.



Documenting All the Deliverables and Requirements

One of the project manager's primary functions is to accurately document the deliver-
ables and requirements of the project and then manage the project so that they are pro-
duced according to the agreed-upon criteria. Deliverables describe the components of
the goals and objectives in a quantifiable way. Requirements are the specifications of the
deliverables. (Remember for the exam that requirements are documented in the Collect
Requirements process that occurs before the Define Scope process.)

The project manager should use the project charter as a starting point for identifying
and progressively elaborating project deliverables, but it's possible that only some of
the deliverables will be documented there. Remember that the charter was signed by a
manager external to the project, and it was the first take at defining the project objectives
and deliverables. As the project manager, it's your job to make certain all the deliverables
are identified and documented in the project scope statement. That's because the scope
statement (not the project charter) serves as the agreement among stakeholders--includ-
ing the customer of the project--regarding what deliverables will be produced in order to
meet and satisfy the business needs of the project.

Interview the stakeholders, other project managers, project team members, customers,
management staff, industry experts, and any other experts who can help you identify all
the deliverables of the project. Depending on the size of the project, you might be able to
accomplish this in a group setting using simple brainstorming techniques, but large com-
plex projects might have scope statements for each deliverable of the project. Remember
that the project scope statement is progressively elaborated into finer detail and is used
later to help decompose the work of the project into smaller tasks and activities.




Project Exclusions
Project exclusions are, as you'd guess, anything that isn't included as a deliverable or work
of the project. You'll want to note the project exclusions in the project scope statement so
that you can continue to manage stakeholder expectations throughout the project.
                                              Writing the Project Scope Statement                  115




Critical Success Factors

Deliverables and requirements are sometimes referred to as critical success factors. Critical
success factors are those elements that must be completed in order for the project to be
considered complete. For example, if you're building a bridge, one of the deliverables might
be to produce a specific number of trusses that will be used to help support the bridge.
Without the trusses, the bridge can't be completed; in fact, the bridge might not stand
without them. The trusses, in this case, are a critical success factor. Not all deliverables are
necessarily critical success factors, but many of them will fall into this category and should
be documented as such.




Project Constraints
Constraints are anything that either restricts the actions of the project team or dictates
the actions of the project team. Constraints put you in a box. (I hope you're not claus-
trophobic.) As a project manager, you have to manage to the project constraints, which
sometimes requires creativity.
   In my organization, and I'm sure the same is true in yours, we have far more project
requests than we have resources to work on them. In this case, resources are a constraint.
You'll find that a similar phenomenon occurs on individual projects as well. Almost every
project you'll encounter must work within the triple constraint combination of scope, time,
and cost. The quality of the project (or the outcomes of the project) is affected by how well
these three constraints are managed. Usually one or two triple constraints apply (and some-
times all three), which restricts the actions of the project team. You might work on projects
where you have an almost unlimited budget (don't we wish!) but time is the limitation. For
example, if the president mandated that NASA put an astronaut on Mars by the end of 2011,
you'd have a time-constrained project on your hands.
   Other projects might present the opposite scenario. You have all the time you need to
complete the project, but the budget is fixed. Still other projects might incorporate two or
more of the project constraints. Government agencies are notorious for starting projects
that have at least two and sometimes all three constraints. For example, new tax laws are
passed that impact the computer programs, requiring new programs to calculate and track
the tax changes. Typically, a due date is given when the tax law takes effect, and the orga-
nization responsible is required to implement the changes with no additions to budget or
staff. In other words, they are told to use existing resources to accomplish the objectives of
the project, and the specific requirements, or scope, of the project are such that they cannot
be changed to try to meet the time deadline.
   As a project manager, one of your biggest jobs is to balance the project constraints
while meeting or exceeding the expectations of your stakeholders. In most projects, you
will usually have to balance only one or two of the triple constraints. For example, if one
of the project objectives is to complete the project by the end of the year and stay within a
116        Chapter 3   n   Developing the Project Scope Statement



certain budget, you will need to balance the other two constraints: time and cost. And as
the saying goes, "I can give it to you fast or I can give it to you cheap, but I can't give it to
you fast and cheap."
   Constraints can take on many forms and aren't limited to time, cost, and scope. Anything
that impedes your project team's ability to perform the work of the project or specifically dic-
tates the way the project should be performed is considered a constraint. Let's say in order to
fulfill some of the deliverables of your project you'll have to purchase a large amount of mate-
rials and equipment. Procurement processes may be so cumbersome that ordering supplies
for a project adds months to the project schedule. The procurement process itself becomes a
constraint because of the methods and procedures you're required to use to get the materials.
   You're likely to encounter the following constraints on your future projects:
Time constraint As I said, time can be a project constraint. This usually comes in the
form of an enforced deadline, commonly known as the "make it happen now" scenario. If
you are in charge of the company's holiday bash scheduled for December 10, your project is
time constrained. Once the invitations are out and the hall has been rented, you can't move
the date. All activities on this project are driven by the due date.
Budget constraints Budgets, or cost, are another element of the classic triple constraint. Bud-
gets limit the project team's ability to obtain resources and might potentially limit the scope
of the project. For example, component X cannot be part of this project because the budget
doesn't support it.
Scope constraints Scope is the third element of the original triple constraints. Scope defines
the deliverables of the project, and you may have situations where scope is predefined by
your project sponsor. Alternatively, sometimes budget constraints will impact the scope of
the project and require you to cut back on the deliverables originally planned.
Quality constraints Quality constraints typically are restricted by the specifications of
the product or service. The specifications for those three-inch widgets talked about earlier
could be considered a quality constraint. Most of the time, if quality is a constraint, one
of the other constraints--time or budget--has to have some give. You can't produce high
quality on a restricted budget and within a tightly restricted time schedule. Of course, there
are exceptions, but only in the movies.
Schedule constraints Schedule constraints can cause interesting dilemmas for the project
manager. For example, say you're the project manager in charge of building a new football
stadium in your city. The construction of the stadium will require the use of cranes--and
crane operators--at certain times during the project. If crane operators are not available
when your project plan calls for them, you'll have to make schedule adjustments so that the
crane operators can come in at the right time.
Resource constraints Resources could be a constraint from a few different perspectives,
including availability of key resources both internally and in the market place, skill levels,
and personality. You may also have availability issues or quality problems with nonhuman
resources, like materials and goods. In my experience, human resources constraints are
something I deal with on every project.
                                               Writing the Project Scope Statement                117




Technology constraints Technology is marvelous. In fact, how did humans survive prior
to the invention of computers and cell phones? However, it can also be a project constraint.
For example, your project might require the use of new technology that is still so new it
hasn't been released on a wide-scale basis or hasn't been adequately tested to determine
stability in production. One impact might be that the project will take an additional six
months until the new technology is ready and tested.
Directive constraints Directives from management can be constraints as well. Your depart-
ment might have specific policies that management requires for the type of work you're about
to undertake. This might add time to the project, so you must consider those policies when
identifying project constraints. And when you're performing work on contract, the provisions
of the contract can be constraints
   Constraints, particularly the classic triple constraints, can be used to help drive out the
objectives and requirements of the project. If it's difficult to discern which constraint is the pri-
mary constraint, ask the project sponsor something like this, "Ms. Sponsor, if you could have
only one of these two alternatives, which would you choose? The project is delivered on the
date you've stated, or we don't spend one penny more than the approved budget." If Ms. Spon-
sor replies with the date response, you know your primary constraint is time. If push comes
to shove during the project Planning processes for this project, the budget might have to give
because time cannot.
   You'll want to understand what the primary constraint is on the project. If you assume
the primary constraint is budget when in actuality the primary constraint is time, in the
immortal words of two-year-olds worldwide, uh-oh. Understanding the constraints and
which one carries the most importance will help you later in the project Planning process
group with details such as scope planning, scheduling, estimating, and project plan devel-
opment. That's assuming your project gets to the project Planning processes, which brings
me to the next topic: project assumptions.

Project Assumptions
You've probably heard the old saying about the word assume, something about what it
makes out of "u" and "me." In the case of project management, however, throw this old
saying out the window, because it's not true.
   Assumptions, for the purposes of project management, are things you believe to be true.
For example, if you're working on a large construction project, you might make assumptions
about the availability of materials. You might assume that concrete, lumber, drywall, and so
on are widely available and reasonably priced. You might also assume that finding contract
labor is either easy or difficult, depending on the economic times and the availability of labor
in your locale. Each project will have its own set of assumptions, and the assumptions should
be identified, documented, and updated throughout the project.
   It's essential to understand and document the assumptions you're making, and the assump-
tions your stakeholders are making, about the project. It's also important to find out as many
of the assumptions as you can up front. Projects can fail, sometimes after lots of progress has
been made, because an important assumption was forgotten or the assumption was incorrect.
Defining new assumptions and refining old ones are forms of progressive elaboration.
118        Chapter 3   n   Developing the Project Scope Statement



    Let's say you make plans to meet your buddy for lunch at 11:30 on Friday at your
favorite spot. When Friday rolls around, you assume he's going to show up, barring any
catastrophes between the office and the restaurant. Project assumptions work the same
way. For planning purposes, you presume the event or thing you've made the assumptions
about is true, real, or certain. You might assume that key resources will be available when
needed on the project. Document that assumption. If Dara is the one and only resource
who can perform a specific task at a certain point in the project, document your assump-
tion that Dara will be available and run it by her manager. If Dara happens to be on a
plane for Helsinki at the time you thought she was going to be working on the project, you
could have a real problem on your hands.
    Other assumptions could be factors, such as vendor delivery times, product availability,
contractor availability, the accuracy of the project plan, the assumption that key project mem-
bers will perform adequately, contract signing dates, project start dates, and project phase
start dates. This is not an exhaustive list, but it should get you thinking in the right direction.
As you interview your stakeholders, ask them about their assumptions, and add them to your
list. Use brainstorming exercises with your team and other project participants to come up
with additional assumptions.


                  Think about some of the factors you usually take for granted when you're
                  trying to identify assumptions. Many times they're the elements everyone
                  expects will be available or will behave in a specific way. Think about fac-
                  tors such as key team members' availability, access to information, access
                  to equipment, management support, and vendor reliability.

   Try to validate your assumptions whenever possible. When discussing assumptions with
vendors, make them put them in writing. In fact, if the services or goods you're expecting to be
delivered by your suppliers are critical to the project, include a clause in the contract to assure
a contingency plan in case your suppliers fail to perform. For example, if you're expecting 200
computers to be delivered, configured, and installed by a certain date, require the vendor to
pay the cost of rental equipment in the event the vendor can't deliver on the promised due date.
   Remember, when assumptions are incorrect or not documented, it could cause problems
partway through the project and might even be a project killer.

Approval Requirements
Approval requirements are not an official component of the scope statement according to
the PMBOK(R) Guide, but I recommend that you know something about them. Approval
requirements refer to how the objectives, deliverables, project management documents, and
other outcomes and results of the project will be approved. This is different from product
acceptance criteria--that element describes how the product itself will be approved, whereas
this element describes the requirements that must be met in order to approve the deliver-
ables. An example product acceptance criteria might be "All widgets must measure three
inches." A deliverable approval requirement might be that the director of sales must approve
a prototype before the project can proceed. This section might also contain the process and
approval requirements of the project scope statement.

Approving and Publishing the Project Scope Statement
Just like the project charter, the project scope statement should be approved, agreed upon,
published, and distributed to the stakeholders, key management personnel, and project team
members. This isn't an official output of this process, nor is it noted in the PMBOK(R) Guide.
You can accomplish this with a formal sign-off procedure that's documented as part of the
approval requirements section of the scope statement. When stakeholders sign off and agree
to the scope statement, they're agreeing to the deliverables and requirements of the project.
And, as with the project charter, their agreement and endorsement of the project require-
ments and deliverables will likely sustain their participation and cooperation throughout the
rest of the project. That doesn't mean they'll agree to everything as the project progresses, but
it does mean the stakeholders are informed and will likely remain active project participants.


                  Remember that the definition of a successful project is one that accom-
                  plishes the goals of the project and meets or exceeds stakeholders' expec-
                  tations. Understand and document those expectations and you're off to a
                  good start.




Updating the Project Documents
The last output of this process is project document updates. When you're in the midst
of defining deliverables, you'll often find that changes to the original project objectives,
requirements, or stakeholder register will occur. This may require updates to the stake-
holder register, the requirements documentation, and requirements traceability matrix.
Changes to scope may occur later in the project. When the changes are approved, you'll
need to update the scope statement and notify stakeholders that changes have been made.




Mountain Streams Services

Maria Sanchez is the CEO of Mountain Streams Services. She recently accepted a presti-
gious industry award on behalf of the company. Maria knows that without the dedication
and support of her employees, Mountain Streams Services wouldn't have achieved this
great milestone.

Maria wants to host a reception for the employees and their guests in recognition of all
their hard work and contributions to the company. Maria has appointed you to arrange
the reception.

The reception is scheduled for April 12, and Maria has given you a budget of $125 per
person. The company employs 200 people. The reception should be semiformal.
120         Chapter 3   n   Developing the Project Scope Statement




You've documented the deliverables as follows:

NN    Location selection
NN    Food and beverage menu
NN    Invitations
NN    Entertainment
NN    Insurance coverage
NN    Decorations
NN    Photographer
NN    Agenda

In addition to the deliverables, you want to go over the following requirements with Maria
to be certain you both are in agreement:

NN    The location should be somewhere in the downtown area.
NN    Employees are encouraged to bring one guest but no children.
NN    There will be an open bar paid for by Maria.
NN    The agenda will include a speech by Maria, followed by the distribution of bonus
      checks to every employee. This is to be kept secret until the reception.
NN    The decorations should include gold-trimmed fountain pens with the company logo
      at every place setting for the attendees to keep.

Once you've documented all the particulars, you ask to speak with Maria to go over this
project scope statement and get her approval before proceeding with the project.




Creating the Work Breakdown Structure
Have you ever mapped out a family tree? In the Create WBS process, you'll construct
something like it called a work breakdown structure (WBS). It maps the deliverables of the
project with subdeliverables and other components stemming from each major deliverable
in a tree or chart format. The PMBOK(R) Guide describes a WBS as "a deliverable-oriented
hierarchical decomposition of the work to be executed by the project team, to accomplish
the project objectives and create the required deliverables...the WBS defines the total scope
of the project." Simply put, a WBS is a deliverable-oriented hierarchy that defines and orga-
nizes the work of the project and only the work of the project. Like the scope statement, the
WBS serves as a foundational agreement among the stakeholders and project team members
regarding project scope.

Exam Spotlight

Subdividing deliverables into smaller components is the purpose of the Create WBS
process. The PMBOK(R) Guide calls this decomposition, which is also a tool and tech-
nique of this process.



   The WBS will be used throughout many of the remaining Planning processes and is an
important part of project planning. As you probably have concluded, everything you've
done so far builds on the previous step. The project charter, requirements document, and
project scope statement outline the project objectives, requirements, and deliverables. Now
you'll use that comprehensive list of requirements and deliverables to build the framework
of the WBS.


                 I can't stress enough the importance of the work you've done up to this
                 point. Your WBS will be only as accurate as your list of requirements and
                 deliverables. The deliverables will become the groupings that will form the
                 higher levels of the WBS from which activities will be derived later in the
                 Planning processes.

   The WBS should detail the full scope of work needed to complete the project. This
breakdown will smooth the way for estimating project cost and time, scheduling resources,
and determining quality controls later in the Planning processes. Project progress will be
based on the estimates and measurements assigned to the WBS segments. So, again, accu-
racy and completeness are required when composing your WBS.
   Before you begin constructing the WBS, you'll need to gather and review some important
project documents. You'll look at those next.


Gathering the WBS Inputs
The inputs to the Create WBS process aren't new. They are as follows:
NN   Project scope statement
NN   Requirements documentation
NN   Organizational process assets
   The important aspect to note about the inputs to this process is that the approved
project scope statement is the document you will use to define and organize the work of
the project in the WBS. Make certain you're using the most current version of the scope
statement. And note also that the WBS, just like the project scope statement, contains the
work of the project and only the work of the project.
122         Chapter 3   n   Developing the Project Scope Statement




Decomposing the Deliverables
The Create WBS process consists of one tool and technique called decomposition. This tech-
nique involves breaking down the deliverables into smaller, more manageable components of
work. The idea here is to break down the deliverables to a point where you can easily plan,
execute, monitor and control, and close out the project deliverables. Decomposition typically
pertains to breaking deliverables down into smaller deliverables, or component deliverables,
where each level of the WBS (or each level of decomposition) is a more detailed definition of
the level above it.
   This breaking-down or decomposing process will accomplish several tasks for you, one
of which is improving estimates. It's easier to estimate the costs, time, and resources needed
for individual work components than it is to estimate them for a whole body of work or
deliverable. Using smaller components also makes it easier to assign performance measures
and controls. These give you a baseline to compare against throughout the project or phase.
And finally, assigning resources and responsibility for the components of work makes bet-
ter sense because several resources with different skills might be needed to complete one
deliverable. Breaking them down assures that an assignment, and the responsibility for that
assignment, goes to the proper parties.
   According to the PMBOK(R) Guide, decomposition is a five-step process:
1.    Identify the deliverables and work. This step involves identifying all the major project
      deliverables and related work. The PMBOK(R) Guide makes a point of noting that you
      can use the expert judgment technique to analyze the project scope statement and iden-
      tify the major deliverables.
2.    Organize the WBS. This step involves organizing the work of the project and determin-
      ing the WBS structure. (I'll talk more about constructing the WBS in the next section).
3.    Decompose the WBS components into lower-level components. WBS components, like
      the deliverables and requirements, should be defined in tangible, verifiable terms so
      that performance and successful completion (or delivery) are easily measured and veri-
      fied. Each component must clearly describe the product, service, or result in verifiable
      terms, and it must be assigned to a unit in the organization that will take responsibility
      for completing the work and making certain of its accuracy.
4.    Assign identification codes. This step is a process where you assign identification codes
      or numbers to each of the WBS components.
5.    Verify the WBS. This step is a verification step. Examine the decomposition to deter-
      mine whether all the components are clear and complete. Determine whether each
      component listed is absolutely necessary to fulfill the requirements of the deliverable,
      and verify that the decomposition is sufficient to describe the work.


                   I'll talk more about the process in step 4 in the section "Understanding the
                   Unique WBS Identifiers" later in this chapter.
                                         Creating the Work Breakdown Structure               123




   You can now plug the components you've identified into the WBS. This all sounds like a
lot of work. I won't kid you--it is, but it's essential to project success. If you don't perform
the WBS process adequately and accurately, you might end up setting yourself up for a failed
project at worst or for lots of project changes, delayed schedules, and increased costs at best,
not to mention all those team members who'll throw up their hands when you return to them
for the third or fourth time to ask that they redo work they've already completed. I know you
won't let this happen, so let's move on to constructing the WBS.
   The Create WBS process has several outputs, one of which is the WBS. You'll look at the
specifics of how to create the WBS next.


Constructing the WBS
There is no "right" way to construct a WBS. In practice, the chart structure is used quite
often. (This structure resembles an organization chart with different levels of detail.) But
a WBS could be composed in outline form as well. The choice is yours. You'll look at both
ways shortly, along with some figures that depict the different levels of a WBS.
   According to the PMBOK(R) Guide, you can organize the WBS in several ways:
Major deliverables and subprojects The major deliverables of the project are used as the
first level of decomposition in this structure. If you're opening a new store, for example,
the deliverables might include determining location, store build-out, furnishings, product,
and so on. I'll talk about subprojects in the next section.
Subproject that may be executed outside the project team Another way to organize
the work is by subprojects. Perhaps you're expanding an existing highway and several
subprojects are involved. Some of your first level of decomposition might include these
subprojects: demolition, design, bridgework, and paving. Each of the subproject managers
will develop a WBS for their subproject that details the work required for that deliverable.
When subproject work is involved, often times the subproject work is contracted out. In
this example, if you contracted out the bridgework deliverable, this subproject requires its
own WBS, which the seller (the bridgework subcontractor) is responsible for creating as
part of the contract and contract work.
Project phases Many projects are structured or organized by project phases. For example,
let's say you work in the construction industry. The project phases used in your industry
might include project initiation, planning, design, build, inspection, and turnover. A feasi-
bility study might be a deliverable under the project initiation phase, blueprints might be a
deliverable under the planning phase, and so on. Each phase listed here would be the first
level of decomposition (that is, the first level of the WBS), their deliverables would be the
next level, and so on.
   We'll take a look at some example WBS structures next.

Understanding the Various WBS Levels
Although the project manager is free to determine the number of levels in the WBS based
on the complexity of the project, all WBS structures start with the project itself. Some WBS
structures show the project as level one. Others show the level under the project, or the first
124        Chapter 3   n   Developing the Project Scope Statement



level of decomposition, as level one. The PMBOK(R) Guide notes that level one is the project
level, so I'll follow that example here.
   The first level of decomposition might be the deliverables, phases, or subprojects, as I
talked about earlier. (Remember that the first level of decomposition is actually the second
level of the WBS because the project level is the first level.) The levels that follow show more
and more detail and might include more deliverables followed by requirements. Each of
these breakouts is called a level in the WBS. The lowest level of any WBS is called the work
package level. (I'll talk more about this in "Defining Work Packages" later in this chapter.)
The goal is to construct the WBS to the work package level where you can easily and reliably
estimate cost and schedule dates. Keep in mind that some projects or deliverables may need
only one or two levels of decomposition.



Exam Spotlight

Remember that each descending level of the WBS is a more detailed description of
the project deliverables than the level above it. Each component of the WBS should be
defined clearly and completely and should describe how the work of the project will be
performed and controlled. Collectively, all the levels of the WBS roll up to the top so that
all the work of the project is captured (and no additional work is added). According to the
PMBOK(R) Guide, this is known as the 100% rule.




                  There is some controversy among project managers over whether activi-
                  ties should be listed on the WBS. In practice, I often include activities on
                  my work breakdown structure for small projects only because it facilitates
                  other Planning processes later. In this case, the activities are the work
                  package level. However, you should realize that large, complex projects do
                  not include activities on the WBS. For the exam, remember that you will
                  decompose activities during the Activity Definition process that I'll talk
                  about in Chapter 4, "Creating the Project Schedule," and that activities are
                  not part of the WBS.

   The easiest way to describe the steps for creating a WBS is with an example. Let's suppose
you work for a software company that publishes children's games. You're the project manager
for the new Billy Bob's Bassoon game, which teaches children about music, musical rhythm,
and beginning sight reading. The first box on the WBS is the project name; it appears at the
top of the WBS, as shown in Figure 3.1, and is defined as WBS Level One.
   The next level is the first level of decomposition and should describe the major deliverables
for the project. In this example, some of the deliverables might be requirements definition,
design specifications, and programming. This isn't an exhaustive list of deliverables; in prac-
tice, you would go on to place all of your major deliverables into the WBS as level-one content.
For illustration purposes, just look at a slice of the WBS for this project. Refer to Figure 3.1 to
see the WBS with level-one and level-two detail added.
                                            Creating the Work Breakdown Structure               125

   Level-three content might be the component deliverables that are further broken out
from the major deliverables of level two, or it might be products or results that contribute
to the deliverable. The Billy Bob's Bassoon example shows further deliverables as level-three
content. See Figure 3.2 for an illustration of the WBS so far.

                  Requirements    Requirements                    Requirements   Requirements




                  Large, complex projects are often composed of several subprojects that
                  collectively make up the main project. The WBS for a project such as the
                  Billy Bob's Bassoon game would show the subprojects as level-one detail.
                  These subprojects' major deliverables would then be listed as level-two
                  content, perhaps more deliverables as level three, and so on.

   The goal here is to eventually break the work out to the point where the responsibility
and accountability for each work package can be assigned to an organizational unit or a
team of people. In Figure 3.3, I've decomposed this WBS to the fourth level to show an
even finer level of deliverable detail. Remember that activities are not usually included in
the WBS. An easy way to differentiate between deliverables and activities is to use nouns
as the deliverable descriptors and verbs as activity descriptors (we'll talk about activities in
126       Chapter 3      n   Developing the Project Scope Statement



Chapter 4). Reaching way back to my grade-school English, I recall that a noun is a person,
place, or thing. In this example, the deliverables are described using nouns. When we get to
the activity list, you might use verbs like define, design, and determine to describe them.

   You can see from these illustrations how a poorly defined scope or inadequate list of
deliverables will lead to a poorly constructed WBS. Not only will this make the WBS look
sickly, but the project itself will suffer and might even succumb to the dreaded premature
project demise. The final cost of the project will be higher than estimated, and lots of
rework (translation: late nights and weekends) will be needed to account for the missing
work not listed on the WBS. You can construct a good WBS and maintain a healthy project
by taking the time to document all the deliverables during the Define Scope process.



WBS Templates

Work breakdown structures can be constructed using WBS templates or the WBS from a
similar completed project. Although every project is unique, many companies and industries
perform the same kind of projects repeatedly. The deliverables are similar from project to
project, and they generally follow a consistent path. WBS templates can be used in a case
like this as a tool to simplify the WBS process, saving the project manager time.
                                         Creating the Work Breakdown Structure               127




   Don't get too carried away when creating a WBS. The object is to define the work of
the project so you can easily plan, manage, monitor, and control the work. But, you don't
want to take this too far. If you decompose the work to the point that you're showing every
minute detail, you've ventured into inefficiency and will find it more difficult to plan and
manage. In addition, you're potentially stifling the creativity of the people working on the
project because everything is so narrowly defined.
   Sometimes, particularly when working on large projects that consist of several sub-
projects, some of the subprojects might not be scheduled until a future date. Obviously,
it makes sense to develop the WBS in detail at that future date when the deliverables and
subprojects are better known and more details are available. This technique is called rolling
wave planning. The idea behind this technique is that you elaborate the work of the project
to the level of detail you know about at the time. If a subproject or deliverable is scheduled
sometime in the future, the only component that might appear on the WBS today is the
subproject itself. As you get closer to the subproject, you'll elaborate the details of the sub-
project and record them on the WBS.



Exam Spotlight

Understand that rolling wave planning is a process of elaborating deliverables, project
phases, or subprojects in the WBS to differing levels of decomposition depending on the
expected date of the work. Work in the near term is described in more detail than work to
be performed in the future.




Understanding the Unique WBS Identifiers
Each element at each level of the WBS is generally assigned a unique identifier according to
the PMBOK(R) Guide. This unique identifier is typically a number, and it's used to sum and
track the costs, schedule, and resources associated with the WBS elements. These numbers
are usually associated with the corporation's chart of accounts, which is used to track costs
by category. Collectively, these numeric identifiers are known as the code of accounts. The
unique identifiers for the requirements definition branch of the WBS might look something
like this:
    10-1 Billy Bob's Bassoon
    10-2 Requirements Definition
    10-3 Game Requirements
         10-3-1 Character Definition
         10-3-2 Instruments Design
         10-4 Software Requirements
         10-4-1 Platform
         10-4-2 System Description
128        Chapter 3   n   Developing the Project Scope Statement



Defining Work Packages


                  As mentioned earlier, the project manager is free to determine the number
                  of levels in the WBS based on the complexity of the project. You need to
                  include enough levels to accurately estimate project time and costs but not
                  so many levels that it's difficult to distinguish between the components.
                  Regardless of the number of levels in a WBS, the lowest level in a WBS is
                  called the work package level.

   Work packages are the components that can be easily assigned to one person, or a team
of people, with clear accountability and responsibility for completing the assignment.
Assignments are easily made at the work package level; however, assignments can be made
at any level in the WBS. The work package level is where time estimates, cost estimates,
and resource estimates are determined.
   Work package levels on large projects can represent subprojects that are further decom-
posed into their own work breakdown structures. They might also consist of project work
that will be completed by a vendor, another organization, or another department in your
organization. If you're giving project work to another department in your organization,
you'll assign the work packages to individual managers, who will in turn break them down
into activities during the Activity Definition process later in the Planning process group.
   Work packages might be assigned to vendors or others external to the organization.
For example, perhaps one of the deliverables in your project is special packaging and a
vendor is responsible for completing this work. The vendor will likely treat this deliverable
as a project within its own organization and construct its own WBS with several levels of
decomposition. However, for your project, it's a deliverable listed at the work package level
of the WBS.




The Lincoln Street Office Building

Flagship International has just purchased a new building to house its growing staff. The
folks at Flagship consider themselves very lucky to have won the bid on the property
located in a prime section of the downtown area. The building is a historic building and
is in need of some repairs and upgrades to make it suitable for office space. Constructing
the renovations will require special handling and care, as outlined in the Historical Society
Building Revisions Guide.

Alfredo Martini is the project manager assigned to the renovation project. Alfredo has
already determined the deliverables for this project. In so doing, he has discovered that
he will not be able to manage all the work himself. He will need several subproject man-
agers working on individual deliverables, all reporting to him. Alfredo calls a meeting
with the other project managers to develop the WBS. Let's eavesdrop on the meeting.

"As you all know, we're planning to move into the Lincoln Street building by November 1.
There is quite a bit of work to do between now and then, and I'm enlisting each of you to
manage a segment of this project. Take a look at this WBS."

Here's how a portion of the WBS Alfredo constructed looks.

         2.1 Sprinkler System
         2.2 Elevators

         4.2 Plans for Office Space Allocation
         4.3 Plans for Break Room Facilities
          4.4 Plans for Employee Workout Room
Alfredo continues, "I'm going to manage the Facility Safety project. Adrian, I'd like you
to take the Asbestos Abatement project, and Orlando, you're responsible for the Office
Space project."

"Alfredo," Adrian says, "asbestos abatement is going to take contractors and specialized
equipment. We don't have staff to do these tasks."

"I understand. You'll need to take charge of securing the contractor to handle this.
Your responsibility will be to manage the contractor and keep them on schedule,"
Alfredo answers.

Orlando reminds Alfredo that he has missed a deliverable on the WBS. "Part of the Office
Space project needs to include the network communications and telecommunications
equipment rooms. I don't see that on here."

"Good point, Orlando," Alfredo says. "The level-two and level-three elements of this
WBS are not complete. Each of you has been assigned to the subproject level, level one.
Your first assignment is to meet back here in two weeks with a WBS for your subproject.
And I'd like to see some ideas about the staff assignments you'd make at the work pack-
age level and how long you think these components will take. We'll refine those after we
meet next."
130         Chapter 3   n   Developing the Project Scope Statement




                   This might seem self-evident, but work packages not shown on the WBS
                   are not included in the project. The same holds true for the project scope
                   statement--if the deliverable isn't noted there, it isn't part of the project.


Creating WBS Process Outputs
The Create WBS process has four outputs:
NN    Work breakdown structure
NN    WBS dictionary
NN    Scope baseline
NN    Project document updates
   I've covered the WBS in detail already. Updates to the scope statement and project docu-
ment updates might come about as a result of changes that occur when you're creating the
WBS. You can see from the examples you've walked through in this chapter how new deliv-
erables or requirements might surface as a result of working on the WBS. These requested
changes should be reviewed and either approved or denied using your change control pro-
cesses. (I'll talk about that in Chapter 10.) The approved changes should be noted in the
project scope statement, and the project management plan and other project documents
should be updated to reflect the new approved project scope statement.

WBS Dictionary
The WBS dictionary is where work component descriptions are documented. According
to the PMBOK(R) Guide, the WBS dictionary should include the following elements for each
component of the WBS:
NN    Code of accounts identifier
NN    Description of the work of the component
NN    Organization responsible for completing the component
NN    List of schedule milestones
NN    Schedule activities associated with the schedule milestones
NN    Required resources
NN    Cost estimates
NN    Quality requirements
NN    Criteria for acceptance
NN    Technical references
NN    Contract information
                                        Creating the Work Breakdown Structure              131




   Let's look at an example of what some of the elements of a WBS dictionary entry might
look like. You'll use the work package level called Inspection and Identification defined in
the sidebar "The Lincoln Street Office Building" earlier. The WBS dictionary entry for this
might look like the following:
    3.1 Inspection and Identification
        Description of work: Inspect the building for asbestos, and identify all areas where
        it's found. Update the plan for removal (WBS 2.2) with each location identified.
        Responsible organization: Adrian in Facilities will hire and oversee a contractor to
        perform this work.
        Schedule milestones: Inspection and identification to start after contractor is iden-
        tified and hired (no later than July 1). Work should be completed no later than
        September 15.
        Contract information: Two contractors have been identified as qualified and expe-
        rienced in this type of work. Contract process should close no later than June 12.

Scope Baseline
Remember how I said that everything you've done so far has built upon itself? This is an
important concept you should know for this output. The scope baseline for the project is
the approved project scope statement, the WBS, and the WBS dictionary. (You'll recall
from Chapter 2 that the project scope statement serves as a baseline for future project deci-
sions because it helps the team determine whether requested changes are inside or outside
of scope.) In other words, these documents together describe in detail all the work of the
project. From these documents, you'll document schedules, assign resources, and monitor
and control the work of the project according to what's described here.



Exam Spotlight

The scope baseline is defined as the detailed project scope statement, the WBS, and the
WBS dictionary. Understand this concept for the exam.



   If the WBS is constructed well, you've given yourself a huge helping hand with the remain-
ing Planning processes. The completion of many of the remaining processes depends on the
project scope statement and WBS being accurate and complete. In Chapter 4, for example,
you'll use the work packages created here to further elaborate the work into activities. From
there, you can estimate costs, develop schedules, and so on. The WBS is an essential tool for
project planning, so keep it handy.

Project Case Study: New Kitchen Heaven Retail Store

The project charter kickoff meeting was held and well attended. You're ready to start
gathering requirements and writing the project scope statement and have a question or
two for Dirk. You knock on his door, and he invites you in.

"Shoot," he says.

"I'm ready to define the deliverables and requirements for this project. I want to make
sure I get the right folks involved in the meeting. Who are key stakeholders you recom-
mend I speak with?"

"I can think of a few people right off that you don't want to miss. There's Jake Peterson
over in Facilities. He's in charge of store furnishings, shelving, things like that--any sup-
plies for the stores that aren't retail products. He can help out with store build-outs too.
He supervised our last eight stores and did a terrific job."

"Anyone else?" you ask.

"You should also talk to Jill Overstreet, the director in charge of retail products. She can
help with the initial store stocking, and once the store is open, her group will take over the
ongoing operations. All the district managers report to Jill."

You thank Dirk and tell him you're going to contact Jake and Jill and set up a brainstorm-
ing session to determine requirements.

A few days later.

You review your notes and reread the first draft of the project scope statement you've pre-
pared for the Kitchen Heaven retail store before looking for Dirk. After your meetings with
the stakeholders, you were better able to refine the project objectives and deliverables.

"Dirk, I'm glad I caught you. I'd like to go over the project scope statement with you
before I give it to the stakeholders. Do you have a few minutes?"

"Sure," Dirk says to you. "Let's have it."

"The project objective is to open the 50th Kitchen Heaven store in Colorado Springs by
February 1. When I met with Jake, he confirmed it takes 120 days to do the store build-out.
That includes having the shelves set up and in place, ready to stock with inventory."

Dirk asks whether Jake told you about his store location idea.

"Yes, Jake gave me a contact name of the leasing agent, and I've left her a voicemail. The
sooner we can get that lease signed, the better. It takes Jake 120 days to do the build-out,
and Jill said she needs two weeks lead time to order the initial inventory and stock the
shelves. That puts us pretty close to our February 1 deadline, counting the time to get the
lease papers signed."
                                           Creating the Work Breakdown Structure                  133




"Sounds good so far," Dirk replies. "What else?"

You continue, "I've included an updated description of the products and services the new
store will offer, based on the documentation that was written from the last store opening.
Jill reviewed the updates to the description, so we should be in the clear there. The store
will include some new lines that we've decided to take on--cookware from famous chefs,
that kind of thing.

"Jake has already made contact with a general contractor in Colorado Springs, and he is
ready to roll once we've signed the lease.

"One more thing, Dirk. Since we're including the big bash at grand opening as part of the
deliverables, I talked to some of your folks in marketing to get some ideas. They are think-
ing we should have some great giveaways as door prizes and that we will want the food
catered. They also thought having some live cooking demonstrations with some local
chefs would be a good attraction."

"Sounds like you're on the right track. So, what's next?" Dirk asks.

"Once you approve the scope statement, I'd like to send a copy to the stakeholders. My
next step is to break down the deliverables and requirements I've documented here into
the WBS so we can get rolling on the work of the project."

Project Case Study Checklist

    The main topics discussed in the case study are as follows:
    Stakeholder analysis for requirements gathering: Jake Peterson and Jill Overstreet
    interviewed. Needs, wants, and expectations recorded and requirements prioritized.
    Organizational structure: Functional organization with a separate projectized
    department.
    Constraints: February 1 date to coincide with home and garden show.
    Assumptions: These are the assumptions:
   NN   A store build-out usually takes 120 days.
   NN   Jill Overstreet will help with the initial store stocking.
   NN   Jake Peterson will provide supplies for the stores that aren't retail products, such as
        store furnishings, shelving, and so on, and can help with the store build-out as well.
   NN   The budget for the project will be between $1.5 and $2 million.

The project scope statement includes the following:

    Project objectives: Open 50th store by February 1 in Colorado Springs.
134           Chapter 3   n   Developing the Project Scope Statement




       Project deliverables: These are the project deliverables:
      NN   Build out storefront, including shelving.
      NN   Retail product line will be delivered two weeks prior to grand opening.
      NN   Have grand-opening party with cooking demos.

       Project requirements: These are the project requirements:
      NN  Sign lease within 14 days.
      NN   Offer new line of gourmet food products.
      NN   Have classroom space in back of store for cooking demos and classes.

       Constraints: February 1 date will coincide with home and garden show.
       Fund limitations: Spend no more than $2 million for the project.
       Assumptions: (These are the same as listed earlier.) Decomposed deliverables into
       a WBS.
       The WBS includes the following:
      NN   Level one is the project.
      NN   Level two is subprojects or deliverables.
      NN   Level three is deliverables.
      NN   Last level of WBS is the work package level, where time and cost estimates can be
           defined in the next process.




                     I'll talk more about change control and change request processes in
                     Chapter 9.

   Approved changes might also impact the project scope management plan or some of the
subsidiary plans that make up this plan. Make certain you update this plan as a result of
the changes made during the Define Scope process.



Understanding How This Applies
to our Next Project
In this chapter, you dealt with the realities of life on the job. The reality is, many project man-
agers I know are managing several projects at once as opposed to one large project. Although
every concept presented in this chapter is a sound one, it's important to note that you have
                           Understanding How This Applies to our Next Project                 135




to balance the amount of effort you'll put into project management processes against the size
and complexity of the project.
    As a manager who prides herself and my team on excellent customer service, I have once
or twice gotten my team into precarious situations because I was so focused on helping the
customer that I hurt them and our department in the process. If you're wondering how that
happened, it's because we didn't take the time to document the scope of the project and the
final acceptance criteria. In one case, in the interest of getting the project completed quickly
because of our customer's own internal deadlines, we decided the project was straightfor-
ward enough that we didn't need to document deliverables. The customer promised to work
side by side with us as we produced the work of the project. Unfortunately, that wasn't the
case, and we didn't meet the expectations of our customer. Further, after we did imple-
ment the project (two months behind schedule), we went through another six weeks of
"fixes" because of the miscommunication between the customer and the project team on
what constituted some of the features of the final product. There's always a great reason for
cutting corners--but they almost always come back to haunt you. My advice is to always
create a scope statement and a requirements list and get stakeholder signatures on both. (In
practice, small projects can include both the deliverables and requirements within the scope
statement.)
    Decomposing the deliverables is the first step toward determining resource requirements
and estimates. A WBS is always a good idea, no matter the size of the project. I have to admit
I have cheated a time or two on small projects and used the project schedule as the WBS. And
in all fairness that's worked out fine when the team is small and there aren't more than three
or four people working on the project. If you get many more than four people on the project
team, it can be a little cumbersome to track deliverables with a schedule only. The WBS is the
perfect tool to use to assign names to work packages, and it's the foundation for determining
estimates for the work of the project.
    The five-step process outlined by the PMBOK(R) Guide works very well. Starting with the
50,000-foot view, the team determines the major deliverables of the project. From there, the
deliverables are decomposed into ever smaller units of work. The trick here is to break the
work down into measurable units so that you can verify the status of the work and the comple-
tion and acceptance of the work when you're finished. If you have "fuzzy" WBS levels or work
packages, you won't be able to determine status accurately. In the information technology
field, we have a saying about the status of projects: "It's 90 percent complete." The problem
is it always seems that the last 10 percent takes twice as long to complete as the first 90 did.
If you've taken the time to document a WBS, you'll have a much better idea of what that 90
percent constitutes. The last step is the verification step where you determine whether every-
thing you've identified in the WBS is absolutely necessary to fulfill the work of the project and
whether it's decomposed enough to adequately describe the work. It has been my experience
that documenting the WBS will save you time later in the Planning processes, particularly
developing the project schedule and determining the project budget.
    I believe the most important idea to take from this chapter is a simple one: always use a
scope statement and requirements list, and always get them signed.

Summary
This chapter started you on the road to project planning via the Develop Project Management
Plan process, the Collect Requirements process, the Define Scope process, and the Create
WBS process. We covered a lot of material in this chapter. Everything you've learned so far
becomes the foundation for further project planning.
   The output of the Develop Project Management Plan process is the project management
plan, which is concerned with defining, coordinating, and integrating all the ancillary
project plans. The purpose of this plan is to define how the project is executed, how it's
monitored and controlled, and how it's closed.
   The Collect Requirements process involves gathering and documenting the require-
ments of the project. It's important that requirements be measurable, traceable, testable
and so on. Measurement criteria for project requirements are agreed upon by the stake-
holders and project manager. Additionally, requirements should be tracked in a traceabil-
ity matrix that documents where they originated, the results of the tests, the priority of the
requirement and more.
   The scope statement is produced during the Define Scope process. It describes the project
deliverables. The scope statement forms a baseline you'll use to weigh future project decisions,
most particularly change requests. The scope statement contains a list of project deliverables
that will be used in future Planning processes.
   The project scope statement contains many elements, including product scope description,
product acceptance criteria, deliverables, exclusions from scope, constraints, and assumptions.
   Constraints restrict or dictate the actions of the project team. Constraints usu-
ally involve time, cost, and scope but can also include schedules, technology, quality,
resources, risk, and more.
   Assumptions are things believed to be true. You'll want to document project assumptions
and validate them as the project progresses.
   A WBS is a deliverable-oriented group of project essentials. The highest levels of the WBS
are described using nouns, and the lowest levels are described with verbs. Each element in
the WBS has its own set of objectives and deliverables that must be met in order to fulfill the
deliverables of the next highest level and ultimately the project itself. In this way, the WBS
validates the completeness of the work.
   The lowest level of the WBS is known as the work package level. This breakdown allows
the project manager to determine cost estimates, time estimates, resource assignments, and
quality controls.



Exam Essentials
Be able to state the purpose of the Develop Project Management Plan process.        It defines,
coordinates, and integrates all subsidiary project plans.
Understand the purpose of the project scope statement. The scope statement serves as a
common understanding of project scope among the stakeholders. The project objectives
                                                                    Exam Essentials            137




and deliverables and their quantifiable criteria are documented in the scope statement and
are used by the project manager and the stakeholders to determine whether the project was
completed successfully. It also serves as a basis for future project decisions.
Be able to define project constraints and assumptions. Project constraints limit the options
of the project team and restrict their actions. Sometimes constraints dictate actions. Time,
budget, and cost are the most common constraints Assumptions are conditions that are pre-
sumed to be true or real.
Be able to describe the purpose of the scope management plan. The scope management
plan has a direct influence on the project's success and describes the process for determin-
ing project scope, facilitates creating the WBS, describes how the product or service of the
project is verified and accepted, and documents how changes to scope will be handled.
The scope management plan is a subsidiary plan of the project management plan.
Be able to define a WBS and its components. The WBS is a deliverable-oriented hierarchy. It
uses the deliverables from the project scope statement or similar documents and decomposes
them into logical, manageable units of work. Level one is the major deliverable level or sub-
project level, level two is a further elaboration of the deliverables, and so on. The lowest level
of any WBS is called a work package.

      C.   The project management plan's process for verification and acceptance of the deliverables
           needs to be updated as a result of the poor scope definition.
      D.   The project costs could increase, there might be rework, and schedule delays might result.

      D.   The work package level facilitates cost and time estimates.

13. You are a project manager working on a new software product your company plans to market
    to businesses. The project sponsor told you that the project must be completed by September 1.
    The company plans to demo the new software product at a trade show in late September and
    therefore needs the project completed in time for the trade show. However, the sponsor has
    also told you that the budget is fixed at $85,000, and it would take an act of Congress to get
    it increased. You must complete the project within the given time frame and budget. Which of
    the following is the primary constraint for this project?
      A. Budget

14. Which of the following statements about decomposition is the least true?
    A. Decomposition involves structuring and organizing the WBS so that deliverables are
       always listed at level one.
    B.   Decomposition requires a degree of expert judgment and also requires close analysis of
         the project scope statement.
    C.   Decomposition is a tool and technique used to create a WBS.
    D.   Decomposition subdivides the major deliverables into smaller components until the
         work package level is reached.

15. You are in the process of translating project objectives into tangible deliverables and require-

16. You are a project manager for a documentary film company. In light of a recent regional
    tragedy, the company president wants to get a new documentary on the efforts of the heroic
    rescue teams to air as soon as possible. She's looking to you to make this documentary the
    best that has ever been produced in the history of this company. She guarantees you free
    rein to use whatever resources you need to get this project done quickly. However, the best
    photographer in the company is currently working on another assignment. Which of the
    following is true?
    A. The primary constraint is time because the president wants the film done quickly. She
       told you to get it to air as soon as possible.
    B.   Resources are the primary constraint. Even though the president has given you free rein
         on resource use, you assume she didn't mean those actively assigned to projects.
    C.   The schedule is the primary constraint. Even though the president has given you free
         rein on resource use, you assume she didn't mean those actively assigned to projects.
         The photographer won't be finished for another three weeks on his current assignment,
         so schedule adjustments will have to be made.
    D.   The primary constraint is quality because the president wants this to be the best film
         ever produced by this company. She's given you free rein to use whatever resources
         needed to get the job done.

Answers to Review Questions
1.   A. The PMIS is one of the elements of the enterprise environmental factors, which is an
     input to the Develop Project Management Plan process.

2.   C. The project management plan describes the processes you'll use to perform the project
     and describes how the project will be executed, monitored, controlled and how the work of
     the project will be executed to meet the objectives.

3.   B. The scope management plan describes how project scope will be defined and verified, how
     the scope statement will be developed, how the WBS will be created and defined, and how
     project scope will be managed and controlled. Project scope is measured against the project
     management plan, whereas product scope is measured against the product requirements.

4.   D. These four decision making techniques belong to the Collect Requirements process and
     are part of the group decision making tool and technique in this process.

5.   B. The scope statement further elaborates the project deliverables and documents the con-
     straints and assumptions for the project. It serves as a basis for future project decisions.

6.   D. The traceability matrix links requirements to their origin and traces them throughout
     the project. Option A describes the requirements management plan, not the requirements
     document. Option B is partially true with the exception of the first statement. Require-
     ments documents do not have to be formal or complex. Option C refers to the project
     scope statement, not the requirements.

7.   C. The scope baseline consists of the approved project scope statement, the WBS, and the
     WBS dictionary.

8.   D. Alternatives identification are a tool and technique of the Define Scope process that
     includes brainstorming and lateral thinking techniques.

9.   C. Each of the three products might have different amounts of elaboration and levels. The
     question said the third product would not be introduced until two years after the first two.
     This WBS entry might contain only one level stating the product name.

10. D. Option A might seem like a correct answer, but option D is more correct. There isn't
    enough information to determine whether stakeholders will require overtime. We do
    know that poor scope definition might lead to cost increases, rework, schedule delays,
    and poor morale.

11. D. Each element in the WBS is assigned a unique identifier. These are collectively known
    as the code of accounts. Typically, these codes are associated with a corporate chart of
    accounts and are used to track the costs of the individual work elements in the WBS.

12. A. The work package level is the lowest level in the WBS and facilitates resource assign-
    ment and cost and time estimates. The agreed-upon deliverables in C would appear in the
    higher levels in the WBS.
146        Chapter 3   n   Developing the Project Scope Statement



13. C. The primary constraint is time. Since the trade show demos depend on project completion
    and the trade show is in late September, the date cannot be moved. The budget is the second-
    ary constraint in this example.

14. A. Decomposition subdivides the major deliverables into smaller components. It is a tool
    and technique of the Create WBS process and is used to create a WBS. Level-two compo-
    nents might be deliverables, phases, subprojects, or some combination.

15. B. Product analysis includes techniques such as value engineering, value analysis, systems
    analysis, systems engineering, product breakdown, and functional analysis.

16. D. The primary constraint is quality. If you made the assumption as stated in B, you
    assumed incorrectly. Clarify these assumptions with your stakeholders and project spon-
    sors. This applies to C as well.

17. C. This is an example of an assumption. You've used this vendor before and not had any
    problems. You're assuming there will be no problems with this delivery based on your past
    experience.

18. B. Constraints restrict the actions of the project team.

19. A. The project came about because of a business need. The phones have to be answered
    because that's the core business. Upgrading the system to handle more volume is a business
    need. An assumption has been made regarding vendor availability. Always validate your
    assumptions.

20. B. The steps of decomposition include identify major deliverables, organize and determine
    the structure, identify lower-level components, assign identification codes, and verify cor-
    rectness of decomposition.

          The PMP exam content from the
          Planning the Project performance
          domain covered in this chapter
          includes the following:

           Obtain Plan Approval
          UU
                                 The Planning process group has more processes than any other
                                 process group. As a result, a lot of time and effort goes into the
                                 Planning processes of any project. You'll find on some projects
that you might spend almost as much time planning the project as you do executing and con-
trolling it. This isn't a bad thing. The better planning you do up front, the more likely you'll
have a successful project. Speaking of planning, together the Planning, Executing, and Moni-
toring and Controlling process groups account for almost 70 percent of the PMP exam ques-
tions, so plan on spending about the same percentage of your study time on these areas.
   This is another fun-filled, action-packed chapter. We'll start off by defining the activities
that become the work of the project. The WBS will come in handy here, so keep it close by.
Then we'll sequence the activities in their proper order, estimate the resources we'll need to
complete the work, and estimate how long each activity will take. Last but not least, we'll
develop the project schedule.
   Everything you've done up to this point and the processes we'll discuss in this chapter will
help you create an accurate project schedule. You'll use these documents (along with several
other documents you've created along the way) throughout the Executing and Monitoring
and Controlling processes to help measure the progress of the project. Let's get going.



Defining Activities
Now you're off and running toward the development of your project schedule. To develop
the schedule, you first need to define the activities, sequence them in the right order, estimate
resources, and estimate the time it will take to complete the tasks. I'll cover the Define Activi-
ties process here, the Sequence Activities process next, and pick up with the estimating pro-
cesses in the next chapter.


                  Define Activities and Sequence Activities are separate processes, each
                  with their own inputs, tools and techniques, and outputs. In practice,
                  especially for small to medium-sized projects, you can combine these
                  processes into one process or step.

   The Define Activities process is a further breakdown of the work package elements of
the WBS. It documents the specific activities needed to fulfill the deliverables detailed on the
WBS. This process might be performed by the project manager, or when the WBS is broken
down to the subproject level, this process (and all the activity-related processes that follow)
might be assigned to a subproject manager.
                                                                 Defining Activities          149




Define Activities Process Inputs
The following are inputs to the Define Activities process:
NN    Scope baseline (deliverables, constraints, and assumptions)
NN    Enterprise environmental factors (project management information systems)
NN    Organizational process assets (existing guidelines and policies, lessons learned
      knowledge base)


Tools and Techniques for Defining Activities
The tools and techniques of the Define Activities process are as follows:
NN    Decomposition
NN    Rolling wave planning
NN    Templates
NN    Expert judgment
   We've covered most of these topics in the previous chapter. Decomposition in this process
involves breaking the work packages into smaller, more manageable units of work called
activities. These are not deliverables but the individual units of work that must be completed
to fulfill the deliverables listed in the WBS. Activities will help in later Planning processes to
define estimates and create the project schedule. Activity lists (which are one of the outputs
of this process) from prior projects can be used as templates in this process. Rolling wave
planning involves planning near-term work in more detail than future-term work. As we dis-
cussed in Chapter 3, this is a form of progressive elaboration. Expert judgment, in the form of
project team members with prior experience developing project scope statements and WBSs,
can help you define activities.



Exam Spotlight

The purpose of the Define Activities process is to decompose the work packages into
schedule activities where the basis for estimating, scheduling, executing, and monitoring
and controlling the work of the project is easily supported and accomplished.




Define Activities Outputs
Define Activities has three outputs:
NN    Activity list
NN    Activity attributes
NN    Milestone list
     We'll look at each of these outputs next.
150        Chapter 4   n   Creating the Project Schedule



Activity List
One primary output of the Define Activities process is an activity list. The activity list should
contain all the schedule activities that will be performed for the project, with a scope of work
description of each activity and an identifier (such as a code or number) so that team mem-
bers understand what the work is and how it is to be completed. The schedule activities are
individual elements of the project schedule, and the activity list is a subsidiary of the project
management plan.

Activity Attributes
Activity attributes describe the characteristics of the activities and are an extension of the
activity list. Activity attributes will change over the life of the project as more information
is known. In the early stages of the project, activity attributes might include the activity ID,
the WBS identification code it's associated with, and the activity name. As you progress
through the project and complete other Planning processes, you might add predecessor and
successor activities, logical relationships, leads and lags, resource requirements, and con-
straints and assumptions associated with the activity. We'll cover these topics throughout
the remainder of this chapter.
    *The activity attributes are used as in input to the Develop Schedule process that we'll
talk about in the section "Developing the Project Schedule" later in this chapter.


                  In practice, I like to tie the activity list to the WBS. Remember from Chapter 2
                  that each WBS element has a unique identifier, just like the activities in the
                  activity list. When recording the identifier code for the activity list, I'll use a
                  system whereby the first three or four digits represent the WBS element the
                  activity is tied to and the remaining digits will refer to the activity itself.



Milestone Lists
Milestones are typically major accomplishments of the project and mark the completion
of major deliverables or some other key event in the project. For example, approval and
sign-off on project deliverables might be considered milestones. Other examples might be
the completion of a prototype, system testing, contract approval, and so on. The milestone
list records these accomplishments and documents whether the milestone is mandatory or
optional. The milestone list is part of the project management plan and is also used to help
develop the project schedule.


Understanding the Sequence
Activities Process
Now that you've identified the schedule activities, you need to sequence them in a logical
order and find out whether dependencies exist among the activities. The interactivity of
                                  Understanding the Sequence Activities Process                   151




logical relationships must be sequenced correctly in order to facilitate the development of a
realistic, achievable project schedule in a later process.
    Consider a classic example. Let's say you're going to paint your house, but unfortunately,
it's fallen into a little disrepair. The old paint is peeling and chipping and will need to be
scraped before a coat of primer can be sprayed on the house. After the primer dries, the
painting can commence. In this example, the primer activity depends on the scraping. You
can't--OK, you shouldn't--prime the house before scraping off the peeling paint. The paint-
ing activity depends on the primer activity in the same way. You really shouldn't start painting
until the primer has dried.
    During Sequence Activities, you will use a host of inputs and tools and techniques to pro-
duce the primary output, project schedule network diagrams. You've already seen all the inputs
to this process. They are activity list, activity attributes, milestone list, project scope statement,
and organizational process assets. We'll look at several new tools and techniques next.


Sequence Activities Tools and Techniques
Sequence Activities has four tools and techniques, all of which are new to you:
NN   Precedence diagramming method (PDM)
NN   Dependency determination
NN   Applying leads and lags
NN   Schedule network templates
   I'll switch the order of these and cover dependency determination first. In practice,
you'll define dependencies either before or while you're using the PDM to draw your
schedule network templates, so to make sure you're on the same page with the PMBOK(R)
Guide terminology regarding dependencies, I'll cover them first and then move on to the
other tools and techniques.

Dependency Determination
Dependencies are relationships between the activities in which one activity is dependent on
another to complete an action, or perhaps an activity is dependent on another to start an
action before it can proceed. Dependency determination is a matter of determining where
those dependencies exist. Thinking back to the house-painting example, you couldn't paint
until the scraping and priming activities were completed. You'll want to know about three
types of dependencies for the exam:
NN   Mandatory dependencies
NN   Discretionary dependencies
NN   External dependencies
  As you've probably guessed, the PMBOK(R) Guide defines dependencies differently
depending on their characteristics:
Mandatory dependencies Mandatory dependencies, also known as hard logic or hard
dependencies, are defined by the type of work being performed. The scraping, primer, and
152        Chapter 4   n   Creating the Project Schedule



painting sequence is an example of mandatory dependencies. The nature of the work itself
dictates the order in which the activities should be performed. Activities with physical limi-
tations are a telltale sign that you have a mandatory dependency on your hands.
Discretionary dependencies Discretionary dependencies are defined by the project
team. Discretionary dependencies are also known as preferred logic, soft logic, or prefer-
ential logic. These are usually process- or procedure-driven or "best-practice" techniques
based on past experience. For example, both past experience and best practices on house-
painting projects have shown that all trim work should be hand-painted while the bulk of
the main painting work should be done with a sprayer.



Exam Spotlight

Discretionary dependencies have a tendency to create arbitrary total float values that will
limit your options when scheduling activities that have this type of dependency. If you are
using fast tracking to compress your schedule, you should consider changing or removing
these dependencies.




External dependencies External dependencies are, well, external to the project. This
might seem obvious, but the PMBOK(R) Guide points out that even though the dependency
is external to the project (and therefore a nonproject activity), it impacts project activities.
For example, perhaps your project is researching and marketing a new drug. The FDA must
approve the drug before your company can market it. This is not a project activity, but the
project cannot move forward until approval occurs. That means FDA approval is an external
dependency.
   Once you've identified the dependencies and assembled all the other inputs for the
Sequence Activities process, you'll take this information and produce a diagram--or
schematic display--of the project activities. The project schedule network diagram shows
the dependencies--or logical relationships--that exist among the activities. You can use
one of the other tools and techniques of this process to produce this output. You'll now
examine each in detail.

Precedence Diagramming Method (PDM)
The precedence diagramming method (PDM) is what most project management software
programs use to sequence activities. Precedence diagrams use boxes or rectangles to represent
the activities (called nodes). The nodes are connected with arrows showing the dependencies
between the activities. This method is also called activity on node (AON).
   The minimum information that should be displayed on the node is the activity name,
but you might put as much information about the activity on the node as you'd like. Some-
times the nodes are displayed with activity name, activity number, start and stop dates, due
dates, slack time, and so on. (I'll cover slack time in the section "Develop Schedule Tools
and Techniques" later in this chapter.)

Exam Spotlight

For the exam, remember that the PDM uses only one time estimate to determine duration.



   The following graphic shows a PDM--or AON--of the house-painting example.

              Project
                            Scrape         Prime                  Paint     Finish
               Start



                                                        Clean
                                                      Equipment


   The PDM is further defined by four types of logical relationships. The terms dependencies
and precedence relationships also are used to describe these relationships. You might already
be familiar with these if you've used Microsoft Project or similar project management soft-
ware program. The four dependencies, or logical relationships, are as follows:
Finish-to-start (FS) The finish-to-start relationship is the most frequently used relation-
ship. This relationship says that the predecessor--or from activity--must finish before
the successor--or to activity--can start. In PDM diagrams, this is the most often used
logical relationship.
Start-to-finish (SF) The start-to-finish relationship says that the predecessor activity must
start before the successor activity can finish. This logical relationship is seldom used.
Finish-to-finish (FF) The finish-to-finish relationship says that the predecessor activity
must finish before the successor activity finishes.
Start-to-start (SS) I think you're getting the hang of this. The start-to-start relationship
says that the predecessor activity depends on starting before the successive activity can start.



Exam Spotlight

For the exam, know that finish-to-start is the most commonly used dependency in the
PDM method and that start-to-finish is rarely used.



   Keep these logical relationships (or dependencies) in mind when constructing your project
schedule network diagram.
154       Chapter 4   n    Creating the Project Schedule



Arrow Diagramming Method (ADM)
This is not a listed tool and technique of the Sequence Activities process, but there is a
possibility you could see a question on the exam regarding this diagramming method. It's
a very old technique that's rarely used anymore, but nonetheless you should have some
familiarity with it.
   The arrow diagramming method (ADM) is visually the opposite of the PDM. The arrow
diagramming method places activities on the arrows, which are connected to dependent
activities with nodes. This method is also called activity on arrow (AOA). This technique
isn't used nearly as often as PDM, but some industries prefer the ADM to the PDM. For the
record, note that ADM allows for more than one time estimate to determine duration and
uses only the finish-to-start dependency. And there's one more unique note about ADM to
tuck away: sometimes dummy activities must be plugged into the diagram to accurately dis-
play the dependencies.
   The following example shows the ADM method applied to the house-painting example.

                   Start         Scrape               Prime          Paint         Finish

Exam Spotlight

I recommend that you memorize the following graphic to help you remember the tools
and techniques of the Sequence Activities process and their characteristics for the exam.
This might look a little strange, but I think it will work for you now that you understand
what each of these diagramming methods is. This is information you need to know for
the exam. If this graphic isn't useful for you, come up with your own mnemonic or sample
that will help you remember which of these is which. Don't say I didn't warn you.

                                     PDM = AON = 1 Time Estimate

   There is one other diagramming method you could potentially see a question about on
the exam. It's called GERT, which stands for Graphical Evaluation and Review Technique.
What you should know for the exam is that this diagramming method allows for condi-
tions, branches, and loops.

Applying Leads and Lags
Leads and lags should be considered when determining dependencies. Lags occur when
time elapses between two activities, which delays successor activities (those that follow a
predecessor activity)from starting, and as a result, time is added either to the start date or
to the finish date of the activity you're scheduling. Leads, conversely, speed up the successor
activities, and as a result, time needs to be subtracted from the start date or the finish date
of the activity you're scheduling.



Exam Spotlight

Leads and lags speed up or delay successor activities but should not replace
schedule logic.



   Let's revisit the house-painting example to put all this in perspective. In order to paint,
you first need to scrape the peeling paint and then prime. However, you can't begin painting
until the primer has dried, so you shouldn't schedule priming for Monday and painting for
Tuesday if you need the primer to dry on Tuesday. Therefore, the priming activity generates
the need for lag time at the end of the activity to account for the drying time needed before
you can start painting.
   Lead time works just the opposite. Suppose, for this example, you could start priming
before the scraping is finished. Maybe certain areas on the house don't require scraping, so
you don't really need to wait until the scraping activity finishes to begin the priming activity.
In this example, lead time is subtracted from the beginning of the priming activity so that
this activity begins prior to the previous activity finishing.

Schedule Network Templates
Schedule network templates are like the templates I've talked about in other processes. Perhaps
the project you're working on is similar to a project that has been completed in the past. You
can use a previous project schedule network diagram as a template for the current project. Or
you might be working on a project with several deliverables that are fairly identical to projects
you've performed in the past and can use the old schedule network diagrams as templates for
this project.


Sequence Activities Outputs
There are only two outputs of the Sequence Activities process. They are project schedule
network diagrams and project document updates.
156        Chapter 4   n   Creating the Project Schedule



   I've just spent a good deal of time describing the different types of project schedule net-
work diagrams you can construct using PDM or ADM techniques. You can generate project
schedule network diagrams on a computer, or you can draw them out by hand. Like the
WBS, these diagrams might contain all the project details or might contain only summary-
level details, depending on the complexity of the project. Summary-level activities are a
collection of related activities also known as hammocks. Think of hammocks as a group of
related activities rolled up into a summary heading that describes the activities likely to be
contained in that grouping.
   Keep in mind that the construction of these project schedule network diagrams might
bring activities to light that you missed when defining your activity list, or it might make you
break an activity down into two activities in places where you thought one activity might
work. If this is the case, you will need to update the activity list and the activity attributes.
The other project document update that may be required as a result of this process is an
update to the risk register. (We'll talk about the risk register in Chapter 6, "Risk Planning.")
   After the activities are sequenced, the next steps involve estimating the resources and esti-
mating the durations of the activities so that they can be plugged into the project schedule.
We'll look at these topics in the next sections of this chapter.



Estimating Activity Resources
All projects, from the smallest to the largest, require resources. The term resources, in this
case, does not mean just people; it means all the physical resources required to complete
the project. The PMBOK(R) Guide defines resources as people, equipment, and materials. In
reality, this includes people, equipment, supplies, materials, software, hardware--the list
goes on depending on the project on which you're working. Estimate Activity Resources is
concerned with determining the types of resources needed (both human and materials) and
in what quantities for each schedule activity within a work package.


                  Remember, the activity resource requirements output from the Estimate
                  Activity Resources process is an input to the Develop Human Resource
                  Plan process.

   The PMBOK(R) Guide notes that Estimate Activity Resources should be closely coordinated
with the Estimate Costs process (I'll talk about Estimate Costs in Chapter 5, "Developing the
Project Budget"). That's because resources--whether people or material or both--are typi-
cally the largest expense you'll have on any project. Identifying the resources becomes a critical
component of the project planning process so estimates--and ultimately the project budget--
can be accurately derived. You'll look at the inputs and tools and techniques that will help you
document these requirements next.
                                                    Estimating Activity Resources            157




Estimate Activity Resources Inputs
The Estimate Activity Resources process has several inputs, most of which you already know:
NN   Activity list
NN   Activity attributes
NN   Resource calendars
NN   Enterprise environmental factors
NN   Organizational process assets
The only input you haven't seen before is resource calendars.


                     Resource calendars is an output of the Acquire Project Team and Conduct
                     Procurements processes. Both of these processes are performed during
                     the Executing process group, so you may find this input perplexing here.
                     However, you may have some resource availability information (resource
                     calendars) on a preliminary basis during this process and you'll further
                     define it when resources are actually assigned to the project later in
                     the Executing processes. In practice, you may find that you perform the
                     Acquire Project Team process during the later stages of the Planning por-
                     tion of the project rather than in the Executing process.

   The resource calendars input describes the time frames in which resources (both human
and material) are available. They look at a particular resource or groups of resources and
their skills, abilities, quantity, and availability. Perhaps your project calls for a marketing
resource and the person assigned to the marketing activities is on an extended vacation in
October. The resource calendar would show this person's vacation schedule. (The overall
project calendar shows the holidays the company recognizes.)
   Resource calendars also examine the quantity, capability, and availability of equipment
and material resources that have a potential to impact the project schedule. For example,
suppose your project calls for a hydraulic drill and your organization owns only one. The
resource calendar will tell you whether it's scheduled for another job at the same time it's
needed for your project.


Estimating Activity Resources Tools and Techniques
Your goal with the Estimate Activity Resources process is to determine the activity resource
requirements, including quantity and availability. This process has five tools and techniques
to help accomplish this output: expert judgment, alternatives analysis, published estimating
data, bottom-up estimating, and project management software. You already know what
expert judgment entails, so take a look at the remaining tools:
Alternatives analysis Alternatives analysis is used when thinking about the methods you
might use to accomplish the activities your resources have been assigned. Many times, you can
158        Chapter 4   n   Creating the Project Schedule



accomplish an activity in more than one way, and alternatives analysis helps decide among
the possibilities. For example, a subcompact car drives on the same roads a six-figure sports
car travels. The sports car has a lot more features than the subcompact, it's faster, it's prob-
ably more comfortable, and it has a visual appeal that the subcompact doesn't. The sports car
might be the valid resource choice for the project, but you should consider all the alternatives.
The same idea applies to human resources in that you might apply senior-level resources versus
junior-level resources, or you could add resources to speed up the schedule. You may also use
make-or-buy analysis when determining alternative resources.
Published estimating data Estimating data might include organizational guidelines,
industry rates or estimates, production rates, and so on. For example, your organization
might have established price agreements with vendors that outline rates by resource types,
or there might be industry estimates for production rates for your particular activity.
Bottom-up estimating Bottom-up estimating is a process of estimating individual schedule
activities or costs and then adding these together to come up with a total estimate for the
work package. Here you estimate every schedule activity individually and then roll up that
estimate, or add them all together, to come up with a total. This is an accurate means of esti-
mating provided the estimates at the schedule activity level are accurate. However, it takes a
considerable amount of time to perform bottom-up estimating because every activity must be
assessed and estimated accurately to be included in the bottom-up calculation. The smaller
and more detailed the activity, the greater the accuracy and cost of this technique.
Project management software Project management software can help plan, organize, and
estimate resource needs and document their availability. It might also help you to produce
resource breakdown structures, resource rates, resource calendars, and availability.


Estimate Activity Resources Outputs
The purpose of the Estimate Activity Resources process is to develop the activity resource
requirements output. This output describes the types of resources and the quantity needed
for each activity associated with a work package. You should prepare a narrative descrip-
tion for this output that describes how you determined the estimate, including the informa-
tion you used to form your estimate and the assumptions you made about the resources and
their availability.


                  Work package estimates are derived by taking a cumulative total of all the
                  schedule activities within the work package.

   You'll use the information from this output in the next process (Estimate Activity Dura-
tions) to determine the length of time each activity will take to complete. That, of course,
depends on the quantity and skill level of the resources assigned, which is the reason you
estimate resources before you try to determine duration.
   The two other outputs of this process are resource breakdown structure and project
document updates.
                                                     Estimating Activity Durations             159




   The resource breakdown structure (RBS) is much like an organizational breakdown
structure only the RBS lists the resources by category and type. You may several categories
of resources, including labor, hardware, equipment, supplies, and so on. Type describes the
types of resources needed, such as skill levels or quality grades of the material and so on.
   The project document updates portion of this output refers to updating the activity list,
activity attributes, and the resource calendars with changes to any of the elements you've
recorded here.
   You can see how these "Activity" processes have built upon each other. First you defined
the activities, then you determined dependencies and sequenced them in the correct order,
and next you determined what types and quantities of resources are required to complete
the activities. Now you're ready to begin estimating the duration of these activities so you
can plug them into the project schedule.



Estimating Activity Durations
The Estimate Activity Durations process attempts to estimate the work effort, resources,
and number of work periods needed to complete each activity. The activity duration esti-
mates are the primary output of this process. These are quantifiable estimates expressed
as the number of work periods needed to complete a schedule activity. Work periods are
usually expressed in hours or days. However, larger projects might express duration in
weeks or months. Work periods are the activity duration estimates, and they become
inputs to the Develop Schedule process.
   When estimating activity duration, make certain to include all the time that will elapse
from the beginning of the activity until the work is completed. For example, consider the
earlier example of the house-painting project. You estimate that it will take three days,
including drying time, to prime the house. Now, let's say priming is scheduled to begin
on Saturday, but your crew doesn't work on Sunday. The activity duration in this case is
four days, which includes the three days to prime and dry plus the Sunday the crew doesn't
work. Most project management software programs will handle this kind of situation auto-
matically once you've keyed in the project calendar and work periods.
   Progressive elaboration comes into play during this process also. Estimates typically
start at a fairly high level, and as more and more details are known about the deliverables
and their associated activities, the estimates become more accurate. You should rely on
those folks who have the most knowledge of the activities you're trying to estimate to help
you with this process.


Estimate Activity Durations Inputs
The inputs to this process include activity list, activity attributes, activity resource require-
ments, resource calendars, project scope statement, enterprise environmental factors, and
organization process assets.
   A few of the important elements regarding these inputs apply here as you've seen in past
processes: databases, productivity metrics, historical information regarding durations on
160           Chapter 4   n   Creating the Project Schedule



similar projects, project calendars, scheduling methodology, and lessons learned. The project
calendars (considered a part of the organizational process assets) and activity resource require-
ments are especially useful during this process.


Estimate Activity Durations Tools and Techniques
The Estimate Activity Durations process has several new tools and techniques:
NN     Expert judgment
NN     Analogous estimating
NN     Parametric estimating
NN     Three-point estimates
NN     Reserve analysis
      You'll take a look at each of these tools and techniques next.

Expert Judgment
The staff members who will perform activities will most accurately estimate them. In this
case, team members use expert judgment because of their experience with similar activities
in the past. You should be careful with these estimates, though, because they are subject to
bias and aren't based on any scientific means. Your experts should consider that resource
levels, resource productivity, resource capability, risks, and other factors can impact esti-
mates. It's good practice to combine expert judgment with historical information and use as
many experts as you can.

Analogous Estimating
Analogous estimating, also called top-down estimating, is a form of expert judgment.
With this technique, you will use the actual duration of a similar activity completed on a
previous project to determine the duration of the current activity--provided the informa-
tion was documented and stored with the project information on the previous project. This
technique is most useful when the previous activities you're comparing are similar to the
activity you're estimating and don't just appear to be similar. And you want the folks who
are working on the estimate to have experience with these activities so they can provide
reasonable estimates. This technique is especially helpful when detailed information about
the project is not available, such as in the early phases of the project.
   Top-down estimating techniques are also used to estimate total project duration, par-
ticularly when you have a limited amount of information about the project. The best way to
think about top-down techniques is to look at the estimate as a whole. Think about being
on a mountaintop where you can see the whole picture as one rather than all the individual
items that make up the picture.
   For instance, let's return to the house-painting example. You would compare a previous
house-painting project to the current house-painting project, where the houses are of simi-
lar size and the paint you're using is the same quality. You can use the first house-painting
                                                     Estimating Activity Durations               161




project to estimate the project duration for the second house-painting project because of the
similarities in the project.
   Top-down techniques are useful when you're early in the project Planning processes and
are just beginning to flesh out all the details of the project. Sometimes during the project
selection process, the selection committee might want an idea of the project's duration. You
can derive a project estimate at this stage by using top-down techniques.



Exam Spotlight

The PMBOK(R) Guide states that you can also use analogous estimating to determine overall
project duration and cost estimates for the entire project (or phases of the project). For the
exam, remember that the analogous technique is typically less time consuming and less
costly than other estimating techniques, but it's also less accurate.




Parametric Estimating
Parametric estimating is a quantitatively based estimating method that multiplies the quantity
of work by the rate. The best way to describe it is with an example. Suppose you are work-
ing on a companywide network upgrade project. This requires you to run new cable to the
switches on every floor in the building. You can use parametric estimates to determine activity
duration estimates by taking a known element--in this case, the amount of cable needed--
and multiplying it by the amount of time it takes to install a unit of cable to come up with an
estimate. In other words, suppose you have 10,000 meters of new cable to run. You know
from past experience it takes 1 hour to install 100 meters. Using this measurement, you can
determine an estimate for this activity of 100 hours to run the new cable. Therefore, the cable
activity duration estimate is 100 hours.



Exam Spotlight

The PMBOK(R) Guide states that you can also use parametric estimating to determine time
estimates for the entire project or portions of the project. For the exam, remember that
there is a statistical relationship between historical data and other variables (as explained
in the cable example earlier) when using parametric estimates and that this technique can
be highly accurate if the data you are using is reliable.




Three-Point Estimates
Three-point estimates, as you can probably guess, use three estimates that when averaged,
come up with a final estimate. The three estimates you'll use in this technique are the most
162        Chapter 4   n   Creating the Project Schedule



likely estimate, an optimistic estimate, and a pessimistic estimate. The most likely estimate
assumes there are no disasters and the activity can be completed as planned. The optimistic
estimate is the fastest time frame in which your resource can complete the activity. And the
pessimistic estimate assumes the worst happens and it takes much longer than planned to get
the activity completed. You'll want to rely on experienced folks to give you these estimates.

Reserve Analysis
Reserve time--also called buffers, time reserves, or contingency reserve in the PMBOK(R)
Guide --means a portion of time that is added to the activity to account for schedule risk
or uncertainty. You might choose to add a percentage of time or a set number of work peri-
ods to the activity or the overall schedule. For example, you know it will take 100 hours to
run new cable based on the quantitative estimate you came up with earlier. You also know
that sometimes you hit problem areas when running the cable. To make sure you don't
impact the project schedule, you build in a reserve time of 10 percent of your original esti-
mate to account for the problems you might encounter. This brings your activity duration
estimate to 110 hours for this activity.


Estimate Activity Durations Outputs
Everything I've discussed to this point has brought you to the primary output of this pro-
cess: the activity duration estimates. You use the inputs and tools and techniques to estab-
lish these estimates. As mentioned earlier, activity duration estimates are an estimate of the
required work periods needed to complete the activity. This is a quantitative measure usu-
ally expressed in hours, weeks, days, or months.
    One factor to note about your final estimates as an output to this process is that they
should contain a range of possible results. In the cable-running example, you would state
the activity duration estimates as "100 hours 10 hours" to show that the actual duration
will take at least 90 hours and might go as long as 110 hours. Or you could use percentages
to express this range.
    The other output of Estimate Activity Durations is project document updates. Some
of the information that may need revisited and updated as a result of this process are the
activity attributes and the assumptions you made regarding resource availability and skill
levels.
    Now that you have all the activity information in hand, along with a host of other
inputs, you're ready to develop the project schedule.



Exam Spotlight

Remember that you perform the "Activity" processes in this order: Define Activities,
Sequence Activities, Estimate Activity Resources, and Estimate Activity Durations.
Develop Schedule comes after you've completed all of these processes.

Desert State University (DSU)

DSU has hired a contract agency to create its new registration website. The website will
allow students in good academic standing to register for classes over the Internet. You
have been appointed the project manager for the DSU side of this project. You'll be work-
ing with Henry Lu from Websites International to complete this project.

Henry has given you an activity list and asked for time estimates that he can plug into the
project plan.

Your first stop is Mike Walter's desk. He's the expert on the mainframe registration sys-
tem and will be writing the interface programs to accept registration data from the new
website. Mike will also create the download that the Internet program will use to verify
students' academic standing. Mike has created other programs just like this in the past.
His expertise and judgment are very reliable.

The next stop is Kate Langdon. She's the new team leader over the testing group. Kate
has been with DSU for only one month. Since she has no experience working with DSU
data and staff members, she tells you she'll get back to you within a week with estimates
for the testing activities. She plans to read through the project binders of some similar
projects and base her estimates against the historical information on similar projects.
She'll run the estimates by her lead tester before giving them to you.

You've asked both of your resources to provide you with three-point estimates. Mike Wal-
ter's estimates are an example of using the tool and technique of expert judgment to derive
activity duration estimates. The estimates expected from Kate Langdon will be derived
using historical information (implied by the research she's going to do into past similar proj-
ects) and expert judgment because she's involving her lead tester to verify the estimates.




Developing the Project Schedule
The Develop Schedule process is the heart of the Planning process group. This is where you lay
out the schedule for your project activities, determine their start and finish dates, and finalize
activity sequences and durations. Develop Schedule, along with Estimate Activity Resources
and Estimate Activity Durations, is repeated several times before you actually come up with
the project schedule. Most project management software programs today can automatically
build a schedule for you once you've entered the needed information for the activities. The
project schedule, once it's approved, serves as the schedule baseline for the project that you
can track against in later processes.
164          Chapter 4    n   Creating the Project Schedule




                      Remember that you cannot perform Develop Schedule until you have com-
                      pleted at least the following processes of the Planning process group: Col-
                      lect Requirements, Define Scope, Create WBS, Define Activities, Sequence
                      Activities, Estimate Activity Durations, and Develop Human Resource
                      Plan. In practice, it's also beneficial to perform Identify Risks, Perform
                      Qualitative Risk Analysis, Perform Quantitative Risk Analysis, Plan Risk
                      Responses, and Plan Procurements prior to developing the schedule.

    There is a lot of material to cover in this process, so grab a cup of coffee or a soda now.
I'll start with the inputs to the Develop Schedule process and then follow up with an in-
depth discussion of the tools and techniques of the process. These techniques will help you
get to the primary output of this process, which is the project schedule.


Develop Schedule Inputs
Develop Schedule has nine inputs, seven of which are outputs from other Planning pro-
cesses. The inputs are as follows:
NN    Activity list
NN    Activity attributes
NN    Project schedule network diagrams
NN    Activity resource requirements
NN    Resource calendars
NN    Activity duration estimates
NN    Project scope statement
NN    Enterprise environmental factors
NN    Organizational process assets
    You can see how important it is to perform all the Planning processes accurately because
the information you derive from almost every process in the Planning group is used some-
where else in Planning, many of them here. Your project schedule will reflect the informa-
tion you know at this point in time. If you have incorrectly estimated activity durations
or didn't identify the right dependencies, for example, the inputs to this process will be
distorted and your project schedule will not be correct. It's definitely worth the investment
of time to correctly plan your project and come up with accurate outputs for each of the
Planning processes.
    As with several other processes, you should pay particular attention to constraints and
assumptions when performing Develop Schedule. Constraints are with you throughout the
life of the project. The most important constraints to consider in the Develop Schedule pro-
cess are time constraints, and they fall into two categories, imposed dates and key events/
major milestones.
                                                   Developing the Project Schedule               165




   Imposed dates restrict the start or finish date of activities. The two most common con-
straints, start no earlier than and finish no later than, are used by most computerized project
management software programs. Let's look once again at the house-painting example. The
painting activity cannot start until the primer has dried. If the primer takes 24 hours to dry
and is scheduled to be completed on Wednesday, this implies the painting activity can start
no earlier than Thursday. This is an example of an imposed date.
   Key events or milestones refer to the completion of specific deliverables by a specific
date. Stakeholders, customers, or management staff might request that certain deliverables
be completed or delivered by specific dates. Once you've agreed to those dates (even if the
agreement is only verbal), it's often cast in stone and difficult to change. These dates, there-
fore, become constraints.


                  Be careful of the delivery dates you commit to your stakeholders or cus-
                  tomers. You might think you're simply discussing the matter or throwing
                  out ideas, while the stakeholder might take what you've said as fact. Once
                  the stakeholder believes the deliverable or activity will be completed by
                  a specific date, there's almost no convincing them that the date needs
                  changing.




Develop Schedule Tools and Techniques
The primary output of Develop Schedule is the project schedule. You can employ several tools
and techniques in order to produce this output. The tools and techniques you choose will
depend on the complexity of the project. For the exam, however, you'll need to know them all.
   Develop Schedule has eight tools and techniques:
NN   Schedule network analysis
NN   Critical path method
NN   Critical chain method
NN   Resource leveling
NN   What-if scenario analysis
NN   Applying leads and lags
NN   Schedule compression
NN   Scheduling tool
  A lot of information is packed into some of these tools and techniques, and you should
dedicate study time to each of them for the exam. We'll look at each one next.

Schedule Network Analysis
Schedule network analysis produces the project schedule. It involves calculating early and
late start dates and early and late finish dates for project activities (as does the critical path
method). It uses a schedule model and other analytical techniques such as critical path and
166        Chapter 4   n   Creating the Project Schedule



critical chain method, what-if analysis, and resource leveling (all of which are other tools
and techniques in this process) to help calculate these dates and create the schedule. These
calculations are performed without taking resource limitations into consideration, so the
dates you end up with are theoretical. What you're attempting to establish at this point is the
time periods within which the activities can be scheduled. Resource limitations and other
constraints will be taken into consideration when you get to the outputs of this process.

Critical Path Method
Critical path method (CPM) is a schedule network analysis technique. It determines the
amount of float, or schedule flexibility, for each of the network paths by calculating the
earliest start date, earliest finish date, latest start date, and latest finish date for each activ-
ity. This is a schedule network analysis technique that relies on sequential networks (one
activity occurs before the next, a series of activities occurring concurrently is completed
before the next series of activities begins, and so on) and on a single duration estimate for
each activity. The precedence diagramming method (PDM) can be used to perform CPM.
Keep in mind that CPM is a method to determine schedule durations without regard to
resource availability.
    The critical path (CP) is generally the longest full path on the project. Any project activ-
ity with a float time that equals zero is considered a critical path task. The critical path can
change under a few conditions. When activities with float time use up all their float, they can
become critical path tasks. Or you might have a milestone midway through the project with
a finish no later than constraint that can change the critical path if it isn't met.
    Float time is also called slack time, and you'll see these terms used interchangeably. There
are two types of float: total float and free float. Total float (TF) is the amount of time you
can delay the earliest start of a task without delaying the ending of the project. Free float
(FF) is the amount of time you can delay the start of a task without delaying the earliest
start of a successor task.
    In the following section, you'll calculate the CP for a sample project, and I'll illustrate
how you derive all the dates, the CP, and the float times.

Gathering Activity and Dependency Information
Let's say you are the project manager for a new software project. The company you are
working for is venturing into the movie rental business over the Web. You need to devise a
software system that tracks all the information related to rentals and also supplies the man-
agement team with reports that will help them make good business decisions. For purposes
of illustration, I'm showing only a limited portion of the tasks that you would have on a
project like this.
   You'll start this example by plugging information from the processes you've already
completed into a table (a complete example is shown later in Table 4.1 in the section "Cal-
culating the Critical Path"). The list of activities comes from the Define Activities process.
The durations for each activity are listed in the Duration column and were derived during
the Estimate Activity Durations process. The duration times are listed in days.
   The Dependency column lists the activities that require a previous activity to finish
before the current activity can start. You're using only finish-to-start relationships. For
example, you'll see that activity 2 and activity 4 each depend on activity 1 to finish before

they can begin. The dependency information came from the Sequence Activities process.
Now, you'll proceed to calculating the dates.

Calculating the Forward and Backward Pass
Project Deliverables is the first activity and, obviously, where the project starts. This activ-
ity begins on April 1. Project Deliverables has a 12-day duration. So, take April 1 and add
12 days to this to come up with an early finish date of April 12. Watch out, because you
need to count day one, or April 1, as a full workday. The simplest way to do this calcula-
tion is to take the early start date, add the duration, and subtract one. Therefore, the early
finish date for the first activity is April 12. By the way, we are ignoring weekends and holi-
days for this example. Activity 2 depends on activity 1, so it cannot start until activity 1
has finished. Its earliest start date is April 13 because activity 1 finished at the end of the
previous day. Add the duration to this date minus one to come up with the finish date.
    You'll notice that, since activity 4 depends on activity 1 finishing, its earliest start date is
also April 13. Continue to calculate the remaining early start and early finish dates in the
same manner. This calculation is called a forward pass.
    To calculate the latest start and latest finish dates, you begin with the last activity. The
latest finish for activity 9 is July 10. Since the duration is only one day, July 10 is also the lat-
est start date. You know that activity 8 must finish before activity 9 can begin, so activity 8's
latest finish date, July 9, is one day prior to activity 9's latest start date, July 10. Subtract the
duration of activity 8 (three days) from July 9 and add one day to get the latest start date of
July 7. You're performing the opposite calculation that you did for the forward pass. This cal-
culation is called a backward pass, as you might have guessed. Continue calculating the latest
start and latest finish through activity 4.
    Activity 3 adds a new twist. Here's how it works: activity 7 cannot begin until activity 3
and activity 6 are completed. No other activity depends on the completion of activity 3. If
activity 7's latest start date is June 29, activity 3's latest finish date must be June 28. June 28
minus eight days plus one gives you a latest start date of June 21. Activity 3 depends on activ-
ity 2, so activity 2 must be completed prior to beginning activity 3. Calculate these dates just
as you did for activities 9 through 4.
    Activity 1 still remains. Activity 4 cannot start until activity 1 is completed. If activity 4's
latest start date is April 13, the latest finish date for activity 1 must be April 12. Subtract the
duration of activity 1, and add one to come up with a latest start date of April 1. Alterna-
tively, you can calculate the forward pass and backward pass by saying the first task starts
on day zero and then adding the duration to this. For example, activity number 1's earliest
start date is April 1, which is day zero. Add 12 days to day zero, and you come up with an
earliest finish date of April 12.
    You determine the calculation for float/slack time by subtracting the earliest start date
from the latest start date. If the float time equals zero, the activity is on the critical path.

Calculating the Critical Path
To determine the CP duration of the project, add the duration of every activity with zero
float. You should come up with 101 days because you're adding the duration for all activities
except for activity 2 and activity 3. A critical path task is any task that cannot be changed
without impacting the project end date. By definition, these are all tasks with zero float.
168        Chapter 4   n   Creating the Project Schedule



   Another way to determine the critical path is by looking at the network diagram. If the
duration is included with the information on the node or if start and end dates are given, you
simply calculate the duration and then add the duration of the longest path in the diagram to
determine the CP. However, this method is not as accurate as what's shown in Table 4.1.
Figure 4.1 shows the same project in diagram form. The duration is printed in the top-right
corner of each node. Add the duration of each path to determine which one is the critical path.
   Remember that CP is usually the path with the longest duration. In Figure 4.1, path
1-2-3-7-8-9 equals 34 days. Path 1-4-5-6-7-8-9 equals 101 days; therefore, this path is
the critical path.

Calculating Expected Value Using PERT
Program Evaluation and Review Technique (PERT) is a method that the United States
Navy developed in the 1950s. The Navy was working on one of the most complex engi-
neering projects in history at the time--the Polaris Missile Program--and needed a way to
manage the project and forecast the project schedule with a high degree of reliability. PERT
was developed to do just that.

   PERT and CPM are similar techniques. The difference is that CPM uses the most likely
duration to determine project duration, while PERT uses what's called expected value (or
the weighted average). Expected value is calculated using the three-point estimates for
activity duration (I talked about three-point estimates earlier in this chapter) and then find-
ing the weighted average of those estimates (I'll talk about weighted average in the next
section "Calculating Expected Value.") If you take this one step further and determine the
standard deviation of each activity, you can assign a confidence factor to your project esti-
mates. Without getting too heavily involved in the mathematics of probability, understand
that for data that fits a bell curve, which is what you're about to calculate with the PERT
technique, the following is true:
NN   Work will finish within plus or minus three standard deviations 99.73 percent of the time.
NN   Work will finish within plus or minus two standard deviations 95.44 percent of the time.
NN   Work will finish within plus or minus one standard deviation 68.26 percent of the time.

Calculating Expected Value
The three-point estimates used to calculate expected value are the optimistic estimate, the
pessimistic estimate, and the most likely estimate. Going back to the software example,
let's find out what these three time estimates might look like for the activity called Write
Programs. You get these estimates by asking the lead programmer, or key team member, to
estimate the optimistic, pessimistic, and most likely duration for the activity based on past
experience. Other historical information could be used to determine these estimates as well.
Say in this case that you're given 38 days for the optimistic time, 57 days for the pessimis-
tic, and 45 days for the most likely. (Forty-five days was derived from the Estimate Activity
Durations process and is the estimate you used to calculate CPM.)
170           Chapter 4   n   Creating the Project Schedule



      The formula to calculate expected value is as follows:
       (optimistic + pessimistic + (4 * most likely)) / 6
      The expected value for the Write Programs activity is as follows:
       (38 + 57 + (4 * 45)) / 6 = 45.83
   The formula for standard deviation, which helps you determine confidence level, is
as follows:
       (pessimistic - optimistic) / 6
      The standard deviation for your activity is as follows:
       (57 - 38) / 6 = 3.17
      You could say the following, given the information you now have:
NN     There is a 68.26 percent chance that the Write Programs activity will be completed in
       42.66 days to 49 days.
NN     There is a 95.44 percent chance that the Write Programs activity will be completed in
       39.49 days to 52.17 days.
   You calculated the range of dates for the 68.26 percent chance by adding and sub-
tracting one standard deviation, 3.17, from the expected value, 45.83. You calculated
the 95.44 percent chance by multiplying the standard deviation times 2, which equals
6.34, and adding and subtracting that result from the expected value to come up with
the least number of days and the most number of days it will take to finish the activity.
Generally speaking, two standard deviations, or 95.44 percent, is a close enough esti-
mate for most purposes.


                    The higher the standard deviation is for an activity, the higher the risk.
                    Since standard deviation measures the difference between the pessimistic
                    and the optimistic times, a greater spread between the two, which results
                    in a higher number, indicates a greater risk. Conversely, a low standard
                    deviation means less risk.


Determining Date Ranges for Project Duration
Let's bring your table of activities back and plug in the expected values and the standard
deviation for each (please see Table 4.2).
    Now let's look at the total project duration using PERT and the standard deviation to
determine a range of dates for project duration. You should add only the tasks that are on
the critical path. Remember from the CPM example that activities 2 and 3 are not on the
critical path, so their expected value and standard deviation calculations have been left
blank in this table. When you add all the remaining tasks, the total expected value duration
is 102.99 days, or 103 days rounded to the nearest day.

Tasks



   Your next logical conclusion might be to add the Standard Deviation column to get the
standard deviation for the project. Unfortunately, you cannot add the standard deviations
because you will come out with a number that is much too high. Totaling the standard
deviations assumes that all the tasks will run over schedule, and that's not likely. It is likely
that a few tasks will run over but not every one of them. So now you're probably wondering
how to calculate the magic number.
   You might have noticed an extra column at the right called SD Squared. This is the
standard deviation squared--or for those of you with math phobias out there, the standard
deviation multiplied by itself.
   Once you have calculated the standard deviation squared for each activity, add the squares,
for a total of 14.98. There's one more step, and you're done. Take the square root of 14.98
(you'll need a calculator) to come up with 3.87. This is the standard deviation you will use
172          Chapter 4   n   Creating the Project Schedule



to determine your range of projected completion dates. Here's a recap of these last few
calculations:
       Total expected value = 103.00
       Sum of SD Squared = 14.98
       Square root of SD Squared = 3.87
      You can now make the following predictions regarding your project:
NN     There is a 68.26 percent chance that the project will be completed in 99.13 days to
       106.87 days.
NN     There is a 95.44 percent chance that the project will be completed in 95.26 days to
       110.74 days.



Exam Spotlight

For the exam, I recommend that you know that one standard deviation gives you a 68 per-
cent (rounded) probability and two standard deviations gives you a 95 percent (rounded)
probability. Also, know how to calculate the range of project duration dates based on the
expected value and standard deviation calculation. You probably don't need to memo-
rize how to calculate the standard deviation because most of the questions give you this
information. You should, however, memorize the PERT formula and know how it works. It
wouldn't hurt to memorize the standard deviation formula as well--you never know what
might show up on the exam.



   PERT is not used often today. When it is, it's used for very large, highly complex projects.
However, PERT is a useful technique to determine project duration when your activity dura-
tions are uncertain. It's also useful for calculating the duration for individual tasks in your
schedule that might be complex or risky. You might decide to use PERT for a handful of the
activities (those with the highest amount of risk, for example) and use other techniques to
determine duration for the remaining activities.

Critical Chain Method
Critical chain method is a schedule network analysis technique that will modify the project
schedule by accounting for limited or restricted resources. After the project schedule network
diagram is constructed using duration estimates, dependencies, and constraints, resource
availability is entered into the scheduling tool. The modified schedule is calculated and you'll
find that it often changes the critical path. The new critical path showing the resource restric-
tions is called the critical chain.
   Critical chain uses both deterministic (step-by-step) and probabilistic approaches. A few
steps are involved in the critical chain process:
NN     Construct the schedule network diagram using activity duration estimates (you'll use
       nonconservative estimates in this method).
                                                   Developing the Project Schedule              173



NN   Define dependencies.
NN   Define constraints.
NN   Calculate critical path.
NN   Enter resource availability into the schedule.
NN   Recalculate for the critical chain.
    As I stated earlier, the critical path will often change once you've entered the resource avail-
ability. That's because the critical chain method adds nonwork activities where needed as dura-
tion buffers to help manage the planned activity durations. These buffers are known as feeding
buffers and they protect the critical chain schedule from slipping. A project buffer is placed
at the end of the critical chain to help keep the finish date from slipping. After the buffers are
added, the planned activities are then scheduled at their latest start and finish dates.
    This method typically schedules high-risk tasks early in the project so that problems can
be identified and addressed right away. It allows for combining several tasks into one task
when one resource is assigned to all the tasks.



Exam Spotlight

CPM manages the total float of schedule network paths, whereas critical chain manages
buffer activity durations.




Resource Leveling
Earlier, I said that CPM and PERT do not consider resource availability. Now that you have
a schedule of activities and have determined the critical path, it's time to plug in resources for
those activities and adjust the schedule according to any resource constraints you discover.
You should use this technique with CPM-based schedules.
   Resource leveling--also called the resource-based method--is used when resources are
overallocated. You'll also use this technique when they are time constrained (especially
those assigned to critical path activities) or when you need to meet specific schedule dates
and are concerned about resource availability.
   Remember that you identified resource estimates during the Estimate Activity Resources
processes. Now during Develop Schedule, resources are assigned to specific activities. Usu-
ally, you'll find that your initial schedule has periods of time with more activities than you
have resources to work on them. You will also find that it isn't always possible to assign 100
percent of your team members' time to tasks. Sometimes your schedule will show a team
member who is overallocated, meaning they're assigned to more work than they can physi-
cally perform in the given time period. Other times, they might not be assigned enough work
to keep them busy during the time period. This problem is easy to fix. You can assign under-
allocated resources to multiple tasks to keep them busy.
174        Chapter 4   n   Creating the Project Schedule



Overallocated Resources
Having overallocated resources is a little more difficult problem to resolve than having
underallocated resources. Resource leveling attempts to smooth out the resource assign-
ments to get tasks completed without overloading the individual while trying to keep the
project on schedule. This typically takes the form of allocating resources to critical path
tasks first.
   The project manager can accomplish resource leveling in several ways. You might delay
the start of a task to match the availability of a key team member. Or you might adjust the
resource assignments so that more tasks are given to team members who are underallocated.
You could also require the resources to work mandatory overtime--that one always goes over
well! Perhaps you can split some tasks so that the team member with the pertinent knowledge
or skill performs the critical part of the task and the noncritical part of the task is given to a
less-skilled team member. All these methods are forms of resource leveling.
   Generally speaking, resource leveling of overallocated team members extends the project
end date. If you're under a date constraint, you'll have to rework the schedule after assign-
ing resources to keep the project on track with the committed completion date. This might
include moving key resources from noncritical tasks and assigning them to critical path tasks
or adjusting assignments as previously mentioned. Reallocating those team members with
slack time to critical path tasks to keep them on schedule is another option. Don't forget, fast
tracking is an option to keep the project on schedule also.

Reverse Resource Allocation Scheduling
Reverse resource allocation scheduling is a technique used when key resources--like a
thermodynamic expert, for example--are required at a specific point in the project and
they are the only resource, or resources, available to perform these activities. This tech-
nique requires the resources to be scheduled in reverse order (that is, from the end date
of the project rather than the beginning) in order to assign this key resource at the
correct time.



Exam Spotlight

Resource leveling can cause the original critical path to change.




What-If Scenario Analysis
What-if scenario analysis uses different sets of activity assumptions to produce multiple
project durations. For example, what would happen if a major deliverable was delayed or
the weather prevents you from completing a deliverable on time? What-if analysis weighs
these questions and their assumptions and determines the feasibility of the project schedule
under these conditions. Simulation techniques such as Monte Carlo analysis use a range of
probable activity durations for each activity, and those ranges are then used to calculate
a range of probable duration results for the project itself. Monte Carlo runs the possible
                                                 Developing the Project Schedule             175




activity durations and schedule projections many, many times to come up with the schedule
projections and their probability, critical path duration estimates, and float time.



Exam Spotlight

For the exam, remember that Monte Carlo is a simulation technique that shows the prob-
ability of all the possible project completion dates.




Applying Leads and Lags
I talked about leads and lags earlier in this chapter. You'll recall that lags delay successor
activities and require time added either to the start date or to the finish date of the activity
you're scheduling. Leads require time to be subtracted from the start date or the finish date
of the activity. Keep in mind that as you go about creating your project schedule, you might
need to adjust lead and lag time to come up with a workable schedule.

Schedule Compression
Schedule compression is a form of mathematical analysis that's used to shorten the proj-
ect schedule without changing the project scope. Compression is simply shortening the
project schedule to accomplish all the activities sooner than estimated.
   Schedule compression might happen when the project end date has been predetermined
or if, after performing the CPM or PERT techniques, you discover that the project is going
to take longer than the original promised date. In the CPM example, you calculated the
end date to be July 10. What if the project was undertaken and a July 2 date was promised?
That's when you'll need to employ one or both of the duration compression techniques:
crashing and fast tracking.

Crashing
Crashing is a compression technique that looks at cost and schedule trade-offs. One of the
things you might do to crash the schedule is add resources--from either inside or outside the
organization--to the critical path tasks. It wouldn't help you to add resources to noncritical
path tasks; these tasks don't impact the schedule end date anyway because they have float
time. Crashing could be accomplished by requiring mandatory overtime for critical path tasks
or requiring overnight deliveries of materials rather than relying on standard shipping times.
You may find that crashing the schedule can lead to increased risk and or increased costs.


                  Be certain to check the critical path when you've used the crashing tech-
                  nique because crashing might have changed the critical path. Also con-
                  sider that crashing doesn't always come up with a reasonable result. It
                  often increases the costs of the project as well. The idea with crashing is
                  to try to gain the greatest amount of schedule compression with the least
                  amount of cost.

Fast Tracking
I talked about fast tracking in Chapter 1, "What Is a Project?" Fast tracking is perform-
ing two tasks in parallel that were previously scheduled to start sequentially. Fast tracking
can increase project risk and might cause the project team to have to rework tasks. Fast
tracking will only work for activities that can be overlapped. For example, fast tracking is
often performed in object-oriented programming. The programmers might begin writing
code on several modules at once, out of sequential order and prior to the completion of the
design phase. However, if you remember way back to our house-painting example, you
couldn't start priming and painting at the same time, so fast tracking isn't a possibility for
those activities.

Scheduling Tool
Given the examples you've worked through on Develop Schedule and resource leveling, you
probably already have concluded how much a scheduling tool might help you with these
processes. The scheduling tools I've used are in the form of project management software
programs. They will automate the mathematical calculations (such as forward and back-
ward pass) and perform resource-leveling functions for you. Obviously, you can then print
the schedule that has been produced for final approval and ongoing updates. It's common
practice to email updated schedules with project notes so that stakeholders know what
activities are completed and which ones remain to be done.
   It's beyond the scope of this book to go into all the various software programs available
to project managers. Suffice it to say that scheduling tools and project management software
range from the simple to the complex. The level of sophistication and the types of project
management techniques that you're involved with will determine which software product
you should choose. Many project managers that I know have had great success with Micro-
soft Project software and use it exclusively. It contains a robust set of features and reporting
tools that will serve most projects well.
   Don't forget that you are the project manager, and your good judgment should never be
usurped by the recommendation of a software product. Your finely tuned skills and experi-
ence will tell you whether relationship issues between team members might cause bigger
problems than what the resource-leveling function indicates. Constraints and stakeholder
expectations are difficult for a software package to factor in. Rely on your expertise when
in doubt. If you don't have the experience yet to make knowledge-based decisions, seek
out another project manager or a senior stakeholder, manager, or team member and ask
them to confirm whether you're on the right track. And a word of caution: don't become so
involved with the software that you're managing the software instead of managing the proj-
ect. Project management software is a wonderful tool, but it is not a substitute for sound
project management practices or experience.

Scheduling Process Outputs
The Develop Schedule process has four outputs:
NN    Project schedule
NN    Schedule baseline
                                                  Developing the Project Schedule                 177



NN   Schedule data
NN   Project document updates
   We'll take a look at all of the outputs of this process next. Take note that the two pri-
mary outputs from this process that will carry forward throughout the rest of the project
are the project schedule and the schedule baseline.




Sunny Surgeons, Inc.

Kate Newman is a project manager for Sunny Surgeons, Inc. Sunny Surgeons, Inc. is a
software company that produces software for handheld devices for the medical profession.
The software allows surgeons to keep notes regarding patients, upcoming surgeries, and
ideas about new medicines and techniques to research. Kate's latest project is to write an
enhanced version of the patient-tracking program with system integration capabilities to a
well-known desktop software product used by the medical industry.

The programming department has had some recent turnover. Fortunately, Stephen, the
senior programmer who led the development effort on the original version of the patient
tracker, still works for Sunny. His expertise with handheld technologies, as well as his knowl-
edge of the desktop software product, makes him an invaluable resource for this project.

Kate discovered a problem during the development of the project schedule. Stephen is
overallocated for three key activities. Kate decides to see what his take is on the situation
before deciding what to do.

Stephen, the eternal optimist programmer who loves his job and does all but sleep in his
office at night, says he can easily complete all the activities and that Kate shouldn't give
it a second thought. He also suggests to Kate that Karen Wong, a junior programmer on
his team who worked on the last project with him, might be able to handle the noncritical
path task on her own, with a little direction from Stephen.

Kate thinks better of the idea of overallocating her key project resource, even if he does
think he can do the entire thing single-handedly. She decides to try some resource leveling
to see what that turns up.

Kate discovers that rearranging the order of activities, along with assigning Karen to
handle the noncritical path activity, might be a possible solution. However, this scenario
lengthens the project by a total of eight days. Since Kate knows the primary constraint on
this project is quality, she's fairly sure she can get buy-off from the project sponsor and
stakeholders on the later schedule date. She can also sell the resource-leveled schedule
as a low-risk option as opposed to assigning Stephen to all the activities and keeping
the project end date the same. Overallocating resources can cause burnout and stress-
related illnesses, which will ultimately have a negative impact on the project schedule.
178        Chapter 4   n   Creating the Project Schedule



Project Schedule
The purpose of the Develop Schedule process is to determine the start and finish dates
for each of the project activities. One of the primary outputs of this process is the project
schedule, which details this information as well as the resource assignments. However,
depending on the size and complexity of your project or your organization's culture, the
resource assignments and determining the start and finish dates might not be completed
yet. If that's the case, the project schedule is considered preliminary until the resources are
assigned to the activities.


                  In PMBOK(R) Guide terms, the project schedule is considered preliminary
                  until resources are assigned. In reality, beware that once you've pub-
                  lished the project schedule (even though it's in a preliminary state), some
                  stakeholders might regard this as the actual schedule and expect you to
                  keep to the dates shown. Use caution when publishing a schedule in its
                  preliminary form.

   The project schedule should be approved and signed off by stakeholders and functional
managers. This assures you that they have read the schedule, understand the dates and
resource commitments, and will likely cooperate. You'll also need to obtain confirmation
that resources will be available as outlined in the schedule when you're working in a func-
tional organization. The schedule cannot be finalized until you receive approval and com-
mitment for the resource assignments outlined in it.
   Once the schedule is approved, it will become your baseline for the remainder of the proj-
ect. Project progress and task completion will be monitored and tracked against the project
schedule to determine whether the project is on course as planned.
   You can create the schedule in a variety of ways, some of which are variations on what
you've already seen. Project schedule network diagrams, like the ones discussed earlier, will
work as schedule diagrams when you add the start and finish dates to each activity. These
diagrams usually show the activity dependencies and critical path. Figure 4.2 shows a sample
portion of a project schedule network diagram highlighting the programming activities.
   Gantt charts are easy to read and commonly used to display schedule activities. Depend-
ing on the software you're using to produce the Gantt chart, it might also show activity
sequences, activity start and end dates, resource assignments, activity dependencies, and
the critical path. Figure 4.3 is a simple example that plots various activities against time.
These activities do not relate to the activities in the tables or other figures shown so far.
Gantt charts are also known as bar charts.
   Milestone charts are another way to depict schedule information. Milestones mark the
completion of major deliverables or some other key event in the project. For example, approval
and sign-off on project deliverables might be considered a milestone. Other examples might be
completion of a prototype, system testing, contract approval, and so on.
   Milestone charts might show the key events and their start or completion dates in a bar
chart form similar to a Gantt chart. Or they can be written in a simple table format with
milestones listed in the rows and expected schedule dates in one column and actual comple-
tion dates in another, as shown in Table 4.3. As the milestones are met, the Actual Date
column is filled in. This information can be included with the project status reports.

Schedule Baseline
I think of the schedule baseline as the final, approved version of the project schedule with
baseline start and baseline finish dates and resource assignments. The PMBOK(R) Guide
notes that the schedule baseline is a designated version of the project schedule that's derived
from the schedule network analysis. The approved project schedule becomes a part of the
project management plan we talked about in Chapter 3.
    As I've noted during discussions of some of the other Planning processes, project plan-
ning and project management are iterative processes. Rarely is anything cast in cement.
You will continue to revisit processes throughout the project to refine and adjust. Eventu-
ally, processes do get put to bed. You wouldn't want to return to the Planning process at
the conclusion of the project, for example, but keep in mind that the Planning, Executing,
and Monitoring and Controlling process groups are iterative, and it's not unusual to have
to revise processes within these process groups as you progress on the project.
    In practice, for small- to medium-sized projects, you can easily complete Define Activi-
ties, Sequence Activities, Estimate Activity Resources, Estimate Activity Durations, and
Develop Schedule at the same time with the aid of a project management software tool.
You can easily produce Gantt charts, you can produce the critical path, resource allocation,
activity dependencies, you can perform what-if analysis, and various reports after plugging
your scheduling information in to most project management software tools. Regardless of
your methods, be certain to obtain sign-off of the project schedule and provide your stake-
holders and project sponsor with regular updates. And keep your schedule handy--there
will likely be changes and modifications as you go. While you're at it, make certain to save
a schedule baseline for comparative purposes. Once you get into the Executing and Moni-
toring and Controlling processes, you'll be able to compare what you planned to do against
what actually happened.

Schedule Data
The schedule data refers to documenting the supporting data for the schedule. The mini-
mum amount of information in this output includes the milestones, schedule activities and
activity attributes, and the assumptions and constraints regarding the schedule. You should
document any other information that doesn't necessarily fit into the other categories.
Always err on the side of too much documentation rather than not enough.
                                                 Developing the Project Schedule                 181




   You will have to be the judge of what other information to include here because it will
depend on the nature of the project. The PMBOK(R) Guide suggests that you might include
resource histograms. Chapter 7, "Planning Project Resources," contains an example resource
histogram if you want to peek ahead. Resource histograms typically display hours needed on
one axis and period of time (days, weeks, months, years) on the other axis. You might also
include alternative schedules or contingency schedule reserves in the schedule data section.

Project Document Updates
Like many of the other processes we've seen in this chapter, creating the project schedule
may require updates to the activity resource requirements document, activity attributes,
calendars, and the risk register.




Project Case Study: New Kitchen Heaven Retail Store

You worked with the stakeholders to document the activity list last week. After creating
the first draft of the project schedule network diagram, you went back to each of them to
ask for time estimates for each of the activities. Ricardo's estimates are shown here:

1.   Procure the T1 connection. This takes 30 to 45 days. This activity can be done concur-
     rently with the other activities listed here. Ricardo will perform this activity.

2.   Run Ethernet cable throughout the building. This activity depends on the lease being
     signed and must finish before the build-out can start. The estimated time to complete
     is 16 hours, which was figured using parametric estimating techniques. Ricardo has
     one person on staff who can complete this specialized activity. His first available date
     is October 5.

3.   Purchase the router, switch, server, and rack for the equipment room and the four point-
     of-service terminals. Delivery time is two weeks. Ricardo will perform this activity.

4.   Install the router and test the connection. Testing depends on the T1 installation at
     demarcation. The time estimate to install is eight hours. Ricardo's staff will perform
     this activity.

5.   Install the switch. Based on past experience, the time estimate to install is two hours.
     Ricardo's staff will do this activity.

6.   Install the server and test. The testing depends on the T1 connection installation.
     Based on past experience, the time estimate to install is six hours. Ricardo's staff will
     do this activity.

7.   The web team will add the new store location and phone number to the lookup func-
     tion on the Internet site. The time estimate is two hours. Ricardo will assign his appli-
     cations programming manager to this activity. This activity depends on the lease
     being signed.
182        Chapter 4   n   Creating the Project Schedule




Jake and Jill have each written similar lists with estimates and potential resource assign-
ments. You begin to align all the activities in sequential order and discover a problem.
Jill needs 14 days to hire personnel and stock shelves, meaning that the build-out must
be finished by January 16. Build-out takes approximately 120 days and can't start before
September 20 because of the contractor's availability. This is a problem because Ricardo's
Ethernet cable expert isn't available until October 5, and he needs 2 days to complete the
cabling. This pushes out the build-out start date by almost 2 weeks, which means the project
completion date, or store-opening date, is delayed by 2 weeks.

After gathering more information from Ricardo, you head to Dirk's office.

"So, Dirk," you conclude after filling him in on all the details, "we have two options. Hire
a contractor to perform the cable run since Ricardo's person isn't available or push the
store opening out by two weeks."

Dirk asks, "How much will the contractor charge to run the cable, and are they available
within the time frame you need?"

"Yes, they are available, and I've already requested that Ricardo book the week of
September 18 to hold this option open for us. They've quoted a price of $10,000."

"OK, let's bring in the contractor. At this point, $10,000 isn't going to break the budget.
How is that planning coming anyway? Signed a lease yet?"

"Yes, we've signed the lease. Jake has been meeting with Gomez construction on the
build-out. We've used Gomez on three out of the last five new stores and have had good
luck with them."

You spend the next couple of days working on the project schedule in Microsoft Project,
clarifying tasks and activities with Jake, Ricardo, and Jill. You decide that a Gantt chart
will work excellently for reporting status for this project. You stare intensely at the prob-
lem you see on the screen. The Grand Opening task is scheduled to occur 13 days later
than when you need it! Grand opening must happen February 1 and 2, not February 14
and 15 as the schedule shows. You trace the problem back and see that Grand Open-
ing task depends on Train Store Personnel, which itself depends on several other tasks,
including Hire Store Personnel and Install and Test Hardware. Digging deeper, build-out
can't begin until the Ethernet cable is run throughout the building. Ricardo already set up
the time with the contractor to run the cable on September 18. This date cannot move,
which means build-out cannot start any sooner than September 20, which works with
Gomez's availability.

You pick up the phone and dial Jake's number. "Jake," you say into the receiver, "I'm
working on the project schedule, and I have some issues with the Gomez activity."

"Shoot," Jake says.
                                                 Developing the Project Schedule                183




"Gomez Construction can't start work until the Ethernet cable is run. I've already con-
firmed with Ricardo that there is no negotiation on this. Ricardo is hiring a contractor for
this activity, and the earliest they can start is September 18. It takes them two days to run
the cable, which puts the start date for build-out at September 20."

"What's the problem with the September 20 date?" Jake asks.

"Jill wants to have the build-out finished prior to hiring the store personnel. During the
last store opening, those activities overlapped, and she said it was unmanageable. She
wants to hire folks and have them stock the shelves in preparation for store opening but
doesn't want contractors in there while they're doing it. A September 20 start date for
Gomez puts us at a finish date of January 26, which is too late to give Jill time to hire and
stock shelves. My question is this: is 120 days to finish a build-out a firm estimate?"

"Always--I've got this down to a science. Gomez has worked with me on enough of these
build-outs that we can come within just a couple of days of this estimate either way,"
Jake says.

You pick up your schedule detail and continue, "I've scheduled Gomez's resource cal-
endar as you told me originally. Gomez doesn't work Sundays, and neither do we. Their
holidays are Labor Day, a couple of days at Thanksgiving, Christmas, and New Year's, but
this puts us too far out on the schedule. We must have our February 1 opening coincide
with the Garden and Home Show dates."

"I can't change the 120 days. Sounds like you have a problem."

"I need to crash the schedule," you say. "What would the chances be of Gomez agreeing
to split the build-out tasks? We could hire a second contractor to come in and work along-
side Gomez's crew to speed up this task. That would shorten the duration to 100 days,
which means we could meet the February 1 date."

"Won't happen. I know Gomez. They're a big outfit and have all their own crews. We typi-
cally work with them exclusively. If I brought another contractor into the picture, I might
have a hard time negotiating any kind of favors with them later if we get into a bind."

"All right," you say. "How about this? I'm making some changes to the resource calendar
while we're talking. What if we authorize Gomez's crew to work six 10-hour days, which
still leaves them with Sundays off, and we ask them to work on Labor Day and take only
one day at Thanksgiving instead of two?"

"I think Gomez would go for that. You realize it's going to cost you?"

"Project management is all about trade-offs. We can't move the start date, so chances
are the budget might take a hit to accommodate schedule changes or risk. Fortunately,
I'm just now wrapping up the final funding requirements, or the cost budget, so if you can
get me the increased cost from Gomez soon, I'd appreciate it. This change will keep us on
track and resolve Jill's issues too."
184         Chapter 4     n   Creating the Project Schedule




"I don't think Gomez's crew will mind the overtime during the holiday season. Everyone
can use a little extra cash at that time of year, it seems. I'll have the figures for you in a
day or two."

Understanding How This Applies
to Your Next Project
Define Activities and Sequence Activities are the first two processes in the "Activity" sequence
you'll complete on the road to Develop Schedule. You perform Estimate Activity Resources
to determine the resource requirements and quantity of resources needed for each schedule
activity. I've found for small- to medium-sized projects, you can perform this process at the
same time as the Estimate Activity Durations process. And, if you work in an organization
where the same resource pool is used for project after project, you already know the people's
skills sets and availability, so you can perform this process at the same time you're creat-
ing the project schedule. The same logic holds for projects where the material resources are
similar for every project you conduct. If you don't have the need to perform this process, I do
                                                                             Summary             185




recommend that you create a resource calendar at a minimum so that you can note whether
team members have extended vacations or family issues that could impact the project sched-
ule. Needless to say, if you're working on a large project or your project teams are new for
every project, you should perform the Estimate Activity Resources process rather than com-
bining it with Develop Schedule. It will come in handy later when you're ready to plug names
into the activities listed on the project schedule.
   Estimate Activity Durations is a process you'll perform for most projects you work on.
For larger projects, I'm a big fan of PERT estimates. PERT gives you estimates with a high
degree of reliability, which are needed for projects that are critical to the organization,
projects that haven't been undertaken before, or projects that involve complex processes or
scope. It's easy to create a spreadsheet template to automatically calculate these estimates
for you. List your schedule activities in each row, and in the individual columns to the
right, record the most likely, pessimistic, and optimistic estimates. The final column can
hold the calculation to perform the weighted average of these three estimates, and you can
transfer the estimates to your schedule. You can easily add columns to calculate standard
deviation as well.
   In theory, if you've performed all the "Activity" processes, the schedule should almost
be a no-brainer. You can plug the activity list, resources, estimates, and successor and
predecessor tasks into the schedule. From there, you will want to take the next step and
determine the critical path. The critical path is, well, critical to your project's success. If
you don't know which activities are on the critical path, you won't know what the impacts
that delays or risk events will have on the project. No matter how big or small the project,
be sure you know and understand the critical path activities.



Summary
Great job, you've made it through the Planning activities associated with the Project Time
Management Knowledge Area. I covered several processes in this chapter, including Define
Activities, Sequence Activities, Estimate Activity Resources, Estimate Activity Durations,
and Develop Schedule.
   Define Activities uses the scope baseline (which includes the scope statement, WBS, and
WBS dictionary) to help derive activities. Activities are used to help derive a basis for esti-
mating and scheduling project work during the Planning processes and for executing and
monitoring and controlling the work of the project in later processes.
   The Sequence Activities process takes the activities and puts them in a logical, sequential
order based on dependencies. Dependencies exist when the current activity relies on some
action from a predecessor activity or it impacts a successor activity. Three types of dependen-
cies exist: mandatory, discretionary, and external. PDM (also known as AON) and ADM (also
known as AOA) are two methods for displaying project schedule network diagrams. PDM has
four logical relationships, or dependencies: finish-to-start, start-to-finish, finish-to-finish, and
start-to-start.
186        Chapter 4    n   Creating the Project Schedule



   The Estimate Activity Resources process considers all the resources needed and the
quantity of resources needed to perform project activities. This information is determined
for each activity and is documented in the activity resource requirements output.
   Duration estimates are produced as a result of the Estimate Activity Durations process.
Activity duration estimates document the number of work periods needed for each activity,
including their elapsed time. Analogous estimating--also called top-down estimating--is
one way to determine activity duration estimates. You can also use top-down techniques
to estimate project durations and total project costs. Parametric estimating techniques
multiply a known element--such as the quantity of materials needed--by the time it takes
to install or complete one unit of materials. The result is a total estimate for the activity.
Three-point estimates calculate an average estimate based on the most likely estimate, a
pessimistic estimate, and an optimistic estimate. Reserve analysis takes schedule risk into
consideration by adding a percentage of time or another work period to the estimate just in
case you run into trouble.
   PERT calculates a weighted average estimate for each activity by using the optimistic, pes-
simistic, and most likely times. It then determines variances, or standard deviations, to come
up with a total project duration within a given confidence range. Work will finish within plus
or minus one standard deviation 68.26 percent of the time. Work will finish within plus or
minus two standard deviations 95.44 percent of the time.
   Develop Schedule is the process in which you assign beginning and ending dates to activities
and determine their duration. You might use CPM to accomplish this. CPM calculates early
start, early finish, late start, and late finish dates. It also determines float time. All tasks with
zero float are critical path tasks. The critical path is the longest path of tasks in the project.
   Schedules sometimes need to be compressed to meet promised dates or to shorten the
schedule times. Crashing looks at cost and schedule trade-offs. Adding resources to critical
path tasks and limiting or reducing the project requirements or scope are ways to crash the
schedule. Fast tracking involves performing tasks in parallel that were originally scheduled to
start one after the other. Fast tracking usually increases project risk. You can use Monte Carlo
analysis in the Develop Schedule process to determine multiple, probable project durations.
   Resource leveling attempts to smooth out the schedule and properly allocate resources to
critical path tasks. This might require updates to the resource management plan.
   The project schedule details the activities in graphical form through the use of project
schedule network diagrams with dates, Gantt charts, milestone charts, and project schedule
network diagrams.



Exam Essentials
Be able to name the purpose of the Estimate Activity Resources process. The purpose of
Estimate Activity Resources is to determine the types of resources needed (human, equipment,
and materials) and in what quantities for each schedule activity within a work package.
                                                                     Exam Essentials            187




Be able to name the tools and techniques of Estimate Activity Durations. The tools and
techniques of Estimate Activity Durations are expert judgment, analogous estimating,
parametric estimating, and reserve analysis.
Be able to define the difference between analogous estimating and bottom-up
estimating. Analogous estimating is a top-down technique that uses expert judgment
and historical information. Bottom-up estimating performs estimates for each work item
and rolls them up to a total.
Be able to calculate the critical path. The critical path includes the activities whose dura-
tions add up to the longest path of the project schedule network diagram. Critical path is
calculated using the forward pass, backward pass, and float calculations.
Be able to define a critical path task. A critical path task is a project activity with zero float.
Be able to describe and calculate PERT duration estimates. This is a weighted average
technique that uses three estimates: optimistic, pessimistic, and most likely. The formula is
as follows: (optimistic + pessimistic + (4 * most likely)) / 6.
Be able to name the duration compression techniques. The duration compression techniques
are crashing and fast tracking.
Be able to describe a critical chain. The critical chain is the new critical path in a modified
schedule that accounts for limited resources.
Be able to name the outputs of the Develop Schedule process. The outputs are project
schedule, schedule baseline, schedule data, and project document updates.

Answers to Review Questions
1.    C. The tools and techniques for Estimate Activity Durations are expert judgment, analo-
      gous estimating, parametric estimating, three-point estimates, and reserve analysis.

2.    B. The Sequence Activities process produces project schedule network diagrams and proj-
      ect document updates, which may include activity attributes. The purpose of this process is
      to identify all activity dependencies.

3.    C. Reserve analysis takes schedule risk into consideration and adds a percentage of time or
      additional work periods to the estimate to prevent schedule delays.

4.    A. Parametric estimating multiplies a known element--such as the quantity of materials
      needed--by the time it takes to install or complete one unit of materials. The result is a
      total estimate for the activity. In this case, 10 servers multiplied by 16 hours per server gives
      you a 160-hour total duration estimate.

5.    C. The activity list is a component of the project schedule, not the WBS. The activity list
      includes all the project activities, an identifier, and a description of the activity. The activity
      list is an output of the Define Activities process.

6.    D. This is an example of a mandatory dependency, also known as hard logic. Mandatory
      dependencies are inherent in the nature of the work. Discretionary dependencies, also called
      preferred logic, preferential logic, and soft logic, are defined by the project management team.

7.    A. The precedence diagramming method is also known as the activity on node (AON) dia-
      gramming method. GERT stands for Graphical Evaluation and Review Technique, a diagram-
      ming method that allows for conditions, branches, and loops.

8.    B. The arrow diagramming method uses only finish-to-start dependencies.

9.    D. Finish-to-start (FS) is the most commonly used logical relationship in PDM and the
      default relationship in most project management software packages.

10. C. The CPM calculates a single early and late start date and a single early and late finish
    date for each activity. Once these dates are known, float time is calculated for each activity
    to determine the critical path. The other answers contain elements of PERT calculations.

11. B. The only information you have for this example is activity duration; therefore, the critical
    path is the path with the longest duration. Path A-D-E-H with a duration of 34 days is the
    critical path.

12. D. The only information you have for this example is activity duration, so you must calcu-
    late the critical path based on the durations given. The duration of A-B-C-E-H increased by
    3 days for a total of 35 days. The duration of A-F-G-H and A-F-G-E-H each increased by
    3 days. A-F-G-E-H totals 36 days and becomes the new critical path.

13. D. You calculate the critical path by adding together the durations of all the tasks with zero
    float. The critical path can be compressed using crashing techniques.

14. C. The calculation for PERT is the sum of optimistic time plus pessimistic time plus four
    times the most likely time divided by 6. The calculation for this example is as follows:
    (48 + 72 + (4 * 60)) / 6 = 60.

15. D. You calculate the standard deviation by subtracting the optimistic time from the pessi-
    mistic time and dividing the result by 6. The calculation for this example is as follows:
    (72 - 48) / 6 = 4.

16. D. There is a 95 percent probability that the work will finish within plus or minus two
    standard deviations. The expected value is 500, and the standard deviation times 2 is 24, so
    the activity will take from 476 to 524 days.

17. B. A 68 percent probability is calculated using plus or minus one standard deviation, a
    95 percent probability uses plus or minus two standard deviations, and a 99 percent prob-
    ability uses plus or minus three standard deviations.

18. A. Crashing the schedule includes tasks such as adding resources to the critical path tasks
    or speeding up deliveries of materials and resources.

19. C. Resource leveling attempts to smooth out resource assignments by splitting tasks,
    assigning underallocated team members to more tasks, or delaying the start of tasks to
    match team members' availability.

20. A. Project management software is a useful tool for the project manager, and it automates
    project scheduling, allowing for what-if analysis and easy changes. But if you focus too
    much on the tool and ignore the project, the tool becomes a hindrance.

 5        Project Budget

          The PMP(R) exam content from the
          Planning the Project performance
          domain covered in this chapter
          includes the following:

           Obtain Plan Approval
          UU
                                Two of the most important documents you'll prepare for
                                any project are the project schedule and the project budget.
                                You'll use the schedule and budget documents throughout the
Executing and Monitoring and Controlling processes to measure progress and determine if
the project is on track. I believe the budget is easier to prepare after the activities have been
defined and the resource estimates calculated. So now that we have the schedule in hand,
we're going to spend our time in this chapter developing the budget.
   There are two processes in the Planning group we'll perform that will lead us to the cost
performance baseline output that is the authorized budget. They are Estimate Costs and
Determine Budget. There are several tools and techniques to cover in these processes that
you'll want to understand for the exam. Before we get into the details of these two processes,
we'll talk about the cost management plan and its importance in guiding the development of
the budget.
   Next we'll talk about how project information is documented and communicated. I've
talked a lot about documentation so far, and I will discuss it more in this chapter. Docu-
mentation is something you will do throughout the remainder of the project, and the Plan
Communications process details how to collect information, how to store it, and when and
how to distribute it to stakeholders.



Creating the Project Cost
Management Plan
You now have an exhaustive breakdown of project activities, and you have some pretty
good duration estimates. Now the question that's forever on the mind of the executive man-
agement staff: How much is it going to cost? The purpose of the Estimate Costs process is
to answer that question.
   Every project has a budget, and part of completing a project successfully is completing it
within the approved budget. Sometimes project managers are not responsible for the bud-
get portion of the project. This function is assigned instead to a functional manager who is
responsible for tracking and reporting all the project costs. I believe project mangers will have
more and more responsibility in this area as the project management discipline evolves. Keep
in mind that if you, as the project manager, don't have responsibility for the project budget,
your performance evaluation for the project should not include budget or cost measurements.
                                    Creating the Project Cost Management Plan              199




    Before diving into the Estimate Costs and Determine Budget process particulars, you
should know that these processes are governed by a cost management plan that is created
when you perform the Develop Project Management Plan process (we talked about that in
Chapter 3, "Developing the Project Scope Statement"). You should know a couple of facts
about this plan for the exam.
    The cost management plan establishes the format and conditions you'll use to plan for
project costs. It also outlines how you will estimate, budget, and control project costs. Like
all the other management plans, the cost management plan is a subsidiary of the project
management plan.
    According to the PMBOK(R) Guide, some of the elements of this plan includes, but is not
limited to, the following elements:
Level of accuracy This refers to the precision level you'll use to round activity estimates--
for example, hundreds, thousands, and so on. Level of accuracy is based on the scope and
complexity of the activities and the project itself.
Units of measure This refers to the unit of measure you'll use to estimate resources--for
example, hours, days, weeks, or a lump sum amount.
Organizational procedures links In Chapter 3, we talked about the WBS and the identifiers
associated with each component of the WBS. These identifiers are called the code of accounts.
A control account (CA) is a point where several factors such as actual cost, schedule, and
scope can be used to determine earned value performance measures. (We'll talk more about
earned value in Chapter 10, "Measuring and Controlling Project Performance"). The control
account is what's used in the Project Cost Management Knowledge Area to monitor and con-
trol project costs. The control account is typically associated with the work package level of
the WBS, but there could be control accounts established at any level of the WBS. The control
account also has a unique identifier that's linked to the organization's accounting system,
sometimes known as a chart of accounts.



Exam Spotlight

The project cost management plan is established using the WBS and its associated
control accounts.




Control thresholds Most actual project costs do not match the estimate exactly. The
control threshold refers to the amount of variance the sponsor or stakeholders are will-
ing to allow before action is required. Document the threshold amount as a percentage of
deviation allowed from the cost performance baseline.
Rules of performance measurement This component of the cost management plan refers
to how you will set the earned value management measurements. It's here you'll document
where the control accounts exist within the WBS, the earned value management (EVM)
200        Chapter 5   n   Developing the Project Budget



techniques you'll use to measure performance, and the equations you'll use for calculating
estimate at completion forecasts and other measurements. We'll talk about EVM and esti-
mate at completion forecasts in detail in Chapter 10.
Reporting formats This refers to the types of cost reports you'll produce for this project
and how often they'll be created.
Process descriptions This describes the Estimate Cost, Determine Budget, and Control
Costs processes and how you'll use these processes to manage project cost.
   The key to determining accurate cost estimates (and as we discovered in Chapter 4,
accurate time estimates) is the work breakdown structure (WBS). Next we'll look at how
to determine cost estimates for the WBS components.



Estimating Costs
The Estimate Costs process develops a cost estimate for the resources (human and mate-
rial) required for each schedule activity. This includes weighing alternative options and
examining risks and trade-offs. Some alternatives you may consider are make-versus-buy,
buy-versus-lease, and sharing resources across either projects or departments.
   Let's look at an example of trade-offs. Many times software development projects take
on a life of their own. The requested project completion dates are unrealistic; however, the
project team commits to completing the project on time and on budget anyway. How do
they do this? They do this by cutting things such as design, analysis, and documentation. In
the end, the project might get completed on time and on budget, but was it really? The costs
associated with the extended support period because of a lack of design and documenta-
tion and the hours needed by the software programmers to fix the reported bugs weren't
included in the original cost of the project (but they should have been). Therefore, the costs
actually exceed what was budgeted. You should examine trade-offs such as these when
determining cost estimates.
   When you are determining cost estimates, be certain to include all the costs of the project
over its entire life cycle. As in the preceding example, software projects often have warranty
periods that guarantee bug fixes or problem resolution within a certain time frame. This is a
legitimate cost that should be included in your estimates.


                 Don't confuse pricing with Estimate Costs. If you are working for a company
                 that performs consulting services on contract, for example, the price you will
                 charge for your services is not the same as the costs to perform the project.
                 The costs are centered on the resources needed to produce the product,
                 service, or result of the project. The price your company might charge for the
                 service includes not only these costs but a profit margin as well.
                                                                 Estimating Costs             201




Estimate Costs Inputs
Many of the inputs of the Estimate Costs process are already familiar to you. However,
we'll look briefly at each one so you can see the key elements that should be considered
when creating the project budget. The inputs to this process are as follows:
NN   Scope baseline
NN   Project schedule
NN   Human resource plan
NN   Risk register
NN   Enterprise environmental factors
NN   Organizational process assets

Scope Baseline
Pop quiz time. Do you remember the elements of the scope baseline? They are the project
scope statement, the WBS, and the WBS dictionary. You'll want to consider a few key
elements from the project scope statement in this process, including key deliverables, con-
straints, and assumptions. I can safely say that every project I've ever worked on had a lim-
ited budget, which is a classic example of a project constraint. You should also understand
other constraints that have the potential to impact costs, such as required delivery dates or
availability of resources.
   The WBS, as we've discussed, serves as the basis for estimating costs. It contains all the
project deliverables and the control accounts are typically established at the work package
level. When considering deliverables, think about those that may have contractual obliga-
tions that should be considered when determining cost estimates. Or, perhaps you have
deliverables that have legal or governmental regulations that will require additional expense
to fulfill. Health, safety, security, licenses, and environmental factors are some of the other
elements of the scope baseline you should consider when estimating costs, according to the
PMBOK(R) Guide.



Exam Spotlight

Scope definition is a key component of determining the estimated costs and should be
completed as early in the project as possible because it's easier to influence costs in the
beginning phases of the project. But you can't influence costs if you don't understand
the project scope.



Project Schedule
We determined the types and quantities of resources we needed in Chapter 4, "Creating the
Project Schedule," using the Estimate Activity Resources (this process is closely associated
with the Estimate Cost process according to the PMBOK(R) Guide) and Estimate Activity
202        Chapter 5   n   Developing the Project Budget



Durations processes. Activity resource requirements and activity duration estimates are the
key outputs you should consider when estimating costs.
   Be aware that duration estimates can affect costs. For example, make certain you account
for costs like interest charges when you're financing the work of the project. Also watch for
duration estimates that are calculated for resources who are scheduled to work for a per unit
period of time. Duration estimates can be incorrect (hopefully not wildly incorrect) and can
end up costing you more. For example, I recently bought a new home requiring a move of
about eight miles. The moving company told me that the work was performed on a per-hour
basis. The person providing the estimate assured me he had been doing this for over 25 years
and his estimates were typically right on the money. Unfortunately, I swallowed that line and
the estimate I was given was wildly incorrect. It took them almost twice the amount of time I
was quoted, and you guessed it, the total ended up being almost twice the original estimate.

Human Resource Plan
We will look more closely at the human resource plan (an output of the Develop Human
Resource Plan process) in Chapter 7, "Planning Project Resources." For the purposes of the
Estimate Costs process, understand that the human resources plan includes elements such
as personnel rates, project staffing attributes, and employee recognition or rewards pro-
grams. All of these elements should be considered when determining cost estimates.

Risk Register
The risk register is an output of the Identify Risks process that we'll discuss in Chapter 6,
"Risk Planning." You should consider the cost of mitigating risks (identified in the risk
register), particularly those with negative impacts to the project, when developing project
cost estimates.

Enterprise Environmental Factors
According to the PMBOK(R) Guide, the enterprise environmental factors you should consider
in this process are market conditions and published commercial information. Market con-
ditions help you understand the materials, goods, and services available in the market and
what terms and conditions exist to procure those resources. Published commercial informa-
tion refers to resource cost rates. You can obtain these from commercial databases or pub-
lished seller price lists.

Organizational Process Assets
The organization process assets considered in the process are similar to those we've seen
before. Historical information and lessons learned on previous projects of similar scope and
complexity can be very useful in determining estimates for the current project--particularly
if the past projects occurred recently. Your organization's business office or PMO may also
have cost estimating templates you can use to help with this process. You could use cost-
estimating worksheets from past projects as templates for the current project as well.
                                                                    Estimating Costs            203




Tools and Techniques to Estimate Costs
Estimate Costs has nine tools and techniques used to derive estimates:
NN   Expert judgment
NN   Analogous estimating
NN   Parametric estimating
NN   Bottom-up estimating
NN   Three-point estimate
NN   Reserve analysis
NN   Cost of quality
NN   Project management estimating software
NN   Vendor bid analysis
    I covered analogous estimating, parametric estimating, three-point estimate, and reserve
analysis techniques in Chapter 4. These are also tools and techniques of the Estimate Activity
Durations process to help determine schedule estimates. All of the information we discussed
in Chapter 4 applies here as well, except you're using the tools and techniques to derive cost
estimates. Three-point estimates are used in this process when you want to improve your
estimates and account for risk and estimation uncertainty. And, in the case of reserve analy-
sis, you're adding cost reserves (or contingencies) during this process, not schedule reserves.
You could aggregate these cost contingencies and assign them to a schedule activity or a WBS
work package level.
    The project management estimating software tool can help you quickly determine esti-
mates given different variables and alternatives. Some systems are quite sophisticated and
use simulation and statistical techniques to determine estimates, while others are less com-
plex. A simple spreadsheet program can do the trick much of the time. We'll look at the
remaining tools and techniques next.



Exam Spotlight

According to the PMBOK(R) Guide, if the Project Cost Management Knowledge Area includes
predicting the potential financial performance of the product of the project, or if the project
is a capital facilities project, you may also use additional tools and techniques in the process,
such as return on investment, discounted cash flow, and payback analysis. We talked about
these techniques in Chapter 2, "Creating the Project Charter."




Bottom-Up Estimating
I discussed this technique in Chapter 4, but there are a few pointers to consider for this
process. This technique estimates costs associated with every activity individually and then
rolls them up to derive a total project cost estimate. You wouldn't choose this technique to
204         Chapter 5   n   Developing the Project Budget



provide a cost estimate for the project during Initiating if one were requested because you
don't have enough information at that stage to use it. Instead, use the top-down estimating
technique (analogous estimating) when a project cost estimate is needed early in the project
selection stage. Bottom-up estimating will generally provide you with the most accurate
cost estimates, but it is the most time-consuming estimating technique of all those men-
tioned here. However, the size and complexity of the project impact the accuracy you can
achieve using this technique.

Cost of Quality
The cost of quality (COQ) is the total cost to produce the product or service of the proj-
ect according to the quality standards. We will talk more in depth about cost of quality in
Chapter 7, "Planning Project Resources."

Vendor Bid Analysis
As the name implies, this is a process of gathering information from vendors to help you estab-
lish cost estimates. You can accomplish this by requesting bids or quotes or working with some
of your trusted vendor sources for estimates. You should compare vendor bids when using this
tool and technique and not rely solely on one vendor to provide you with estimates.



Exam Spotlight

For the exam, make sure you're familiar with all the Estimate Costs tools and techniques,
their benefits, and under what conditions you use them.




Estimate Costs Process Outputs
One of the outputs of the Estimate Costs process is activity cost estimates. These are quan-
titative amounts--usually stated in monetary units--that reflect the cost of the resources
needed to complete the project activities. The tools and techniques I just described help you
derive these estimates. Resources in this case include human resources, material, equipment,
information technology needs, and so on, as well as any contingency reserve amounts and
inflation factors (if you're using them).
    The remaining outputs of the Estimate Costs process are basis of estimates and project
document updates. Basis of estimates is the supporting detail for the activity cost estimates and
includes any information that describes how the estimates were developed, what assumptions
were made during the Estimate Costs process, and any other details you think are needed.
According to the PMBOK(R) Guide, the basis of estimates should include at least the following:
NN    A description of how the estimate was developed or the basis for the estimate.
NN    A description of the assumptions made about the estimates or the method used to
      determine them.
                                                                 Estimating Costs             205



NN   A description of the constraints.
NN   A range of possible results. You should state the cost estimates within ranges such as
     $5000  10%.
NN   The confidence level regarding the final estimates.




This Older House

Janie is an accomplished project manager. She and her husband recently purchased an
80-year-old home in need of several repairs and modern updates. She decided to put
her project management skills to work on the house project. First, they hired a general
contractor to oversee all the individual projects needed to bring the house up-to-date.
Janie worked with the general contractor to construct a WBS, and she ended up with
23 work packages. With each work package (or multiple work packages in some cases)
assigned to a subcontractor, it was easy to track who was responsible for completing
the work and for determining duration estimates. Janie and the general contractor
worked together to determine schedule dependencies and make certain the work was
performed in the correct order and that each subcontractor knew when their activity
was to begin and end.

Some of the cost estimates for certain work packages were easy to determine using the
parametric estimating method. Others required expert judgment and the experience of
the general contractor (analogous techniques) to determine a cost estimate. Resource
rates for laborers for some of the work packages were agreed to when the subcontractors
bid on the work. Once Janie had all the cost estimates, she used the bottom-up estimat-
ing technique to come up with an overall cost estimate for the project. She added a con-
tingency reserve in addition to the overall estimate for unforeseen risk events.



   The last output of this process is project document updates. Cost variances will occur
and estimates will be refined as you get further into your project. As a result, you'll update
cost estimates and ultimately the project budget to reflect these changes. The risk register
may also require an update after cost estimates are complete.
   Estimate Costs uses several techniques to make an accurate assessment of the project
costs. In practice, using a combination of techniques is your best bet to come up with
the most reliable cost estimates. The activity cost estimates will become an input to the
Determine Budget process, which allows you to establish a baseline for project costs to
track against.
206        Chapter 5   n   Developing the Project Budget




Establishing the Cost Budget Baseline
The next process concerns determining the cost performance baseline, which is the pri-
mary output of the Determine Budget process. The Determine Budget process aggregates
the cost estimates of activities and establishes a cost performance baseline for the project
that is used to measure performance of the project throughout the remaining process
groups. Only the costs associated with the project become part of the authorized project
budget. For example, future period operating costs are not project costs and therefore
aren't included in the project budget.
   The cost performance baseline is the total expected cost for the project when using a
budget at completion calculation, an earned value management technique. When you're
using earned value management techniques, the cost performance baseline is also known as
the performance measurement baseline (PMB). We'll talk about budget at completion and
earned value management techniques in detail in Chapter 10, "Measuring and Controlling
Project Performance." Remember that costs are tied to the financial system through the
chart of accounts--or code of accounts--and are assigned to project activities at the work
package level or to control accounts at various points in the WBS. The budget will be used
as a plan for allocating costs to project activities.


                 As we've discussed with several other processes, in practice you can
                 sometimes perform the Estimate Costs and Determine Budget processes
                 at the same time.




Determine Budget Inputs
Outputs from other Planning processes, including the Create WBS, Schedule Development,
and Estimate Costs processes, must be completed prior to working on Determine Budget
because some of their outputs become the inputs to this process. The inputs for Determine
Budget are as follows:
Activity cost estimates These are an output of the Estimate Costs process. Activity cost
estimates are determined for each activity within a work package and then summed to
determine the total estimate for a work package.
Basis of estimates This is also an output of the Estimate Costs process and contains all
the supporting detail regarding the estimates. You should consider assumptions regarding
indirect costs and whether they will be included in the project budget. Indirect costs cannot
be directly linked to any one project. They are allocated among several projects, usually
within the department or division in which the project is being performed. Indirect costs
can include items like building leases, management and administrative salaries (those not
directly assigned full time to a specific project), and so on.
                                            Establishing the Cost Budget Baseline            207




Scope baseline Scope baseline includes the scope statement, WBS, and WBS dictionary.
The scope statement describes the constraints of the project you should consider when
developing the budget. The WBS shows how the project deliverables are related to their
components, and the work package level typically contains control account information
(although control accounts can be assigned at any level of the WBS).
Project schedule The schedule contains information that is helpful in developing the budget,
such as start and end dates for activities, milestones, and so on. Based on the information in
the schedule, you can determine budget expenditures for calendar periods.
Resource calendars Resource calendars help you determine costs in calendar periods
and over the length of the project because they describe what resources are needed when
on the project.
Contracts Contracts include cost information you should include in the overall project
budget. We'll talk more about contracts in Chapter 7.
Organizational process assets The organization process assets that will assist you with
the work of this process include cost budgeting tools, the policies and procedures your
organization (or PMO) may have regarding budgeting exercises, and reporting methods.


Determine Budget Tools and Techniques
The Determine Budget process has five tools and techniques, including two you haven't
seen before:
NN    Cost aggregation
NN    Reserve analysis
NN    Expert judgment
NN    Historical relationships
NN    Funding limit reconciliation
     I've covered expert judgment previously. Let's look at the remaining tools and techniques.
Cost aggregation Cost aggregation is the process of tallying the schedule activity cost
estimates at the work package level and then totaling the work package levels to higher-
level WBS component levels (such as the control accounts). Then all of the costs can be
aggregated to obtain a total project cost.
Reserve analysis We talked about reserve analysis in Chapter 4 as it pertains to the project
schedule. Reserve analysis works the same for the Determine Budget process, only you're
planning contingency reserves for unplanned project scope and project costs. Reserves are
not included as part of the cost performance baseline (an output of this process) but should
be included in the project budget. Reserves are also not considered when calculating earned
value measurements.
208         Chapter 5   n   Developing the Project Budget




                  Reserve analysis should also contain appropriations for risk responses.
                  I'll talk about several categories and tools of Risk Response Planning in
                  Chapter 6. Additionally, you'll want to set aside money for contingency
                  reserves for unknown risks. This is for the unforeseen, unplanned risks
                  that might occur. Even with all the time and effort you spend on planning,
                  unexpected issues do crop up. It's better to have the money set aside and
                  not need it than to need it and not have it.


Historical relationships Analogous estimates and parametric estimates can be used to
help determine total project costs. Remember from Chapter 4 that analogous estimates
are a form of expert judgment. Actual costs from previous projects of similar size, scope,
and complexity are used to estimate the costs for the current project. This is helpful when
detailed information about the project is not available or it's early in the project phases and
not much information is known.
Parametric estimates are quantitatively based and, for example, multiply the amount of time
needed to perform an activity by the resource rate to determine total cost. This technique
can be very accurate when the data you're using is reliable.
Funding limit reconciliation Funding limit reconciliation involves reconciling the amount
of funds to be spent with the amount of funds budgeted for the project. The organization
or the customer sets these limits. Reconciling the project expenses will require adjusting the
schedule so that the expenses can be smoothed. You do this by placing imposed date con-
straints (I talked about these in the Schedule Development process in Chapter 4) on work
packages or other WBS components in the project schedule.


Determine Budget Process Outputs
The goal of Determine Budget is to develop a cost performance baseline (an output of this
process) for the project that you can use in the Executing and Monitoring and Controlling pro-
cesses to measure performance. You now have all the information you need to create the cost
performance baseline. In addition, you'll establish the project funding requirements.
   The following are the outputs of the Determine Budget process:
NN    Cost performance baseline
NN    Project funding requirements
NN    Project document updates
   We've covered the project document updates in other processes. For Determine Budget,
you may need to update the risk register, cost estimates, and/or the project schedule. Let's
look at the other two outputs next.

Documenting the Cost Performance Baseline
You develop the cost performance baseline, the first output of Determine Budget, by add-
ing the costs of the WBS elements (remember, these costs were aggregated with the cost
                                          Establishing the Cost Budget Baseline              209




aggregation tool and technique) by time periods. This is also known as the project's time-
phased budget. Most projects span some length of time, and most organizations time the
funding with the project. In other words, you won't get all the funds for the project at the
beginning of the project; they'll likely be disbursed over time. The cost performance base-
line provides the basis for measurement, over time, of the expected cash flows (or funding
disbursements) against the requirements.
   Cost performance baselines can be displayed graphically, with time increments on one
axis and dollars expended on the other axis, as shown in Figure 5.1. The costs shown on
this graph are cumulative costs, meaning that what you spent this period is added to what
was spent last period and then charted. Many variations of this graph exist showing dollars
budgeted against dollars expended to date and so on. Cost budgets can be displayed using
this type of graph as well, by plotting the sum of the estimated costs excepted per period.

   The cost performance baseline should contain the costs for all of the expected work on
the project. You would have identified these costs in the Estimate Costs process. You'll find
most projects' largest expense is resource costs (as in labor costs). In the case of projects
where you're purchasing the final product, the purchase price is the largest cost.



Exam Spotlight

For the exam, remember that cost performance baselines are displayed as an S curve.
The reason for this is that project spending starts out slowly, gradually increases over
the project's life until it reaches a peak, and then tapers off again as the project wraps
up. Large projects are difficult to graph in this manner because the timescale isn't wide
enough to accurately show fluctuations in spending. There are other methods that more
accurately graph costs that you'll look at in the Cost Control process.
210          Chapter 5       n   Developing the Project Budget




                         Large projects might have more than one cost performance baseline. For
                         example, you might be required to track human resources costs, material
                         costs, and contractor costs separately.

  You'll revisit the cost performance baseline when you learn about the Cost Control process
and examine different ways to measure costs in Chapter 10.

Gathering the Project Funding Requirements
Project funding requirements describe the need for funding over the course of the project
and are derived from the cost performance baseline. Funding requirements can be expressed
in monthly, quarterly, or annual increments or other increments that are appropriate for
your project.
   As I said earlier, spending usually starts out slowly on the project and picks up speed
as you progress. Sometimes, the expected cash flows don't match the pace of spending.
Project funding requirements account for this by using a management reserve (usually a
margin or percentage of the cost performance baseline) that's released in increments with
the project budget. Figure 5.2 shows the cost performance baseline, the funding require-
ments, and the expected cash flows plotted on the S curve. The difference between the
funding requirements and the cost performance baseline at the end of the project is
the management reserve.

   We've now completed two critical components of the project plan, the project schedule
and the project budget. I've mentioned several times throughout the book about the need
for documenting, publishing, and communicating project information. As you can imagine,
the PMBOK(R) Guide has a process for communications. We'll discuss it next.
                                                    Plan Communications Inputs            211




Communicating the Plan
I've talked a good deal about documentation so far, and this topic will continue to come up
throughout the remainder of the book. "Is that documented?" should be an ever-present ques-
tion on the mind of the project manager. Documentation can save your bacon, so to speak,
later in the project. Documentation is only one side of the equation, though--communication
is the other. You and your stakeholders need to know who gets what information and when.
    The Plan Communications process involves determining the communication needs of
the stakeholders by defining the types of information needed, the format for communicat-
ing the information, how often it's distributed, and who prepares it. All of this is docu-
mented in the communications management plan, which is an output of this process.


                  Pop quiz: Do you remember where else the communications management
                  plan belongs? I'll give you the answer later in the section "Communications
                  Management Plan."




Plan Communications Inputs
The inputs to the Plan Communications process will look familiar to you. They are as
follows:
NN   Stakeholder register
NN   Stakeholder management strategy
NN   Enterprise environmental factors
NN   Organizational process assets
   The stakeholder register and stakeholder management strategy should give you a lot of
insight into the communication needs of the stakeholders. The stakeholder register is a list
of all the project stakeholders and includes additional information including their poten-
tial influence on the project and their classification. The stakeholder management strategy
defines the level of participation needed for each stakeholder and potential strategies you
can use to gain their support or reduce the negative impacts or obstacles they could pres-
ent to the project.
   The PMBOK(R) Guide notes that all the elements described in the enterprise environ-
mental factors and in the organizational process assets are inputs to this process. However,
special note is made of the lessons learned and historical information elements of the orga-
nizational process assets input. Information you learn as you're progressing through the
project is documented as lessons learned. This information is helpful for future projects of
similar scope and complexity. Historical information is also useful to review when starting
the Plan Communications process. Either of these documents might contain information
212         Chapter 5   n   Developing the Project Budget



about communication decisions on past projects and their results. Why reinvent the wheel?
If something didn't work well on a past project, you'd want to know that before implement-
ing that procedure on this project, so review past project documentation.
    The project management plan is not an input to this process, but you'll recall that it
defines how the subsidiary plans will be defined and integrated into the overall project
management plan. As such, it's rich with constraints and assumptions that you should
review as they pertain to stakeholder communication needs.



Exam Spotlight

The PMBOK(R) Guide notes that there is a difference between effective and efficient
communication. Effective communication refers to providing the information in the right
format for the intended audience at the right time. Efficient communication refers to pro-
viding the appropriate information at the right time, that is, only the information that's
needed at the time.




Tools and Techniques for
Plan Communications
The Plan Communications process concerns defining and documenting the types of infor-
mation you're going to deliver, the format it will take, to whom it will be delivered, and
when. The process consists of two tools and techniques to help determine these elements.
They are communications requirements analysis and communications technology. You'll
look at both of these next.


Communications Requirements Analysis
Communications requirements analysis involves analyzing and determining the commu-
nication needs of the project stakeholders. According to the PMBOK(R) Guide, there are
several sources of information you can examine to help determine these needs, including
the following:
NN    Company and departmental organizational charts
NN    Stakeholder responsibility relationships
NN    Other departments and business units involved on the project
NN    The number of resources involved on the project and where they're located in relation
      to project activities
                                 Tools and Techniques for Plan Communications             213



NN   Internal needs that the organization may need to know about the project
NN   External needs that organizations such as the media, government, or industry groups
     might have that require communication updates
NN   Stakeholder information (This was documented in the stakeholder register and stake-
     holder management strategy outputs of Identify Stakeholders.)
   This tool and technique requires an analysis of the items in the preceding list to make
certain you're communicating information that's valuable to the stakeholders. Communicat-
ing valuable information doesn't mean you always paint a rosy picture. Communications
to stakeholders might consist of either good or bad news--the point is that you don't want to
bury stakeholders in too much information but you want to give them enough so that they're
informed and can make appropriate decisions.
   Project communication will always involve more than one person, even on the tiniest of
projects. As such, communication network models have been devised to try to explain the
relationships between people and the number or type of interactions needed between project
participants. What you need to remember for the exam is that network models consist of
nodes with lines connecting the nodes that indicate the number of communication channels,
also known as lines of communication. Figure 5.3 shows an example of a network commu-
nication model with six channels of communication.

F i g u r e 5 . 3 Network communication model


                                             1


                            6                                2




                            5                                3


                                             4

                         Nodes = participants
                         Lines = lines of communication between participants


   The nodes are the participants, and the lines show the connection between them all.
You'll need to know how to calculate the number of communication channels when you
take the exam. You could draw them out as in this example and count up the lines, but
there's an easier way. The formula for calculating the lines of communication is as follows:
     (number of participants * (number of participants less 1)) divided by 2
214           Chapter 5     n   Developing the Project Budget



      Here's the calculation in mathematical terms:
       n (n - 1) / 2
   Figure 5.3 shows six participants, so let's plug that into the formula to determine the
lines of communication:
       6 (6 - 1) / 2 = 15




Stakeholder Relationships

Bill is an information technology manager working on an enterprise resource planning
project. He's one of the key stakeholders on this project. Bill reports to the CIO, who in turn
reports to the executive vice president, who also happens to be the project sponsor. Bill
is close friends with the human resources director but doesn't get along so well with the
accounting department director. This project requires heavy involvement from the account-
ing department and medium-level involvement from the human resources department.

You are the project manager for this project and are new to the organization. You know
Bill's relationship with both the accounting and human resources directors. What you don't
know is the relationship the two directors have with each other. Since all three stakeholders
are key to the success of this project, it's important that all three communicate with you as
well as with each other. You set up an interview with each of these stakeholders to deter-
mine several pieces of information: other departments that might need to be involved on
the project, stakeholder communication needs and timing, external needs, timing of status
updates for the company newsletter, and other department members aside from the stake-
holders who need to be involved in the project. You also plant a few surreptitious questions
that will give you some insight into the relationships the stakeholders have with each other
and with the project sponsor.

You discover that the human resources and accounting directors have known each other
for several years and worked together at another organization prior to coming to work
here. This tells you that if you can get one of them to buy in on project decisions, the
other will likely follow suit. They both have the utmost respect for Bill and his technical
capabilities, even though the accounting director doesn't care for his abrupt, direct com-
munication style. You also learn that although they both have respect for the position of
the executive vice president, they don't believe the person filling that role is competent
to do the job. They question his decision-making ability--or lack thereof--and warn you
that you need to write down his answers and direction so that he doesn't change his story
halfway through the project. Although you won't formally document this valuable piece
of information, you'll definitely put it into action right away.

Exam Spotlight

I recommend you memorize the communications channel formula before taking the exam.




Communications Technology
The second tool and technique of this process is communications technology. This examines
the methods (or technology) used to communicate the information to, from, and among the
stakeholders. Methods of communicating can take many forms, such as written, spoken,
email, formal status reports, meetings, online databases, online schedules, and so on. This
tool and technique examines the technology elements that might affect project communica-
tions. You should consider several factors before deciding what methods you'll choose to
transfer information. The timing of the information exchange or need for updates is the first
factor. The availability of the technology you're planning on using to communicate project
information is important as well. Do you need to procure new technology or systems, or are
there systems already in place that will work? Staff experience with the technology is another
factor. Are the project team members and stakeholders experienced at using this technology,
or will you need to train them? Consider the duration of the project and the project environ-
ment. Will the technology you're choosing work throughout the life of the project, or will it
have to be upgraded or updated at some point? And how does the project team function? Are
they all located together or spread out across several campuses or locations?
   The answers to these questions should be documented in the communications manage-
ment plan output. I'll cover that in the next section.


Communications Models
Communication models depict how information is transmitted from the sender and how
it's received by the receiver. According to the PMBOK(R) Guide, a communications model
includes the following key components:
NN   Encode
NN   Message and feedback message
NN   Medium
NN   Noise
NN   Decode
   Encoding the message simply means putting the information or your thoughts or ideas
into a language that the receiver will understand. The message is the result or output of
the encoding.
216        Chapter 5   n   Developing the Project Budget



   The medium is the method you'll use to communicate. This could be written, oral,
email, and so on.
   Noise refers to anything that keeps the message from either being transmitted or under-
stood. And decode refers to translating the information that was sent.
   The sender is responsible for the encoding of the message, the medium, and decoding
the feedback message. The receiver is responsible for decoding the original message from the
sender and encoding and sending the feedback message.


Communications Methods
Communication methods refer to how the project information is shared among the stake-
holders. According to the PMBOK(R) Guide, there are three classifications of communication
methods. We'll briefly look at each of them.
Interactive communication Interactive communication involves multidirectional commu-
nication where two or more parties must exchange thoughts or ideas. This method includes
videoconferencing, phone or conference calls, and meetings.
Push communications Push communications is one way and refers to sending information
to intended receivers. It includes methods such as letters, memos, reports, emails, voicemails,
and so on. This method assures the communication was sent but is not concerned with
whether it was actually received or understood by the intended receivers.
Pull communications This is the opposite of push communications. The likely recipients
of the information access the information themselves using methods such as web sites,
e-learning sites, knowledge repositories, shared network drives, and so on.


                 We'll discuss communication models and communication methods
                 in more detail in Chapter 9, "Conducting Procurements and Sharing
                 Information."




Communications Management Plan
There are two outputs to the Plan Communications process. They are communications
management plan and product document updates. The updates that may be required as a
result of performing this process are the project schedule, the stakeholder register, and the
stakeholder management strategy. Let's take a closer look at the details of the communica-
tions management plan.
    All projects require sound communication plans, but not all projects will have the same
types of communication or the same methods for distributing the information. The commu-
nications management plan documents the types of information needs the stakeholders have,
when the information should be distributed, and how the information will be delivered. The
answer to the pop quiz posed earlier in this chapter is the communications management plan
is a subsidiary plan of the project management plan I talked about in Chapter 3.
                                           Communications Management Plan                   217




   The type of information you will typically communicate includes project status, project
scope statements and scope statement updates, project baseline information, risks, action
items, performance measures, deliverable acceptance, and so on. What's important to know
for this process is that the information needs of the stakeholders should be determined as
early in the Planning process group as possible so that as you and your team develop proj-
ect planning documents, you already know who should receive copies of them and how
they should be delivered.
   According to the PMBOK(R) Guide, the communications management plan typically
describes the following elements:
NN   The communication requirements of each stakeholder or stakeholder group
NN   Purpose for communication
NN   Frequency of communications, including time frames for distribution
NN   Name of the person responsible for communicating information
NN   Format of the communication and method of transmission
NN   Method for updating the communications management plan
NN   Glossary of common terms


                 I've included only some of the most important elements of the commu-
                 nications management plan in the list of elements for the communica-
                 tions management plan. I recommend you review the entire list in the
                 PMBOK(R) Guide.

   The information that will be shared with stakeholders and the distribution methods are
based on the needs of the stakeholders, the project complexity, and the organizational poli-
cies. Some communications might be informal--a chat by the coffeemaker, for instance--
while other communications are more formal and are kept with the project files for later
reference. The communications management plan may also include guidelines for conduct-
ing status meetings, team meetings, and so on.
   You might consider setting up an intranet site for your project and posting the appropri-
ate project documentation there for the stakeholders to access anytime they want. If you
use this method, make sure to document it in the communications management plan and
notify your stakeholders when updates or new communication is posted.



Exam Spotlight

For the exam, know that the communications management plan documents how the com-
munication needs of the stakeholders will be met, including the types of information that
will be communicated, who will communicate it, who receives the communication, the
methods used to communicate, the timing and frequency, the method for updating this
plan as the project progresses, the escalation process, and a glossary of common terms.
218         Chapter 5   n   Developing the Project Budget




Project Case Study: New Kitchen Heaven Retail Store

After creating the first draft of the project schedule network diagram, you went back to
each stakeholder to ask for cost estimates for each of the activities. Ricardo's estimates
are shown here with the activities he gave you last time:

1.    Procure the T1 connection. This takes 30 to 45 days and will have ongoing costs of
      $3,000 per month. Procurement costs are covered in the monthly expense.

2.    Run Ethernet cable throughout the building. The estimated time to complete is 16
      hours at $100 per hour, which was figured using parametric estimating techniques.

3.    Purchase the router, switch, server, and rack for the equipment room and four point-
      of-service terminals. The estimated costs are $17,000.

4.    Install the router and test the connection. Testing depends on the T1 installation at
      demarcation. The time estimate to install is eight hours. Ricardo's staff will perform
      this activity at an average estimated cost of $78 per hour.

5.    Install the switch. Based on past experience, the time estimate to install is two hours.
      Ricardo's staff will perform this activity at an average estimated cost of $78 per hour.

6.    Install the server and test. Based on past experience, the estimate to install is six
      hours at $84 per hour.

7.    The web team will add the new store location and phone number to the lookup func-
      tion on the Internet site. The time estimate is two hours at $96 per hour.

Jake and Jill have each written similar lists with time and cost estimates. Using this infor-
mation, you create the activity cost estimates and are careful to document the basis of
estimates. The following list includes some of the information you document in the basis
of estimates:

NN    Ricardo's use of parametric estimates for his cost estimates.
NN    Jake's use of both analogous and parametric estimating techniques.
NN    Jill's use of reserve analysis to include contingencies for unplanned changes involving
      vendor deliveries.
NN    Assumptions made about vendor deliveries and availability of the T1 and assump-
      tions made regarding when lease payments begin.
NN    The range of possible estimates is stated as plus or minus 10%.

You also document the cost performance baseline and project funding requirements. Since
this project will occur fairly quickly, there are only two funding requirement periods needed.
                                             Communications Management Plan                    219




The communications management plan is also complete, and you've asked the key stake-
holder to review it before posting it to the intranet site for the project. You want to make
certain you've identified stakeholder communication needs, the method of communication,
and the frequency with which they will occur.

Understanding How This Applies
to Your Next Project
Estimate Costs is something I have to do rather early in the project because of our long
procurement cycle. The way our process works, I must have an estimated cost for the proj-
ect before I can request funding. If funding is approved, the project is approved. If I'm not
awarded funding, the project dies and we move on to the next one.
   I rely on expert judgment and parametric estimating techniques to determine activity
and total project costs. I often engage vendors and my own project team to help determine
the costs. When I have a large project that must go out for bid, I have a well-defined scope
and some idea of schedule dates and overall costs, but I won't complete the schedule until
after the contract is awarded. In an ideal world, I would prefer to create the schedule prior
to determining cost estimates and budgets...but we don't live in an ideal world and some-
times Planning processes have to be performed out of order.
   The authorized project budget becomes one of the key measurements of project success. In
a later chapter we'll talk about monitoring the budget to determine whether we're tracking to
our estimates.
   The communications management plan is a must-have for every project. I can't stress
enough how often I've seen the root cause of project issues end up being communication
problems. Never assume keeping the stakeholders informed is an easy job. Even if you
know the stakeholders well, always create a communication plan. Document how you'll
communicate status, baseline information, risks, and deliverables acceptance. That way
there's no question as to how information will be relayed, who's going to receive it, or when
it will be delivered.



Summary
The Estimate Costs process determines how much the project resources will cost, and these
costs are usually stated in monetary amounts. Some of the techniques used specifically for
estimating costs are analogous estimating, parametric estimating, bottom-up estimating,
three-point estimates, and reserve analysis. You can also use bottom-up estimating for total
project cost estimates. This involves estimating the cost of each activity and then rolling
these up to come up with a total work package cost. The output of this process is the activ-
ity cost estimates and the basis of estimates that details all the support information related
to the estimates.
   The tools and techniques of the Determine Budget process include cost aggregation, reserve
analysis, expert judgment, historical relationships, and funding limit reconciliation. These
tools together help you produce the final, authorized project budget known as the cost perfor-
mance baseline, which is an output of this process. You will use the cost performance baseline
throughout the remainder of the project to measure project expenditures, variances, and proj-
ect performance. The cost performance baseline is graphically displayed as an S curve.
                                                                 Exam Essentials           221




   The cost performance baseline is also known as a performance measurement baseline
(PMB) when you're calculating earned value management formulas. PMBs are management
controls that should change only infrequently. Examples of the performance measurement
baselines you've looked at so far are the scope, schedule, and cost baselines. The completed
project plan itself also becomes a baseline. If changes in scope or schedule do occur after
Planning is complete, you should go through a formalized process (which I'll cover in
Chapter 10, "Measuring and Controlling Project Performance") to implement the changes.
   The purpose of the communications management plan is to determine and docu-
ment the communication needs of the stakeholders by defining the types of information
needed, the format for communicating the information, how often it's distributed, and
who prepares it. This plan is a subsidiary plan of the project management plan.



Exam Essentials
Be able to identify and describe the primary output of the Estimate Costs process. The
primary output of Estimate Costs is activity cost estimates. These estimates are quantitative
amounts--usually stated in monetary units--that reflect the cost of the resources needed to
complete the project activities.
Be able to identify the tools and techniques of the Estimate Costs process. The tools
and techniques of Estimate Costs are expert judgment, analogous estimating, parametric
estimating, bottom-up estimating, three-point estimates, reserve analysis, cost of quality,
project management estimating software, and vendor bid analysis.
Be able to identify additional general management techniques that can be used in the Project
Cost Management Knowledge Area. Some of the general management techniques that can
be used in this Knowledge Area are return on investment, discounted cash flow, and payback
analysis.
Be able to identify the tools and techniques of the Determine Budget process. The tools
and techniques of Determine Budget are cost aggregation, reserve analysis, expert judgment,
historical relationships, and funding limit reconciliation.
Be able to describe the cost performance baseline. The cost performance baseline is the
authorized, time-phased cost of the project when using budget-at-completion calculations.
The cost performance baseline is displayed as an S curve.
Be able to describe project funding requirements. Project funding requirements are an
output of the Determine Budget process. They detail the funding requirements needed on
the project by time period (monthly, quarterly, annually).
Be able to describe the purpose of the communications management plan. The communica-
tions management plan determines the communication needs of the stakeholders. It documents
what information will be distributed, how it will be distributed, to whom, and the timing of
the distribution.

Answers to Review Questions
1.    A. Determining the cost of resources (not the amount) to complete all the activities for the
      project is the primary concern of the Project Cost Management Knowledge Area.

2.    D. The cost management plan is used to establish the criteria for planning, estimating,
      budgeting, and controlling costs.

3.    D. Control thresholds are variance thresholds (typically stated as a percentage of deviation
      from the baseline) used for monitoring cost performance.

4.    C. A control account can be placed at any level of the WBS and is used for earned value
      measurement calculations regarding project costs.

5.    A. The inputs of Estimate Costs are scope baseline, project schedule, human resource plan,
      risk register, enterprise environmental factors, and organizational process assets.

6.    B. Three-point estimates can improve activity cost estimates because they factor in estima-
      tion uncertainty and risk.

7.    A. Reserve analysis accounts for cost uncertainty by including a contingency reserve, usu-
      ally expressed as a percentage of the estimated cost.

8.    C. The expected activity cost is calculated this way: (4 * most likely + optimistic + pessi-
      mistic) / 6. Therefore, the answer is (4 * 42 + 35 + 54) / 6 = 43.

9.    C. Future period operating costs are considered ongoing costs and are not part of
      project costs.

10. B. Bottom-up techniques are the most time consuming and generally the most accurate
    estimates you can use. With bottom-up estimating, each work item is estimated and rolled
    up to a project total.

11. A. Funding limit reconciliation concerns reconciling the funds to be spent on the project
    with funding limits placed on the funding commitments for the project.

12. B. The cost performance baseline is displayed as an S curve because of the way project
    spending occurs. Spending begins slowly, picks up speed until the spending peak is reached,
    and then tapers off as the project winds down.

13. D. Cost of quality is a tool and technique of Estimate Costs. The tools and techniques
    of Determine Budget are cost aggregation, reserve analysis, expert judgment, historical
    relationships, and funding limit reconciliation.

14. A. Analogous--or top-down--estimating techniques are a form of expert judgment. Since
    this project is similar to another recent project, you can use the cost estimates from the pre-
    vious project to help you quickly determine estimates for the current project.

15. B. There are 28 channels of communication, which is considered when using the communi-
    cations requirements analysis tool and technique.

16. D. Communications requirements analysis, communication technology, communication
    models, and communication methods are the tools and techniques of the Plan Communica-
    tions process.

17. C. Acknowledgment means the receiver has received the message but does not mean they

                                Risk is evident in everything we do. When it comes to project
                                management, understanding risk and knowing how to mini-
                                mize its impacts (or take full advantage of its opportunities)
on your project are essential for success. This entire chapter is dedicated to project risk. Five
of the six risk processes, all contained in the Risk Management Knowledge Area, fall in the
Planning process group. I'll cover Plan Risk Management, Identify Risks, Perform Qualitative
Risk Analysis, Perform Quantitative Risk Analysis, and Plan Risk Responses in this chapter.
I'll follow up with the last risk process, Monitor and Control Risks, in Chapter 10, "Measur-
ing and Controlling Project Performance."
    Hold on to your hats! I'm going to cover a lot of material in this chapter, but it will go
fast, I promise.



Planning for Risks
Every one of us takes risks on a daily basis. Just getting out of bed in the morning is a risk.
You might stub your toe in the dark on the way to the light switch or trip over the dog and
break a leg. These events don't usually happen, but the possibility exists. The same is true
for your project. Risk exists on all projects, and the potential that a particular risk will
occur depends on the nature of the risk.
   Risk, like most of the elements of the other Planning processes, changes as the project
progresses and should be monitored throughout the project. As you get close to a risk event,
that's the time to reassess your original assumptions about the risk and your plans to deal
with the risk and to make any adjustments as required.
   Not all risks are bad. Risks can present future opportunities as well as future threats to
a project. They may occur due to one reason or several reasons, and they may have multiple
impacts. All risks have causes, and if the risk event occurs during a project, there are con-
sequences. Those consequences will likely impact one or more of the project objectives, and
you'll need to know whether the consequences have positive or negative impacts.
   Risk is, after all, uncertainty. The more you know about risks and their impacts before-
hand, the better equipped you are to handle a risk when it occurs. The processes that involve
risk, probably more than any other project Planning process, concern balance. You want to
find that point where you and the stakeholders are comfortable with the risk based on the
benefits you can potentially gain. In a nutshell, you're balancing the action of taking a risk
against avoiding the consequences or impacts of a risk. The rest of this chapter will deal
with finding out what risk events might occur (and how to deal with those risks that are
                                                Planning Your Risk Management                 233




unknown), determining an organization's tolerance for risk taking, and developing action
plans for those risks you've determined have hefty impacts. The first step is performing the
Plan Risk Management process. Here, you determine the approach you'll use for risk man-
agement activities and document your plans for them in a risk management plan. You'll look
at that process now.



Planning Your Risk Management
Risks come about for many reasons. Some are internal to the project, and some are external.
The project environment, the planning process, the project management process, inadequate
resources, and so on can all contribute to risk. Some risks you'll know about in advance and
plan for during this process; others risk events will occur unannounced during the project.
The Plan Risk Management process determines how you'll plan for risks on your project.



Exam Spotlight

The PMBOK(R) Guide states that the Plan Risk Management process is the foundation for
all the Risk processes that follow. The risk management plan assures that the appropriate
amount of resources and the appropriate time are dedicated to risk management. "Appro-
priate" is determined based on the levels, the importance, and the types of risks. The most
important function the risk management plan serves is that it's an agreed-upon baseline
for evaluating project risk.



   To document the risk management plan, you need to gather some inputs that will help
you determine your organization's risk policies and tolerance for risk. You'll look at those
inputs next.


Plan Risk Management Inputs
Risks associated with a project generally concern four project objectives--time, cost, scope,
and quality--or any combination of the four. As you might have guessed, the project scope
statement is an input to this process since it describes your project deliverables. The inputs
of this process are as follows:
NN   Project scope statement
NN   Cost management plan
NN   Schedule management plan
NN   Communications management plan
NN   Enterprise environmental factors
NN   Organizational process assets
234        Chapter 6   n   Risk Planning



    One of the key elements of the enterprise environmental factors to consider as in input in
this process is the risk tolerance levels of the organization and the stakeholders. Risk tolerance
is that balance I talked about earlier where stakeholders are comfortable taking a risk because
the benefits to be gained outweigh what could be lost--or just the opposite. They will avoid
taking a risk because the cost or impact is too great given the amount of benefit that can be
derived. Here's an example to describe risk tolerance: Suppose you're a 275-pound brute who's
surrounded by three bodyguards of equal proportion everywhere you go. Chances are, walk-
ing down a dark alley in the middle of the night doesn't faze you in the least. That means your
risk tolerance for this activity is high. However, if you're a petite 90-pounder without benefit
of bodyguards or karate lessons, performing this same activity might give you cause for con-
cern. Your risk tolerance is low, meaning you wouldn't likely do this activity. The higher your
tolerance for risk, the more you're willing to take on risk and its consequences.


                  Organizations and stakeholders, as well as individuals, all have different
                  tolerances for risk. One organization might believe that the risk of a potential
                  7 percent cost overrun is high, while another might think it's low. However,
                  either one of these organizations might decide to accept the risk if it believes
                  the risk is in balance with the potential rewards. It's important for the proj-
                  ect manager to understand the tolerance level that the organization and the
                  stakeholders have for risk before evaluating and ranking risk.

   Remember that organizational process assets include policies and guidelines that might
already exist in the organization. Your organization's risk categories, risk statement formats,
and risk templates should be considered when planning for risks. Defined roles and respon-
sibilities and the authority levels the stakeholders and project manager have for making
decisions regarding risk planning should also be considered when developing the risk man-
agement plan.
   The project scope statement, as mentioned earlier, contains the project deliverables.
This is the first place you'll start looking when identifying risks and it should be considered
when determining the process you'll use to evaluate risks. The risk management plan (the
only output of this process) will become part of the project management plan; therefore,
other project management processes and guidelines should be considered when performing
this process so that the risk management plan is in line with the overall direction and man-
agement of the project.


Tools and Techniques for Plan Risk Management
The Plan Risk Management process has only one tool and technique: planning meetings
and analysis. The purpose of these meetings, which are held with project team members,
stakeholders, functional managers, and others who might have involvement in the risk
management process, is to contribute to the risk management plan. During these meetings,
the fundamental plans for performing risk management activities will be discussed and
determined and then documented in the risk management plan.
                                                   Planning Your Risk Management                235




     The key outcomes of performing these planning meetings are as follows:
NN    Risk cost elements are developed for inclusion in the project budget.
NN    Schedule activities associated with risk are developed for inclusion in the project schedule.
NN    Risk responsibilities are assigned.
NN    The risk contingency reserve process is established or reviewed.
NN    Templates for risk categories are defined or modified for this project.
NN    Definitions of terms (probability, impact, risk types, risk levels, and so on) are developed
      and documented.
NN    The probability and impact matrix is defined or modified for this project.


                   I'll discuss risk responsibilities, define the terms associated with risk man-
                   agement, and help you construct your own probability and impact matrix
                   in the remaining sections of this chapter.




Do We Need a Risk Management Plan?

Julia is the project manager for a small project her department is undertaking. The project
objective is to give customers the ability to download videos of the properties her organiza-
tion has listed for lease. Two programmers from the information technology department will
be working on the updates to the website, programming the links, and so on. The project
sponsor wants to fast track this project. She'd like to skip most of the Planning processes,
and she sees no need for a risk management plan. Julia explains to the sponsor that the risk
management plan for a project this size might be only a paragraph or two long. She empha-
sizes the importance of documenting how they'll identify risks, how they'll quantify them,
and how they'll monitor the risks as the project progresses. Julia has project management
experience on projects of all sizes and knows first-hand that ignoring this step could bring
some unexpected surprises to the sponsor later in the project. She explains a bad past expe-
rience where this step was ignored and then assures the sponsor they can probably agree to
the plan, identify and quantify the risks, and determine response plans in an hour and a half
or less. The sponsor now understands the issues and agrees to the meeting.



   Ultimately, your goal for this process concerns documenting the risk management plan
(the output of this process). This document is the basis for understanding the remaining
risk processes. Since the risk management plan encompasses a wealth of information, I've
given this topic its own section. Let's get to it.
236         Chapter 6   n   Risk Planning




Creating the Risk Management Plan
The purpose of the Plan Risk Management process is to create a risk management plan,
which describes how you will define, monitor, and control risks throughout the project.
The risk management plan is a subsidiary of the project management plan, and it's the only
output of this process.
   The risk management plan details how risk management processes (including Identify
Risks, Perform Qualitative Risk Analysis, Perform Quantitative Risk Analysis, Plan Risk
Responses, and Monitor and Control Risks) will be implemented, monitored, and con-
trolled throughout the life of the project. It details how you will manage risks but does not
attempt to define responses to individual risks.


                   I'll talk about how to develop the risk response plans in the section "Devel-
                   oping a Risk Response Plan" later in this chapter.

   According to the PMBOK(R) Guide, the risk management plan should include the follow-
ing elements:
NN    Methodology
NN    Roles and responsibilities
NN    Budgeting
NN    Timing
NN    Risk categories
NN    Definitions of risk probability and impact
NN    Probability and impact matrix
NN    Revised stakeholder tolerances
NN    Reporting formats
NN    Tracking



Exam Spotlight

It's important to spend time developing the risk management plan because it's an
input to every other risk-planning process and enhances the probability of risk man-
agement success.



   You'll take a look at most of these elements next. However, risk categories, probability
and impact, and probability and impact matrix are pretty meaty topics, so I'll cover those
in their own sections following this one.
                                                Planning Your Risk Management              237




Methodology Methodology is a description of how you'll perform risk management,
including elements such as methods, tools, and where you might find risk data that you
can use in the later processes.
Roles and responsibilities Roles and responsibilities describe the people who are respon-
sible for managing the identified risks and their responses and for each type of activity iden-
tified in the risk management plan. These risk teams might not be the same as the project
team. Risk analysis should be unbiased, which might not be possible when project team
members are involved.
Budgeting The budget for risk management is included in the plan as well. In this section,
you'll assign resources and estimate the costs of risk management and its methods. These
costs are then included in the project cost baseline.
Timing Timing documents the timing of the risk management processes (including when
and how often they'll be performed on the project) and includes the activities associated
with risk management in the project schedule.
Revised stakeholder tolerances This is just as it implies. As you proceed through the risk
management processes, you might find that risk tolerances will change. Document those
new tolerance levels in the risk management plan.
Reporting formats Reporting formats describe the content of the risk register and the
format of this document. (I'll talk more about the risk register later in this chapter.)
Reporting formats also detail how risk management information will be maintained,
updated, analyzed, and reported to project participants.
Tracking This includes a description of how you'll document the history of the risk activi-
ties for the current project and how the risk processes will be audited. You can reference
this information when you're performing risk-planning processes later in the current project
or on future projects. This information is also helpful for lessons learned, which I'll cover
in Chapter 11, "Controlling Work Results."

Risk Categories
Risk categories are a way to systematically identify risks and provide a foundation for under-
standing. When determining and identifying risks, the use of risk categories helps improve the
process by giving everyone involved a common language or basis for describing risk.
   Risk categories should be identified during this process and documented in the risk
management plan. These categories will assist you in making sure the next process, Identify
Risks, is performed effectively and produces a quality output. The following list includes
some examples of the categories you might consider during this process (or modify based
on previous project information):
NN   Technical, quality, or performance risks
NN   Project management risks
NN   Organizational risks
NN   External risks
238        Chapter 6      n    Risk Planning



    You can go about describing categories of risk in a couple of ways. One way is simply
listing them. You could, and should, review prior projects for risk categories and then tailor
them for this project.
    You could also construct a risk breakdown structure (RBS), which lists the categories
and subcategories. Figure 6.1 shows a sample of an RBS.

F i g u r e 6 .1 Risk breakdown structure


                                                 Project Name




            Technical            Project Management         Organizational            External




       Unproven Technology        Schedule Planning       Project Schedules           Weather




       Quality of Technology      Project Disciplines    Unrealistic Objectives     Labor Issues




        Performance Risks         Resource Planning        Lack of Funding        Catastrophic Risk




       Complex Technology          Cost Estimates




                                       Budgets




                    The organizational process assets input might include an RBS that you can
                    reference for this project. And don't forget your PMO. They might have
                    templates or an RBS already developed.

   Risk categories might reflect the type of industry or application area in which the project
exists. For example, information technology projects will likely have many risks that fall
into the technical category, whereas construction projects might be more subject to risks
that fall into the external risks category. The categories do not have to be industry specific,
however. Keep in mind that project management, for example, is a risk for every project in
every industry. You can find a description of each of the categories next:
Technical/quality/performance risks Technical, quality, or performance risks include
risks associated with unproven technology, complex technology, or changes to technology
                                                Planning Your Risk Management              239




anticipated during the course of the project. Performance risks might include unrealistic
performance goals. Perhaps one of the project deliverables concerns a component manu-
factured to specific performance standards that have never been achieved. That's a perfor-
mance risk.
Project management risks The project management risk category includes improper
schedule and resource planning, poor project planning, and improper or poor project
management disciplines or methodologies.
Organizational risks The organizational risk category can include resource conflicts
because of multiple projects occurring at the same time in the organization; scope, time,
and cost objectives that are unrealistic given the organization's resources or structure; and
lack of funding for the project or diverting funds from this project to other projects.
External risks The external risk category includes those aspects that are external to the
project, such as new laws or regulations, labor issues, weather, changes in ownership, and
foreign policy for projects performed in other countries. Catastrophic risks--known as
force majeure--are usually outside the scope of Plan Risk Management and instead require
disaster recovery techniques. Force majeure includes events such as earthquakes, meteor-
ites, volcanoes, floods, civil unrest, terrorism, and so on.

Defining Probability and Impact
When you're writing the risk management plan, you'll want to document the definitions
for probability and impact as they relate to potential negative risk events and their impacts
on the four project objectives. Probability describes the potential for the risk event occur-
ring, while impact describes the effects or consequences the project will experience if the
risk event occurs. This definition can be sophisticated or simple. For example, you might
use numeric values to define probability and impact or simply assign a high-medium-low
rating to each risk. What's important to note now is that you don't use these probability
and impact definitions here. You use these definitions later in the Perform Qualitative Risk
Analysis process. (I'll talk in depth about probability and impact in the section "Analyzing
Risks Using Qualitative Techniques" later in this chapter.) But you should define and docu-
ment them here in the risk management plan.

Probability and Impact Matrix
A probability and impact matrix prioritizes the combination of probability and impact
scores and helps you determine which risks need detailed risk response plans. For example, a
risk event with a high probability of occurring and a high impact will likely need a response
plan. This matrix is typically defined by the organization, but if you don't have one, you'll
need to develop this now--during your planning meeting and analysis (the tool and tech-
nique of this process). You'll use this matrix in the Perform Qualitative Risk Analysis pro-
cess, and I'll talk more in depth about it in the section "Analyzing Risks Using Qualitative
Techniques" later in this chapter. Again, you want to define (or modify) and document the
probability and impact matrix in the risk management plan.
240         Chapter 6   n   Risk Planning




                   The key point about this process is that you'll define what the probability
                   and impact tools look like now during Plan Risk Management so that the
                   team has an agreed-upon basis for evaluating the identified risks later
                   during the Perform Qualitative Risk Analysis process.

   To recap, the steps associated with these last few elements of the risk management plan
are as follows:
1.    Define the risk categories (these will assist the risk team in the Identify Risks process).
2.    Determine how probability and impact will be defined (to be used in the Perform Qual-
      itative Risk Analysis process).
3.    Develop or modify the probability and impact matrix (to be used in the Perform Quali-
      tative Risk Analysis process).
   Doing all these steps, together with the other elements of the risk management plan,
gives you and the risk management team a common understanding for evaluating risks
throughout the remainder of the project.



Identifying Potential Risk
The Identify Risks process involves identifying all the risks that might impact the project,
documenting them, and documenting their characteristics. Identify Risks is an iterative
process that continually builds on itself. As you progress through the project, more risks
might present themselves. Once you've identified or discovered a potential new risk, you
should analyze it to determine whether a response plan is needed. You can see that the risk
management cycle starts again with Identify Risks and progresses through the remaining
risk processes to determine what to do about them.
   You can include several groups of folks to help identify risks, including project team
members, risk team members, stakeholders, subject matter experts, users of the final prod-
uct or service, and anyone else who you think might help in the process. Perhaps in the first
round of Identify Risks you could include just the project team and subject matter experts
and then bring in the stakeholders or risk management team to further flesh out risks dur-
ing the second round of identification. Risk events can occur at any time during the proj-
ect, and all project participants should be encouraged to continually watch for and report
potential risk events.


                   I'll talk more about the techniques you can use to identify risks in the
                   section "Tools and Techniques for Identify Risk."

  Risks might or might not adversely affect the project. Some risks have positive conse-
quences, while others have negative consequences. However, you should identify all risk
                                                           Identifying Potential Risk       241




events and their consequences. Here's a partial list to get you thinking about where risk
might be found:
NN   Budgets/funding
NN   Schedules
NN   Scope or requirements changes
NN   Project plan
NN   Project management processes
NN   Technical issues
NN   Personnel issues
NN   Hardware
NN   Contracts
NN   Political concerns
NN   Business risk
NN   Legal risk
NN   Environmental risk
NN   Management risk
   This is by no means an exhaustive list. Remember that risk is uncertainty, and realize
that risk (uncertainty) is lurking almost anywhere on your project. It's your job to discover
as many of the potential risks as possible using the tools and techniques of this process and
to document these risks.


Identify Risks Inputs
The inputs to the Identify Risks process are as follows:
NN   Risk management plan
NN   Activity cost estimates
NN   Activity duration estimates
NN   Scope baseline
NN   Stakeholder register
NN   Cost management plan
NN   Schedule management plan
NN   Quality management plan
NN   Project documents
NN   Enterprise environmental factors
NN   Organizational process assets
242         Chapter 6   n   Risk Planning



    We have covered each of these inputs previously, with the exception of the quality
management plan. We'll talk about that in Chapter 7, "Planning Project Resources." For
purposes of the Identify Risk process, understand that the quality management process,
identified in the quality management plan, has the potential to produce or prevent risks
itself. We'll touch on a few of the key elements of some of these other inputs also.
    You should pay particular attention to the roles and responsibilities section of the risk
management plan and the budget and schedule for risk activities. Don't forget to examine
the categories of risks as well. This is a great place to start when you get the team together
and begin brainstorming your list of risks.
    The project scope statement, part of the scope baseline, contains a list of project
assumptions. You'll recall that assumptions are things believed to be true. It's imperative
during the risk-planning stages of your project and throughout the work of the project to
revisit and revalidate your project assumptions. At the time you recorded an assumption
about vendor deliveries, for example, the vendor had a great track record and never missed
a date. Months later on the project, that vendor merges with one of its competitors. Now
you'll need to reexamine your assumptions about delivery times and determine whether the
assumption is still valid or whether you have a risk on your hands.
    The project management plan contains several other management plans (such as schedule,
quality, and cost) that can be helpful sources also when identifying risks. You should also
consider network diagrams, baselines, work performance reports, and other project informa-
tion during this process.
    The enterprise environmental factors input concerns aspects from outside the project
that might help you determine or influence project outcomes. Be certain to check for indus-
try information (commercial databases, checklists, benchmarking studies, and so on) or
academic research that might exist for your application areas regarding risk information.
    As always, don't forget about historical information such as previous project experiences
via the project files. Project team knowledge is another form of historical information.


                   Although the PMBOK(R) Guide doesn't mention it, I've found that other ele-
                   ments of your project are helpful when identifying risk, such as the work
                   breakdown structure (WBS), the staffing management plan, project staff
                   assignments, and resource availability. In practice, you should examine the
                   outputs of most of the Planning processes when attempting to identify risks.




Tools and Techniques for Identify Risks
The Identify Risks process is undertaken using seven tools and techniques:
NN    Documentation reviews
NN    Information-gathering techniques
NN    Checklist analysis
                                                          Identifying Potential Risk          243



NN    Assumptions analysis
NN    Diagramming techniques
NN    SWOT analysis
NN    Expert judgment
     You'll learn more about each of these in the following sections.

Documentation Reviews
Documentation reviews involve reviewing project plans, assumptions, and historical
information from previous projects from both a total project perspective and an individ-
ual deliverables and activities level. This review helps the project team identify risks asso-
ciated with the project objectives. Pay attention to the quality of the plans (is the content
complete, or does it seem to be lacking detail?) and the consistency between plans. An
exceptionally documented schedule is great, but if the budget isn't as well documented,
you might have some potential risks.

Information Gathering
Information gathering encompasses several techniques, including brainstorming, the Delphi
technique, interviewing, and root cause identification. The goal of these techniques is to
end up with a comprehensive list of risks at the end of the meeting. Let's take a quick look
at each of these techniques.

Brainstorming
Brainstorming is probably the most often used technique of the Identify Risks process. You've
probably used this technique many times for many purposes. Brainstorming involves getting
subject matter experts, team members, risk management team members, and anyone else who
might benefit the process in a room and asking them to start identifying possible risk events.
The trick here is that one person's idea might spawn another idea, and so on so that by the
end of the session you've identified all the possible risks. The facilitator could start the group
off by going through the categories of risks to get everyone thinking in the right direction.

Nominal Group Technique
This technique is mentioned in the brainstorming tool and technique in the PMBOK(R) Guide.
The Nominal Group Technique is a type of brainstorming or can be conducted as a mass
interview technique.
    This technique requires the participants to be together in the same room. Each participant
has paper and pencil in front of them, and they are asked to write down what risks they think
the project faces. Using sticky-backed notes is a good way to do this. Each piece of paper
should contain only one risk. The papers are given to the facilitator, who sticks them up to
the wall or a white board. The panel is then asked to review all the risks posted on the board;
rank them and prioritize them, in writing; and submit the ranking to the facilitator. Once this
is done, you should have a complete list of risks.
244        Chapter 6   n   Risk Planning



Delphi Technique
The Delphi technique is a lot like brainstorming, only the people participating in the meeting
don't necessarily know each other. In fact, the people participating in this technique don't all
have to be located in the same place and usually participate anonymously. You can use email
to facilitate the Delphi technique easily.
    What you do is assemble your experts, from both inside and outside the company,
and provide them with a questionnaire to identify potential risks. They in turn send their
responses back to you (or to the facilitator of this process). All the responses are organized
by content and sent back to the Delphi members for further input, additions, or comments.
The participants then send their comments back one more time, and the facilitator compiles
a final list of risks.
    The Delphi technique is a great tool that allows consensus to be reached quickly. It also
helps prevent one person from unduly influencing the others in the group and thus prevents
bias in the outcome because the participants are usually anonymous and don't necessarily
know how others in the group responded.

Interviewing
Interviews are question-and-answer sessions held with others, including other project man-
agers, subject matter experts, stakeholders, customers, the management team, project team
members, and users. These folks provide you with possible risks based on their past experi-
ences with similar projects.
   This technique involves interviewing those folks with previous experience on projects
similar to yours or those with specialized knowledge or industry expertise. Ask them to tell
you about any risks that they've experienced or that they think might happen on your project.
Show them the WBS and your list of assumptions to help get them started thinking in the
right direction.

Root Cause Identification
Did you ever hear someone say you're looking at the symptoms and not at the problem?
That's the idea here. Root cause identification involves digging deeper than the risk itself
and looking at the cause of the risk. This helps define the risk more clearly, and it also helps
you later when it's time to develop the response plan for the risk.



Exam Spotlight

Not all the techniques listed here are detailed in the PMBOK(R) Guide. Be aware that there
might be questions about any of the techniques I've shown here. Understand the difference
between the various information-gathering techniques for the exam.



Checklist Analysis
Checklists used during the Identify Risks process are usually developed based on historical
information and previous project team experience. If you typically work on projects that
                                                                       Identifying Potential Risk   245




are similar in nature, begin to compile a list of risks. You can then convert this to a check-
list that will allow you to identify risks on future projects quickly and easily. You can also
use the lowest level of the RBS as a checklist. However, don't rely solely on checklists for
Identify Risks because you might miss important risks. It isn't possible for a single checklist
to be an exhaustive source for all projects. You can improve your checklists at the end of
the project by adding the new risks that were identified.

Assumptions Analysis
Assumptions analysis is a matter of validating the assumptions you identified and documented
during the course of the project-planning processes. Assumptions should be accurate, com-
plete, and consistent. Examine all your assumptions for these qualities. Assumptions are also
used as a jumping-off point to further identify risks.
   The important point to note about the project assumptions is that all assumptions are
tested against two factors:
NN    The strength of the assumption or the validity of the assumption
NN    The consequences that might impact the project if the assumption turns out to be false
     All assumptions that turn out to be false should be evaluated and scored just as risks.

Diagramming Techniques
Three types of diagramming techniques are used in Identify Risks: cause-and-effect,
system or process flowcharts, and influence diagrams. Cause-and-effect diagrams show
the relationship between the effects of problems and their causes. This diagram depicts
every potential cause and subcause of a problem and the effect that each proposed
solution will have on the problem. This diagram is also called a fishbone diagram or
Ishikawa diagram after its developer, Kaoru Ishikawa. Figure 6.2 shows an example
cause-and-effect diagram.

                                                                              Defect Statement

   The system or process flowchart shows the logical steps needed to accomplish an objective,
how the elements of a system relate to each other, and what actions cause what responses. This
flowchart is probably the one with which you're most familiar. It's usually constructed with
rectangles and parallelograms that step through a logical sequence and allow for "yes" and
"no" branches (or some similar type of decision). Figure 6.3 shows a flowchart to help deter-
mine whether risk response plans should be developed for the risk (I'll talk about response
plans in the section "Developing a Risk Response Plan" later in this chapter).

                  Cause-and-effect diagrams and system or process flowcharts are used in
                  the Identify Risks process as well as in the Perform Quality Control process.

   A third diagramming technique used during Identify Risks is called influence diagramming.
According to the PMBOK(R) Guide, influence diagrams typically show the causal influences
among project variables, the timing or time ordering of events, and the relationships among
other project variables and their outcomes. Simply put, they visually depict risks (or decisions),
uncertainties or impacts, and how they influence each other. Figure 6.4 shows an influence dia-
gram for a product introduction decision. The weather is a variable that could impact delivery
time, and delivery time is a variable that can impact when revenues will occur.

                                               times


   Each of these techniques provides a way for you to help identify project risks. It's impor-
tant that you identify all the risks early in the process. The better job you do of identifying
the project's risks at the Planning stage, the more comprehensive the risk response plan will
be. Identify Risks is not an area of project planning that you should skip.

Strengths, Weaknesses, Opportunities, and Threats (SWOT)
Strengths, weaknesses, opportunities, and threats (also known as SWOT analysis) is a
technique that examines the project from each of these viewpoints. It also requires exam-
ing the project from the viewpoint of the project itself and from project management
processes, resources, the organization, and so on to identify risks, including those that are
generated internally to the project. Strengths and weaknesses are generally related to issues
that are internal to the organization. Strengths examine what your organization does well
and what your customers, or the marketplace, view as your strengths. Weaknesses are
areas the organization could improve upon. Typically negative risks are associated with
the organization's weaknesses and positive risks are associated with its strengths. Oppor-
tunities and threats are usually external to the organization. SWOT analysis is sometimes
known as internal-external analysis and can be used in combination with brainstorming
techniques to help discover and document potential risks.
248          Chapter 6   n   Risk Planning



Expert Judgment
Experts for risk identification purposes can include anyone who has experience working on
similar projects, experience working in the business area for which the project was under-
taken, or specific industry experience. You should consider any bias your experts may have
regarding the project or potential risk events when using this technique.


Identify Risks Outputs
The output of the Identify Risks process is the risk register. Everything you've done
in this process up to this point will get documented here. The risk register contains the
following elements:
NN    List of identified risks
NN    List of potential responses
   The risk register also often contains warning signs or triggers, although these aren't listed
as an official part of the register. You'll take a look at each of these next. Understand that all
risks should be documented, tracked, reviewed, and managed throughout the project.

List of Identified Risks
Risks are all the potential events and their subsequent consequences that could occur as
identified by you and others during this process. You might want to consider logging your
risks in a risk database or tracking system to organize them and keep a close eye on their
status. This can easily be done in spreadsheet format or whatever method you choose. List
the risks, assign each risk a tracking number, and note the potential cause or event and the
potential impact. This list gives you a means to track the risks, their occurrence, and the
responses implemented.

List of Potential Responses
You might identify potential responses to risk at the same time you're identifying the risks.
Sometimes just identifying the risk will tell you the appropriate response. Document those
responses here. You'll refer to them again in the Plan Risk Responses process a little later in
this chapter.
   A sample risk register is shown in Table 6.1. As you progress through the risk, planning
processes and through the project itself, more risks may be identified and more information
will become know about the risks. You should update the risk register with new informa-
tion as it becomes known.

                                  Analyzing Risks Using Qualitative Techniques              249




Triggers
Triggers are warning signs or symptoms that a risk event is about to occur. For example,
if you've ever suffered from a hay fever attack, you can't mistake the itchy, runny nose and
scratchy throat that can come on suddenly and send you into a sneezing frenzy. Signals
like this are known as triggers and work the same way when determining whether a risk
event is about to occur. For example, if you're planning an outdoor gathering and rain
clouds start rolling in from the north on the morning of the activity, you probably have a
risk event waiting to happen. A key team member hinting about job hunting is a warning
sign that the person might be thinking of leaving, which in turn can cause schedule delays,
increased costs, and so on. This is another example of a trigger.
    Triggers are not listed as one of the risk register elements, but in practice this is an
appropriate place to list them. You will likely encounter questions on the exam about trig-
gers, so don't say I didn't warn you. Also, throughout the remainder of the project, be on
the alert for triggers that might signal that a risk event is about to occur.



Analyzing Risks Using Qualitative
Techniques
The Perform Qualitative Risk Analysis process involves determining what impact the
identified risks will have on the project objectives and the probability they'll occur. It also
ranks the risks in priority order according to their effect on the project objectives. This
helps the team determine whether Perform Quantitative Risk Analysis should be performed
or whether you can skip right to developing response plans. The Perform Qualitative Risk
Analysis process also considers risk tolerance levels, especially as they relate to the project
constraints (scope, time, cost, and quality) and the time frames of the potential risk events.
   The Perform Qualitative Risk Analysis process should be performed throughout the
project. This process is the one you'll find you'll use most often when prioritizing project
risks because it's fast, relatively easy to perform, and cost effective. The PMBOK(R) Guide
notes that you should identify and manage the risk attitudes of those assisting with this
process, and if bias is introduced, you should evaluate it and correct it if necessary.


Perform Qualitative Risk Analysis Inputs
The Perform Qualitative Risk Analysis process has four inputs:
NN   Risk register
NN   Risk management plan
NN   Project scope statement
NN   Organizational process assets
250           Chapter 6   n   Risk Planning



    The critical element in this process, as with most of the processes where the risk reg-
ister is an input, is the list of risks. The risk management plan documented the roles and
responsibilities of risk team members, budget and schedule factors for risk activities, the
stakeholder risk tolerances, the definitions for probability and impact, and the probability
and impact matrix, all of which should be utilized when prioritizing risks. You'll examine
probability and impact more closely in the next section, "Tools and Techniques for Perform
Qualitative Risk Analysis."
    The project scope statement describes the deliverables of the project, and from there you
should be able to determine whether you're dealing with a high level of uncertainty or a
project that's similar in size and scope to one you've performed before. Projects with high
levels of uncertainty or that are more complex than what the team has undertaken before
require more diligence during the Perform Qualitative Risk Analysis process.
    As with the Identify Risks process, you should examine historical information and lessons
learned from past projects as a guide for prioritizing the risks for this project. Risk databases
from your industry or application area can be used here as well. These are part of the organi-
zational process assets input.
    The real key to this process lies in the tools and techniques you'll use to prioritize risks.
Hold on tight because you're going in the deep end.


Tools and Techniques for Perform
Qualitative Risk Analysis
The Perform Qualitative Risk Analysis process's tools and techniques are primarily concerned
with discovering the probability of a risk event and determining the impact (or consequences)
the risk will have if it does occur. The output of this process is a risk register update where
you'll document the prioritized risks you've scored using these tools and techniques. All the
information you gather regarding risks and probability needs to be as accurate as possible. It's
also important that you gather unbiased information so that you don't unintentionally over-
look risks with great potential or consequences.
   The purpose of this process is to determine risk event probability and risk impact. You'll
use the tools and techniques of this process to establish risk scores, which is a way of cat-
egorizing the probability and risk impact. The Perform Qualitative Risk Analysis process
includes the following tools and techniques:
NN     Risk probability and impact assessment
NN     Probability and impact matrix
NN     Risk data quality assessment
NN     Risk categorization
NN     Risk urgency assessment
NN     Expert judgment
      We'll look at each of these tools and techniques next.
                                     Analyzing Risks Using Qualitative Techniques               251




Risk Probability and Impact Assessment
This tool and technique assesses the probability that the risk events you've identified will occur,
and it determines the effect their impacts have on the project objectives, including time, scope,
quality, and cost. Analyzing risks in this way allows you to determine which risks require the
most aggressive management. When determining probabilities and impacts, you'll refer to the
risk management plan element called "definitions of risk probability and impact."

Probability
Probability is the likelihood that an event will occur. The classic example is flipping a coin.
There is a .50 probability of getting heads and a .50 probability of getting tails on the flip.
Note that the probability that an event will occur plus the probability that the event will not
occur always equals 1.0. In this coin-flipping example, you have a .50 chance that you'll get
heads on the flip. Therefore, you have a .50 chance you will not get heads on the flip. The
two responses added together equal 1.0. Probability is expressed as a number from 0.0--
which means there is no probability of the event occurring--to 1.0--which means there is
100% certainty the risk will occur.
   Determining risk probability can be difficult because it's most commonly accomplished
using expert judgment. In non-PMP terms, this means you're guessing (or asking other
experts to guess) at the probability a risk event will occur. Granted, you're basing your guess
on past experiences with similar projects or risk events, but no two risk events (or projects)
are ever the same. It's best to fully develop the criteria for determining probability and get as
many experts involved as you can. Carefully weigh their responses to come up with the best
probability values possible.

Impact
Impact is the amount of pain (or the amount of gain) the risk event poses to the project.
The risk impact scale can be a relative scale (also known as an ordinal scale) that assigns
values such as high-medium-low (or some combination of these) or a numeric scale known
as a cardinal scale. Cardinal scale values are actual numeric values assigned to the risk
impact. Cardinal scales are expressed as values from 0.0 to 1.0 and can be stated in equal
(linear) or unequal (nonlinear) increments.
    Table 6.2 shows a typical risk impact scale for cost, time, and quality objectives based
on a high-high to low-low scale. You'll notice that each of the high-medium-low value com-
binations on this impact scale have been assigned a cardinal value. I'll use these in the next
section when I talk about the probability and impact matrix.
    When you're using a high-medium-low scale, it's important that your risk team under-
stands what criteria was used to determine a high score versus a medium or low score and
how these should be applied to the project objectives.

Assessing Probability and Impact
The idea behind both probability and impact values is to develop predefined measurements
that describe what value to place on a risk event.



Exam Spotlight

For the exam, don't forget that you define probability and impact values during the Plan
Risk Management process.



   If the risk impact scale has not been previously defined, develop one for the project as
early in the Planning processes as possible. You can use any of the techniques I talked about
earlier in the section "Tools and Techniques for Identify Risk," such as brainstorming or
the Delphi technique, to come up with the values for probability and impact.
   During the Perform Qualitative Risk Analysis process, you'll determine and assess prob-
ability and impact for every risk identified during the Identify Risks process. You could
interview or hold meetings with project team members, subject matter experts, stakehold-
ers, or others to help assess these factors. During this process, you should document not
only the probability and impact but also the assumptions your team members used to arrive
at these determinations. The next technique--probability and impact matrix--takes the
probability and impact values one step further by assigning an overall risk score.

Probability and Impact Matrix
The outcome of a probability and impact matrix is an overall risk rating for each of the proj-
ect's identified risks. The combination of probability and impact results in a classification
usually expressed as high, medium, or low. According to the PMBOK(R) Guide, high risks
are considered a red condition, medium risks are considered a yellow condition, and low risks
                                      Analyzing Risks Using Qualitative Techniques                       253




are considered a green condition. This type of ranking is known as an ordinal scale because
the values are ordered by rank from high to low. (In practice, ordinal values might also include
ranking by position. In other words, the risks are listed in order by rank as the first, the sec-
ond, the third, and so on.)



Exam Spotlight

The PMBOK(R) Guide notes that the probability and impact matrix values are usually set by
the organization and are part of the organizational process assets.



    Now let's look at an example. You have identified a risk event that could impact project
costs, and your experts believe costs could increase by as much as 9 percent. According to
the risk impact rating matrix in Table 6.2, this risk carries a medium impact, with a value
of 0.40. Hold on to that number because you're going to plug it into the probability impact
matrix--along with the probability value--to determine an overall risk value next.
    You'll remember from the discussion previously that probability values should be assigned
numbers from 0.0 to 1.0. In this example, the team has determined that there is a 0.2 proba-
bility of this risk event occurring. The risk impact scale shows a medium or 0.4 impact should
the event occur.
    Now, to determine whether the combination of the probability and impact of this risk is
high, medium, or low, you'll need to check the probability impact matrix. Table 6.3 shows
a sample probability and impact matrix.

   First look at the probability column. Your risk event has a probability of .2. Now fol-
low that row across until you find the column that shows the impact score of .40 (it's the
Medium column). According to your probability and impact matrix values, this risk carries
254         Chapter 6   n   Risk Planning



an overall score of .08 and falls in the low threshold, so this risk is assigned a low (or green
condition) value.
   The values assigned to the risks determine how Plan Risk Responses is carried out for
the risks later during the risk-planning processes. Obviously, risks with high probability
and high impact are going to need further analysis and formal responses. Remember that
the values for this matrix (and the probability and impact scales discussed earlier) are deter-
mined prior to the start of this process and documented in the risk management plan. Also
keep in mind that probability and impact do not have to be assigned the same values as I've
done here. You might use 0.8, 0.6, 0.4, and 0.2 for probability, for example, and assign .05,
0.1, .03, 0.5, and 0.7 for impact scales.




Screen Scrapers, Inc.

Screen Scrapers is a software-manufacturing company that produces a software product
that looks at your mainframe screens, commonly called green screens, and converts them
to browser-based screens. The browser-based screens look like any other Windows-
compatible screens with buttons, scroll bars, and drop-down lists.

Screen Scrapers devised this product for companies that use mainframe programs to
update and store data because many of the entry-level workers beginning their careers
today are not familiar with green screens. They're cumbersome and difficult to learn, and
no consistency exists from screen to screen or from program to program. An F5 key in
one program might mean go back one page, while an F5 key in another program might
mean clear the screen. New users are easily confused, make a lot of mistakes, and have
to write tablets full of notes on how to navigate all the screens.

Your company has purchased the Screen Scraper product and has appointed you the
project manager over the installation. This project consists of a lot of issues to address,
and you've made great headway. You're now at the Identify Risks and Perform Qualitative
Risk Analysis stage. You decide to use the Delphi technique to assist you in identifying
risk and assigning probability and impact rankings. Some experts are available in your
company to serve on the Delphi panel, as well as some folks in industry organizations you
belong to outside the company.

You assemble the group, set up a summary of the project, and send it out via email,
requesting responses to your questions about risk. After the first pass, you compile the
list of risks as follows (this list is an example and isn't exhaustive because your list will be
project specific):

NN    Vendor viability (will the software company stay in business?)
NN    Vendor responsiveness with problems after implementation
                                   Analyzing Risks Using Qualitative Techniques             255




NN   Software compatibility risks with existing systems
NN   Hardware compatibility risk
NN   Connection to the mainframe risk
NN   Training IT staff members to maintain the product

You send this list back to the Delphi members and ask them to assign a probability of 0.0
to 1.0 and an impact of high-high, high, medium, low, or low-low to each risk. The Delphi
members assign probability and impact based on a probability scale and an impact scale
designed by the risk management team. The values of the impact scale are as follows:

NN   High-high = 0.8
NN   High = 0.6
NN   Medium = 0.4
NN   Low = 0.2
NN   Low-low = 0.05

The results are compiled to determine the following probability and impact values:

NN   Vendor viability = .6 probability, high impact
NN   Vendor responsiveness = .4 probability, medium impact
NN   Software compatibility = .4 probability, medium impact
NN   Hardware compatibility = .6 probability, high-high impact
NN   Mainframe connection = .2 probability, high-high impact
NN   Training = .2 probability, low-low impact

The probability and impact matrix you used to assign the overall risk scores were derived
from the probability and impact matrix shown in the following table.

Based on the probability and impact matrix thresholds, the project risks are assigned the
following overall probabilities:

NN   Vendor viability = high
NN   Vendor responsiveness = medium
NN   Software compatibility = medium
NN   Hardware compatibility = high
NN   Mainframe connection = medium
NN   Training = low

Risk Data Quality Assessment
The data quality assessment involves determining the usefulness of the data gathered to
evaluate risk. Most important, the data must be unbiased and accurate. You will want to
examine elements such as the following when using this tool and technique:
NN    The quality of the data used
NN    The availability of data regarding the risks
NN    How well the risk is understood
NN    The reliability and integrity of the data
NN    The accuracy of the data
   Low-quality data will render the results from the Perform Qualitative Risk Analysis pro-
cess almost useless. Spend the time to validate and verify the information you've collected
about risks so that your prioritization and analysis is as accurate as it can be. If you find
that the quality of the data is questionable, you guessed it--go back and get better data.

Risk Categorizations
This tool and technique is used to determine the effects risk has on the project. You can
examine not only the categories of risk determined during the Plan Risk Management pro-
cess (and described in the RBS) but also the project phase and the WBS to determine the
elements of the project that are affected by risk.

Risk Urgency Assessment
Using this tool you'll determine how soon the potential risk events might occur and quickly
determine responses for those risk events that could occur soon. You should consider the
risk triggers, the time to develop and implement a response, and the overall risk rating
when determining how quickly responses are needed.
                                                                   Quantifying Risk          257




Expert Judgment
Because this process determines qualitative values, by its very nature you must rely on expert
judgment to determine the probability, impact, and other information we've derived so far.
The more knowledge and similar experience your experts have, the better your assessments
will be. Interviews and facilitated workshops are two techniques you can use in conjunction
with expert judgment to perform this process. As with the Identify Risks process, make cer-
tain to take into account any bias your experts have and to correct it when necessary.


Ranking Risks in the Risk Register
The goal of the Perform Qualitative Risk Analysis process is to rank the risks and deter-
mine which ones need further analysis and, eventually, risk response plans. The output of
this process is risk register updates. According to the PMBOK(R) Guide, you'll update the
register with the following information:
NN   Risk ranking (or priority) for the identified risks
NN   Risks grouped by categories
NN   Causes of risk
NN   List of risks requiring near-term responses
NN   List of risks that need additional analysis and response
NN   Watch list of low-priority risks
NN   Trends in qualitative risk analysis results
    Each element becomes a new entry in the risk register. For example, risk ranking assigns
the risk score or priority you determined using the probability and impact matrix to the list
of identified risks previously recorded in the risk register. I discussed the categories and the
list of risks requiring near-term responses earlier. Note these in the risk register.
    You'll also note those risks that require further analysis (including using the Perform
Quantitative Risk Analysis process), you'll create a list of risks that have low risk scores to
review periodically, and you should note any trends in Perform Qualitative Risk Analysis
that become evident as you perform this process.



Quantifying Risk
The Perform Quantitative Risk Analysis process evaluates the impacts of risk prioritized
during the Perform Qualitative Risk Analysis process and quantifies risk exposure for the
project by assigning numeric probabilities to each risk and their impacts on project objec-
tives. This quantitative approach is accomplished using techniques such as Monte Carlo
simulation and decision tree analysis. To paraphrase the PMBOK(R) Guide, the purpose of
this process is to perform the following:
NN   Quantify the project's possible outcomes and probabilities.
NN   Determine the probability of achieving the project objectives.
258         Chapter 6   n   Risk Planning



NN    Identify risks that need the most attention by quantifying their contribution to overall
      project risk.
NN    Identify realistic and achievable schedule, cost, or scope targets.
NN    Determine the best project management decisions possible when outcomes are uncertain.
   Perform Quantitative Risk Analysis--like Perform Qualitative Risk Analysis--examines
each risk and its potential impact on the project objectives. You might choose to use both of
these processes to assess all risks or only one of them, depending on the complexity of the
project and the organizational policy regarding risk planning. The Perform Quantitative
Risk Analysis process can follow either the Identify Risks process or the Perform Qualita-
tive Risk Analysis process. If you do use this process, be certain to repeat it every time the
Plan Risk Responses process is performed and as part of the Monitor and Control Risks
process so that you can determine if overall project risk has decreased.
   I've already covered many of the inputs to the Perform Quantitative Risk Analysis pro-
cess in previous sections of this chapter. They are as follows:
NN    Risk register
NN    Risk management plan
NN    Cost management plan
NN    Schedule management plan
NN    Organizational process assets
   The elements of the organizational process assets you'll want to pay close attention to
as an input to this process are the historical information from previous projects, risk data-
bases, and risk specialists studies performed on similar projects.


Tools and Techniques for Perform Quantitative
Risk Analysis
The Perform Quantitative Risk Analysis process includes three tools and techniques: data
gathering and representation techniques, Quantitative Risk Analysis and modeling techniques,
and expert judgment.

Data Gathering and Representation Techniques
The data gathering techniques include interviewing techniques and probability distributions.

Interviewing
This technique is like the interviewing technique discussed earlier in the section "Identify-
ing Potential Risk." Project team members, stakeholders, and subject-matter experts are
prime candidates for risk interviews. Ask them about their experiences on past projects and
about working with the types of technology or processes you'll use during this project.
                                                                   Quantifying Risk           259




                  For the exam, remember that interviewing is a tool and technique of the
                  Perform Quantitative Risk Analysis process. Although you can use this
                  technique in the Identify Risks process, remember that it's part of the data
                  gathering and representation technique and not a named tool and tech-
                  nique itself.

   When using this technique, you should first determine what methods of probability dis-
tribution (described next) you'll use to analyze your information. The technique you choose
will dictate the type of information you need to gather. For example, you might use a three-
point scale that assesses the low, high, and most likely risk scenarios or take it a step fur-
ther and use standard deviations calculations.
   Make certain you document how the interviewees decided upon the risk ranges, the cri-
teria they used to place risks in certain categories, and the results of the interview. This will
help you later in developing risk responses as well.



Exam Spotlight

For the exam, you should know that several types of probability distributions exist that
are useful in determining and displaying risk information. The type of distribution you use
determines the type of information you should gather during the interviewing process.




Probability Distributions
It's beyond the scope of this book to delve into probability distributions and calculations,
so I'll point out a few aspects of them that you should remember for the exam.
    Continuous probability distributions (particularly beta and triangular distributions) are
commonly used in Perform Quantitative Risk Analysis. According to the PMBOK(R) Guide,
continuous probability distributions include normal, lognormal, triangular, beta, and uniform
distributions. Distributions are graphically displayed and represent both the probability and
time or cost elements.
    Triangular distributions use estimates based on the three-point estimate (the pessimistic,
most likely, and optimistic values). This means that during your interviews, you'll gather
these pieces of information from your experts. Then you'll use them to quantify risk for
each WBS element.
    Normal and lognormal distributions use mean and standard deviations to quantify risk,
which also require gathering the optimistic, most likely, and pessimistic estimates.
    Discrete distributions represent possible scenarios in a decision tree (we'll discuss this in
the next section), outcomes of a test, results of a prototype, and other uncertain events.
260        Chapter 6   n   Risk Planning



Quantitative Risk Analysis and Modeling Techniques
There are four analysis and modeling techniques within the Quantitative Risk Analysis tool
and technique you should know for the exam: sensitivity analysis, expected monetary value
analysis, decision tree analysis, and modeling and simulation. Let's take a brief look at each
of them.

Sensitivity Analysis
Sensitivity analysis is a quantitative method of analyzing the potential impact of risk events
on the project and determining which risk event (or events) has the greatest potential for
impact by examining all the uncertain elements at their baseline values. One of the ways
sensitivity analysis data is displayed is a tornado diagram. Figure 6.5 shows a sample tor-
nado diagram.

F i g u r e 6 . 5 Tornado diagram



                  Technical risk

                            Quality risk

                   Project management risk

                               Organizational risk


                                   -12,000    -6,000         0          6,000   12,000
                                                       Project budget


   You can see by the arrangement of horizontal bars (each representing a sensitivity vari-
able) how the diagram gets its name. The idea is that each sensitivity bar displays the low
and high value possible for the element the bar represents. It's beyond the scope of this book
to explain how these values are determined. The questions you might encounter on the exam
are focused on the context of this type of analysis. The variables with the greatest effect
on the project appear at the top of the graph and decrease in impact as you progress down
through the graph. This gives you a quick overview of how much the project can be affected
by uncertainty in the various elements. It also allows you to see at a glance which risks
might have the biggest impacts on the project and will require carefully crafted, detailed
response plans. You can use tornado diagrams to determine sensitivity in cost, time, and
quality objectives or for risks you've identified during this process. Sensitivity analysis can
also be used to determine stakeholder risk tolerance levels.

Expected Monetary Value (EMV) Analysis
Expected monetary value (EMV) analysis is a statistical technique that calculates the
average, anticipated future impact of the decision. EMV is calculated by multiplying
the probability of the risk by its impact for two or more potential outcomes (for example,
                                                                   Quantifying Risk          261




a good outcome and a poor outcome) and then adding the results of the potential outcomes
together. EMV is used in conjunction with the decision tree analysis technique, which is
covered next. I'll give you an example of the EMV formula in the next section. Positive
results generally mean the risks you're assessing pose opportunities to the project, while
negative results generally indicate a threat to the project.

Decision Tree Analysis
Unfortunately, this isn't a tree outside your office door that produces "yes" and "no" leaves
that you can pick to help you make a decision. Decision trees are diagrams that show the
sequence of interrelated decisions and the expected results of choosing one alternative over
the other. Typically, more than one choice or option is available when you're faced with
a decision or, in this case, potential outcomes from a risk event. The available choices are
depicted in tree form starting at the left with the risk decision branching out to the right with
possible outcomes. Decision trees are usually used for risk events associated with time or cost.
    Figure 6.6 shows a sample decision tree using expected monetary value (EMV) as one of
its inputs.

                              Choice Y

                                                 Probability .2


   The expected monetary value of the decision is a result of the probability of the risk
event multiplied by the impact for two or more potential outcomes and then summing their
results. The squares in this figure represent decisions to be made, and the circles represent
the points where risk events might occur.
   The decision with an expected value of $7,000 is the correct decision to make because
the resulting outcome has the greatest value.

Modeling and Simulation
Modeling and simulation techniques are often used for schedule risk analysis and cost
analysis. For example, modeling allows you to translate the potential risks at specific
262        Chapter 6   n   Risk Planning



points in the project into their impacts so you can determine how the project objectives are
affected. Simulation techniques compute the project model using various inputs, such as
cost or schedule duration, to determine a probability distribution for the variable chosen.
(Cost risks typically use either a work breakdown structure or a cost breakdown structure
as the input variable. Schedule risks always use the precedence diagramming method as
the input variable. I'll cover schedule diagramming methods in Chapter 7.) If you used
simulation techniques to determine project cost and use the cost of the project elements as
the input variable, a probability distribution for the total cost of the project would be pro-
duced after running the simulation numerous times. Modeling and simulation techniques
examine the identified risks and their potential impacts to the project objectives from the
perspective of the whole project.
   Monte Carlo analysis is an example of a simulation technique. Monte Carlo analysis is
replicated many times, typically using cost or schedule variables. Every time the analysis is
performed, the values for the variable are changed using a probability distribution for each
variable. Monte Carlo analysis can also be used during the Schedule Development process.



Exam Spotlight

Simulation techniques are recommended for predicting schedule or cost risks because
they're more powerful than EMV and less likely to be misused. For the exam, remember
that simulation techniques are used to predict schedule or cost risks.




Expert Judgment
I've talked about this tool and technique before. Experts can come from inside or outside
the organization and should have experience that's applicable to your project. For example,
if your project involves manufacturing a new product or part, you might want to consider
experts such as engineers or statisticians. If you're dealing with sensitive data in an infor-
mation technology project, consider bringing in a security expert.


Perform Quantitative Risk Analysis Outputs
The output of the Perform Quantitative Risk Analysis process is--I'll bet you can guess--
risk register updates. As with the Perform Qualitative Risk Analysis process, you'll record
the following new elements in the risk register:
Probabilistic analysis of the project Probabilistic analysis of the project is the forecasted
results of the project schedule and costs as determined by the outcomes of risk analysis. These
results include projected completion dates and costs, along with a confidence level associated
with each. According to the PMBOK(R) Guide, this output is often expressed as a cumulative
distribution, and you'll use these results along with stakeholder risk tolerances to quantify the
                                                  Developing a Risk Response Plan                263




time and cost contingency reserves. (I'll talk about contingency reserves in the next section,
"Developing a Risk Response Plan.")
Confidence levels can also be used to describe the level of confidence placed on the outcome
of the forecasted results. For example, suppose the projected schedule completion date is
July 12 and the confidence level is .85. This says you believe the project will finish on or
before July 12 and that you have an 85 percent level of confidence that this date is accurate.
Probability of achieving the cost and time objectives Using the tools and techniques of Per-
form Quantitative Risk Analysis allows you to assign a probability of achieving the cost and
time objectives of the project. This output documents those probabilities and as such requires
a thorough understanding of the current project objectives and knowledge of the risks.
Prioritized list of quantified risks The prioritized list in this process is similar to the list pro-
duced during the Perform Qualitative Risk Analysis process. The list of risks includes those
that present the greatest risk or threat to the project and their impacts. It also lists those risks
that present the greatest opportunities to the project. This list should also indicate which risks
are most likely to impact the critical path and those that have the largest cost contingency.
Trends in Perform Quantitative Risk Analysis results Trends in Perform Quantitative
Risk Analysis will likely appear as you repeat the risk analysis processes. This information
is useful as you progress, making those risks with the greatest threat to the project more
evident, which gives you the opportunity to perform further analysis or go on to develop
risk response plans.

Developing a Risk Response Plan
The Plan Risk Responses process is the last process covered in this chapter. (I hear you
cheering out there!) Plan Risk Responses is a process of deciding what actions to take to
reduce threats and take advantage of the opportunities discovered during the risk analysis
processes. This process also includes assigning departments or individual staff members the
responsibility of carrying out the risk response plans you'll outline in this process. These
folks are known as risk owners.


                   The more effective your risk response plans are, the better your chances
                   for a successful project. Well-developed and well-written risk response
                   plans will likely decrease overall project risk.
264           Chapter 6   n   Risk Planning



   Generally, you'll want to develop risk response plans for those risks with a combina-
tion of high probability of occurrence and significant impact to the project, those ranked
high (or red) on the probability/impact matrix, or those ranked high as a result of Perform
Quantitative Risk Analysis. Developing risk response plans for risks of low severity or
insignificant impact is not an efficient or good use of the project team's time. Spend your
time planning responses that are appropriate given the impact the risk itself poses (or the
opportunity the risk presents), and don't spend more time, money, or energy to produce a
response than the risk event itself would produce if it occurred.
   The inputs you'll use to assist you in this process are the risk register and the risk
management plan. Several strategies are used in this process to reduce or control risk. It's
important that you choose the right strategy for each risk so that the risk and its impacts
are dealt with effectively. After deciding on which strategy to use, you'll develop an action
plan to put this strategy into play should the risk event occur. You might also choose to
designate a secondary or backup strategy.



Exam Spotlight

The rank of the risk will dictate the level of Plan Risk Responses that should be performed.
For example, a risk with low severity wouldn't warrant the time it takes to develop a detailed
risk response plan. Risk responses should be cost effective--if the cost of the response
is more than the consequences of the risk, you might want to examine a different risk
response. Risk responses should also be timely, agreed to by all the project stakeholders,
and assigned to an individual (risk owner) who is responsible for monitoring and carrying
out the risk response plan if needed.




Tools and Techniques for Plan Risk Responses
The Plan Risk Responses process consists of four tools and techniques, and each one of
them involves a strategy. The tools and techniques are as follows:
NN     Strategies for negative risks or threats
NN     Strategies for positive risks or opportunities
NN     Contingent response strategy
NN     Expert judgment
      You'll take a look at the first three next.

Strategies for Negative Risks or Threats
Four strategies exist to deal with negative risks or threats to the project objectives. They are
avoid, transfer, mitigate, and accept.
                                                Developing a Risk Response Plan             265




Avoid
To avoid a risk means you'll evade it altogether, eliminate the cause of the risk event, or
change the project plan to protect the project objectives from the risk event. Let's say you're
going to take a car trip from your home to a point 800 miles away. You know--because
your friends who just took the same trip told you--that there is a long stretch of construc-
tion on one of the highways you're planning on using. To avoid the risk of delay, you plan
the trip around the construction work and use another highway for that stretch of driving.
In this way, you change your plans, avoid the risk of getting held up in construction traffic,
and arrive at your destination on time.
    With risk avoidance, you essentially eradicate the risk by eliminating its cause. Here's
another example: Suppose your project was kicked off without adequate scope definition
and requirements gathering. You run a high probability of experiencing scope creep--
ever-changing requirements--as the project progresses, thus impacting the project sched-
ule. You can avoid this risk by adequately documenting the project scope and requirements
during the Planning processes and taking steps to monitor and control changes to scope so
it doesn't get out of hand.
    Risks that occur early in the project might easily be avoided by improving communica-
tions, refining requirements, assigning additional resources to project activities, refining the
project scope to avoid risk events, and so on.

Transfer
The idea behind a risk transfer is to transfer the risk and the consequences of that risk to a
third party. The risk hasn't gone away, but the responsibility for the management of that risk
now rests with another party. Most companies aren't willing to take on someone else's risk
without a little cash thrown in for good measure. This strategy will impact the project budget
and should be included in the cost estimate exercises if you know you're going to use it.
    Transfer of risk can occur in many forms but is most effective when dealing with finan-
cial risks. Insurance is one form of risk transfer. You are probably familiar with how insur-
ance works. Car insurance is a good example. You purchase car insurance so that if you
come upon an obstacle in the road and there is no way to avoid hitting it, the cost to repair
the damage to the car is paid by the insurance company...OK, minus the deductible and
all the calculations for the age of the car, the mileage, the color and make of the car, the
weather conditions the day you were driving--but I digress.
    Another method of risk transfer is contracting. Contracting transfers specific risks to the
vendor, depending on the work required by the contract. The vendor accepts the responsi-
bility for the cost of failure. Again, this doesn't come without a price. Contractors charge
for their services, and depending on the type of contract you negotiate, the cost might be
quite high. For example, in a fixed-price contract, which I'll talk more about in Chapter 7,
the vendor (or seller) increases the cost of the contract to compensate for the level of risk
they're accepting. A cost reimbursable contract, however, leaves the majority of the risk
with you, the buyer. This type of contract might reduce costs if there are project changes
midway through the project.
    Keep in mind that contracting isn't a cure-all. You might just be swapping one risk for
another. For example, say you hire a driver to go with you on your road trip, and that person's
266         Chapter 6   n   Risk Planning



job is to do all the driving. If the driver becomes ill or in some way can't fulfill their obligation,
you aren't going to get to your destination on time. You've placed the risks associated with
the trip on the contract driver; however, you've taken on a risk of delay because of nonper-
formance, which means you've just swapped one risk for another. You'll have to weigh your
options in cases like this and determine which side of the risk coin your organization can more
readily accept.
   Other forms of transference include warranties, guarantees, and performance bonds.

Mitigate
When you mitigate a risk, you attempt to reduce the probability of a risk event and its
impacts to an acceptable level. This strategy is a lot like defensive driving. You see an
obstacle in the road ahead, survey your options, and take the necessary steps to avoid the
obstacle and proceed safely on your journey. Seeing the obstacle ahead (identifying risk)
allows you to reduce the threat by planning ways around it or planning ways to reduce its
impact if the risk does occur (mitigation strategies).
   According to the PMBOK(R) Guide, the purpose of mitigation is to reduce the probability
that a risk will occur and reduce the impact of the risk to a level where you can accept the
risk and its outcomes. It's easier to take actions early on that will reduce the probability of
a risk or its consequences than it is to fix the damage once it has occurred. Some examples
of risk mitigation include performing more tests, using less complicated processes, creating
prototypes, and choosing more reliable vendors.

Accept
The acceptance strategy is used when you aren't able to eliminate all the threats on the
project. Acceptance of a risk event is a strategy that can be used for risks that pose either
threats or opportunities to the project. Passive acceptance is a strategy that means you
won't make any plans to try to avoid or mitigate the risk. You're willing to accept the con-
sequences of the risk should it occur. Acceptance might also mean the project team was
unable to come up with an adequate response strategy and must accept the risk and its con-
sequences. Active acceptance might include developing contingency reserves to deal with
risks should they occur. (You'll look at contingency reserves in the next section.)
   Let's revisit the road trip example. You could plan the trip using the original route and
just accept the risk of running into construction. If you get to that point and you're delayed,
you'll just accept it. This is passive acceptance. You could also go ahead and make plans to
take an alternate route but not enact those plans until you actually reach the construction
and know for certain that it is going to impede your progress. This is active acceptance and
might involve developing a contingency plan.

New Convention Center Wing

You work for a small hotel and resort in western Colorado. Your company has taken on a
project to expand the convention center by adding another wing. This wing will add six
more meeting rooms (four of which can be combined into a large room by folding back the
movable walls to accommodate large groups). This is a popular resort, and one of the risks
identified with this project was an increase in demand for conference reservations after
the construction finishes. The marketing team members decide they'll mitigate this risk by
contacting the organizations who've consistently reserved space with them over the past
three years and offer them incentives on their next reservation if they book their conven-
tion before the construction is completed. That way, their most important customers won't
be turned away when the new reservations start pouring in.




Strategies for Positive Risk or Opportunities
Four strategies exist to deal with opportunities or positive risks that might present themselves
on the project: exploit, share, enhance and accept. We already covered accept, so we'll look at
the remaining strategies next.

Exploit
When you exploit a risk event, you're looking for opportunities for positive impacts. This
is the strategy of choice when you've identified positive risks that you want to make certain
will occur on the project. Examples of exploiting a risk include reducing the amount of
time to complete the project by bringing on more qualified resources or by providing even
better quality than originally planned.

Share
The share strategy is similar to transferring because you'll assign the risk to a third-party
owner who is best able to bring about the opportunity the risk event presents. For example,
perhaps what your organization does best is investing. However, it isn't so good at market-
ing. Forming a joint venture with a marketing firm to capitalize on a positive risk will make
the most of the opportunities.

Enhance
The enhance strategy closely watches the probability or impact of the risk event to assure
that the organization realizes the benefits. This entails watching for and emphasizing risk
triggers and identifying the root causes of the risk to help enhance impacts or probability.
268        Chapter 6   n   Risk Planning



Contingency Planning
The last tool and technique of the Plan Risk Responses process is called the contingent
response strategy, better known as contingency planning. Contingency planning involves
planning alternatives to deal with the risks should they occur. This is different from mitiga-
tion planning in that mitigation looks to reduce the probability of the risk and its impact,
whereas contingency planning doesn't necessarily attempt to reduce the probability of a
risk event or its impacts. Contingency planning says the risk might very well occur, and you
better have plans in place to deal with it when it does.
   Contingency comes into play when the risk event occurs. This implies you need to plan
for your contingencies well in advance of the threat occurring. After the risks have been
identified and quantified, contingency plans should be developed and kept at the ready.
   Contingency allowances or reserves are a common contingency response. Contingency
reserves include project funds that are held in reserve to offset any unavoidable threats to proj-
ect scope, schedule, cost, or quality. It also includes reserving time and resources to account
for risks. You should consider stakeholder risk tolerances when determining the amount of
contingency reserves.
   Fallback plans should be developed for risks with high impact or for risks with identified
strategies that might not be the most effective at dealing with the risk.
   In practice, you'll find that identifying, prioritizing, quantifying, and developing responses
for potential threats might happen simultaneously. In any case, you don't want to be taken
by surprise, and that's the point of the risk processes. If you know about potential risks early,
you can often mitigate them or prepare appropriate response plans or contingency plans to
deal with them.


Plan Risk Responses Outputs
As you've no doubt concluded, the purpose of the Plan Risk Responses process is to develop
risk responses for those risks with the highest threat to or best opportunity for the project
objectives. The Plan Risk Responses process has four outputs: risk register updates, risk-related
contract decisions, project management plan updates, and project document updates.


                  Remember that you might need to revisit other Planning processes after
                  performing Plan Risk Responses to modify project plans as a result of risk
                  responses.



Risk Register Updates
Again, the risk register is updated at the end of this process with the information you've dis-
covered during this process. The response plans are recorded in the risk register. You'll recall
that the risk register lists the risk in order of priority (those with the highest potential for
threat or opportunity first), so it makes sense that the response plans you have for these risks
will be more detailed than the remaining lists. Some risks might not require response plans
at all, but you should put them on a watch list and monitor them throughout the project.
                                                Developing a Risk Response Plan            269




   Let's take a look at what the risk register should contain at this point. According to
the PMBOK(R) Guide, after Identify Risks, Perform Qualitative Risk Analysis, and Per-
form Quantitative Risk Analysis are preformed, the following elements should appear in
the risk register:
NN   Prioritized list of identified risks, including their descriptions, what WBS element they
     impact (or area of the project), categories (RBS), root causes, and how the risk impacts
     the project objectives
NN   Risk ranking
NN   Risk owners and their responsibility
NN   Outputs from the Perform Qualitative Analysis
NN   Agreed-upon response strategies
NN   Actions needed to implement response plans
NN   Cost and schedule activities needed to implement risk responses
NN   Contingency plans
NN   Fallback plans
NN   List of residual and secondary risks
NN   Contingency reserves
   The only elements in the preceding list I haven't talked about so far are residual and
secondary risks. A residual risk is a leftover risk, so to speak. After you've implemented a
risk response strategy--say mitigation, for example--some minor risk might still remain.
The contingency reserve is set up to handle situations like this.
   Secondary risks are risks that come about as a result of implementing a risk response.
The example given previously where you transferred risk by hiring a driver to take you to
your destination but the person became ill along the way is an example of a secondary risk.
The driver's illness delayed your arrival time, which is a risk directly caused by hiring the
driver or implementing a risk response. When planning for risk, identify and plan responses
for secondary risks.

Risk-Related Contractual Agreements
If you're planning on using strategies such as transference or sharing, for example, you
might need to purchase services or items from third parties. You can prepare the contracts
for those services now and discuss them with the appropriate parties.
    Risks exist on all projects, and risk planning is an important part of the project Planning
processes. Just the act of identifying risks and planning responses can decrease their impact
if they occur. Don't take the "What I don't know won't hurt me" approach to risk plan-
ning. This is definitely a case where not knowing something can be devastating. Risks that
are easily identified and have planned responses aren't likely to kill projects or your career.
Risks that you should have known about but ignored could end up costing the organiza-
tion thousands or millions of dollars, causing schedule delays, causing loss of competitive
advantage, or ultimately killing the project. There could be a personal cost as well, because
cost and schedule overruns due to poor planning on your part are not easily explained.
270         Chapter 6   n   Risk Planning



Project Management Plan and Project Document Updates
As we've discussed throughout the book, the management plans created that document
how the schedule, budget, quality, procurement, and human resources will be defined,
managed, and controlled on the project become subsidiary plans to the project management
plan. Any and all of these management plans may require updates after you perform the
risk processes. In addition, the WBS, the schedule baseline, and cost performance baseline
may require updates as well.
   Other project documents, such as technical documentation and the assumptions docu-
mented in project scope statement, could need an update after performing these processes
as well.




Project Case Study: New Kitchen Heaven Retail Store

Ricardo knocks on your office door and asks whether you have a few minutes to talk. "Of
course," you reply, and he takes a seat on one of the comfy chairs at the conference table.
You have a feeling this might take a while.

"I think you should know that I'm concerned about the availability of the T1 line. I've
already put in the call to get us on the list because, as I said last week, there's a 30- to
45-day lead time on these orders."

"We're only part way through the Planning processes. Do you need to order the T1 so
soon? We don't even know the store location yet," you say.

"Even though they say lead time is 30 to 45 days, I've waited as long as five or six months
to get a T1 installed in the past. I know we're really pushing for the early February store
opening, so I thought I'd get the ball rolling now. What I need from you is the location
address, and I'll need that pretty quick."

"We're narrowing down the choices between a couple of properties, so I should have that
for you within the next couple of weeks. Is that soon enough?"

"The sooner, the better," Ricardo replies.

"Great. I'm glad you stopped by, Ricardo. I wanted to talk with you about risk anyway, and
you led us right into the discussion. Let me ask you, what probability would you assign to
the T1 line installation happening six months from now?"

"I'd say the probability for six months is low. It's more likely that if there is a delay, it
would be within a three- to four-month time frame."

"If they didn't get to it for six months, would it be a showstopper? In other words, is there
some other way we could transfer Jill's data until the T1 did get installed?"
                                                   Developing a Risk Response Plan               271




"Sure, we could use other methods. Jill won't want to do that for very long, but work-
arounds are available."

"Good. Now, what about the risk for contractor availability and hardware availability and
delivery schedules?" you ask.

You and Ricardo go on to discuss the risks associated with the IT tasks. Later, you ask Jill
and Jake the same kinds of questions and compile a list of risks. In addition, you review
the project information for the Atlanta store opening because it's similar in size and scope
to this store. You add the risks from that store opening to your list as well. You divide
some of the risks into the following categories: IT, Facilities, and Retail. A sample portion
of your list appears as follows, with overall assignments made based on Perform Qualita-
tive Risk Analysis and the probability and impact matrix:

NN    Category: IT
     NN   T1 line availability and installation. Risk score: Low
     NN   Contractor availability for Ethernet installation. Risk score: Medium
     NN   POS and server hardware availability. Risk score: Medium
NN    Category: Facilities
     NN   Desirable location in the right price range. Risk score: High
     NN   Contractor availability for build-out. Risk score: Low
     NN   Availability of fixtures and shelving. Risk score: Low
NN    Category: Retail
     NN   Product availability. Risk score: Medium
     NN   Shipment dates for product. Risk score: Medium

After examining the risks, you decide that response plans should be developed for the
last two items listed under the IT source, the first item under Facilities, and both of the
risks listed under Retail.

Ricardo has already mitigated the T1 connection and installation risk by signing up sev-
eral months ahead of the date when the installation is needed. The contractor availability
can be handled with a contingency plan that specifies a backup contractor should the first
choice not be available. For the POS terminals and hardware, you decide to use the trans-
fer strategy. As part of the contract, you'll require these vendors to deliver on time, and if
they cannot, they'll be required to provide and pay for rental equipment until they can get
your gear delivered.

The Facilities risk and Retail risks will be handled with a combination of acceptance, con-
tingency plans, and mitigation.
272            Chapter 6   n   Risk Planning




You've calculated the expected monetary value for several potential risk events. Two of
them are detailed here.

Desirable location has an expected monetary value of $780,000. The probability of choos-
ing an incorrect or less than desirable location is 60 percent. The potential loss in sales is
the difference between $2.5 million in sales per year that a high-producing store gener-
ates versus $1.2 million in sales per year that an average store generates.

The expected monetary value of the product availability event is $50,000. The probability
of the event occurring is 40 percent. The potential loss in sales is $125,000 for not open-
ing the store in conjunction with the Garden and Home Show.

Understanding How This Applies
to Your Next Project
Risk management and all the processes it involves is not a process I recommend you skip on
any size of project. This is where the Boy Scouts of America motto, "Be Prepared" is wise
advice. If you haven't examined what could be lurking around the corner on your project and
                                                                          Summary            273




come up with a plan to deal with it, then you can be assured you're in for some surprises. Then
again, if you like living on the edge, never knowing what might occur next, you'll probably
find yourself back on the job-hunting scene sooner than you planned (oh, wait, you didn't plan
because you're living on the edge).
   In all seriousness, as with most of the Planning processes I've discussed so far, risk
management should be scaled to match the complexity and size of your project. If you're
working on a small project with a handful of team members and a short timeline, it doesn't
make sense to spend a lot of time on risk planning. However, it does warrant spending
some time identifying project risk, determining impact and probability, and documenting
a plan to deal with the risk.
   My two favorite Identify Risks techniques are brainstorming and the Nominal Group
Technique. Both techniques help you quickly get to the risks with the greatest probability and
impact because, more than likely, these are the first risks that come to mind. Identify Risks
can also help the project team find alternative ways of completing the work of the project.
Further digging and the ideas generated from initial identification might reveal opportunities
or alternatives you wouldn't have thought about during the regular Planning processes.
   After you've identified the risks with the greatest impact to the project, document response
plans that are appropriate for the risk. Small projects might have only one or two risks that
need a response plan. The plans might consist of only a sentence or two, depending on the
size of the project. I would question a project where no risks require a response plan. If it
seems too good to be true, it probably is.
   The avoid, transfer, and mitigate strategies are the most often used strategies to deal
with risk, along with contingency planning. Of these, mitigation and contingency planning
are probably the most common. Mitigation generally recognizes that the risk will likely
occur and attempts to reduce the impact.
   I have used brainstorming and the Nominal Group Technique to strategize response
plans for risks on small projects. When you're working on a small project, you can typically
identify, quantify, and create response plans for risks at one meeting.
   Identifying positive risk, in my experience, is fairly rare. Typically, when my teams
perform Identify Risks, it's to determine what can go wrong and how bad the impact will
be if it does. The two most important concepts from this chapter that you should apply
to your next project are that you and your team should identify risks and create response
plans to deal with the most significant ones.



Summary
Congratulations! You've completed another fun-filled, action-packed chapter, and all of it on
a single topic--risk. Risk is inherent in all projects, and risks pose both threats and opportu-
nities to the project. Understanding the risks facing the project better equips you to determine
the appropriate strategies to deal with those risks and helps you determine the response plans
for the risks (and the level of effort you should put into preparing those plans).
274       Chapter 6   n   Risk Planning



    The Plan Risk Management process determines how you will plan for risks on your
project. Its only output is the risk management plan, which details how you'll define, mon-
itor, and control risks throughout the project. The risk management plan is a subsidiary of
the project management plan.
    The Identify Risks process seeks to identify and document the project risks using
information-gathering techniques like brainstorming, the Nominal Group technique
the Delphi technique, interviewing, and root cause identification. This list of risks gets
recorded in the risk register, the only output of this process.
    Perform Qualitative Risk Analysis and Perform Quantitative Risk Analysis involve
evaluating risks and assigning probability and impact values to the risks. Many tools and
techniques are used during these processes, including risk probability and impact, probabil-
ity and impact matrix, interviewing, probability distributions, expert judgment, sensitivity
analysis, decision tree analysis, and simulation.
    A probability and impact matrix uses the probability multiplied by the impact value to
determine the risk score. The threshold of risk based on high, medium, and low tolerances
is determined by comparing the risk score based on the probability level to the probability
and impact matrix.
    Monte Carlo simulation is a technique used to quantify schedule or cost risks. Decision
trees graphically display decisions and their various choices and outcomes and is typically
used in combination with earned monetary value.
    The Plan Risk Responses process is the last Planning process and culminates with an
update to the risk register documenting the risk response plans. The risk response plans
detail the strategies you'll use to respond to risk and assign individuals to manage each
risk response. Risk response strategies for negative risks include avoidance, mitigation, and
transference. Risk strategies for positive risks include exploit, share, and enhance. Accep-
tance is a strategy for both negative and positive risks.
    Contingency planning involves planning alternatives to deal with risk events should they
occur. Contingency reserves are set aside to deal with risks associated with cost and time
according to the stakeholder tolerance levels.



Exam Essentials
Be able to define the purpose of the risk management plan. The risk management plan
describes how you will define, monitor, and control risks throughout the project. It details
how risk management processes (including Identify Risks, Perform Qualitative Risk Analy-
sis, Perform Quantitative Risk Analysis, Plan Risk Responses, and Monitor and Control
Risks) will be implemented, monitored, and controlled throughout the life of the project. It
describes how you will manage risks but does not attempt to define responses to individual
risks. The risk management plan is a subsidiary of the project management plan, and it's
the only output of the Plan Risk Management process.
                                                                     Exam Essentials             275




Be able to name the purpose of Identify Risks. The purpose of the Identify Risks process
is to identify all risks that might impact the project, document them, and identify their
characteristics.
Be able to define the purpose of Perform Qualitative Risk Analysis. Perform Qualitative
Risk Analysis determines the impact the identified risks will have on the project and the
probability they'll occur, and it puts the risks in priority order according to their effects on
the project objectives.
Be able to define the purpose of Perform Quantitative Risk Analysis. Perform Quantitative
Risk Analysis evaluates the impacts of risk prioritized during the Perform Qualitative Risk
Analysis process and quantifies risk exposure for the project by assigning numeric probabili-
ties to each risk and their impacts on project objectives.
Be able to define the purpose of the Plan Risk Responses process. Plan Risk Responses is
the process where risk response plans are developed using strategies such as avoid, transfer,
mitigate, accept, exploit, share, enhance, develop contingent response strategies, and apply
expert judgment. The risk response plan describes the actions to take should the identified
risks occur. It should include all the identified risks, a description of the risks, how they'll
impact the project objectives, and the people assigned to manage the risk responses.
Be able to define the risk register and some of its primary elements. The risk register is an
output of the Identify Risks process, and updates to the risk register occur as an output of
every risk process that follows this one. By the end of the Plan Risk Responses process, the
risk register contains these primary elements: identified list of risks, risk owners, risk triggers,
risk strategies, contingency plans, and contingency reserves.

15. You work for a large manufacturing plant. You are working on a new project to release an
    overseas product line. This is the company's first experience in the overseas market, and it
    wants to make a big splash with the introduction of this product. The stakeholders are a
    bit nervous about the project and historically proceed cautiously and take a considerable
    amount of time to examine information before making a final decision. The project entails
    producing your product in a concentrated formula and packaging it in smaller containers
    than the U.S. product uses. A new machine is needed in order to mix the ingredients into a

Answers to Review Questions
1.    B. The cause-and-effect flowcharts--also called fishbone diagrams or Ishikawa diagrams--
      show the relationship between the causes and effects of problems.

2.    C. The purpose of Perform Qualitative Risk Analysis is to determine what impact the iden-
      tified risk events will have on the project and the probability they'll occur. It also puts risks
      in priority order according to their effects on the project objectives and assigns a risk score
      for the project.

3.    B. The risk management plan details how risk management processes will be implemented,
      monitored, and controlled throughout the life of the project. The risk management plan
      does not include responses to risks or triggers. Responses to risks are documented in the
      risk register as part of the Plan Risk Responses process.

4.    C. Distributions graphically display the probability of risk to the project objectives as well
      as the time or cost elements.

5.    D. The information-gathering techniques in the Identify Risks process are brainstorming,
      the Delphi technique, interviewing, and root cause analysis.

6.    C. Perform Quantitative Risk Analysis analyzes the probability of risks and their conse-
      quences using a numerical rating. Perform Qualitative Risk Analysis might use numeric rat-
      ings but can use a high-medium-low scale as well.

7.    C. Probability of achieving time and cost estimates is an update that is produced from the
      Perform Quantitative Risk Analysis process.

8.    B. This risk event has the potential to save money on project costs, so it's an opportunity,
      and the appropriate strategy to use in this case is the exploit strategy.

9.    D. This risk event has the potential to save money on project costs. Sharing involves using a
      third party to help assure that the opportunity take place.

10. A. The best answer is A. Triggers are warning signs of an impending risk event.

11. C. The probability and impact matrix multiplies the probability and impact to determine
    a risk score. Using this score and a predetermined matrix, you determine if the scores is a
    high, medium, or low designation.

12. B. Monte Carlo analysis is a simulation technique that computes project costs many times
    in an iterative fashion.

13. C. Mitigation attempts to reduce the impact of a risk event should it occur. Making plans
    to arrange for the leased equipment reduces the consequences of the risk.

14. A. Assumptions analysis is a tool and technique of the Identify Risks process.
                                                      Answers to Review Questions                283



15. A. This question describes risk tolerance levels of the stakeholders. Risk triggers are recorded
    in the risk register during the Plan Risk Responses process. The risk of buying a machine
    from a new supplier would pose a threat to the project, not an opportunity. Interviewing
    might have been used, but this question wasn't describing the Identify Risks process.

16. B. The question describes sensitivity analysis, which is a tool and technique of the Perform
    Quantitative Risk Analysis process. Tornado diagrams are often used to display sensitivity
    analysis data.

17. B. Decision tree diagrams are used during the Perform Quantitative Risk Analysis process.
    All the other options are diagramming techniques used in the Identify Risks process.

18. D. The RBS describes risk categories, and the lowest level can be used as a checklist to help
    identify risks. Risk owners are not assigned from the RBS but typically are assigned as soon
    as the risk is identified.

19. D. This is a response strategy known as passive acceptance because the team has decided
    to take no action and make no plans for the risk. This is a strategy that can be used for
    either positive or negative risks.

20. C. Perform Qualitative Risk Analysis is a fast and easy method of determining probability
    and impact.

                              We're closing in on finishing up the Planning group pro-
                              cesses. We're at a place where we need to talk about some
                              processes that aren't necessarily related to each other but
need to be completed before you can construct the project schedule and budget. So, we'll
start out this chapter by discussing resources.
   All projects require resources. Some may require materials or goods, but all projects
require human resources to perform the activities to bring them to completion. We'll discuss
the Plan Procurements process, which deals with the goods and services procurements and
then move on to Develop Human Resource Plan, where you will develop the staffing manage-
ment plan. This plan will help guide you later on in acquiring your project team members in
the Executing process.
   We'll wrap up the chapter with the Plan Quality process. This process focuses on
determining the quality standards that are necessary for the project and on documenting
how you'll go about meeting them. Let's get going.



Procurement Planning
Plan Procurements is a process of identifying what goods or services you're going to purchase
from outside the organization and which needs the project team can meet. Part of what you'll
accomplish in this process is determining whether you should purchase the goods or services
and, if so, how much and when. Keep in mind that I'm discussing the procurement from the
buyer's perspective, because this is the approach used in the PMBOK(R) Guide.
   The Plan Procurements process can influence the project schedule, and the project schedule
can influence this process. For example, the availability of a contractor or special-order mate-
rials might have a significant impact on the schedule. And conversely, your organization's
business cycle might have an impact on the Plan Procurements process if the organization is
dependent on seasonal activity. The Estimate Activity Resources process can also be influ-
enced by this process, as will make-or-buy decisions (I'll get to those shortly).


                  You need to perform each process in the Project Procurement Management
                  Knowledge Area (beginning with Plan Procurements and ending with Close
                  Procurements) for each product or service that you're buying outside the
                  organization. If you're procuring all your resources from within the organi-
                  zation, the only process you'll perform in this Knowledge Area is the Plan
                  Procurements process.
                                                            Procurement Planning            287




   Sometimes, you'll procure all the materials and resources for your project from a vendor.
In cases like these, the vendor will have a project manager assigned to the project. Your
organization might choose to have an internal project manager assigned as well to act as
the conduit between your company and the vendor and to provide information and monitor
your organization's deliverables. When this happens, the vendor or contracting company is
responsible for fulfilling all the project management processes as part of the contract. In the
case of an outsourced project, the seller--also known as the vendor, supplier, or contractor--
manages the project and the buyer becomes the stakeholder. If you're hiring a vendor, don't
forget to consider permits or professional licenses that might be required for the type of work
you need them to perform.
   Several inputs are needed when planning for purchases. You'll look at them next.


Plan Procurements Inputs
The Plan Procurements process has eleven inputs:
NN   Scope baseline
NN   Requirements documentation
NN   Teaming agreements
NN   Risk register
NN   Risk-related contract decisions
NN   Activity resource requirements
NN   Project schedule
NN   Activity cost estimates
NN   Cost performance baseline
NN   Enterprise environmental factors
NN   Organizational process assets
    The scope baseline includes the project scope statement that describes the need for the
project and lists the deliverables and the acceptance criteria for the product or service of the
project. Obviously, you'll want to consider these when thinking about procuring goods and
services. You'll also want to consider the constraints (issues such as availability and timing
of funds, availability of resources, delivery dates, and vendor availability) and assumptions
(issues such as reliability of the vendor, assuming availability of key resources, and adequate
stakeholder involvement). The product scope description is included in the project scope
statement as well and might alert you to special considerations (services, technical require-
ments, and skills) needed to produce the product of the project.
    As part of the scope baseline, the WBS and WBS dictionary identify the deliverables and
describe the work required for each element of the WBS.
    Teaming agreements are contractual agreements between multiple parties that are forming
a partnership or joint venture to work on the project. Teaming agreements are often used when
two or more vendors form a partnership to work together on a particular project. If teaming
288        Chapter 7   n   Planning Project Resources



agreements are used on the project, typically the scope of work, requirements for competition,
buyer and seller roles, and other important project concerns should be predefined.



Exam Spotlight

According to the PMBOK(R) Guide, when teaming agreements are in force on a project,
the planning processes are significantly impacted. For example, the teaming agreement
predefines the scope of work, and that means that elements like the requirements and the
deliverables may change the completion dates, thus impacting the project schedule, or
they may impact the project budget, quality, human resources availability, procurement
decisions, and so on.



   The risk register and risk-related contract decisions will guide you in determining the
types of services or goods needed for risk management. For example, the transference
strategy might require the purchase of insurance. You should review each of these elements
when determining which goods and services will be performed within the project and
which will be purchased.
   Marketplace conditions are the key element of enterprise environmental factors you
should consider for this process. The organization's guidelines and organizational policies
(including any procurement policies) are the elements of the organizational process assets
you should pay attention to here.


                 Many organizations have procurement departments that are responsible
                 for procuring goods and services and writing and managing contracts.
                 Some organizations also require that all contracts be reviewed by their
                 legal department prior to signing. These are organizational process assets
                 that you should consider when you need to procure goods and services.

   It's important for the project manager to understand organizational policies because
they might impact many of the Planning processes, including the Procurement Planning
processes. For example, the organization might have purchasing approval processes that
must be followed. Perhaps orders for goods or services that exceed certain dollar amounts
need different levels of approval. As the project manager, you need to be aware of policies
like this so you're certain you can execute the project smoothly. It's frustrating to find out
later that you should have followed a certain process or policy and now, because you didn't,
you've got schedule delays or worse. You could consider using the "Sin now, ask forgiveness
later" technique in extreme emergencies, but you didn't hear that from me. (By the way,
that's not a technique that's authorized by the PMBOK(R) Guide.)
   The project manager and the project team will be responsible for coordinating all the
organizational interfaces for the project, including technical, human resources, purchasing,
                                                           Procurement Planning             289




and finance. It will serve you well to understand the policies and politics involved in each of
these areas in your organization.


                 My organization is steeped in policy. (A government organization steeped
                 in policy? Go figure!) It's so steeped in policy that we have to request the
                 funds for large projects at least two years in advance. There are mounds
                 and mounds of request forms, justification forms, approval forms, routing
                 forms--you get the idea. But my point is if you miss one of the forms or
                 don't fill out the information correctly, you can set your project back by a
                 minimum of a year, if not two. Then once the money is awarded, there are
                 more forms to fill out and policies to follow. Again, if you don't follow the
                 policies correctly, you can jeopardize future project funds. Many organiza-
                 tions have a practice of not giving you all the project money up front in one
                 lump sum. In other words, you must meet major milestones or complete a
                 project phase before they'll fund your next phase. Know what your organi-
                 zational policies are well ahead of time. Talk to the people who can walk you
                 through the process and ask them to check your work to avoid surprises.




Tools and Techniques for Plan Procurements
The Plan Procurements process consists of three tools and techniques. They are make-or-
buy analysis, expert judgment, and contract types. I've already covered expert judgment, so
you'll look at make-or-buy analysis next, and then I'll cover contract types.

Make-or-Buy Analysis
The main decision you're trying to get to in make-or-buy analysis is whether it's more cost
effective to buy the products and services or more cost effective for the organization to pro-
duce the goods and services needed for the project. Costs should include both direct costs
(in other words, the actual cost to purchase the product or service) and indirect costs, such
as the salary of the manager overseeing the purchase process or ongoing maintenance costs.
Costs don't necessarily mean the cost to purchase. In make-or-buy analysis, you might weigh
the cost of leasing items versus the cost of buying them. For example, perhaps your project
requires using a specialized piece of hardware that you know will be outdated by the end of
the project. In a case like this, leasing might be a better option so that when the project is
ready to be implemented, a newer version of the hardware can be tested and put into produc-
tion during rollout.
   Other considerations in make-or-buy analysis might include elements such as capacity
issues, skills, availability, and trade secrets. Strict control might be needed for a certain
process and thus the process cannot be outsourced. Perhaps your organization has the skills
in-house to complete the project but your current project list is so backlogged that you can't
get to the new project for months, so you need to bring in a vendor.
290         Chapter 7   n   Planning Project Resources



   Make-or-buy analysis is considered a general management technique and concludes with
the decision to do one or the other.

Contract Types
A contract is a compulsory agreement between two or more parties and is used to acquire
products or services from outside the organization. Typically, money is exchanged for the
goods or services. Contracts are enforceable by law and require an offer and an acceptance.
   There are different types of contracts for different purposes. The PMBOK(R) Guide divides
contracts into three categories:
NN    Fixed price or lump sum
NN    Cost reimbursable
NN    Time and materials (T&M)
   Within the fixed-price and cost-reimbursable categories are different types of contracts.
You'll look at each in the following sections. Keep in mind that several factors will impact
the type of contract you should use. The product requirements (or service criteria) might
drive the contract type. The market conditions might drive availability and price--remember
back in the dot-com era when trying to hire anyone with programming skills was next to
impossible? And the amount of risk--for the seller, the buyer, and the project itself--will
help determine contract type.



Exam Spotlight

There could always be an exam question or two regarding contract types, so spend some
time getting familiar with them.




Fixed-Price or Lump-Sum Contracts
Fixed-price contracts (also referred to as lump-sum contracts) can either set a specific, firm
price for the goods or services rendered (known as a firm fixed-price contract, or FFP) or
include incentives for meeting or exceeding certain contract deliverables.
   Fixed-price contracts can be disastrous for both the buyer and the seller if the scope
of the project is not well defined or the scope changes dramatically. It's important to have
accurate, well-defined deliverables when you're using this type of contract. Conversely,
fixed-price contracts are relatively safe for both buyer and seller when the original scope is
well defined and remains unchanged. They typically reap only small profits for the seller
and force the contractor to work productively and efficiently. This type of contract also
minimizes cost and quality uncertainty. There are three types of fixed-price contracts you
should know for the exam:
Firm Fixed-Price (FFP) In the FFP contract, the buyer and seller agree on a well-defined
deliverable for a set price. In this kind of contract, the biggest risk is borne by the seller.
                                                             Procurement Planning             291




The seller--or contractor--must take great strides to assure they've covered their costs and
will make a comfortable profit on the transaction. The seller assumes the risks of increasing
costs, nonperformance, or other problems. However, to counter these unforeseen risks, the
seller builds in the cost of the risk to the contract price.
Fixed-Price Plus Incentive (FPIF) Fixed-price plus incentive (FPIF) contracts are another
type of fixed-price contract. The difference here is that the contract includes an incentive--
or bonus--for early completion or for some other agreed-upon performance criterion that
meets or exceeds contract specifications. The criteria for early completion, or other perfor-
mance enhancements, are typically related to cost, schedule, or technical performance and
must be spelled out in the contract so both parties understand the terms and conditions.
Another aspect of fixed-price plus incentive contracts to consider is that some of the risk is
borne by the buyer, unlike the firm fixed-price contract where most of the risk is borne by the
seller. The buyer takes some risk, albeit minimal, by offering the incentive to, for example, get
the work done earlier. Suppose the buyer really would like the product delivered 30 days prior
to when the seller thinks they can deliver. In this case, the buyer assumes the risk for the early
delivery via the incentive.
Fixed-Price with Economic Price Adjustment (FP-EPA) There's one more type of fixed-price
contract, known as a fixed-price with economic price adjustment contract (FP-EPA). This
contract allows for adjustments due to changes in economic conditions like cost increases
or decreases, inflation, and so on. These contracts are typically used when the project spans
many years. This type of contract protects both the buyer and seller from economic condi-
tions that are outside of their control.



Exam Spotlight

The economic adjustment section of an FP-EPA contract should be tied to a known
financial index.




Cost-Reimbursable Contracts
Cost-reimbursable contracts are as the name implies. The allowable costs--allowable is
defined by the contract--associated with producing the goods or services are charged to
the buyer. All the costs the seller takes on during the project are charged back to the buyer;
thus, the seller is reimbursed.
   Cost-reimbursable contracts carry the highest risk to the buyer because the total costs
are uncertain. As problems arise, the buyer has to shell out even more money to correct
the problems. However, the advantage to the buyer with this type of contract is that scope
changes are easy to make and can be made as often as you want--but it will cost you.
   Cost-reimbursable contracts have a lot of uncertainty associated with them. The con-
tractor has little incentive to work efficiently or be productive. This type of contract pro-
tects the contractor's profit because increasing costs are passed to the buyer rather than
292        Chapter 7   n   Planning Project Resources



taken out of profits, as would be the case with a fixed-price contract. Be certain to audit
your statements when using a contract like this so that charges from some other project the
vendor is working on don't accidentally end up on your bill.
   Cost-reimbursable contracts are used most often when the project scope contains a lot
of uncertainty, such as for cutting-edge projects and research and development. They are
also used for projects that have large investments early in the project life. We'll look at four
types of cost-reimbursable contracts:
Cost plus fixed fee (CPFF) Cost plus fixed fee (CPFF) contracts charge back all allowable
project costs to the seller and include a fixed fee upon completion of the contract. This is
how the seller makes money on the deal; the fixed fee portion is the seller's profit. The fee
is always firm in this kind of contract, but the costs are variable. The seller doesn't neces-
sarily have a lot of motivation to control costs with this type of contract, as you can imag-
ine. And one of the strongest motivators for completing the project is driven by the fixed
fee portion of the contract.
Cost plus incentive fee (CPIF) The next category of cost-reimbursable contract is cost plus
incentive fee (CPIF). This is the type of contract in which the buyer reimburses the seller for
the seller's allowable costs and includes an incentive for meeting or exceeding the performance
criteria laid out in the contract. An incentive fee actually encourages better cost performance
by the seller, and there is a possibility of shared savings between the seller and buyer if per-
formance criteria are exceeded. The qualification for exceeded performance must be written
into the contract and agreed to by both parties, as should the definition of allowable costs; the
seller can possibly lose the incentive fee if agreed-upon targets are not reached.
There is moderate risk for the buyer under the cost plus incentive fee contract, and if
well written, it can be more beneficial for both the seller and then buyer than a cost-
reimbursable contract.
Cost plus percentage of cost (CPPC) In the cost plus percentage of cost (CPPC), the seller
is reimbursed for allowable costs plus a fee that's calculated as a percentage of the costs.
The percentage is agreed upon beforehand and documented in the contract. Since the fee
is based on costs, the fee is variable. The lower the costs, the lower the fee, so the seller
doesn't have a lot of motivation to keep costs low.
Cost plus award fee (CPAF) This is the riskiest of the cost plus contracts for the seller. In
this contract, the seller will recoup all the costs expended during the project but the award
fee portion is subject to the sole discretion of the buyer. The performance criteria for earning
the award is spelled out in the contract, but these criteria can be subjective and the awards
are not usually contestable.

Time and Materials (T&M) Contracts
Time and materials (T&M) contracts are a cross between fixed-price and cost-reimbursable
contracts. The full amount of the material costs is not known at the time the contract is
awarded. This resembles a cost-reimbursable contract because the costs will continue to grow
during the contract's life and are reimbursable to the contractor. The buyer bears the biggest
risk in this type of contract.
                                                          Procurement Planning            293




   T&M contracts can resemble fixed-price contracts when unit rates are used, for
example. Unit rates might be used to preset the rates of certain elements or portions of the
project. For example, a contracting agency might charge you $135 per hour for a .NET
programmer, or a leasing company might charge you $2,000 per month for the hardware
you're leasing during the testing phase of your project. These rates are preset and agreed
upon by the buyer and seller ahead of time. T&M contracts are most often used when you
need human resources with specific skills and when you can quickly and precisely define
the scope of work needed for the project.



Exam Spotlight

Understand the difference between fixed-price, cost-reimbursable, and time and materi-
als contracts for the exam. Also know when each type of contract should be used, and
know which party bears the most risk under each type of contract.




Plan Procurements Outputs
The Plan Procurements process consists of six outputs. The first is the procurement
management plan. You've seen a few of the other management plan outputs, so you're
probably already ahead of me on this one. But hold the phone--I'll make sure to touch
on the important points. The other outputs are the procurement statements of work,
make-or-buy decisions, procurement documents, source selection criteria, and change
requests.

Procurement Management Plan
The procurement management plan details how the procurement process will be managed.
According to the PMBOK(R) Guide, it includes the following information:
NN   The types of contract to use
NN   The authority of the project team
NN   How the procurement process will be integrated with other project processes
NN   Where to find standard procurement documents (provided your organization uses
     standard documents)
NN   How many vendors or contractors are involved and how they'll be managed
NN   How the procurement process will be coordinated with other project processes, such as
     performance reporting and scheduling
NN   How the constraints and assumptions might be impacted by purchasing
NN   How multiple vendors or contractors will be managed
NN   The coordination of purchasing lead times with the development of the project schedule
294         Chapter 7   n   Planning Project Resources



NN    The schedule dates that are determined in each contract
NN    Identification of prequalified sellers (if known)
NN    Risk management issues
NN    Procurement metrics for managing contracts and for evaluating sellers
   The procurement management plan, like all the other management plans, becomes a
subsidiary of the project management plan.




Streamlining Purchases

Russ is a project manager for a real estate development company in Hometown, USA.
Recently he transferred to the office headquarters to develop a process for streamlining
purchases and purchase requests for the construction teams in the field. His first step
was to develop a procurement management plan for the construction managers to use
when ordering materials and equipment. Russ decided the procurement management
plan could be used as a template for all new projects. That meant the project managers
in the field didn't have to write their own procurement management plan when starting
a new construction project. They could use the template, which had many of the fields
prepopulated with corporate headquarters processes, and then they could fill in the infor-
mation specific to their project. For example, the Types of Contracts section states that all
equipment and materials purchases require fixed-price contracts. When human resources
are needed for the project on a contract basis, a T&M contract should be used with the
unit rates stated in the contract. A "not to exceed" amount should also be written into the
contract so that there are no surprises as to the total amount of dollars the company will
be charged for the resources.




Procurement Statements of Work
A procurement statement of work (SOW) contains the details of the procurement item in
clear, concise terms. It includes the following elements:
NN    The project objectives
NN    A description of the work of the project and any postproject operational support needed
NN    Concise specifications of the product or services required
NN    The project schedule, time period of services, and work location
   The procurement SOW might be prepared by either the buyer or the seller. Buyers might
prepare the SOW and give it to the sellers, who in turn rewrite it so that they can price the
work properly. If the buyer does not know how to prepare a SOW or the seller would be better
at creating the SOW because of their expertise about the product or service, the seller might
                                                            Procurement Planning            295




prepare it and then give it to the buyer to review. In either case, the procurement statement of
work is developed from the project scope statement and the WBS and WBS dictionary.
   The seller uses the SOW to determine whether they are able to produce the goods or
services as specified. In addition, it wouldn't hurt to include a copy of the WBS with the
SOW. Any information the seller can use to properly price the goods or services helps both
sides understand what's needed and how it will be provided.
   Projects might require some or all of the work of the project to be provided by a vendor.
The Plan Procurements process determines whether goods or services should be produced
within the organization or procured from outside, and if goods or services are procured
from outside, it describes what will be outsourced and what kind of contract to use and then
documents the information in the SOW and procurement management plan. The SOW will
undergo progressive elaboration as you proceed through the procurement processes. There
will likely be several iterations of the SOW before you get to the actual contract award.


                  You prepared a SOW during the Develop Project Charter process. You can
                  use that SOW as the procurement SOW during this process if you're contract-
                  ing out the entire project. Otherwise, you can use just those portions of the
                  SOW that describe the work you've contracted.



Make-or-Buy Decisions
The make-or-buy decision is a document that outlines the decisions made during the process
regarding which goods and/or services will be produced by the organization and which will
be purchased. This can include any number of items, including services, products, insurance
policies, performance, and performance bonds.

Procurement Documents
Procurement documents are used to solicit vendors and suppliers to bid on your procurement
needs. You're probably familiar with some of the titles of procurement documents. They might
be called request for proposal (RFP), request for information (RFI), invitation for bid (IFB),
request for quotation (RFQ), and so on.
   Procurement documents should clearly state the description of the work requested, they
should include the contract SOW, and they should explain how sellers should format and
submit their responses. These documents are prepared by the buyer to assure as accurate
and complete a response as possible from all potential bidders. Any special provisions or
contractual needs should be spelled out as well. For example, many organizations have data
concerning their marketing policies, new product introductions planned for the next few
years, trade secrets, and so on. The vendor will have access to this private information, and
in order to ensure that they maintain confidentiality, you should require that they sign a
nondisclosure agreement.
   A few terms that you should understand are used during this process; they are usually
used interchangeably even though they have distinct definitions. When your decision is going
to be made primarily on price, the terms bid and quotation are used, as in IFB or RFQ.
296          Chapter 7   n   Planning Project Resources



When considerations other than price (such as technology or specific approaches to the proj-
ect) are the deciding factor, the term proposal is used, as in RFP. These terms are used inter-
changeably in practice, even though they have specific meanings in the PMBOK(R) Guide.


                  In my organization, all solicitation requests are submitted as RFPs, even
                  though our primary decision factor is price.




Exam Spotlight

Understand the difference between bid and/or quotation and proposal for the exam. Bids
or quotations are used when price is the only deciding factor among bidders. Proposals
are used when there are considerations other than price.



  Procurement documents are posted or advertised according to your organizational policies.
This might include ads in newspapers and magazines or ads/posts on the Internet.

Source Selection Criteria
The term source selection criteria refers to the method your organization will use to choose
a vendor from among the proposals you receive. The criteria might be subjective or objec-
tive. In some cases, price might be the only criteria, and that means the vendor that submits
the lowest bid will win the contract. You should use purchase price (which should include
costs associated with purchase price, such as delivery and setup charges) as the sole criteria
only when you have multiple qualified sellers from which to choose.
   Other projects might require more extensive criteria than price alone. In this case, you
might use scoring models as well as rating models, or you might utilize purely subjective meth-
ods of selection. I described an example weighted-scoring method in Chapter 2, "Creating the
Project Charter." You can use this method to score vendor proposals.
   Sometimes, the source selection criteria are made public in the procurement process so that
vendors know exactly what you want in a vendor. This approach has pros and cons. If the
organization typically makes known the source selection criteria, you'll find that almost all the
vendors that bid on the project meet every criteria you've outlined (in writing, that is). When it
comes time to perform the contract, however, you might encounter some surprises. The vendor
might have done a great job of writing the bid based on your criteria, but in reality they don't
know how to put the criteria into practice. On the other hand, having all the criteria publicly
known beforehand gives ground to great discussion points and discovery later in the procure-
ment processes.
   The following list includes some of the criteria you can consider using for evaluating
proposals and bids:
NN    Comprehension and understanding of the needs of the project as documented in the
      contract SOW
NN    Cost
                                                              Procurement Planning                  297



NN   Technical ability of vendor and its proposed team
NN   Technical approach
NN   Risk
NN   Experience on projects of similar size and scope, including references
NN   Project management approach
NN   Management approach
NN   Financial stability and capacity
NN   Production capacity
NN   Reputation, references, and past performance
NN   Intellectual and proprietary rights
  You could include many of these in a weighted scoring model and rate each vendor on
how well they responded to these issues.




The Customer Relationship Management System Response

Ryan Hunter is preparing the source selection criteria for an RFP for a customer relationship
management (CRM) software system. After meeting with key stakeholders and other proj-
ect managers in the company who've had experience working on projects of this size and
scope, he devised the first draft of the source selection criteria. A partial list is as follows:

NN   Successful bidder's response must detail how business processes (as documented in
     the RFP page 24) will be addressed with their solution.
NN   Successful bidder must document their project management approach, which must
     follow the PMBOK(R) Guide project practices. They must provide an example project
     management plan based on a previous project experience of similar size and scope
     to the one documented in the RFP.
NN   Successful bidder must document previous successful implementations, including
     integration with existing organization's PBX and network operating system, and must
     provide references.
NN   Successful bidder must provide financial statements for the previous three years.




Change Requests
As you perform the Plan Procurements process, the project management plan, including its
subsidiary plans, may require changes due to vendor availability, vendor capability, or the
vendor's proposed solution as well as cost and quality considerations. Change requests must
298        Chapter 7   n   Planning Project Resources



be processed through the Perform Integrated Change Control process that we'll discuss in
Chapter 10, "Measuring and Controlling Project Performance."
   Now we'll switch our focus to the human resource needs for the project and discuss the
Develop Human Resource Plan process next.



Developing the Human Resource Plan
All projects require human resources, from the smallest project to the largest. The Develop
Human Resource Plan process documents the roles and responsibilities of individuals or
groups for various project elements and then documents the reporting relationships for each.
Reporting relationships can be assigned to groups as well as to individuals, and the groups
or individuals might be internal or external to the organization or a combination of both.
Plan Communications goes hand in hand with Develop Human Resource Plan because the
organizational structure affects the way communications are carried out among project par-
ticipants and the project interfaces.
    When developing the human resource plan, the only output of this process, you'll have
to consider factors such as the availability of resources, skill levels, training needs, and
more. Each of these factors can have an impact on the project cost, schedule, and quality
and may introduce risks not previously considered.


Develop Human Resource Plan Inputs
Develop Human Resource Plan has three inputs: activity resource requirements, enterprise
environmental factors, and organizational process assets. We'll look at the key elements of
each of these next.

Activity Resource Requirements
Human resources are needed to perform and complete the activities outlined in the activity
resource requirement output of the Estimate Activity Resources process. During the Develop
Human Resource Plan process, you'll define those resource needs in further detail.

Key Environmental Factors
Enterprise environmental factors play a key role in determining human resource roles and
responsibilities. The type of organization you work in, the reporting relationships, and the
technical skills needed to complete the project work are a few of the factors you should con-
sider when developing the staffing management plan. Here is a list of some of the factors you
should consider during this process:
Organizational factors Consider what departments or organization units will have a role
in the project, the interactions between and among departments, organizational culture,
and the level of formality among these working relationships.
                                            Developing the Human Resource Plan                299




Existing human resources and marketplace conditions The existing base of human
resources that are employed, or available to, the organization should be considered when
developing the human resource plan. Marketplace conditions will dictate the availability
of resources you're acquiring outside the organization and their going rate.
Personnel policies Make certain you have an understanding of the personnel policies
in the organization regarding hiring, firing, and tasking employees. Other considerations
include holiday schedules, leave time policies, and so on.
Technical factors Consider the types of specialized skills needed to complete the work
of the project (for example, programming languages, engineering skills, knowledge of
pharmaceuticals) and any technical considerations during handoff from phase to phase
or from project completion to production.
Interpersonal factors Interpersonal factors have to do with potential project team members.
You should consider their experience, skills, current reporting relationships, cultural consider-
ations, and perceptions regarding their levels of trust and respect for co-workers and superiors.
Location and logistics Consider where the project team is physically located and whether
they are all located together or at separate facilities (or cities or countries).
Political factors Political factors involve your stakeholders. Consider the amount of influ-
ence the stakeholders have, their interactions and influence with each other, and the power
they can exert over the project.
   In addition to these factors, you should also consider constraints that pertain to project
teams, including the following:
Organizational structures Organizational structures can be constraints. For example, a
strong matrix organization provides the project manager with much more authority and
power than the weak matrix organization does. Functional organizations typically do not
empower their project managers with the proper authority to carry out a project. If you
work in a functional organization as I do, it's important to be aware that you'll likely face
power struggles with other managers and, in some cases, a flat-out lack of cooperation.
Don't tell them I said this, but functional managers tend to be territorial and aren't likely
to give up control easily. The best advice I have for you in this case is as follows:
    NN   Establish open communications early in the project.
    NN   Include all the functional managers with key roles in important decisions.
    NN   Get the support of your project sponsor to empower you (as the project manager)
         with as much authority as possible. It's important that the sponsor makes it clear
         to the other managers that their cooperation on project activities is expected.
Collective bargaining agreements Collective bargaining agreements are actually contractual
obligations of the organization to the employees. Collective bargaining is typically associated
with unions and organized employee associations. Other organized employee associations or
groups might require specialized reporting relationships as well--especially if they involve con-
tractual obligations. You will not likely be involved in the negotiations of collective bargaining
300        Chapter 7   n   Planning Project Resources



agreements, but if you have an opportunity to voice opinions regarding employee duties or
agreements that would be helpful to your project or future projects, by all means take it.
Economic conditions These conditions refer to the availability of funds for the project
team to perform training, hire staff, and travel. If funds are severely limited and your project
requires frequent trips to other locations, you have an economic constraint on your hands.



Exam Spotlight

For the exam, understand the key environmental factors (organizational factors, existing
human resources and market conditions, personnel policies, technical factors, interper-
sonal, location and logistics, and political factors) and the three constraints (organizational
structures, collective bargaining agreements, and economic conditions) that can impact the
Develop Human Resource Plan process.




Organizational Process Assets
You should consider three primary elements of the organizational process assets input
during this process. They are organizational processes and standardized role descriptions,
templates and checklists, and historical information.
   The term templates, in this case, refers to documentation such as project descriptions,
organizational charts, performance appraisals, and the organization's conflict management
process. Checklists might include elements such as training requirements, project roles and
responsibilities, skills and competency levels, and safety issues.



Exam Spotlight

Using templates and checklists is one way to ensure that you don't miss any key respon-
sibilities when planning the project and will help reduce the amount of time spent on
project planning.




Develop Human Resource Plan Tools and Techniques
The Develop Human Resource Plan process consists of three tools and techniques. Remem-
ber that your goal is to produce the human resource plan output of this process that includes
a description of the team's roles and responsibilities, organizational charts, and a staffing
management plan. You'll see that the tools and techniques of this process directly contribute
to the components of the human resource plan. They are organization charts and position
descriptions, networking, and organizational theory. We'll look at each of these in the fol-
lowing sections.
                                          Developing the Human Resource Plan               301




Organization Charts and Position Descriptions
We've all seen an organization chart. It usually documents your name, your position, your
boss, your boss's boss, your boss's boss's boss, and so on. The important point to note about
this tool and technique is that this information might be presented in one of four ways:
Hierarchical charts Hierarchical charts, like a WBS, are designed in a top-down format.
For example, the organization or department head is at the top, the management employees
who report to the organization head are next, and so on, descending down the structure.
An organization breakdown structure (OBS) is a form of organization chart that shows
the departments, work units, or teams within an organization (rather than individuals) and
their respective work packages.
A resource breakdown structure (RBS) is another type of hierarchical chart that breaks
down the work of the project according to the types of resources needed. (RBS also stands
for risk breakdown structure, as you learned in the previous chapter.) For example, you
might have programmers, database analysts, and network analysts as resource types on the
RBS. However, they won't all necessarily work on the project team. You might have pro-
grammers reporting to the project team, the finance department, and the customer service
department, for example. An RBS can help track project costs because it ties to the organi-
zation's accounting system. Let's suppose you have programming resources in the RBS at
the junior, advanced, and senior levels. Each of these levels of programmer has an average
hourly salary recorded in the accounting system that makes it easy for you to track project
costs. Ten senior programmers, 14 advanced, and 25 junior-level programmers are easy to
calculate and track.
Matrix-based charts Matrix-based charts are used to show the type of resources and the
responsibility they have on the project. Many times a project manager will use a responsi-
bility assignment matrix (RAM) to graphically display this information. A RAM is usually
depicted as a chart with resource names listed in each row (for example, programmers,
testers, and trainers) and project phases or WBS elements listed as the columns. (It can also
be constructed using team member names.) Indicators in the intersections show where the
resources are needed. However, the level of detail is up to you. One RAM might be devel-
oped showing only project phases. Another RAM might show level-two WBS elements for
a complex project, with more RAMs subsequently produced for the additional WBS levels.
Or a RAM might be constructed with level-three elements only.



Exam Spotlight

The RAM relates the OBS to the WBS to assure that every component of the work of the
project is assigned to an individual.




Table 7.1 shows a sample portion of a type of RAM called a RACI chart for a software
development team. In this example, the RACI chart shows the level of accountability each
302          Chapter 7    n   Planning Project Resources



of the participants has on the project. The letters in the acronym RACI are the designations
shown in the chart:
      R = Responsible for performing the work
      A = Accountable, the one who is responsible for producing the deliverable or work
      package and approves or signs off on the work
      C = Consult, someone who has input to the work or decisions
      I = Inform, someone who must be informed of the decisions or results

Ta b l e 7.1 Sample RAM


                      Olga                  Rae             Jantira           Nirmit

Design                R                     A               C                 C

Test                  I                     R               C                 A

Implement             C                     I               R                 A

R = Responsible, A = Accountable, C = Consult, I = Inform




In this example, Olga is responsible for design, meaning she creates the software program-
ming design document, but Rae is accountable and is the one who must make certain the
work of the project is completed and approved. This is a great tool because it shows at a
glance not only where a resource is working but what that resource's responsibility level is
on the project.
Text-oriented formats Text-oriented formats are used when you have a significant amount
of detail to record. These are also called position descriptions or role-responsibility-authority
forms. These forms detail (as the name implies) the role, responsibility, and authority of the
resource, and they make great templates to use for future projects.
Other sections of the project management plan Don't forget that other subsidiary plans
of the project management plan might also describe roles and responsibilities. For example,
you'll recall from Chapter 6, "Risk Planning," that the risk register lists the risk owners
and their responsibility, so be certain to check these documents when outlining roles and
responsibilities as well.

Networking
Networking in this process doesn't refer to the technical kind of networking with serv-
ers, switches, and fiber. It means human resource networking; that is, you know someone
who knows someone and you can share information, learn new techniques, and interact
with each other. According to the PMBOK(R) Guide, several types of networking activities
exist including: proactive communication, lunch meetings (my personal favorite), informal
                                            Developing the Human Resource Plan                303




conversations (ah, the information you learn by hanging out at the espresso machine), and
trade conferences (another favorite because they get you out of the office). Networking might
help when you have a specific resource need on the project but can't seem to locate someone
with that set of skills.

Organizational Theory
Organizational theory refers to all the theories that attempt to explain what makes people,
teams, and work units perform the way they do. I'll talk more about motivation techniques
(which are a type of organizational theory) in Chapter 8, "Developing the Project Team."
Organizational theory improves the probability that planning will be effective and helps
shorten the amount of time it takes to produce the Develop Human Resource Plan outputs.


Develop Human Resource Plan Outputs
The Develop Human Resource Plan process has one output, the human resource plan.
According to the PMBOK(R) Guide, the human resource plan, a subsidiary of the project
management plan, documents how human resources should be defined, staffed, managed
and controlled, and released from the project when their activities are complete.
  This output has three components that we'll look at:
NN   Roles and responsibilities
NN   Project organizational charts
NN   Staffing management plan
  I've already covered organizational charts in detail, so we'll look at the other two com-
ponents of the human resource plan now.

Roles and Responsibilities
This output is the list of roles and responsibilities for the project team. It can take the form
of the RAM or RACI chart I talked about earlier, or the roles and responsibilities can be
recorded in text format. The following are the key elements you should include in the roles
and responsibilities documentation:
Role Describes what part of the project the individuals or teams are accountable for. This
should also include a description of authority levels, responsibilities, and what work is not
included as part of the role.
Authority Describes the amount of authority the resource has to make decisions, dictate
direction, and approve the work.
Responsibility    Describes the work required to complete the project activities.
Competency       Describes the skills and ability needed to perform the project activities.

Staffing Management Plan
The staffing management plan documents how and when human resources are introduced
to the project and the criteria for releasing them. As with the other management plans I've
304        Chapter 7             n   Planning Project Resources



discussed, the level and amount of detail contained in this plan are up to you. It can be formal
or informal, and it can contain lots of detail or only high-level detail.
   The staffing management plan should be updated throughout the project. According
to the PMBOK(R) Guide, you should consider several elements for inclusion in the staffing
management plan, including the following:
Staff acquisition This describes how team members are acquired (from inside or outside
the organization), where they're located, and the costs for specific skills and expertise. I'll
talk more about staff acquisition in Chapter 8.
Resource calendars This describes the time frames in which the resources will be needed on
the project and when the recruitment process should begin. The resources can be described
individually, by teams, or by function (programmers, testers, and so on). Many staffing man-
agement plans use a resource histogram. This is usually drawn in chart form, with project time
along the horizontal axis and hours needed along the vertical axis. The following example his-
togram shows the hours needed for an asphalt crew on a construction project.

                                                 Resource Histogram for Asphalt Crew

                                 215
                   Staff Hours




                                 195


                                 175


                                 155
                                           Jan           Feb           Mar             April




Exam Spotlight

Project calendars are used in the Develop Schedule process we talked about in Chapter 4.
They describe the working and nonworking days (or shifts) for the entire project, includ-
ing company holidays and weekends. Resource calendars describe availability for indi-
viduals or for categories or groups of resources. For example, a resource calendar shows
planned vacation time for an individual or nonworking time for a category of resources.




Staff release plan Attention should be given to how you'll release project team members
at the end of their assignment. You should have reassignment procedures in place to move
folks on to other projects or back to assignments they had before the project. This reduces
overall project costs because you pay them only for the time they work and then release
                                                                 Quality Planning          305




them. You won't have a tendency to simply keep them busy between assignments or until
the end of their scheduled end date if they complete their activities early. Having these pro-
cedures in place will also improve morale because everyone will be clear about how reas-
signment will occur. This should reduce anxiety about their opportunity for employment at
the conclusion of the project or their assignment.
Training needs This describes any training plans needed for team members who don't
have the required skills or abilities to perform project tasks.
Recognition and rewards This describes the systems you'll use to reward and reinforce
desired behavior. I'll talk more about recognition and rewards in Chapter 8.
Compliance If your project involves regulations that must be met or contractual obligations
(such as union contracts), the staffing management plan should detail these and any human
resource policies the organization has in place that deal with compliance issues.
Safety Any safety policies and procedures that are applicable to the project or industry
you work in should be included in the staffing management plan.



Exam Spotlight

Make certain you understand the roles and responsibilities and the staffing management
elements of the human resource plan for the exam.



   In the next section, we'll shift our focus once again but to a completely new topic. We'll
look at quality and its effect on the project planning processes.



Quality Planning
Quality is affected by the triple constraints (project scope, schedule, and cost), and quality
concerns are found in all projects. Quality typically defines whether stakeholder expectations
were met. Being on time and on budget is one thing; if you deliver the wrong product or an
inferior product, on time and on budget suddenly don't mean much.
   The Plan Quality process is concerned with targeting quality standards that are relevant
to the project at hand and devising a plan to meet and satisfy those standards. The quality
management plan is an output of this process that describes how the quality policy will be
implemented by the project management team during the course of the project. Another
key output of this process is the process improvement plan, which documents the actions
for analyzing processes to ultimately increase customer value. Everything discussed in this
section, including the inputs and tools and techniques of this process, will be used to help
develop these two primary outputs.
306         Chapter 7     n   Planning Project Resources




Exam Spotlight

Plan Quality is a key process performed during the Planning processes and when develop-
ing the project management plan. It should be performed in conjunction with other Planning
processes. According to the PMBOK(R) Guide, "quality is planned, designed, and built in--not
inspected in."




Plan Quality Inputs
The Plan Quality process has several inputs:
NN    Scope baseline
NN    Stakeholder register
NN    Cost performance baseline
NN    Schedule baseline
NN    Risk register
NN    Enterprise environmental factors
NN    Organizational process assets
   The two key elements I'll cover regarding inputs are standards and regulations, which
are part of the enterprise environmental factors input, and the quality policy, which is part
of the organizational process assets input.

Standards and Regulations
The project manager should consider any standards, regulations, guidelines, or rules that
exist concerning the work of the project when writing the quality plan. A standard is some-
thing that's approved by a recognized body and that employs rules, guidelines, or charac-
teristics that should be followed. For example, the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA)
has established standards for web page designers that outline alternative viewing options of
web pages for people with disabilities. PMI guidelines regarding project management are
another example of standards.
   Standards aren't legally mandatory, but it's a good idea to follow them. Many organi-
zations (or industries) have standards in place that are proven best practice techniques.
Disregarding accepted standards can have significant consequences. For example, if you're
creating a new software product that ignores standard protocols, your customers won't
be able to use it. Standards can be set by the organization, independent bodies, organiza-
tions such as the International Organization for Standardization (ISO), and so on. In fact,
according to the PMBOK(R) Guide, the Project Quality Management Knowledge Area is
designed to be in alignment with the ISO.
                                                                    Quality Planning            307




   A regulation is mandatory. Regulations are almost always imposed by governments or
institutions like the American Medical Association. However, organizations might have
their own self-imposed regulations that you should be aware of as well. Regulations require
strict adherence, particularly in the case of government-imposed regulations, or stiff penal-
ties and fines could result--maybe even jail time if the offense is serious enough. Hmm, it
might be tough to practice project management from behind bars--not a recommended
career move.
   If possible, it's a good idea to include information from the quality policy (I'll cover this in
the next section) and any standards, regulations, or guidelines that affect the project in the
quality management plan. If it's not possible to include this information in the quality man-
agement plan, then at least make reference to the information and where it can be found. It's
the project management team's responsibility to be certain all stakeholders are aware of and
understand the policy issues and standards or regulations that might impact the project.


                  Contracts might have certain provisions for quality requirements that you
                  should account for in the quality management plan. If the quality manage-
                  ment plan was written prior to the Plan Procurements process, you should
                  update the quality plan to reflect it.



Quality Policy
The quality policy is part of the organizational process assets input. It's a guideline pub-
lished by executive management that describes what quality policies should be adopted for
projects the company undertakes. It's up to the project manager to understand this policy
and incorporate any predetermined company guidelines into the quality plan. If a quality
policy does not exist, it's up to the project management team to create one for the project.



Exam Spotlight

It is the responsibility of the project management team to assure that all key project
stakeholders are aware of and have received copies of the quality policy.




Tools and Techniques for Plan Quality
The Plan Quality process has nine tools and techniques used to help construct the quality
management plan:
NN   Cost-benefit analysis
NN   Cost of quality
NN   Control charts
308         Chapter 7    n   Planning Project Resources



NN    Benchmarking
NN    Design of experiments
NN    Statistical sampling
NN    Flowcharting
NN    Proprietary quality management methodologies
NN    Additional quality planning tools
   Make sure you understand each of these tools and techniques and its purpose for the
exam. We'll take a look at them now with the exception of flowcharting. We discussed that
tool and technique in Chapter 6.

Cost-Benefit Analysis
You've seen the cost-benefit analysis technique before in the Initiating process group. In the
case of quality management, you'll want to consider the trade-offs of the cost of quality.
It's cheaper and more efficient to prevent defects in the first place than to spend time and
money fixing them later. The benefits of meeting quality requirements are as follows:
NN    Stakeholder satisfaction is increased.
NN    Costs are lower.
NN    Productivity is higher.
NN    There is less rework.
   The PMBOK(R) Guide notes that the primary cost of meeting quality requirements for a
project is the expense incurred while performing project quality management activities.

Cost of Quality
The cost of quality (COQ) is the total cost to produce the product or service of the project
according to the quality standards. These costs include all the work necessary to meet the
product requirements whether the work was planned or unplanned. It also includes the costs
of work performed due to nonconforming quality requirements, assessing whether the product
or service meets requirements, and rework.
   Three costs are associated with the cost of quality:
Prevention costs Prevention means keeping defects out of the hands of customers. Prevention
costs are the costs associated with satisfying customer requirements by producing a product
without defects. These costs are manifested early in the process and include aspects such as
Plan Quality, training, design review, and contractor and supplier costs.
Appraisal costs Appraisal costs are the costs expended to examine the product or process
and make certain the requirements are being met. Appraisal costs might include costs asso-
ciated with aspects such as inspections and testing. Prevention and appraisal costs are often
passed on to the acquiring organization because of the limited duration of the project.
                                                                   Quality Planning          309




Failure costs Failure costs are what it costs when things don't go according to plan. Failure
costs are also known as cost of poor quality. Two types of failure costs exist:
   Internal failure costs These result when customer requirements are not satisfied while
   the product is still in the control of the organization. Internal failure costs might include
   corrective action, rework, scrapping, and downtime.
   External failure costs These occur when the product has reached the customer who
   determines that the requirements have not been met. Costs associated with external failure
   costs might include inspections at the customer site, returns, and customer service costs.
    There are two categories of costs within COQ, the cost of conformance and the cost
of nonconformance. Conformance costs are associated with activities undertaken to avoid
failures, while nonconformance costs are those undertaken because a failure has occurred.
All of the types of costs of quality we just covered fall into one of these categories. Table 7.2
is a quick reference.

Ta b l e 7. 2 Cost of Conformance and Nonconformance


Conformance Costs                      Nonconformance Costs

Prevention costs                       Internal failure costs

Appraisal costs                        External failure costs




                   The cost of quality can be affected by project decisions. Let's say you're
                   producing a new product. Unfortunately, the product scope description
                   or project scope statement was inadequate in describing the functional-
                   ity of the product. And, the project team produced the product exactly
                   as specified in the project scope statement, the WBS, and other planning
                   documents. Once the product hit the store shelves, the organization was
                   bombarded with returns and warranty claims because of the poor quality.
                   Therefore, your project decisions impacted the cost of quality. Recalls of
                   products can also impact the cost of quality.

   Cost of quality is a topic you'll likely encounter on the exam. The following sections
will discuss some of the pioneers in this field. Quality must be planned into the project,
not inspected in after the fact to make certain the product or service meets stakeholders'
expectations.
   Four people in particular are responsible for the rise of the quality management move-
ment and the theories behind the cost of quality: Philip B. Crosby, Joseph M. Juran, W.
Edwards Deming, and Walter Shewhart. Each of these men developed steps or points that
led to commonly accepted quality processes that we use today and either developed or were
310          Chapter 7   n   Planning Project Resources



the foundation for the development of quality theories such as Total Quality Management,
Six Sigma, cost of quality, and continuous improvement. I'll also cover a quality technique
called the Kaizen approach that originated in Japan.

Philip B. Crosby
Philip B. Crosby devised the zero defects practice, which means, basically, do it right the
first time. (Didn't your dad use to tell you this?) Crosby says that costs will increase when
quality planning isn't performed up front, which means you'll have to engage in rework,
thus affecting productivity. Prevention is the key to Crosby's theory. If you prevent the
defect from occurring in the first place, costs are lower, conformance to requirements is
easily met, and the cost measurement for quality becomes the cost of nonconformance
rather than the cost of rework.

Joseph M. Juran
Joseph M. Juran is noted for his fitness for use premise. Simply put, this means the stake-
holders' and customers' expectations are met or exceeded. This says that conformance to
specifications--meaning the product of the project that was produced is what the project
set out to produce--is met or exceeded. Fitness for use specifically reflects the customers'
or stakeholders' view of quality and answers the following questions:
      Did the product or service produced meet the quality expectation?
      Did it satisfy a real need?
      Is it reliable and safe?
   Juran also proposed that there could be grades of quality. However, you should not con-
fuse grade with quality. Grade is a category for products or services that are of the same
type but have differing technical characteristics. Quality describes how well the product or
service (or characteristics of the product or service) fulfills the requirements. Low quality is
usually not an acceptable condition; however, low grade might be. For example, your new
Dad's Dollars Credit Card software tracking system might be of high quality, meaning it
has no bugs and the product performs as advertised, but of low grade, meaning it has few
features. You'll almost always want to strive for high quality, regardless of the acceptable
grade level.



Exam Spotlight

Understand the difference between quality and grade for the exam.




W. Edwards Deming
W. Edwards Deming suggested that as much as 85 percent of the cost of quality is a man-
agement problem. Once the quality issue has hit the floor, or the worker level, the workers
                                                                  Quality Planning            311




have little control. For example, if you're constructing a new highway and the management
team that bid on the project proposed using inferior-grade asphalt, the workers laying the
asphalt have little control over its quality. They're at the mercy of the management team
responsible for purchasing the supplies.
    Deming also proposed that workers cannot figure out quality on their own and thus can-
not perform at their best. He believed that workers need to be shown what acceptable quality
is and that they need to be made to understand that quality and continuous improvement are
necessary elements of any organization--or project, in your case.
    Many consider Deming to be a major contributor to the Total Quality Management
(TQM) theory. TQM, like Deming, says that the process is the problem, not people. Every
person and all activities the company undertakes are involved with quality. TQM stipulates
that quality must be managed in and that quality improvement should be a continuous way
of doing business, not a one-time performance of a specific task or process.



Exam Spotlight

There is some controversy surrounding who is the actual founder of TQM. Some say Dem-
ing, but others say Armand V. Feigenbaum. For the exam, I recommend knowing that
Feigenbaum is the founder of TQM and Deming believes quality is a management issue.
Six Sigma is a quality management approach that is similar to TQM and is typically used in
manufacturing and service-related industries. Six Sigma is a measurement-based strategy
that focuses on process improvement and variation reduction, which you can achieve by
applying Six Sigma methodologies to the project. There are two Six Sigma methodologies.
The first is known as DMADV (define, measure, analyze, design, and verify) and is used
to develop new processes or products at the Six Sigma level. The second is called DMAIC
(define, measure, analyze, improve, and control) and is used to improve existing processes
or products. Another tidbit you should understand about Six Sigma is that it aims to elimi-
nate defects and stipulates that no more than 3.4 defects per million are produced.




Walter Shewhart
Some sources say that Walter Shewhart is considered the grandfather of TQM, which was
further popularized by Feigenbaum and Deming. Shewhart developed statistical tools to
examine when a corrective action must be applied to a process. He invented control chart
techniques (control charts are a tool and technique of the Perform Quality Control process)
and was also the inventor of the Plan-Do-Check-Act cycle that I talked about in Chapter 1.

Kaizen Approach
The Kaizen approach is a quality technique from Japan. In fact, Kaizen means continuous
improvement in Japanese. With this technique, all project team members and managers should
be constantly watching for quality improvement opportunities. The Kaizen approach states
that you should improve the quality of the people first and then the quality of the products or
service.
312         Chapter 7   n   Planning Project Resources



   Continuous improvement involves everyone in the organization watching for ways to
improve quality, whether incrementally or by incorporating new ideas into the process. This
involves taking measurements, improving processes by making them repeatable and system-
ized, reducing variations in production or performance, reducing defects, and improving cycle
times. TQM and Six Sigma are examples of continuous improvement.



Exam Spotlight

Understand each of these theories on the cost of quality for the exam. Here's a key to help
you remember:

NN    Crosby = Zero defects and prevention or rework results.
NN    Juran = Fitness for use, conformance. Quality by design.
NN    Deming = Quality is a management problem.
NN    Feigenbaum = Founder of TQM.
NN    Shewhart = Plan-Do-Check-Act cycle.
NN    TQM = Quality must be managed in and must be a continuous process.
NN    Six Sigma = Six Sigma is a measurement-based strategy; no more than 3.4 defects
      per million opportunities.
NN    Kaizen = Continuous improvement; improve quality of people first.
NN    Continuous improvement = Watch continuously for ways to improve quality.




Control Charts
Control charts help you determine if a process is stable and whether process variances are
in control or out of control. We will discuss control charts in more depth in Chapter 9,
"Conducting Procurements and Sharing Information."

Benchmarking
Benchmarking is a process of comparing previous similar activities to the current project
activities to provide a standard to measure performance against. This comparison will also
help you derive ideas for quality improvements on the current project. For example, if your
current printer can produce 8 pages per minute and you're considering a new printer that
produces 14 pages per minute, the benchmark is 8 pages per minute.

Design of Experiments
Design of experiments (DOE) is a statistical technique that identifies the elements--or
variables--that will have the greatest effect on overall project outcomes. It is used most
                                                                  Quality Planning              313




often concerning the product of the project but can also be applied to project management
processes to examine trade-offs. DOE designs and sets up experiments to determine the
ideal solution for a problem using a limited number of sample cases. It analyzes several
variables at once, allowing you to change all (or some of) the variables at the same time
and determine which combination will produce the best result at a reasonable cost.



Exam Spotlight

For the exam, remember that the key to DOE is that it equips you with a statistical frame-
work that allows you to change the variables that have the greatest effect on overall project
outcomes at once instead of changing one variable at a time.




Statistical Sampling
Statistical sampling involves taking a sample number of parts from the whole population
and inspecting them to determine whether they fall within acceptable variances. We will
discuss statistical sampling in more detail in Chapter 9.

Flowcharting
A flowchart graphically depicts the relationships between and among steps. They typically
show activities, decision points, and the flow or order of steps in a process.

Proprietary Quality Management Methodologies
We've covered most of these during our discussion of cost of quality. Proprietary quality
management methodologies include Six Sigma, Lean Six Sigma, Total Quality Management,
Quality Function Deployment, and others.

Additional Quality Planning Tools
The last tool and technique of the Plan Quality process is additional quality-planning
tools. The PMBOK(R) Guide lists these additional tools as follows:
NN   Brainstorming
NN   Affinity diagrams
NN   Force field analysis
NN   Nominal Group technique
NN   Matrix diagrams
NN   Prioritization matrices
   We've already covered brainstorming and the Nominal Group technique. Let's briefly
look at the remaining tools next.
314         Chapter 7   n   Planning Project Resources



   Affinity diagrams are used to group and organize thoughts and facts and can be used in
conjunction with brainstorming. After you've gathered all ideas possible with brainstorming,
you group similar ideas together on an affinity diagram.
   Force field analysis is a method of examining the drivers and resistors of a decision.
You could use the old T-square approach and list all the drivers down the left column
and all the resistors in the right. Determine which of these elements in the list are barri-
ers and which are enablers to the project. Assign a priority or rank to each, and develop
strategies for leveraging the strengths of the high-priority enablers while minimizing
the highest-ranked barriers.
   Matrix diagrams are also used as a decision-making tool, particularly when several
options or alternatives are available. Using a spreadsheet format, you list common elements
down the rows in the first column and then list each alternative in its own column to the
right of this one. Then rank each alternative in the corresponding cell where the common
element and the alternative intersect.
   Prioritization matrices are useful when you need to prioritize complex issues that have
numerous criteria for decision making. They're best used in situations where you can use data
or inputs to score the criteria. They work similarly to a weighted scoring model (I talked about
those in Chapter 2) in that the most important criteria carries the greatest weight.
   You should memorize the names of these additional Plan Quality tools for the exam, but
more important, you should understand both the names and concepts of the other tools
and techniques I talked about earlier in this chapter.


Plan Quality Outputs
Plan Quality uses many techniques to determine the areas of quality improvement that can
be implemented, controlled, and measured throughout the rest of the project, as you've
seen. These are recorded in the primary output of this process, which is called the quality
management plan. The following list includes all the outputs of this process:
NN    Quality management plan
NN    Quality metrics
NN    Quality checklists
NN    Process improvement plan
NN    Project document updates
   Project document updates include updates to the stakeholder register and the RAM and
may also involve updates to the quality management plan and process improvement plan as
a result of changes or corrections that result from the Perform Quality Assurance process.
We'll talk about the Perform Quality Assurance process in Chapter 9. We'll look at the
remaining outputs of Plan Quality next.

Quality Management Plan
The quality management plan describes how the project management team will carry out
the quality policy. It should document the resources needed to carry out the quality plan, the
                                                                  Quality Planning          315




responsibilities of the project team in implementing quality, and all the processes and proce-
dures the project team and organization should use to satisfy quality requirements, including
quality control, quality assurance techniques, and continuous improvement processes.
   The project manager, in cooperation with the project staff, writes the quality manage-
ment plan. You can assign quality actions to the activities listed on the WBS based on the
quality plan requirements. Isn't that WBS a handy thing? Later in the Perform Quality
Control process, measurements will be taken to determine whether the quality to date is on
track with the quality standards outlined in the quality management plan.



Exam Spotlight

The Project Quality Management Knowledge Area, which includes the Plan Quality,
Perform Quality Assurance, and Perform Quality Control processes, involves the quality
management of the project as well as the quality aspects of the product or service the
project was undertaken to produce. We'll discuss Quality Assurance and Quality Control
in later chapters.



Quality Metrics
A quality metric, also known as operational definition, describes what is being measured
and how it will be measured during the Perform Quality Control process. For example,
let's say you're managing the opening of a new restaurant in July of next year. Perhaps one
of the deliverables is the procurement of flatware for 500 place settings. The operational
definition in this case might include the date the flatware must be delivered and a count-
ing or inventory process to ensure you received the number of place settings you ordered.
Measurements of this variable consist of actual values, not "yes" or "no" results. In our
example, receiving the flatware is a "yes" or "no" attribute result (you have it or you don't),
but the date it was delivered and the number of pieces delivered are actual values. Failure
rates are another type of quality metric that is measurable, as are reliability, availability,
test coverage, and defect density measurements.

Quality Checklists
If you're like me, you start your day at the office with a big to-do list that has so many
items on it you won't be able to finish them all. Nevertheless, you faithfully write the list
every day and check off the items that you accomplish throughout the day. Checklists are
like this in that they provide a means to determine whether the required steps in a process
have been followed. As each step is completed, it's checked off the list. Checklists can be
activity specific or industry specific and might be very complex or easy to follow. Some-
times, organizations might have standard checklists they use for projects. You might also
be able to obtain checklists from professional associations.

Candy Works

Juliette Walters is a contract project manager for Candy Works. She is leading a project
that will introduce a new line of hard candy drops in various exotic flavors: cafe latte, hot
buttered popcorn, and jalapeno spice, just to name a few.

Juliette is writing the quality management plan for this project. After interviewing stake-
holders and key team members, she has found several quality factors of importance to
the organization. Quality will be measured by the following criteria:

Candy size Each piece should measure 3 mm.

Appearance     No visible cracks or breaks should appear in the candy.

Flavor Flavor must be distinguishable when taste tested.

Number produced The production target is 9,000 pieces per week. The current machine
has been benchmarked at 9,200 candies per week.

Intensity of color There should be no opaqueness in the darker colors.

Wrappers Properly fitting wrappers cover the candies, folding over twice in back and
twisted on each side. There is a different wrapper for each flavor of candy, and they must
match exactly.

The candy is cooked and then pulled into a long cylinder shape roughly 6 feet long and
2 feet in diameter. This cylinder is fed into the machine that molds and cuts the candy
into drops. The cylinders vary a little in size because they're hand-stretched by expert
candy makers prior to feeding them into the drop maker machine. As a result, the end of
one flavor batch--the cafe latte flavor--and the beginning of the next batch--the hot but-
tered popcorn flavor--merge. This means the drops that fall into the collection bins are
intermingled during the last run of the first flavor batch. In other words, the last bin of
the cafe latte flavor run has some hot buttered popcorn drops mixed in. And, there isn't
a way to separate the drops once they've hit the bin. From here, the drops go on to the
candy-wrapping machine, where brightly colored wrappers are matched to the candy fla-
vor. According to the quality plan, hot buttered popcorn drops cannot be wrapped as cafe
latte drops. Juliette ponders what to do.

As she tosses and turns that night thinking about the problem, it occurs to her to present this
problem to the company as an opportunity rather than as a problem. To keep production in
the 9,000 candies per week category, the machines can't be stopped every time a new batch
is introduced. So, Juliette comes up with the idea to wrap candies from the intermixed bins
with wrappers that say "Mystery Flavor." This way, production keeps pace with the plan,
and the wrapper/flavor quality problem is mitigated.

Exam Spotlight

Be aware that a checklist shows up as an input, an output, and a tool and technique. Quality
checklists are an output of the Plan Quality process and an input to the Perform Quality Control
process, and checklist analysis is a tool and technique of the Identify Risk process.




Process Improvement Plan
The process improvement plan focuses on finding inefficiencies in a process or activity and
eliminating them. The idea here is that if you're doing activities or performing processes that
don't add any value, you'll want to either stop doing what you're doing or modify the process
so that you are adding value. You should note that the process improvement plan is a subsid-
iary plan of the project management plan. Some of the elements you should consider when
thinking about process improvement are the process boundaries, which describes the purpose
for the process and its expected start and end dates; the process configuration so that you
know what processes are performed when and how they interact; the process metrics; and
any specific elements you want to target for improvement.

Quality Baseline
The quality baseline is not a listed output of this process. But almost everything you've
done throughout the Plan Quality process culminates in the quality baseline. The quality
baseline is the quality objective of the project. It's what you'll use to measure and report
quality against as you perform the remaining Quality processes. You should understand
the definition of the quality baseline for the exam.


                  One of the results of the Plan Quality process is that your product or
                  process might require adjustments to conform to the quality policy and
                  standards. These changes might result in cost changes and schedule
                  changes. You might also discover that you'll need to perform risk analysis
                  techniques for problems you uncover or when making adjustments as a
                  result of this process.




Bringing It All Together
Believe it or not, you have officially completed the Planning process group. Along the way, I've
mentioned gaining approvals for portions of the project plan such as the schedule and budget.
   The project plan is the approved, formal, documented plan that's used to guide you
throughout the project Executing process group. The plan consists of all the outputs of the
318        Chapter 7   n   Planning Project Resources



Planning process groups, including the project management plan. It's the map that tells
you where you're going and how to perform the activities of the project plan during the
Project Plan Execution process. It serves several purposes, the most important of which is
tracking and measuring project performance through the Executing and Monitoring and
Controlling processes and making future project decisions. The project plan is critical in
all communications you'll have from here forward with the stakeholders, management, and
customers. The project plan also documents all project planning assumptions, all project
planning decisions, and important management reviews needed.
    The project plan encompasses everything I've talked about up to now and is represented
in a formal document, or collection of documents. This document contains the project scope
statement, deliverables, assumptions, risks, WBS, milestones, project schedule, resources, and
more. It becomes the baseline you'll use to measure and track progress against. It's also used
to help you control the components that tend to stray from the original plan so you can get
them back in line.
    The project plan is used as a communication and information tool for stakeholders,
team members, and the management team. They will use the project plan to review and
gauge progress as well.



Exam Spotlight

Performance measurement baselines are management controls that should change only
infrequently. Examples of the performance measurement baselines you've looked at so far
are budget, quality, and schedule baselines. However, the project plan itself also becomes
a baseline. If changes in scope or schedule do occur after Planning is complete, you should
go through a formalized process (which I'll cover in Chapter 10) to implement the changes.



    Don't forget that sign-off of the project plan is important to the project's success. Your last
step in the Planning process group is obtaining sign-off of the project plan from stakeholders,
the sponsor, and the management team. If they've been an integral part of the Planning pro-
cesses all along (and I know you know how important this is), obtaining sign-off of the project
plan should simply be a formality.
    Note that you will use all the management plans I discussed during the Planning pro-
cesses--the project management plan and its subsidiary plans, including the scope manage-
ment plan, the schedule management plan, and so on, plus the cost budgeting baseline, the
schedule baseline, and the quality baseline--throughout the Executing process group to man-
age the project and keep the performance of the project on track with the project objectives.
If you don't have a project plan, you'll have no way of managing the process. You'll find that
even with a project plan, project scope has a way of changing. Stakeholders and others tend
to sneak in a few of the "Oh, I didn't understand that before" statements and hope that they
slide right by you. With that signed, approved project plan in your files, you are allowed to
gently remind them that they read and agreed to the project plan and you're sticking to it.

Project Case Study: New Kitchen Heaven Retail Store

You're just finishing a phone conversation with Jill, and you see Dirk headed toward
your office.

Dirk walks in, crosses his arms over his chest, and stands next to your desk with an "I'm
here for answers" look.

"I thought I'd drop by and see whether you have signed a lease and gotten Jake started
on that build-out yet," says Dirk.

"I just got off the phone with Jill," you reply. "The Realtor found a great location, and
we've set up a tour for tomorrow."

"What has been the holdup?" Dirk asks. "I thought we'd be ready to start the build-out
about now."

"I've been working on the project plans."

"Project plans," Dirk interrupts. "We already have a plan. That schedule thing and risk stuff
and the budget you drew up over the last couple of weeks spelled things out pretty clearly."

"I'm almost finished with the project plans. I'd like you to take a look at the human
resource plan after I review with you what we've done to date."

"I don't understand why you're wasting all this time planning. We all know what the
objectives are."

"Dirk," you reply, "if we put the right amount of effort and time into planning, the actual
work of the project should go pretty smoothly. Planning is probably one of the most impor-
tant things we can do on this project. If we don't plan correctly, we might miss something
very important that could delay the store opening. That date is pretty firm, I thought."

"Yes, the date is firm. But I don't see how we could miss anything. You and I have met sev-
eral times, and I know you've met with Jill and Jake. They're the other key players on this."

"Let me finish," you reply. "I have met with all the key stakeholders and after you review
these last few documents I have for you, we're finished with the planning phase of this
project. Ricardo drafted a procurement statement of work. He needs to hire some exter-
nal resources--and I noted that in the human resource management plan by the way--to
help run Ethernet cable, procure a T1 line, and purchase some routers and switches. The
purchase of the routers and switches will be accomplished using a fixed-price contract
and the human resources he needs will be procured using a time and materials contract.
Jill also drew up a procurement statement of work for the gourmet and cookware lines
purchase. I documented a lot of the human resource plan when we worked through the
320           Chapter 7   n   Planning Project Resources




activity estimating and duration exercise and put some finishing touches on it yesterday.
It includes a RACI chart for all our project key deliverables." You sneak in a quick breath
because you don't want Dirk to interrupt. "And the quality management plan is complete.
After your review, I'll distribute it to the key stakeholders. The quality management plan
describes how we'll implement our quality policy. You know the old saying, `Do it right
the first time.' I took the time to write down the specific quality metrics we're looking for,
including the lease signing date (this one must start and finish on time) and the IT equip-
ment specifications, and Jill has documented the gourmet products and the cookware
line specifications."

Dirk looks impressed but you can't tell for sure.

"After I look at the last of these planning documents, are we ready to actually start
working?"

"Yes, as soon as the lease is signed. I anticipate that happening by the end of this week.
Tomorrow's tour is the fifth location Jill will look at. She's very happy with the third prop-
erty she saw but wants to look at this last property before she makes her final decision."

"Great. Let's take a look at that human plan or whatever it is."

After reviewing the last of the planning documents, Dirk signs off on the project plan.

Understanding How This Applies
to Your Next Project
In my organization, the Plan Procurements process comes right after finalizing project
scope because it takes a great deal of time and effort to procure goods and services. That
means we have to start procuring resources as early in the project as possible in order to
meet the project deadlines.
   In all the organizations I've worked in, someone has always been responsible for procure-
ment--whether it was a single person or an entire department. Typically, the procurement
department defines many elements of the procurement management plan. Sure, the project
team determines how many vendors need to be involved and how they'll be managed along
with the schedule dates, but many other elements are predetermined, such as the type of con-
tract to use, the authority of the project team regarding the contract, how multiple vendors
will be managed, and the identification of prequalified sellers.
   The procurement department also determines what type of procurement document
you should use depending on the types of resources you're acquiring and the amount of
money you're spending. Typically, they'll have a template for you to use with all the lega-
lese sections pre-populated, and you'll work on the sections that describe the work or
resources you need for the project, milestones or schedule dates, and evaluation criteria.
   Don't make the mistake of thinking your procurement department will take care of all
the paperwork for you. At a minimum, you will likely be responsible for writing the state-
ment of work, writing the RFP, writing the contract requirements (as they pertain to the
work of the project), creating the vendor selection criteria, and determining the schedule
dates for contract work.
   Develop Human Resource Plan is a process you might not need to complete, depending
on the size and complexity of the project. I typically work with the same team members
over and over again, so I know their skills, capabilities, and availability. However, if you're
hiring contract resources for the project or you typically work with new team members on
each project, I recommend creating a staffing management plan.
   The quality management plan is another important element of your project plan. You
should take into consideration the final result or product of the project and the complexity
of the project to determine if you need a multipage document with detailed specifications
or if the plan can be more informal and broad in nature. Again, depending on the project
complexity, the measurements or criteria you'll use to determine the quality objective could
be a few simple sentences or bullet items or a more formal, detailed document. The quality
baseline should be documented during this process as well.
322        Chapter 7   n   Planning Project Resources




Summary
This chapter's focus was on planning for project resources. Several aspects are involved
in these planning activities, including procuring goods and services, planning human
resources, and defining the activities in which human resources will be involved.
   This chapter started with the Plan Procurements process. This process identifies the
goods or services you're going to purchase from outside the organization and determines
which project the project team needs can meet. This involves tools and techniques such as
make-or-buy decisions, expert judgment, and contract types. The procurement manage-
ment plan is one of the outputs of this process and describes how procurement services will
be managed throughout the project. The procurement SOW (another output of this process)
describes the work that will be contracted.
   In our discussion of contract types, we covered fixed-price, cost plus, and time and
materials contracts and the benefits and risks of using them.
   The Develop Human Resource Plan process identifies and assigns roles and responsibili-
ties and reporting relationships. Many times the roles and responsibilities assignments are
depicted in a responsibility assignment matrix (RAM) or a RACI chart. The staffing man-
agement plan describes how and when project team members will be acquired and is part
of the human resource plan output of this process.
   Plan Quality targets the quality standards that are relevant to your project. The quality
management plan outlines how the project team will enact the quality policy.
   You need to consider the cost of quality when considering stakeholder needs. Four
men led to the rise of the cost of quality theories. Crosby is known for his zero defects
theory, Juran for the fitness for use theory, Deming for attributing 85 percent of cost of
quality to the management team, and Shewhart for the Plan-Do-Check-Act cycle. The
Kaizen approach says that the project team should continuously be on the lookout for
ways to improve the process and that people should be improved first and then the qual-
ity of the products or services. TQM and Six Sigma are examples of continuous improve-
ment techniques.
   Cost-benefit analysis considers trade-offs in the Plan Quality process. Benchmarking
compares previous similar activities to the current project activities to provide a standard
to measure performance against. Design of experiments is an analytical technique that
determines what variables have the greatest effect on the project outcomes. This technique
equips you with a statistical framework, allowing you to change all the important variables
at once instead of changing one variable at a time.
   Cost of quality involves three types of costs: prevention, appraisal, and failure costs;
the latter is also known as the cost of poor quality. Failure costs include the costs of both
internal and external failures.
   The process improvement plan is a subsidiary plan of the project management plan and
targets inefficiencies in a process or activity. The quality baseline is used to document the
quality objectives of the project and is used as a basis for future Quality processes.
                                                                   Exam Essentials           323




Exam Essentials
Be able to name the purpose for the Plan Procurements process. The purpose of the Plan
Procurements process is to identify which project needs should be obtained from outside the
organization. Make-or-buy analysis is used as a tool and technique to help determine this.
Be able to identify the contract types and their usage. Contract types are a tool and tech-
nique of the Plan Procurements process and include fixed-price and cost-reimbursable con-
tracts. Use fixed-price contracts for well-defined projects with a high value to the company,
and use cost-reimbursable contracts for projects with uncertainty and large investments early
in the project life. The three types of fixed-price contracts are FFP, FPIF, and FP-EPA. The
four types of cost-reimbursable contracts are CPFF, CPIF, CPF (or CPPC), and CPAF. Time
and materials contracts are a cross between fixed-price and cost-reimbursable contracts.
Be able to name the outputs of the Plan Procurements process. The outputs of Plan Pro-
curements are procurement management plan, procurement statements of work, make-or-
buy decisions, procurement documents, source selection criteria, and change requests.
Be able to name the purpose of the Develop Human Resource Plan process. Develop
Human Resource Plan involves determining roles and responsibilities, reporting relation-
ships for the project, and creating the staffing management plan, which describes how team
members are acquired and the criteria for their release.
Be able to identify the benefits of meeting quality requirements. The benefits of meeting
quality requirements include increased stakeholder satisfaction, lower costs, higher produc-
tivity, and less rework and are discovered during the Plan Quality process.
Be able to define the cost of quality. The COQ is the total cost to produce the product
or service of the project according to the quality standards. These costs include all the work
necessary to meet the product requirements for quality. The three costs associated with cost
of quality are prevention, appraisal, and failure costs (also known as cost of poor quality).
Be able to name four people associated with COQ and some of the techniques they helped
establish. They are Crosby, Juran, Deming, and Shewhart. Some of the techniques they
helped to establish are TQM, Six Sigma, cost of quality, and continuous improvement. The
Kaizen approach concerns continuous improvement and says people should be improved first.
Be able to name the tools and techniques of the Plan Quality process. The Plan Quality
process consists of cost-benefit analysis, cost of quality, control charts, benchmarking, design
of experiments, statistical sampling, flowcharting, proprietary quality management method-
ologies, and additional quality planning tools.

    policy. It must address at least all of the following except which one?
    A. Quality control
    B.   Quality metrics
    C.   Quality assurance
    D.   Continuous process improvement

18. You work for a furniture manufacturer. Your project is going to design and produce a new
    office chair. The chair will have the ability to function as a regular chair and also the ability to
    transform its occupant into an upright, kneeling position. The design team is trying to deter-
    mine the combination of comfort and ease of transformation to the new position that will give
    the chair the best characteristics while keeping the costs reasonable. Several different combina-
    tions have been tested. This is an example of which of the following tools and techniques of
    Plan Quality?
    A. Benchmarking
    B.   Quality metrics
    C.   COQ
    D.   DOE

         based strategy
    C.   Asserts that quality must be a continuous way of doing business
    D.   Focuses on improving the quality of the people first, then improving the quality of the
         process or project

20. Your organization is embarking on a long-term project that will require additional human
    resources on a contract basis to complete the work of the project. Since the project will span
    several years, you know one vendor probably can't supply all the resources you'll need over
    the course of the contract. However, you only want to work with one vendor throughout the
    project to minimize the amount of procurement documents you'll have to produce. So you'll
    specify in your procurement documents that contractors will have to form partnerships to
    work on this project. You know all of the following are true regarding this question except
    for which one?
    A. You will use an RFP, which is an output of the Plan Procurements process, as your
       procurement document for this project.
    B.   You'll use an FP-EPA contract, which is described in the contract types tool and tech-
         nique of the Plan Procurements process.
    C.   You should consider teaming agreements, which are an input to the Develop Human
         Resource Plan process.
    D.   Some of the quality metrics you'll use for this project include on-time performance,
         failure rates, budget control, and test coverage. Quality metrics are an output of the
         Plan Quality process.

Answers to Review Questions
1.    D. Make-or-buy analysis is determining whether it's more cost effective to purchase the
      goods or services needed for the project or more cost effective for the organization to produce
      them internally.

2.    C. Firm fixed-price contracts have the highest risk to the seller and the least amount of risk
      to the buyer. However, the price the vendor charges for the product or service will compen-
      sate for the amount of risk they're taking on.

3.    B. Either the buyer or the seller can write the SOW. Sometimes the buyer will write the SOW
      and the seller might modify it and send it back to the buyer for verification and approval.

4.    A. The cost plus incentive fee contract reimburses the seller for the seller's allowable costs
      and includes an incentive or bonus for exceeding the performance criteria laid out in the
      contract.

5.    D. The RAM and RACI charts are tools and techniques of this process.

6.    C. Source selection criteria can be based on price alone when there are many vendors who
      can readily supply the goods or services. The question states that only three vendors make
      the machine, which means source selection criteria should be based on more than price.

7.    A. Constraints can be anything that limits the option of the project team. Organizational
      structures, collective bargaining agreements, and economic conditions are all constraints
      that you might encounter during this process.

8.    C. Fixed-price contracts can include incentives for meeting performance criteria, but the
      questions states the vendor helping with the programming task will be reimbursed for their
      costs and, depending on your satisfaction with their results, may receive an additional
      award. This describes a cost plus award fee contract.

9.    A. RACI stands for responsible, accountable, consult, and inform.

10. B. Plan Procurements can directly influence the project schedule, and the project schedule
    can directly influence this process.

11. B. This is a cost-reimbursable contract that includes a fee as a percentage of allowable
    costs. This type of contract is known as a cost plus percentage of cost (CPPC) contract.

12. A. Design of experiments is a tool and technique of the Plan Quality process that provides
    statistical analysis for changing key product or process elements all at once (not one at a
    time) to optimize the process.

13. C. Philip Crosby devised the zero defects theory, meaning do it right the first time. Proper
    Plan Quality leads to less rework and higher productivity. Joseph Juran's fitness for use says
    that stakeholders' and customers' expectations are met or exceeded.
                                                     Answers to Review Questions               331



14. A. W. Edwards Deming conjectured that the cost of quality is a management problem 85
    percent of the time and that once the problem trickles down to the workers, it is outside
    their control.

15. C. The benefits of meeting quality requirements are increased stakeholder satisfaction,
    lower costs, higher productivity, and less rework.

16. A. Internal failure costs are costs associated with not meeting the customer's expectations
    while you still had control over the product. This results in rework, scrapping, and downtime.

17. B. Quality metrics are an output of the Plan Quality process.

18. D. This is an example of design of experiments.

19. B. Six Sigma is a measurement-based strategy that focuses on process improvement and
    variation reduction by applying Six Sigma methodologies to the project.

20. C . Teaming agreements are an input of the Plan Procurements process.

                             This chapter begins the project Executing process group. I'll
                             cover four of the processes in this chapter: Direct and Man-
                             age Project Execution, Acquire Project Team, Develop Project
Team, and Manage Project Team. I'll cover the remaining four Executing processes in the
next chapter.
    Direct and Manage Project Execution is the action process. This is where you'll put
the plans into action and begin working on the project activities. Execution also involves
keeping the project in line with the original project plan and bringing wayward activities
back into alignment.
    The Acquire, Develop, and Manage Project Team processes are all interrelated, as you
can imagine, and work together to help obtain the best project team available.
    Several things happen during the Executing processes. The majority of the project
budget will be spent during this process group, and often the majority of the project time
is expended here as well. The greatest conflicts you'll see during the project Executing
processes are schedule conflicts. In addition, the product description will be finalized here
and contain more detail than it did in the Planning processes.
    There might be several exam questions from every process within the Executing process
group. Don't skip studying these processes and the ones in Chapter 9 because roughly one
quarter of the exam questions concern the Executing process group. Are you ready to dive
into Executing? Let's go.



Executing the Project Plan
The purpose of the Direct and Manage Project Execution process is to carry out the project
plan. This is where your project comes to life and the work of the project happens. The work
is authorized to begin and activities are performed. Resources are committed and carry out
their assigned activities to create the product, result, or service of the project. Funds are
spent to accomplish project objectives. Performing project activities, training, selecting sell-
ers, collecting project data, utilizing resources, and so on are all integrated with or are part
of this process.
    Direct and Manage Project Execution is where the rubber meets the road. If you've done
a good job planning the project, things should go relatively smoothly for you during this pro-
cess. The deliverables and requirements are agreed upon, the resources have been identified
and are ready to go, and the stakeholders know exactly where you're headed because you had
them review, agree to, and approve the project plan.
                                                       Executing the Project Plan              335




   Some project managers think this is the time for them to kick back and put their feet up.
After all, the project plan is done, everyone knows what to do and what's expected of them,
and the work of the project should almost carry itself out because your project plan is a
work of genius, right? Wrong! You must stay involved. Your job now is a matter of oversee-
ing the actual work, staying on top of issues and problems, and keeping the work lined up
with the project plan.



Exam Spotlight

The project plan serves as the project baseline. During the Executing processes, you should
continually compare and monitor project performance against the baseline so that correc-
tive actions can be taken and implemented at the right time to prevent disaster. This infor-
mation will also be fed into the Monitoring and Controlling processes for further analysis.



   One of the most difficult aspects of this process is coordinating and integrating all the
elements of the project. Although you do have the project plan as your guide, you still have
a lot of balls in the air. You'll find yourself coordinating and monitoring many project
elements--occasionally all at the same time--during the course of the Direct and Manage
Project Execution process. You might be negotiating for team members at the same time
you're negotiating with vendors at the same time you're working with another manager
to get a project component completed so your deliverables stay on schedule. You should
monitor risks and risk triggers closely. The Plan Procurements process might need interven-
tion or cause you delays. The organizational, technical, and interpersonal interfaces might
require intense coordination and oversight. And of course, you should always be concerned
about the pulse of your stakeholders. Are they actively involved in the project? Are they
throwing up roadblocks now that the work has started?
   According to the PMBOK(R) Guide, this process also requires implementing corrective
actions to bring the work of the project back into alignment with the project plan, preven-
tive actions to reduce the probability of negative consequences, and defect repairs to correct
product defects discovered during the quality processes.
   As you can see, your work as project manager is not done yet. Many elements of the
project require your attention, so let's get to work.


                 Later in this chapter I'll also talk about Develop Project Team because this
                 is an integral part of the Direct and Manage Project Execution process as
                 well. You'll want to monitor the team's performance, the status of their
                 work, and their interactions with you and other team members as you
                 execute the project plan.

Executing Inputs
Direct and Manage Project Execution has four inputs:
NN    Project management plan
NN    Approved change requests
NN    Enterprise environmental factors
NN    Organization process assets
   The project management plan documents the collection of outputs of the Planning pro-
cesses and describes and defines how the project should be executed, monitored, controlled,
and closed. You'll take a brief look at each of the other inputs next.

Approved Change Requests
Approved change requests come about as a result of the change request status updates output
of the Perform Integrated Change Control process. (We'll cover this process in Chapter 10,
"Measuring and Controlling Project Performance"). Change requests are approved or denied
during this process, and once the decision has been made, approved changes come back
through the Direct and Manage Project Execution process for the project team to implement.
   Approved changes might either expand or reduce project scope and may also cause
revisions to project budgets, schedules, procedures, project management plans, and so on.
Change requests can be internal or external to the project or organization. For example,
you may need to make changes because of a new law that affects your project.

Enterprise Environmental Factors
There are several enterprise environmental factors to consider when performing this process,
including the company culture and organizational structure, the facilities available to the
project team, personnel guidelines and hiring practices, risk tolerance levels, and project
management information systems.

Organizational Process Assets
Like many of the other processes we've covered, historical information from past projects,
organizational guidelines, and work processes are some of the organizational process assets
you should consider when performing this process. In addition, measurement databases and
issue and defect databases can be used in this process to compare past projects to the current
project and to capture information about the current project for future reference.


Tools and Techniques of Direct and
Manage Project Execution
The tools and techniques of the Direct and Manage Project Execution process are expert
judgment and project management information system. You've looked at both of these before.
Remember that in the Executing processes, you'll be actively using both of these tools, con-
sulting with stakeholders, professionals, and others and employing the project management
                                                         Executing the Project Plan             337




methodology you've developed in the Planning process and using the project management
information system to update and track progress.
   Some of the outputs of this process are going to look familiar and some are new. We'll
examine them next.


Outputs of Direct and Manage Project Execution
The outputs of the Direct and Manage Project Execution process are as follows:
NN   Deliverables
NN   Work performance information
NN   Change requests
NN   Project management plan updates
NN   Project document updates
   The three most important outputs of this process are deliverables (meaning actually accom-
plishing the activities leading to the completion of the product, result, or service you set out to
produce), work performance information, and change requests. Almost every process you've
performed up to this point has defined and outlined what the work of the project entails and
what the final results should look like. Now you're ready to begin performing the work. Let's
look at these three outputs that will help us document our progress.

Deliverables
During Direct and Manage Project Execution, you'll gather and record information
regarding the outcomes of the work, including activity completion dates, milestone
completions, the status of the deliverables, the quality of the deliverables, costs, schedule
progress and updates, and so on. Deliverables aren't always tangible. For example, perhaps
your team members require training on a piece of specialized equipment. Completion of
the training is recorded as a work result. Capabilities required to perform a service that's
described in the project management plan are also considered a deliverable. All of this
information gets used during the Performance Reporting process, which I'll discuss during
the Monitoring and Controlling processes.
   Executing and Monitoring and Controlling are two process groups that work hand in
hand. As you gather the information from work results, you'll measure the outputs and
take corrective actions where necessary. This means you'll loop back through the Executing
processes to put the corrections into place. The PMBOK(R) Guide breaks these processes up
for ease of explanation, but in practice, you'll work through several of the Executing and
Monitoring and Controlling processes together.

Work Performance Information
Work performance information concerns gathering, documenting, and recording the status
of project activities. The types of information you might gather during this process include
some of the following:
NN   Schedule status and progress
338         Chapter 8   n   Developing the Project Team



NN    Status of deliverable completion
NN    Progress and status of schedule activities
NN    Adherence to quality standards
NN    Status of costs (those authorized and costs incurred to date)
NN    Schedule activity completion estimates for those activities started
NN    Schedule activities percent complete
NN    Lessons learned
NN    Resource consumption and utilization
   Work performance information becomes an input to a few of the Monitoring and Con-
trolling processes where you'll perform further analysis on the data. It's important that
you document this information so that when you get to the Monitoring and Controlling
processes, you don't have to backtrack.

Change Requests
As a result of working through activities and producing your product, service, or result, you
will inevitably come upon things that need to be changed. Changes can also come about
from stakeholder requests, external sources, technological advances, and so on. These change
requests might encompass schedule, scope, requirement, or resource changes. The list really
could go on. Your job as project manager, if you choose to accept it, is to collect the change
requests and make determinations about their impact on the project.
   Implementation of change requests may incorporate two types of actions: corrective
actions or preventive actions. They may also require defect repairs. Each of these topics
are described next.
Corrective actions In my organization, a corrective action means an employee is in big
trouble. Fortunately, this isn't what's meant here. Corrective actions are taken to get the antici-
pated future project outcomes to align with the project plan. Maybe you've discovered that
one of your programmers is adding an unplanned feature to the software project because he's
friends with the user. You'll have to redirect him to the activities assigned to him originally
to avoid schedule delays. Perhaps your vendor isn't able to deliver the laboratory equipment
needed for the next project phase. You'll want to exercise your contract options (let's hope
there's a clause in the contract that says the vendor must provide rental equipment until they
can deliver your order), put your contingency plan into place, and get the lab the equipment
that's needed to keep the project on schedule.
Preventive action Preventive action involves anything that will reduce the potential impacts
of risk events should they occur. Contingency plans and risk responses are examples of pre-
ventive action. I described these and other risk responses while talking about the Plan Risk
Response process in Chapter 6. You should be aware of contingency plans and risk responses
so that you're ready to implement them at the first sign of trouble.
Defect repairs A defect occurs when a project component does not meet the require-
ments or specifications. Defects might be discovered when conducting quality audits in the
                                                      Executing the Project Plan             339




Perform Quality Assurance process or when performing inspections during the Perform
Quality Control process.
You should understand the difference between a validated defect repair and a defect repair
for the exam. A validated defect repair is the result of a reinspection of the original defect
repair. In other words, you found a problem with the product during the Quality processes,
you corrected the problem (defect repair), and now you're reinspecting that repair (vali-
dated defect repair) to make certain the fix is accurate, correct, and fixed the problem.
   I'll discuss change requests more in the coming chapters as well. Change requests are an
output of several processes, including the Direct and Manage Project Execution process
and the Report Performance process in the Monitoring and Controlling process group.
Remember that Executing and Monitoring and Controlling outputs feed each other as
inputs. And in this particular case, approved change requests are an input, and change
requests are an output of the same process.




We All Scream for Ice Cream

Heather is a pharmaceutical sales person who is fed up with the rat race. She ran the num-
bers, decided to quit her day job, and bought an ice cream shop in a quaint tourist town.
Having been involved in a few research and development projects, she understands the
value of project management planning and using that plan as her guide to perform the work
of the project.

Heather documented the deliverables needed to prepare for opening day in her scope
statement. Some of those deliverables are as follows: remodel, develop staffing plan,
procure equipment, and procure materials. Confident in her planning, Heather hired a
contractor and began remodeling the shop. And then real life happened. The contractors
discovered a water problem in the storage room. They installed a sump pump, which took
care of the water, but discovered an even bigger problem when they moved the storage
shelves. There was mold growing up the drywall. The drywall had to be removed, as did
the insulation behind it, and the mold remaining on permanent fixtures had to be elimi-
nated. Then new insulation and drywall had to be installed. The drywall had to be primed
and painted, and Heather decided since that portion of the storage room was getting a
fresh coat of paint, the contractors might as well paint the entire room.

All of these actions required another pass through the Planning processes. The sched-
ule didn't require much modification because other work could be started at the same
time the water problem was being addressed, but the budget needed to be modified as
a result of the additional work. To avoid more surprises, Heather requested that the con-
tractor perform a thorough inspection of the property and determine whether there were
any other hidden issues. Armed with the inspection report, Heather could knowledgeably
plan corrective action for other items that needed to be addressed.

Exam Spotlight

Direct and Manage Project Execution is where the work of the project is performed and
the project plan is put into action and carried out. In this process, the project manager is
like an orchestra conductor signaling the instruments to begin their activities, monitoring
what should be winding down, and keeping that smile going to remind everyone that they
should be enjoying themselves. I recommend that you know the outputs of the Direct and
Manage Project Execution process for the exam.



   I told you the Executing process group is about performing the work of the project, and
in order to do that, you need resources. You'll look at two processes, Acquire the Project
Team and Develop the Project Team, in the next few sections.



Acquiring the Project Team
The Acquire Project Team process involves attaining and assigning human resources to the
project. Project staff might come from inside the company or from outside the company
in the form of employees hired specifically for the project or as contract help. In any case,
it's your job as the project manager to ensure that resources are available and skilled in the
project activities to which they're assigned. However, in practice, you might find that you
don't always have control over the selection of team members. Someone else, the big boss
for example, might handpick the folks they want working on the project, and it's up to you
to assess their skills and decide where they best fit on the project.
    The Acquire Project Team process inputs are as follows:
NN    Project management plan
NN    Enterprise environmental factors
NN    Organizational process assets
   The project management plan describes the roles and responsibilities, project organization
charts, and staffing management plan by way of subsidiary plans.
   Enterprise environmental factors in this process account for project activities that might
require special skills or knowledge in order to be completed. They may also consider per-
sonal interests, cost rates, prior experience, and availability of potential team members
before making assignments. For example, consider the previous experience of the staff
member you're thinking of assigning to a specific activity. Have they performed this func-
tion before? Do they have the experience necessary for the level of complexity this project
activity calls for? Are they competent and proficient at these skills?
   Personal interests and personal characteristics play a big role as well. If the person you're
thinking of just isn't interested in the project, they aren't likely to perform at their best. If
you can, think about assigning someone else in a case like this. Unfortunately, some people
                                                       Acquiring the Project Team            341




just don't play well with others. When you're assigning staff, if at all possible, don't put the
only two people in the whole company who can't get along together on the same project. If a
staff member you need has a skill no one else has or they can perform a function like no one
else can, you might not have a choice. In this case, you'll have to employ other techniques
to keep the team cohesive and working well together despite the not-so-friendly relationship
between the two staff members.
   One final consideration: Check on the availability of key team members. If the team
member you must have for the activity scheduled in February is on their honeymoon, you
probably aren't going to win the toss.



Exam Spotlight

Remember that the availability, experience levels, interests, cost, and abilities of your
resources are considered part of the enterprise environmental factors input. You should
understand these inputs and their importance to the Acquire Project Team process for
the exam.



   The organizational process assets input refers to standard processes, policies, and pro-
cedures the organization has in place. Recruitment practices are one example to watch for
in this process. You'll want to make certain you're following the organization's recruitment
procedures and processes when hiring and assigning staff. You should also note that orga-
nizational policies that dictate recruitment practices are constraints.
   We've looked at the other inputs in previous processes, so we'll move on to the tools and
techniques of this process.


Tools and Techniques of Acquire Project Team
The tools and techniques of the Acquire Project Team process are as follows:
NN   Pre-assignment negotiation
NN   Acquisitions
NN   Virtual teams

Pre-Assignment Pre-assignment can happen when the project is put out for bid and specific
team members are promised as part of the proposal or when internal project team members
are promised and assigned as a condition of the project. When staff members are promised
as part of the project proposal--particularly on internal projects--they should be identified
in the project charter.
Negotiation As the project manager, you will use the negotiation technique a lot, so brush
up on those skills every chance you get. You'll have to negotiate with functional managers and
other organizational department managers--and sometimes with the vendor to get some of
their best people--for resources for your project and for the timing of those resources.
342         Chapter 8   n   Developing the Project Team



Availability is one part of the negotiating equation. You'll have to work with the functional
manager or other project managers to ensure that the staff member you're requesting is
available when the schedule says they're needed.
The second part of the equation is the competency level of the staff member they're assigning
to your project. I remember hearing someone say once that availability is not a skill set. Be
wary of functional managers who are willing to offer up certain individuals "anytime" while
others are "never available." Be certain your negotiations include discussions about the skills
and personal characteristics of the team members you want on your project.
Acquisition Acquisition involves hiring individuals or teams of people for certain project
activities, either as employees or as contract help during the course of the project or project
phase or for specific project activities. Procurement is usually required when the organiza-
tion does not have employees with the required skills and competencies available to work
on the project.


                   We talked about Plan Procurements in Chapter 7, "Planning Project
                   Resources."


Virtual teams Virtual teams are the last tool and technique of this process. Virtual teams
don't necessarily work in the same location, but their members all share the goals of the
project and have a role to fulfill. This type of team allows you to include folks from different
geographic locations, those who work different hours or shifts than the other team members,
those with mobility limitations, and so on. According to the PMBOK(R) Guide, "Virtual teams
can be defined as groups of people with a shared goal, who fulfill their roles with little or no
time spent meeting face to face." In today's wonderful world of technology, team members can
use the Internet, email, videoconferencing, teleconferencing, and more to meet and communi-
cate on a regular basis. This of course brings to light the importance of communication. Make
certain all team members are aware of the protocols for communicating in a virtual team envi-
ronment, understand the expectations, and are clear regarding decision making processes.
It's vital in this type of team structure that you, as the project manager, give credit to the
appropriate team members for their performance and actions on the project. You might
be the only one who fully understands the contributions individual team members have
made. When teams are co-located, members have the opportunity to see for themselves the
extraordinary efforts others are making on the project. Virtual team members don't nec-
essarily know what their teammates have contributed to the project (or the level of effort
they've exerted), so it's up to you to let everyone know about outstanding performance.


Outputs of Acquire Project Team
The resulting outputs of the Acquire Project Team process are as follows:
NN    Project staff assignment
NN    Resource calendars
NN    Project management plan updates
                                                        Acquiring the Project Team                343




Project staff assignment Your ability to influence the selection of resources (using the
negotiating technique) will impact the project staff assignment output. After determining
elements such as the roles and responsibilities, reviewing recruitment practices, and negotiat-
ing for staff, you assign project team members to project activities. Along with this output, a
project team directory is published listing the names of all project team members and stake-
holders. Don't forget to also include team member names in project organization charts,
RAM charts, and other planning documents if their assignments or names weren't known
when you created those documents.
Resource calendars Resource calendars show the team members' availability and the times
they are scheduled to work on the project. A composite resource calendar includes availability
information for potential resources as well as their capabilities and skills. (Resource calendars
are an input to the Estimate Activity Resources process). This comes in handy when you're
creating the final schedule and assigning resources to activities.




The Only Candidate

"Hey, did you hear?" your friend Story asks. "Roger has been assigned to the project team."

"Over my dead body," you reply, pushing away from your computer screen. You head
straight for the project manager's office and don't wait for a response from Story.

Ann sets the phone into the cradle just as you walk through the door. Fortunately for you,
Ann's door is always open, and she welcomes drop-ins.

"Seems like something is on your mind," Ann says. "What can I help with?"

"Story just told me that Roger has been assigned to the project team. I can't work with
Roger. He's arrogant and doesn't respect anyone's work but his own. He belittles me in
front of others, and I don't deserve that. I write good code, and I don't need Roger looking
over my shoulder. I want to be on this team, but not if Roger is part of it."

Ann thinks for a minute and replies, "I want you to work on this project; it's a great opportu-
nity for you. But there isn't anyone else who can work on the analysis phase of this project
except Roger. He's the only one left who has a solid understanding of the mainframe legacy
code. Unfortunately, those old programs were never documented well, and they've evolved
over the years into programs on top of programs. Without Roger's knowledge of the exist-
ing system, we'd blow the budget and time estimates already established for this project.
Since I need both of you on this project, here's what I propose. I will clearly outline the
roles and responsibilities for all the key team members at the kickoff meeting. I'll also make
it clear that negative team interactions won't be allowed. And if you have a problem with
Roger that you can't resolve on your own, you should get me involved right away."
344        Chapter 8   n   Developing the Project Team



Project management plan updates The time periods your project staff are available are
documented in the resource calendars output. The human resource plan and staffing man-
agement plan might require updates to document the project roles and responsibilities of the
staff assigned to the project. These documents might require updates throughout the project
if you have staff members leave because of a promotion or, heaven forbid, if they leave for
employment in another company (unless you want them to leave--that's another story).
    Now that you have the team, what do you do with them? You'll look at topics such as
motivation, rewards, and recognition in the next process, Develop Project Team.



Developing the Project Team
Projects exist to create a unique product, result, or service within a limited time frame.
Projects are performed by people, and most projects require more than one person to
perform all of the activities. If you've got more than one person working on your project,
you've got a team. And if you've got a team, you've got a wide assortment of personalities,
skills, needs, and issues in the mix. Couple this with part-time team members, teams based
in functional organizations whose loyalty lies with the functional manager, or teams based
in matrix organizations that report to you for project-related activities and another man-
ager for their functional duties, and you could have some real challenges on your hands.
Good luck--OK, I won't leave you hanging like that.
   The Develop Project Team process is about creating an open, encouraging environment
for your team and developing it into an effective, functioning, coordinated group. Projects are
performed by individuals, and the better they work together, the smoother and the more effi-
cient the execution of the project will be. I'm sure you all have had the experience of working
with a team that pitched in and shared workloads when the work became unbalanced. I'm
also sure you all have worked with teams that didn't do this--teams whose members took on
a "me first" attitude and couldn't care less about the plight of their fellow team members. I'd
much rather work with a team like the first example.


                 The proper development of the team is critical to a successful project. Since
                 teams are made up of individuals, individual development becomes a critical
                 factor to project success. Individual team members need the proper devel-
                 opment and training to perform the activities of the project or to enhance
                 their existing knowledge and skills. The development needed will depend
                 on the project. Perhaps you have a team member who's ready to make the
                 jump into a lead role but they don't have any experience at lead work. Give
                 them some exposure by assigning them a limited amount of activities in a
                 lead capacity, provide them with some training if needed, and be available to
                 coach and mentor where needed. The best option is to work with the man-
                 agement team to provide this person with the development they need prior
                 to the start of the project (if you're lucky enough to know early on who your
                 resources might be and what their existing skills are).
                                                       Developing the Project Team             345




   Develop Project Team inputs include project staff assignments, project management
plan, and resource calendars. Funny thing, these inputs are all outputs that I discussed in
the Acquire Project Team process, so we'll move on.


Tools and Techniques of Develop Project Team
The tools and techniques of Develop Project Team are as follows:
NN    Interpersonal skills
NN    Training
NN    Team-building activities
NN    Ground rules
NN    Co-location
NN    Recognition and rewards
     I'll cover all these tools and techniques next.

Interpersonal Skills
Interpersonal skills are often referred to as soft skills. Soft skills include such things as lead-
ership, influence, negotiation, communications, empathy, and creativity. For example, it's
important for you as the project manager to have an understanding of your project team
members' attitudes and opinions about their work. Bad attitudes, like the saying goes, are
contagious. It doesn't mean the person who has the attitude is bad, but if you're paying
attention to your team members and taking the appropriate amount of time to listen to their
legitimate concerns and issues, and taking action on them, you can go a long way toward
stemming bad attitudes.
   Soft skills can be learned but in my experience are more often inherent in project manag-
ers' personalities. But just because certain soft skills may not be in your nature, it doesn't
mean you can't observe this behavior in others and incorporate them into your manage-
ment techniques.
   One other issue to consider regarding this tool and technique is that you'll have resources
from other departments who have assignments on the project that you're responsible for
overseeing. For example, the finance department and the marketing department might have
assigned project activities, and as the project manager, you'll manage their progress. This
implies that you'll need general knowledge management skills to understand what the assign-
ments entail and strong leadership and negotiation skills to influence the departments to stay
on schedule.

Training
Training is a matter of assessing your team members' skills and abilities, assessing the project
needs, and providing the training necessary for the team members to carry out their assigned
activities. Training can sometimes be a reward as well. In the software industry, program-
mers seek out positions that offer training on the latest and greatest technologies, and they
346        Chapter 8   n   Developing the Project Team



consider it a benefit or bonus to attend training on the company dollar and time. If you know
early in the Planning processes that training is necessary, include the details of this in the
staffing management plan. During the course of the project, you might observe team mem-
bers who need training, or they might ask for training. Update the staffing management plan
with this information.

Team-Building Activities
Many times, project teams consist of folks who don't know each other. They aren't neces-
sarily aware of the project objectives and might not even want to be a part of the team. The
project manager might not have worked with the people assigned to the project team before
either. Sound like a recipe for disaster? It's not. Thousands of projects are started with team
members and project managers who don't know each other, and those projects come to a
successful completion. How is that done? It's a result of the project manager's team-building
and communication skills.
    The project manager's job is to bring the team together, get its members all headed in the
right direction, and provide motivation, reward, and recognition to keep the team in tip-top
shape. This is done using a variety of team-building techniques and exercises. Team building
is simply getting a diverse group of people to work together in the most efficient and effective
manner possible. This might involve events organized by the management team or individual
actions designed to improve team performance. There are entire volumes on this subject, and
it's beyond the scope of this book to go into all the team-building possibilities. The exam
tends to focus more on the theories behind team building and the characteristics of effective
teams, so that's what you'll spend your time exploring.
    Dr. Bruce Tuckman developed a model that describes how teams develop and mature.
According to Tuckman, all newly formed teams go through five stages of development:
1.    Forming
2.    Storming
3.    Norming
4.    Performing
5.    Adjourning
    Tuckman originally devised this theory using the first four stages of development. Based
on later research by Tuckman and Mary Ann Jensen, a fifth stage of development was added
called adjourning. You may see this model referred to as the Tuckman-Jensen model in other
literature, and you might want to tuck that piece of information away for the exam. You've
probably seen this model elsewhere, but since these stages might show up on the exam, you'll
want to memorize them. Take a brief look at each of them:
Forming This one is easy. Forming is the beginning stage of team formation, when all the
members are brought together, introduced, and told the objectives of the project. This is
where team members learn why they're working together. During this stage, team members
tend to be formal and reserved and take on an "all-business" approach.
                                                     Developing the Project Team              347




Storming Storming is where the action begins. Team members become confrontational
with each other as they're vying for position and control during this stage. They're working
through who is going to be the top dog and jockeying for status.
Norming Now things begin to calm down. Team members know each other fairly well
by now. They're comfortable with their positions in the team, and they begin to deal with
project problems instead of people problems. In the norming stage, they confront the project
concerns and problems instead of each other. Decisions are made jointly at this stage, and
team members exhibit mutual respect and familiarity with one another.
Performing Ahh, perfection. Well, almost, anyway. This is where great teams end up.
This stage is where the team is productive and effective. The level of trust among team
members is high, and great things are achieved. This is the mature development stage.
Adjourning As the name implies, this phase refers to the breakup of the team after the
work is completed.



Exam Spotlight

Different teams progress through the stages of development at different rates. When new
team members are brought onto the team, the development stages start all over again. It
doesn't matter where the team is in the first four phases of the development process--a new
member will start the cycle all over again.



   According to Tuckman, leaders adapt their leadership styles as the teams develop maturity
and progress through the development stages. For example, early in the forming stage, leaders
take on a direct style of leadership. As the team progresses, their leaders will employ a coach-
ing, participating, and then delegating style of leadership to match the level of development
the team has achieved.
   You'll now take a closer look at focusing your team members throughout these stages of
development, along with some of the characteristics of effective teams.

Team Focus
Have you ever watched any of those old pirate movies on late-night TV? Remember the
scenes where the captain goes down into the bowels of the ship to check on the teams of
rowers? He scrutinizes the crew and literally whips the rowers who aren't pulling their
weight into shape. I don't recommend this as a team-building technique, but imagine for a
minute that your project team members are like those rowing teams. If the members on the
left are rowing one way and the members on the right are rowing another, you're creating a
lot of energy and looking busy, but in the end you aren't making any progress.
    It's paramount that the team members know and understand the goals and objectives
of the project. They should all understand the direction you're headed and work toward
348         Chapter 8   n   Developing the Project Team



that end. After all, that's the reason they've been brought together in the first place. Keep
in mind that people see and hear things from their own perspective. A room full of people
attending a speech will each come away with something a little different because what
was said speaks to their particular situation in life at the time. In other words, their own
perceptions filter what they hear. It's your job as project manager to make certain the team
members understand the project goals and their own assignments correctly. I suggest you
use solid communication skills to get your point across. Ask your team members to tell
you in their own words what they believe the project goals are. This is a great way to know
whether you've got everyone on board and a great opportunity for you to clarify any mis-
understandings regarding the project goals.

Effective Team Characteristics
Effective teams are typically very energetic teams. They often are characterized as high-
performance teams and are motivated by results and the successful completion of tasks. Their
enthusiasm is contagious, and it feeds on itself. They generate a lot of creativity and become
good problem solvers. Teams like this are every project manager's dream. Investing yourself
in team building as well as relationship building--especially when you don't think you have
the time to do so--will bring many benefits. Here's a sample of the benefits:
NN    Better conflict resolution
NN    Commitment to the project
NN    Commitment to the project team members and project manager
NN    High job satisfaction
NN    Enhanced communication
NN    A sense of belonging and purpose
NN    A successful project
   Dysfunctional teams will typically produce the opposite results of the benefits just listed.
Dysfunctional teams don't just happen by themselves any more than great teams do. Sure,
sometimes you're lucky enough to get the right combination of folks together right off the
bat. But usually, team building takes work and dedication on the part of the project man-
ager. Even in the situations where you do get that dynamite combination of people, they
will benefit from team-building exercises and feedback.
   Unfortunately, sour attitudes are just as contagious as enthusiasm. Watch for these
symptoms among your team members, and take action to correct the situation before the
entire team is affected:
NN    Lack of motivation or "don't care" attitudes
NN    Project work that isn't satisfying
NN    Status meetings that turn into whining sessions
NN    Poor communication
NN    Lack of respect and lack of trust for the project manager
                                                        Developing the Project Team               349




                   No amount of team building will make up for poor project planning or inef-
                   fective project management techniques. Neglecting these things and fooling
                   yourself into thinking that your project team is good enough to make up for
                   the poor planning or poor techniques could spell doom for your project. And
                   besides that, it's not fair to your project team to put them in that position.



Ground Rules
Ground rules are expectations set by the project manager and project team that describe
acceptable team behavior. For example, one of my pet peeves is team members who interrupt
each other. In this case, one of the ground rules is one person speaks at a time during a meet-
ing. Another ground rule might be reporting potential issues as soon as the team member
becomes aware of them. Outlining ground rules like this helps the team understand expecta-
tions regarding acceptable behavior and increases productivity.

Co-location
Team members are often in the same physical location--for example, the same office building
or meeting space. This tool and technique is called co-location. Co-location enables teams
to function more effectively than if they're spread out among different localities. Many times
on large projects, the project manager will make provisions in the project budget to bring the
team together at the same location. (It's difficult, but not impossible, to manage project team
members who are not physically located together.) One way to achieve co-location might be
to set aside a common meeting room, sometimes called a war room, for team members who
are located in different buildings or across town to meet and exchange information.
   Multiple locations can also be a big time waster for you as the project manager and for
your team members. If some team members are located in one part of town and another set of
team members are located across town, you'll find yourself in the car (or the bus) driving back
and forth to make face-to-face contact and get status updates. Conducting team meetings also
becomes a hassle as one set of team members or the other must drive to another location (or
both to a central location) to have a meeting.
   Our busy, conflicting schedules and differences in location don't always allow for face-
to-face communication, so email is the next best thing. I'm a huge email fan--it's one of my
favorite forms of communication. Email can keep the information flowing when you aren't
able to meet in person, and it can even help take the heat out of conflicts that might escalate if
you were meeting one on one. However, email cannot reveal tone of voice, facial expressions,
or body language. Sometimes those nonverbal cues are more important than what's being
said. If you don't know your team members or stakeholders well, I recommend meeting with
them personally whenever you can. Once you've established good relationships with them, you
should be able to balance the use of email and personal interactions and know when it's time
to call a face-to-face meeting. In reality, it's often difficult to get your team together physically.
A good solution in lieu of having people relocate is videoconferencing or conference calling.
Team members scattered across the country all have access to the telephone, and it's relatively
350        Chapter 8   n   Developing the Project Team



easy to find a time everyone can meet over the phone. Videoconferencing is the best option if
it's available because it allows intonation and nonverbal behaviors to be part of the communi-
cation process.

Recognition and Rewards
I have quite a bit of ground to cover with recognition and rewards. As I said earlier, you
could see several exam questions regarding team building, so dig out all your favorite mem-
orization techniques and put them to use.
    Team building starts with project planning and doesn't stop until the project is completed.
It involves employing techniques to improve your team's performance and in keeping team
members motivated. Motivation helps people work more efficiently and produce better results.
If clear expectations, clear procedures, and the right motivational tools are used, project teams
will excel.
    Motivation can be extrinsic or intrinsic. Extrinsic motivators are material rewards and
might include bonuses, the use of a company car, stock options, gift certificates, training
opportunities, extra time off, and so on.
    Intrinsic motivators are specific to the individual. Some people are just naturally driven
to achieve--it's part of their nature. (I suspect this is a motivator for you since you're read-
ing this book.) Cultural and religious influences are forms of intrinsic motivators as well.
Reward and recognition--a tool and technique of the Develop Project Team process--are
examples of extrinsic motivators. We'll look at them next.
    Recognition and rewards are an important part of team motivation. They are formal
ways of recognizing and promoting desirable behavior and are most effective when carried
out by the management team and the project manager. You should develop and document
the criteria for rewards, especially monetary awards. Although rewards and recognition help
build a team, they can also kill morale if you don't have an established method or criteria
for handing them out. Track who is receiving awards throughout the project. For example, if
you have consistent overachievers on the team, you could kill morale by consistently reward-
ing the same one or two people repeatedly. It could also be perceived that you're playing
favorites. If team members believe the rewards are win-lose (also known as zero-sum) and
that only certain team members will be rewarded, you might end up hurting morale more
than helping. If you find yourself in this position, consider team awards. This is a win-win
because all team members are recognized for their contributions. Recognition and rewards
should be proportional to the achievement. In other words, appropriately link the reward
to the performance. For example, a project manager who has responsibility for the project
budget and the procurement process and keeps the costs substantially under budget without
sacrificing the results of the project should be rewarded for this achievement. However, if
these responsibilities are assigned to a functional manager in the organization, it wouldn't
be appropriate to reward a project manager who was not the one responsible for keeping the
costs in line.
    Team members should be rewarded for going above and beyond the call of duty. Perhaps
they put in a significant amount of overtime to meet a project goal or spent nights round-the-
clock babysitting ill-performing equipment. These types of behaviors should be rewarded and
formally recognized by the project manager and the management team. On the other hand,
                                                     Developing the Project Team                351




if the ill-performing equipment was a direct result of mistakes made or if it happened because
of poor planning, rewards would not be appropriate, obviously.
    Consider individual preferences and cultural differences when using rewards and rec-
ognitions. Some people don't like to be recognized in front of a group; others thrive on it.
Some people appreciate an honest thank-you with minimal fanfare, and others just won't
accept individual rewards as their culture doesn't allow it. Keep this in mind when devising
your reward system.
    There are many theories on motivation. As a project manager, it's important to understand
them so that you can tailor your recognition and rewards programs to take into account the
reasons people do what they do. You might encounter questions on these theories on the exam,
so we'll discuss their primary points in the following sections.




Baker's Gift Baskets

You're a contract project manager for Baker's Gift Baskets. This company assembles gift
baskets of all styles and shapes with every edible treat imaginable. The company has
recently experienced explosive growth, and you've been brought on board to manage
its new project. The owners of the company want to offer "pick-your-own" baskets that
allow customers to pick the individual items they want included in the basket. In addi-
tion, they're introducing a new line of containers to choose from, including items such as
miniature golf bags, flowerpots, serving bowls, and the like. This means changes to the
catalog and the website to accommodate the new offerings.

The deadline for this project is the driving constraint. The website changes won't cause
any problems with the deadline. However, the catalog must go to press quickly to meet
holiday mailing deadlines, which in turn are driving the project deadline.

Your team members put their heads together and came up with an ingenious plan to
meet the catalog deadline. It required lots of overtime and some weekend work on their
part to pull it off, but they met the date.

You decide this is a perfect opportunity to recognize and reward the team for their out-
standing efforts. You've arranged a slot on the agenda at the next all-company meeting to
bring your team up front and praise them for their cooperation and efforts to get the cata-
log to the printers on time. You'll also present each of them with two days of paid time off
and a gift certificate for a dinner with their family at an exclusive restaurant in the city.




Motivational Theories
Motivational theories came about during the modern age. Prior to today's information-
and service-type jobs and yesterday's factory work, the majority of people worked the
land and barely kept enough food on the table to feed their family. No one was concerned
352        Chapter 8   n   Developing the Project Team



about motivation at work. You worked because you wouldn't have anything to eat if you
didn't. Fortunately, that isn't the only reason most people work today.
   Today we have a new set of problems in the workplace. Workers in the service- and
knowledge-based industries aren't concerned with starvation--that need has been replaced
with other needs such as job satisfaction, a sense of belonging and commitment to the project,
good working conditions, and so on. Motivational theories present ideas on why people act
the way they do and how you can influence them to act in certain ways to get the results you
want. Again, there are libraries full of books on this topic. I'll cover four of them here.
Maslow's Hierarchy of Needs
You have probably seen this classic example of motivational theory. Abraham Maslow the-
orized that humans have five basic needs arranged in hierarchical order. The first needs are
physical needs, such as the need for food, clothing, and shelter. The idea is that these needs
must be met before the person can move to the next level of needs in the hierarchy, which
includes safety and security needs. Here, the concern is for the person's physical welfare
and the security of their belongings. Once that need is met, they progress to the next level,
and so on.
    Maslow's hierarchy of needs theory suggests that once a lower-level need has been met, it
no longer serves as a motivator and the next higher level becomes the driving motivator in a
person's life. Maslow conjectures that humans are always in one state of need or another. Here
is a recap of each of the needs, starting with the highest level and ending with the lowest:
Self-actualization   Performing at your peak potential
Self-esteem needs Accomplishment, respect for self, capability
Social needs A sense of belonging, love, acceptance, friendship
Safety and security needs     Your physical welfare and the security of your belongings
Basic physical needs   Food, clothing, shelter
   The highest level of motivation in this theory is the state of self-actualization. The
United States Army had a slogan a few years ago that I think encapsulates self-actualization
very well: "Be all that you can be." When all the physical, safety, social, and self-esteem
needs have been met, a person reaches a state of independence where they're able to express
themselves and perform at their peak. They'll do good work just for the sake of doing good
work. Recognition and self-esteem are the motivators at lower levels; now the need for
being the best they can be is reached.


                 In Maslow's later work, he discussed three additional aspects of motiva-
                 tion: cognitive, aesthetic, and transcendence. The five key needs are the
                 ones you'll most likely need to know for the exam, but it wouldn't hurt to
                 be familiar with the names of the three additional motivational levels.


Hygiene Theory
Frederick Herzberg came up with the Hygiene Theory, also known as the Motivation-
Hygiene Theory. He postulates that two factors contribute to motivation: hygiene factors
                                                     Developing the Project Team            353




and motivators. Hygiene factors deal with work environment issues. The thing to remember
about hygiene factors is that they prevent dissatisfaction. Examples of hygiene factors are
pay, benefits, the conditions of the work environment, and relationships with peers and
managers. Pay is considered a hygiene factor because Herzberg believed that over the long
term, pay is not a motivator. Being paid for the work prevents dissatisfaction but doesn't
necessarily bring satisfaction in and of itself. He believed this to be true as long as the pay
system is equitable. If two workers performing the same functions have large disparities in
pay, then pay can become a motivator.
    Motivators deal with the substance of the work itself and the satisfaction one derives
from performing the functions of the job. Motivators lead to satisfaction. The ability to
advance, the opportunity to learn new skills, and the challenges involved in the work are
all motivators according to Herzberg.



Exam Spotlight

For the exam, remember that Herzberg was the inventor of the Hygiene Theory and that
this theory claims that hygiene factors (pay, benefits, and working conditions) prevent
dissatisfaction while motivators (challenging work, opportunities to learn, and advance-
ment) lead to satisfaction.




Expectancy Theory
The Expectancy Theory, first proposed by Victor Vroom, says that the expectation of a posi-
tive outcome drives motivation. People will behave in certain ways if they think there will
be good rewards for doing so. Also note that this theory says the strength of the expectancy
drives the behavior. This means the expectation or likelihood of the reward is linked to the
behavior. For example, if you tell your two-year-old to put the toys back in the toy box and
you'll give her a cookie to do so, chances are she'll put the toys away. This is a reasonable
reward for a reasonable action. However, if you promise your project team members vacations
in Hawaii if they get the project done early and they know there is no way you can deliver that
reward, there is little motivation to work toward it.
   This theory also says that people become what you expect of them. If you openly praise
your project team members and treat them like valuable contributors, you'll likely have a
high-performing team on your hands. Conversely, when you publicly criticize people or let
them know that you have low expectations regarding their performance, they'll likely live
up (or down as the case might be) to that expectation as well.
Achievement Theory
Achievement Theory, attributed to David McClelland, says that people are motivated by
the need for three things: achievement, power, and affiliation. The achievement motiva-
tion is obviously the need to achieve or succeed. The power motivation involves a desire
for influencing the behavior of others. And the need for affiliation is relationship oriented.
Workers want to have friendships with their co-workers and a sense of camaraderie with
354        Chapter 8   n   Developing the Project Team



their fellow team members. The strength of your team members' desire for each of these
will drive their performance on various activities.



Exam Spotlight

Make certain you understand the theories of motivation and their premises for the exam.
Here's a summary to help you memorize them.

Maslow's hierarchy of needs      Abraham Maslow. Needs must be satisfied in a
hierarchical order.

Hygiene Theory Frederick Herzberg. Work environment (pay, benefits, and working
conditions) prevents dissatisfaction.

Expectancy Theory Victor Vroom. Expectation of positive outcomes drives motivation.

Achievement Theory David McClelland. People are motivated by achievement, power,
and affiliation.



   I'll cover two more theories in the leadership section, which is next. These deal specifically
with how leaders interact with their project team members.

Leadership versus Management
Chapter 1 introduced the differences between leaders and managers. I'll add a bit more
information here regarding leadership theories and the types of power leaders possess, but
first I'll recap leadership and management.
    Recall that leadership is about imparting vision and rallying people around that vision.
Leaders motivate and inspire and are concerned with strategic vision. Leaders have a knack
for getting others to do what needs to be done.
    Two of the techniques they use to do this are power and politics. Power is the ability to
get people to do what they wouldn't do ordinarily. It's also the ability to influence behavior.
Politics imparts pressure to conform regardless of whether people agree with the decision.
Leaders understand the difference between power and politics and when to employ each
technique. I'll talk more about power shortly.
    Good leaders have committed team members who believe in the vision of the leader. Lead-
ers set direction and time frames and have the ability to attract good talent to work for them.
Leaders inspire a vision and get things done through others by earning loyalty, respect, and
cooperation from team members. They set the course and lead the way. Good leaders are
directive in their approach but allow for plenty of feedback and input. Good leaders com-
monly have strong interpersonal skills and are well respected.
    Managers are generally task oriented and concerned with issues such as plans, controls,
budgets, policies, and procedures. They're generalists with a broad base of planning and
organizational skills, and their primary goal is satisfying stakeholder needs. They also pos-
sess motivational skills and the ability to recognize and reward behavior.
                                                     Developing the Project Team             355




                  Project managers need to use the traits of both leaders and managers at
                  different times during a project. On large projects, a project manager will
                  act more like a leader inspiring the subproject managers to get on board
                  with the objectives. On small projects, project managers will act more
                  like managers because they're responsible for all the planning and coor-
                  dinating functions.

   I'll discuss four theories regarding leadership and management. They are Douglas
McGregor's Theory X and Theory Y, Dr. William Ouchi's Theory Z, and the Contin-
gency Theory. Then I'll discuss the types of power leaders use and the outputs of Develop
Project Team.
Theory X, Theory Y, and Theory Z
   Douglas McGregor defined two models of worker behavior, Theory X and Theory Y,
that attempt to explain how different managers deal with their team members. Theory X
managers believe most people do not like work and will try to steer clear of it; they believe
people have little to no ambition, need constant supervision, and won't actually perform
the duties of their job unless threatened. As a result, Theory X managers are like dictators
and impose very rigid controls over their people. They believe people are motivated only by
punishment, money, or position. Unfortunately for the team members, Theory X manag-
ers unknowingly also subscribe to the Expectancy Theory. If they expect people to be lazy
and unproductive and treat them as such, their team members probably will be lazy and
unproductive.
   Theory Y managers believe people are interested in performing their best given the right
motivation and proper expectations. These managers provide support to their teams, are
concerned about their team members, and are good listeners. Theory Y managers believe
people are creative and committed to the project goals, that they like responsibility and
seek it out, and that they are able to perform the functions of their positions with limited
supervision.
   Theory Z was developed by Dr. William Ouchi. This theory is concerned with increasing
employee loyalty to their organizations. It came about in Japan in the 1980s when jobs were
often offered for life. This theory results in increased productivity, it puts an emphasis on the
well-being of the employees both at work and outside of work, it encourages steady employ-
ment, and it leads to high employee satisfaction and morale.
Contingency Theory
The Contingency Theory builds on a combination of Theory Y behaviors and the
Hygiene Theory. The Contingency Theory, in a nutshell, says that people are motivated
to achieve levels of competency and will continue to be motivated by this need even after
competency is reached.

The Power of Leaders
As stated earlier, power is the ability to influence others to do what you want them to do.
This can be used in a positive manner or a negative one. But that old saying of your grand-
mother's about attracting more flies with honey than vinegar still holds true today.
356        Chapter 8   n   Developing the Project Team



   Leaders, managers, and project managers use power to convince others to do tasks a
specific way. The kind of power they use to accomplish this depends on their personality,
their personal values, and the company culture.
   A project manager might use several forms of power. I've already talked about reward
power, which is the ability to grant bonuses or incentive awards for a job well done. Here
are a few more:
Punishment power Punishment, also known as coercive or penalty power, is just the
opposite of reward power. The employee is threatened with consequences if expectations
are not met.
Expert power Expert power occurs when the person being influenced believes the
manager, or the person doing the influencing, is knowledgeable about the subject or has
special abilities that make them an expert. The person goes along just because they think
the influencer knows what they're doing and it's the best thing for the situation.
Legitimate power Legitimate, or formal, power comes about as a result of the influencer's
position. Because that person is the project manager, executive vice president, or CEO, they
have the power to call the shots and make decisions.
Referent power Referent power is inferred to the influencer by their subordinates. Project
team members who have a great deal of respect and high regard for their project managers
willingly go along with decisions made by the project manager because of referent power.
   Punishment power should be used as a last resort and only after all other forms have
been exhausted. Sometimes you'll have to use this method, but I hope much less often than
the other three forms of power. Sometimes, you'll have team members who won't live up
to expectations and their performance suffers as a result. This is a case where punishment
power is enacted to get the employee to correct their behavior.



Exam Spotlight

Know the difference between leaders and managers, Theory X and Theory Y, the Contin-
gency Theory, and the types of power for the PMP exam. Here's a summary to help you
memorize them:

Leaders Leaders motivate, inspire, and create buy-in for the organization's strategic
vision. Leaders use power and politics to accomplish the vision.

Managers    Managers are task oriented and concerned with satisfying stakeholder
needs.

Theory X   Most people don't like work.

Theory Y: People are motivated to perform their best given proper expectations and
motivation.
                                                         Managing Project Teams             357




Theory Z The implementation of this theory increases employee loyalty and leads to
high satisfaction and morale.

Contingency Theory People are motivated to achieve levels of competency and will
continue to be motivated after competency is reached.

Reward power     You reward desirable behavior with incentives or bonuses.

Punishment power You threaten team members with consequences if expectations are
not met (also known as penalty power).

Expert power The person doing the influencing has significant knowledge or skills
regarding the subject.

Legitimate power This is the power of the position held by the influencer (the president
or vice president, for example).

Referent power    This is power that's inferred to the influencer.




Outputs of Develop Project Team
You're now ready to close out the Develop Project Team process. This process has only
two outputs, team performance assessment and enterprise environmental factors updates.
Team performance assessments involves determining a team's effectiveness. As a result
of positive team-building experiences, you'll see individuals improving their skills, team
behaviors and relationships improving, conflict resolutions going smoothly, and team
members recommending ways to improve the work of the project. I talked about effective
team characteristics earlier in this chapter. Assessing these characteristics will help you
determine where (or whether) the project team needs improvements.


                 Project managers wear a lot of hats. This is one of the things that make this
                 job so interesting. You need organization and planning skills to plan the
                 project. You need motivation and sometimes disciplinary skills to execute
                 the project plans. You need to exercise leadership and power where appro-
                 priate. And all the while, you have a host of relationships to manage, involv-
                 ing team members, stakeholders, managers, and customers. It's a great job
                 and brings terrific satisfaction.




Managing Project Teams
The Manage Project Team process is concerned with tracking and reporting on the perfor-
mance of individual team members. During this process, performance appraisals are pre-
pared and conducted, issues are identified and resolved, and feedback is given to the team
358           Chapter 8   n   Developing the Project Team



members. Some team behavior is also observed during this process, but the main focus here
is on individuals and their performance.



Exam Spotlight

Take note that the PMBOK(R) Guide states that one of the outcomes or results of the Man-
age Project Team process is an update to the human resource plan, which is part of the
project management plan updates output of this process.



      You've seen all the inputs to this process before with the exception of performance reports:
NN     Project staff assignments
NN     Project management plan
NN     Team performance assessments
NN     Performance reports
NN     Organizational process assets
   Performance reports document the status of the project compared to the forecasts.
We'll talk more at length about performance reports in Chapter 10. Keep in mind that
this is another example of an input to an Executing process coming from an output of a
Monitoring and Controlling process.


Tools and Techniques for Managing Teams
Most of the tools and techniques for this process are new. Don't skip studying any of them
because you'll likely see exam questions regarding them. The tools and techniques of the
Manage Project Team process are as follows:
NN     Observation and conversation
NN     Project performance appraisals
NN     Conflict management
NN     Issue log
NN     Interpersonal skills
      We'll take a closer look at each of these tools in the following sections.

Observation and Conversation
Observation and conversation is another one of those tools and techniques that is self-evident.
To assess team member performance, you have to observe it. I hope you've also learned how
important communication is to the success of the project. This includes communicating
with your team members. I know project managers who are reticent to engage their teams
in conversation unless it's official project business. I've even known project managers who
                                                          Managing Project Teams               359




instructed their administrative assistant to give a specific direction to another team member.
It's difficult to understand a team member's attitude or viewpoint toward the project if you're
communicating through someone else. Establish an open door policy with your team mem-
bers and live up to it. The benefits are so great that it's worth a few minutes a day of chitchat
to establish that feeling of trust and camaraderie. If your team perceives you as open, honest,
and willing to listen, you'll be the first person they come to when issues arise.




What Not to Do

Tina is a newly minted project manager. She has worked on many projects as the assis-
tant project manager, but this is the first time she has led the charge. Tina is so shy she
finds it difficult to give team members any kind of direction or to assign tasks, so she
has her administrative assistant do it for her. Tina tells her administrative assistant what
needs to be done and who needs to do it and leaves it to the assistant to inform the
appropriate team members.

As the project progresses, schedule milestone dates are missed, and Tina discovers tasks
that haven't started that were scheduled to start two weeks ago. Coming in from lunch
one day she saw several project team members huddled around her administrative assis-
tant's desk. From what she overheard, they were discussing a risk event that occurred on
the project.

Fortunately for Tina, one of the project managers she has worked for in the past saw what
was happening. Because the administrative assistant was the one who had established
relationships with the team and was in effect giving the orders, the team began treat-
ing her as the project manager instead of Tina. Tina's friend had a one-on-one coaching
session with Tina about her management style and the importance of conversation and
observation. Together they were able to get the project back on track.




Project Performance Appraisal
Project performance appraisals are typically annual or semiannual affairs where managers
let their employees know what they think of their performance over the past year and rate
them accordingly. These are usually manager-to-employee exchanges but can incorporate
a 360-degree review, which takes in feedback from just about everyone the team member
interacts with, including stakeholders, customers, project manager, peers, subordinates,
and the delivery person if they have a significant amount of project interaction. I'm not
a fan of 360-degree reviews because it makes most nonmanager types uncomfortable. "I
don't want to rate my peer" is a typical response. I also find 360-degree reviews are biased.
At best you'll get a response like this: "Oh, Ken is great, just great. No problems--a good
360        Chapter 8   n   Developing the Project Team



guy." Or you'll get exactly the opposite if the person you're speaking with doesn't like the
team member you're reviewing. Performance appraisal should be a bit more constructive
than this. Nonetheless, understand the 360-degree concept for the exam.
    No matter what type of appraisal is conducted, project managers should contribute to
the performance appraisals of all project team members. You should be aware of potential
loyalty issues when you're working in a matrix organizational structure. The team member
in this structure reports to both you (as the project manager) and a functional manager. If
the project manager does not have an equal say, or at least some say about the employee's
performance, it will cause the team member to be loyal to the functional manager and show
little loyalty to the project or project manager. Managing these dual reporting relationships
is often a critical success factor for the project, and it is the project manager's responsibility
to assure that these relationships are managed effectively.
    Performance appraisal time is also a good time to explore training needs, to clarify roles
and responsibilities, to set goals for the future, and so on.

Conflict Management
I said earlier in this chapter that if you have more than one person working on your project,
you have a team. Here's another fact: if you have more than one person working on your
project, you'll have conflict.
   Everyone has desires, needs, and goals. Conflict comes into the picture when the desires,
needs, or goals of one party are incompatible with the desires, needs, or goals of another
party (or parties). Conflict, simply put, is the incompatibility of goals, which often leads
to one party resisting or blocking the other party from attaining their goals. Wait--this
doesn't sound like a party!
   There are six ways of resolving conflict that might show up on the exam:
Forcing Forcing is just as it sounds. One person forces a solution on the other parties.
This is where the boss puts on the "Because I'm the boss and I said so" hat. Although this
is a permanent solution, it isn't necessarily the best solution. People will go along with it
because, well, they're forced to go along with it. It doesn't mean they agree with the solu-
tion. This isn't the best technique to use when you're trying to build a team. This is an
example of a win-lose conflict resolution technique. The forcing party wins, and the losers
are those who are forced to go along with the decision.
Smoothing/accommodating Smoothing does not lead to a permanent solution. It's a
temporary way to resolve conflict where the areas of agreement are emphasized over the
areas of difference so the real issue stays buried. Smoothing can also occur when some-
one attempts to make the conflict appear less important than it is. Everyone looks at each
other and scratches their head and wonders why they thought the conflict was such a big
deal anyway. As a result, a compromise is reached, and everyone feels good about the solu-
tion until they get back to their desk and start thinking about the issue again. When they
realize that the conflict was smoothed over and really is more important than they were
led to believe, or that they never dealt with the real issue at hand, they'll be back at it, and
the conflict will resurface. This is an example of a lose-lose conflict resolution technique
because neither side wins. Smoothing is also known as accommodating.
                                                           Managing Project Teams                  361




Compromise Compromise is achieved when each of the parties involved in the conflict
gives up something to reach a solution. Everyone involved decides what they will give on
and what they won't give on, and eventually through all the give and take, a solution is
reached. Neither side wins or loses in this situation. As a result, neither side is really gung
ho about the decision that was reached. They will drag their feet and reluctantly trudge
along. If, however, both parties make firm commitments to the resolution, then the solution
becomes a permanent one.
Confrontation/problem solving Confrontation is also called problem solving and is the
best way to resolve conflict. One of the key actions you'll perform with this technique is a
fact-finding mission. The thinking here is that one right solution to a problem exists and
the facts will bear out the solution. Once the facts are uncovered, they're presented to the
parties and the decision will be clear. Thus, the solution becomes a permanent one and the
conflict expires. This is the conflict resolution approach project mangers use most often and
is an example of a win-win conflict resolution technique.
Collaborating Collaborating occurs when multiple viewpoints are discussed and shared
and team members have the opportunity to examine all the perspectives of the issue. Col-
laborating will lead to true consensus where team members commit to the decision.
Withdrawal/avoidance Withdrawal or avoidance never results in resolution. This occurs
when one of the parties gets up and leaves and refuses to discuss the conflict. It is probably
the worst of all the techniques because nothing gets resolved. This is an example of a lose-
lose conflict resolution technique



Exam Spotlight

Know each of the conflict resolution techniques for the exam. Also remember that these
techniques will not necessarily yield long-term results. The smoothing and withdrawal
techniques have temporary results and aren't always good techniques to use to resolve
problems. Resolutions reached through forcing, compromise, and confrontation techniques
might not always be satisfying for all parties, but they tend to produce longer-lasting results.
Collaborating techniques are often successful and produce commitment to the decision pro-
vided all parties believe they had opportunity to provide their opinions and ideas.



   During the Manage Project Team process it's important to note that, as in any situation,
you'll want to deal with conflict as soon as it arises. According to the PMBOK(R) Guide, when
you have successfully resolved conflict, it will result in increased productivity and better,
more positive working relationships.
   Most conflicts come about in the Manage Project Team process as a result of schedule
issues, availability of resources (usually the lack of availability), or personal work habits. When
project team members are having a conflict, address them first in private with the person who
has the issue. Work in a direct and collaborative manner, but be prepared to escalate the issue
into a more formalized procedure (potentially even disciplinary action) if needed.
362         Chapter 8   n   Developing the Project Team



   If conflicts exist between the team members, encourage resolution between them with-
out intervention on your part. The best conflict resolution will come about when they can
work out the issues between them. When that isn't possible, you'll have to step in and help
resolve the matter.
   Remember that solid ground rules and established policies and procedures will help
mitigate conflict before it arises.

Issue Log
The issue log is a place to document the issues that keep the project team from meeting
project goals. These can range from differences of opinion to newly surfaced responsibili-
ties that need to be assigned to a project team member. Each issue should be recorded in
the log along with the person responsible for resolving it. You should also note the date the
resolution is needed.

Interpersonal Skills
We talked about interpersonal skills in the Develop Project Team process, but you should
know for the exam that the PMBOK(R) Guide points out three types of interpersonal skills
used most often in this process. They are leadership, influencing, and effective decision mak-
ing. We've already covered leadership and influencing. Effective decision making concerns
making decisions in a timely manner and making decisions that reflect and support the goals
of the project. Effective decisions should bring about a good result for the project, the stake-
holders, and the team members. They also help you take advantage of opportunities and
minimize negative risks. As project managers, and good leaders, we have a responsibility to
put the good of project and the organization over our own needs, so use sound judgment
when making decisions.


                  I have seen many project managers in the course of my career drag their feet
                  when it comes to making a decision or downright refuse to make a decision.
                  No decision is a decision--in effect, you're choosing to do nothing. This can
                  have disastrous consequences for your project. Sometimes, it's better to
                  make a misguided decision than no decision at all. Make certain to examine
                  all the information known at the time, consult your experts, and finally, make
                  the decision.




Managing Project Team Outputs
The outputs of the Manage Project Team process are the result of the conversations, per-
formance appraisals, and conflict resolution I've talked about previously. This process
has four outputs:
NN    Enterprise environmental factors updates
NN    Organizational process assets update
                                                          Managing Project Teams                 363



NN   Change requests
NN   Project management plan updates
   Remember that the elements of these outputs pertain to human resources. For example,
change requests might come about as a result of a change in staffing, corrective actions
might come about because of disciplinary actions or training needs, and preventive actions
might be needed to reduce the impact of potential human resource issues. Any of these
actions might cause changes to the staffing management plan or the human resource plan,
which means you should update the project management plan.
   The enterprise environmental process updates has two components that may need
updating as a result of this process. They are input to organizational performance apprais-
als and personnel skill updates. The input to organizational performance appraisals comes
from team members with significant interactions with the project and each other.
   The organizational process asset updates output has three components: historical infor-
mation/lessons learned documentation, templates, and organizational standard processes.
   Lessons learned encompasses everything you've learned about the human resources
aspect during this project, including documentation that can be used as templates on future
projects (such as org charts, position descriptions, and the staffing management plan), tech-
niques used to resolve conflict, the types of conflict that came up during the project, ground
rules, when and how virtual teams were used on the project and the procedures associated
with them, the staffing management plan, special skills needed during the project that
weren't known about during the Planning processes, and the issue log.
   In the next chapter, we'll wrap up the Executing process group and examine the processes
associated with conducting procurements, providing quality assurance, distributing infor-
mation, and managing the expectations of stakeholders.




Project Case Study: New Kitchen Heaven Retail Store

You are in Dirk's office giving him some good news.

"The lease is signed and the work of the project has started. Ricardo has several of his staff
members assigned to perform tasks related to the information technology deliverables, as
do Jill and Jake for their areas.

I held a kick-off meeting with all the key project team members. We started out with some
team-building exercises and I explained the five stages of team development. It's normal
to have some conflict as we're starting out, and I let them all know my door is always
open and if they have issues they can't resolve, they can come to me directly. I explained
the goals of the project, laid some ground rules for team interaction, and talked with them
about the conflict resolution techniques we'll use as we get further into the project."
364        Chapter 8   n   Developing the Project Team




"I'm just glad to hear we're finally doing something," Dirk replies.

"Even though Gomez construction doesn't start until next week, they sent their crew
leader to the kickoff meeting. I was impressed with that."

Dirk asks, "Why isn't Gomez starting work now?"

"They aren't scheduled to start until Sept 20 and we need to get our procurement docu-
ments signed. We have a week to finish up the signatures before they get here, so we're
in fine shape. But Ricardo's group has already prepared their procurement documents to
purchase the switches and other equipment they need to start work. Bryan, Ricardo's team
lead, finished his other project sooner than anticipated, and since they have Ethernet cable
on hand, he started running cable today."

The key stakeholder from the marketing department peeks her head in Dirk's door. "I saw
you both in here and thought I'd ask you when someone from the project team is going to
work with me on the website announcement? I haven't heard anything, and I don't want
to cut this so close that we put up something subpar on the website. The 50th anniversary
deserves a little splash."

"OK," you reply. "I'll set up a meeting with you to get more information, and then I'll work
with Ricardo to determine who is the best fit. I've noted we need to assign someone to
this activity in the issue log. The person he thought he was going to assign to this task is
out on family leave and we don't know when he's expected back."

"Thanks," the stakeholder replies. "I also heard you lost a valuable team member last week.
I was really sorry to see Madelyn go. What happened? And will her loss impact the project?"

"I don't want to go into all the details, but she violated our Internet acceptable use policy.
She was placed on disciplinary action on this very issue once before. This may impact the
project schedule because her activities were on the critical path. I've already interviewed
two internal candidates who've expressed interest in working on the project. I believe
either one would work out nicely. They have the skills we need and are very interested.
However, there is some ramp-up time needed. I've added this to the risk list because we
could have an impact to the schedule if we don't get Madelyn replaced by the end of this
week. I've got a change request ready also in case there is a schedule impact. I won't
know more until next week."

Dirk glances at his desk clock.

You stand and on your way to the door tell him, "Next week I'll hold a formal status meeting
with all the stakeholders and will begin distributing written weekly status reports."

Understanding How This Applies to
Your Next Project
The topics in this chapter are some of my favorites because this is where project management
shines--dynamic teams working under the direction of a capable, responsible leader who
can effectively balance the needs of the team with the needs of the project (and ultimately
the organization) and pull it all off successfully. There aren't many things better in an orga-
nization than a high-performing team working together to accomplish a well-understood
goal. And it doesn't really matter whether the team members are all in the same company,
366        Chapter 8   n   Developing the Project Team



department, or country. When they're working toward a common goal and functioning
at the performing level, there's almost nothing they can't accomplish. The movies Ocean's
Eleven, Ocean's Twelve, and Ocean's Thirteen are good examples of strong leadership
and dynamic teamwork at play. Although I'm certainly not advocating you turn to a life of
crime, you can pick up a few pointers on how effective teams work from George Clooney
and the gang.
    So, how does this apply? As the project manager, it's your responsibility, and dare I say
duty, to acquire the best team members possible for your project. In my experience, this
doesn't always mean all my team members are highly qualified. To me, team fit and team
dynamics are as important as the team members' skills. I know some will disagree with me
on this next point, but I believe it's easier to train someone on a new skill (given they have
the aptitude) than it is to take on a team member with an abrasive personality who is immi-
nently qualified but can't get along with anyone else on the team. Sometimes you really
don't have much choice when it comes to picking team members, as referenced in the side-
bar "The Only Candidate" earlier in this chapter. When you find yourself in this situation,
I recommend you lay down clear ground rules for communication, problem escalation,
work assignments, and so on.
    Make it a habit to read at least a couple of leadership books a quarter. You may already
be familiar with the topic and think there isn't anything new to learn. However, staying
current on the topic will reinforce concepts that you already know and will remind you of
other points that you forgot about and haven't yet developed but know you should. And
occasionally, you will pick up a gold nugget of information that is new and immediately
applicable to your situation.
    Leadership skills are invaluable, but communication skills are just as important. In my
opinion, it's difficult to be an effective leader without also being an effective communicator.
My guess is that if you take a close look at the leaders you respect and admire, you'll discover
they are also good communicators. And communication is mostly listening--not talking. I
make it a habit to practice active listening. It's amazing what people will tell you when you
smile politely and ask an open-ended question or two.
    Let me stress again that you cannot successfully manage a project team without com-
municating with them on a regular basis. The last thing you want is for a stakeholder to
follow you into the elevator to inform you about a major problem with the project that
you weren't aware of. That will happen if you haven't established a relationship with your
team. If they don't believe you're trustworthy or they don't know you well enough to know
whether you'll stand by them, you'll be one of the last people to find out what's happening.
I know managers and project managers who subscribe to the "don't get too close to your
team" theory. I subscribe to the "all things in moderation" theory. You do want to establish
relationships and prove your loyalty to the team, but you also have to know where to draw
the line. When it comes time to hold a team member accountable, it can be difficult to do if
you have become very close on a personal basis. But I advocate erring on the side of devel-
oping a relationship with the team. My teams have to trust me to the point that they know
they can come to me--at any time, with all types of news, good or bad--and I'll help them
resolve the problem.
                                                                          Summary             367




Summary
This chapter described four processes from the Executing process group: Direct and
Manage Project Execution, Acquire Project Team, Develop Project Team, and Manage
Project Team.
   In Direct and Manage Project Execution, the project plans come to life. Activities are
authorized to begin and the product, result, or service of the project is produced. Status
review meetings are held to inform stakeholders of project progress and updates.
   Acquire Project Team involves negotiation with other functional managers, project man-
agers, and organizational personnel to obtain human resources to complete the work of the
project. The project manager might not have control over who will be a part of the team.
Availability, ability, experience, interests, and costs are all enterprise environmental factors
that should be considered when you are able to choose team members.
   Develop Project Team involves creating an open, inviting atmosphere where project team
members will become efficient and cooperative, increasing productivity during the course
of the project. It's the project manager's job to bring the team together into a functioning,
productive group.
   Team development has five stages, according to the Tuckman-Jensen model: forming,
storming, norming, performing, and adjourning. All groups proceed through these stages,
and the introduction of a new team member will always start the process over again.
   Co-location is physically placing team members together in the same location. This
might also include a common meeting room or gathering area where team members can
meet and collaborate on the project.
   Several motivational theories exist, including reward and recognition, Maslow's hierarchy
of needs, the Hygiene Theory, the Expectancy Theory, and the Achievement Theory. These
theories conjecture that motivation is driven by several desires, including physical, social, and
psychological needs, anticipation of expected outcomes, or needs for achievement, power, or
affiliation. The Hygiene Theory proposes that hygiene factors prevent dissatisfaction.
   Leaders inspire vision and rally people around common goals. Theory X leaders think
most people are motivated only through punishment, money, or position. Theory Y leaders
think most people want to perform the best job they can. The Contingency Theory says that
people naturally want to achieve levels of competency and will continue to be motivated by
the desire for competency even after competency is reached.
   Leaders exhibit five types of power: reward, punishment, expert, legitimate, and refer-
ent power.
   Communication skills are the most important skills a project manager exercises. People
who send messages are responsible for making sure the messages are clear, concise, and
complete. Receivers are responsible for understanding the messages correctly and making
sure they've received all the information.
   Listening skills put speakers at ease. Several techniques tell your speaker you're listen-
ing attentively, including making eye contact, nodding, asking clarifying questions, and
limiting interruptions.
368        Chapter 8   n   Developing the Project Team



   Manage Project Teams involves tracking and reporting on project team member perfor-
mance. Performance appraisals are performed during this process and feedback is provided
to the team members.



Exam Essentials
Be able to identify the distinguishing characteristics of Direct and Manage Project
Execution. Direct and Manage Project Execution is where the work of the project is
performed, and the majority of the project budget is spent during this process.
Be able to name the five stages of group formation. The four stages of group formation
are forming, storming, norming, performing, and adjourning.
Be able to define Maslow's highest level of motivation. Self-actualization occurs when a
person performs at their peak and all lower-level needs have been met.
Be able to name the five types of power.     The five levels of power are reward, punishment,
expert, legitimate, and referent.
Be able to identify the five styles of conflict resolution. The five styles of conflict resolution
are forcing, smoothing, compromise, confrontation, and withdrawal.
Be able to name the tools and techniques of the Manage Project Team process. The tools and
techniques of Manage Project Team are observation and conversation, project performance
appraisal, conflict management, issue log, and interpersonal skills.
                                                                      Key Terms          369




Key Terms
I've discussed in detail the processes you'll use while developing your project team. You
need to understand each of these processes to effectively build your team and know them
by the names used in the PMBOK(R) Guide to be successful on the exam:

Acquire Project Team
Develop Project Team
Direct and Manage Project Execution

Review Questions
1.    You are a project manager for a growing dairy farm. It offers its organic dairy products
      regionally and is expanding its operations to the West Coast. It is in the process of purchasing
      and leasing dairy farms to get operations underway. You are in charge of the network opera-
      tions part of this project. An important deadline is approaching that depends on the success-
      ful completion of the testing phase. You've detected some problems with your hardware in
      the testing phase and discover that the hardware is not compatible with other network equip-
      ment. You take corrective action and exchange the hardware for more compatible equipment.
      Which of the following statements is true?
      A. This is not a corrective action because corrective action involves human resources, not
         project resources.
      B.   Corrective action is taken here to make sure the future project outcomes are aligned
           with the project management plan.
      C.   Corrective action is not necessary in this case because the future project outcomes
           aren't affected.
      D.   Corrective action serves as the change request to authorize exchanging the equipment.

Answers to Review Questions
1.   B. Corrective action brings anticipated future project outcomes back into alignment with
     the project management plan. Since there is an important deadline looming that depends
     on a positive outcome of this test, the equipment is exchanged so that the project plan and
     project schedule are not impacted.

2.   A. The most difficult aspect of the Direct and Manage Project Execution process is coor-
     dinating and integrating all the project elements. The clue to this question is in the next-to-
     last sentence.

3.   A. The Executing process group and Monitoring and Controlling process group serve as
     inputs to each other.

4.   B. This question describes the deliverable output. Deliverables can be intangibles, such as
     the completion of training.

5.   D. Work performance information includes elements such as schedule status, the status of
     deliverables completion, lessons learned, and resource utilization.

6.   C. The enterprise environmental factors input of the Acquire Project Team process con-
     siders elements such as prior experience, interest in working on the project, cost rates,
     and availability of potential team members.

7.   A. This question describes a defect repair that was discovered and implemented. Defect
     repairs come about as a result of approved changes. Approved changes are implemented
     in the Direct and Manage Project Execution process. The question implies that the change
     request was approved because the problem was corrected and the rest of the production run
     went smoothly.

8.   B. Teams in the norming stage of team development exhibit affection and familiarity with
     one another and make joint decisions.

9.   C. The introduction of a new team member will start the formation and development of
     the team all over again with the forming stage.

10. D. The performing stage is similar to Maslow's self-actualization. Both involve team members
    at the peak of performance, concerned with doing good and being the best.

11. B. The Expectancy Theory says that people are motivated by the expectation of good out-
    comes. The outcome must be reasonable and attainable.

12. B. Co-location would bring your team members together in the same location and allow
    them to function more efficiently as a team. At a minimum, meeting in a common room,
    such as a war room, for all team meetings would bring the team closer together.

13. C. Confronting is a problem-solving technique that seeks to determine the facts and find
    solutions based on the facts. That results in a win-win resolution for all parties.

14. A. Referent power is power that is inferred on a leader by their subordinates as a result of
    the high level of respect for the leader.

15. B. Theory Y managers believe that people will perform their best if they're provided with
    the proper motivation and the right expectations.

16. A. Improving competencies, team interactions, and the team environment are characteristics
    of the Develop Project Team process, not the Manage Team Process.

17. D. This technique is called 360-degree feedback. It's part of the project performance
    appraisals tool and technique of the Manage Project Team process.

18. C. This question refers to preassignments, which are a tool and technique of the Acquire
    Project Team process. The other tools and techniques of this process are negotiation, acqui-
    sition, and virtual teams.

19. B. Smoothing (also known as accommodating) and withdrawal (also known as avoidance)
    are both lose-lose techniques. Forcing is a win-lose technique. Compromise is where neither
    side wins or loses.

20. D. Theory Z encourages employee loyalty because jobs are offered for life. This leads to
    increased productivity, morale, and high employee satisfaction.

          The PMP exam content from the

          domain covered in this chapter
          includes the following:

          UU
                                This chapter wraps up the Executing process group. We'll
                                look at four processes in this chapter: Conduct Procure-
                                ments, Perform Quality Assurance, Distribute Information,
and Manage Stakeholder Expectations.
   Most of these processes aren't related to each other, but all are necessary to conduct
the work of the project. They work in coordination with all the other Executing processes
and are all extensions of the Planning processes that preceded them (like Plan Procure-
ments, Plan Quality, and so on). Conduct Procurements, and Perform Quality Assur-
ance in particular, work hand in hand with their Monitoring and Controlling processes
(Administer Procurements and Perform Quality Control) to implement, measure, and
report services and results.
   Conduct Procurements is where sellers respond to the bids we prepared in the Plan Con-
tracting process. Contract awards are made here also. In Perform Quality Assurance, we'll
look at several techniques to audit the project's quality requirements against the quality results.
Distribute Information will cover more communication topics, including status reports, and
last but not least we'll talk about Managing Stakeholder Expectations, which is critical during
the Executing processes. Grab your favorite beverage and let's get started.



Conducting Procurements
Many times project managers must purchase goods or services to complete some or all of
the work of the project. Sometimes the entire project is completed on contract. The Con-
duct Procurements process is concerned with obtaining responses to bids and proposals
from potential vendors, selecting a vendor, and awarding the contract.
   This process has several inputs:
NN   Project management plan (procurement management plan)
NN   Source selection criteria
NN   Qualified seller list
NN   Seller proposals
NN   Project documents
NN   Make-or-buy decisions
NN   Teaming agreements
NN   Organizational process assets
                                                         Conducting Procurements              379




    I've talked about most of these inputs in previous chapters. Procurement documents
include requests for proposals (RFPs), requests for information (RFIs), requests for quota-
tions (RFQs), and so on. The responses to those proposals become inputs to this process.
Source selection criteria was defined in the Plan Procurements process that we talked about
in Chapter 7. In the tools and techniques section for this process, we'll talk more about how
seller proposals are evaluated.
    Qualified sellers lists are lists of prospective sellers who have been preapproved or
prequalified to provide contract services (or provide supplies and materials) for the orga-
nization. For example, your organization might require vendors to register and maintain
information regarding their experience, offerings, and current prices on a qualified seller
list. Vendors must usually go through the procurement department to get placed on the list.
Project managers are then required to choose their vendors from the qualified seller list pub-
lished by the procurement department. However, not all organizations have qualified seller
lists. If a list isn't available, you'll have to work with the project team to come up with your
own requirements for selecting vendors.


                    The Conduct Procurements process is used only if you're obtaining
                    goods or services from outside your own organization. If you have all the
                    resources you need to perform the work of the project within the organiza-
                    tion, you won't use this process.

   In the following sections, you'll examine some new tools and techniques that will help
vendors give you a better idea of their responses, and then you'll move on to the outputs of
this process, two of which are the selected seller and procurement contract award.


Conduct Procurements Tools and Techniques
   Remember that the purpose of the Conduct Procurements process is to obtain responses to
your RFP (or similar procurement document), select the right vendor for the job, and award
the contract. The tools and techniques of this process are designed to assist the vendors in
getting their proposals to you and include techniques for evaluating those proposals. The
tools and techniques are as follows:
NN    Bidder conferences
NN    Proposal evaluation techniques
NN    Independent estimates
NN    Expert judgment
NN    Advertising
NN    Internet search
NN    Procurement negotiations
     We'll look at each of these tools and techniques next with the exception of expert judgment.
380        Chapter 9   n   Conducting Procurements and Sharing Information



Bidder Conferences
Bidder conferences (also known as vendor conferences, prebid conferences, and contractor
conferences according to the PMBOK(R) Guide) are meetings with prospective vendors or
sellers that occur prior to the completion of their response proposal. You or someone from
your procurement department arranges the bidder conference. The purpose is to allow all
prospective vendors to meet with the buyers to ask questions and clarify issues they have
regarding the project and the RFP. The meeting is held once, and all vendors attend at the
same time. The bidder conference is held before the vendor prepares their responses so that
they are sure their RFP response will address the project requirements.

Proposal Evaluation Techniques
There are several techniques you might use to evaluate proposals. Simple procurements may
not need much more than a quick check against the statement of work or a price comparison.
Complex procurements may need several rounds of evaluation to begin narrowing the list of
sellers. This is where you might use one or more of the following evaluation techniques to get
to the final winner.
    You can use source selection criteria as one method of rating and scoring proposals. We
discussed source selection criteria in Chapter 6. You may recall that this includes several
elements such as an understanding of the work, costs, technical capability, risk, warranty,
and so on. We'll get into more detail on some of these criteria here. Keep in mind this is an
input to the Conduct Procurements process, not a tool and technique, even though you'll be
using it as you would a tool and technique.
    The types of goods and services you're trying to procure will dictate how detailed your
evaluation criteria are. (Of course, if your organization has policies in place for evaluating
proposals, then you'll use the format or criteria already established.) The selection of some
goods and services might be price driven only. In other words, the bidder with the lowest
price will win the bid. This is typical when the items you're buying are widely available.
    When you're purchasing goods, you might request a sample from each vendor in order to
compare quality (or some other criteria) against your need. For example, perhaps you need
a special kind of paper stock for a project you're working on at a bank. This stock must
have a watermark, it must have security threads embedded through the paper, and when
the paper is used for printing, the ink must not be erasable. You can request samples of
stock with these qualities from the vendors and then test them to see whether they'll work
for your project.
    It's always appropriate to ask the vendor for references, especially when you're hiring
contract services. It's difficult to assess the quality of services because it's not a tangible
product. References can tell you whether the vendor delivered on time, whether the vendor
had the technical capability to perform the work, and whether the vendor's management
approach was appropriate when troubles surfaced. Create a list of questions to ask the ref-
erences before you call.
    You can request financial records to assure you--the buyer--that the vendor has the
fiscal ability to perform the services they're proposing and that the vendor can purchase
                                                         Conducting Procurements                381




whatever equipment is needed to perform the services. If you examine the records of the
company and find that it's two steps away from bankruptcy, that company might not be
a likely candidate for your project. (Remember those general management skills? Here's
another example where they come into play.)
    One of the most important criteria is the evaluation of the response itself to determine
whether the vendor has a clear understanding of what you're asking them to do or provide.
If they missed the mark (remember, they had an opportunity at the bidder conferences to
ask clarifying questions) and didn't understand what you were asking them to provide,
you'll probably want to rank them very low.
    Now you can compare each proposal against the criteria and rate or score each proposal
for its ability to meet or fulfill these criteria. This can serve as your first step in eliminating
vendors that don't match your criteria. Let's say you received 18 responses to an RFP. After
evaluating each one, you discover that six of them don't match all the evaluation criteria.
You eliminate those six vendors in this round. The next step is to apply the tools and tech-
niques of this process to further evaluate the remaining 12 potential vendors.

Weighting Systems
Weighting systems assign numerical weights to evaluation criteria and then multiply
them by the weights of each criteria factor to come up with total scores for each
vendor. This technique provides a way to quantify the data and assist in keeping per-
sonal biases to a minimum. Weighting systems are useful when you have multiple
vendors to choose from because they allow you to rank the proposals to determine the
sequence of negotiations.
   You'll find an example of a weighted scoring system in Chapter 2. These systems are
commonly used to evaluate vendor proposals.

Screening Systems
Screening systems use predefined performance criteria or a set of defined minimum require-
ments to screen out unsuitable vendors. Perhaps your project requires board-certified engi-
neers. One of the screening criteria would be that vendors propose project team members who
have this qualification. If they don't, they're eliminated from the selection process.
   Screening systems can be used together with some of the other tools and techniques of
this process, weighting systems and independent estimates, to rank vendor proposals.

Seller Rating Systems
Seller rating systems use information about the sellers--such as past performance, deliv-
ery, contract compliance, and quality ratings--to determine seller performance. Your
organization might have seller rating systems in place, and you should check with your
procurement department to see whether they exist for the bidders on your project. Part of
the Administer Procurement process (I'll talk about this in Chapter 10) concerns gather-
ing and recording this type of information. Don't use seller rating systems as your sole
criteria for evaluating vendors.
382        Chapter 9   n   Conducting Procurements and Sharing Information




                  Proposal evaluation techniques are a combination of all the techniques I've
                  discussed in this section. All techniques use some form of expert judgment
                  and evaluation criteria--whether it's objective or subjective criteria. The
                  evaluation criteria are usually weighted, much like a weighted scoring sys-
                  tem, and those participating as reviewers provide their ratings (usually to
                  the project manager) to compile into a weighted proposal to determine an
                  overall score. Scoring differences are also resolved using this technique.
                  Some or all of the evaluation techniques described here can be used in
                  combination with the remaining tools and techniques of this section to
                  evaluate seller responses.



Independent Estimates
Your procurement department might conduct independent estimates (also known as should
cost estimates) of the costs of the proposal and compare these to the vendor prices. If there
are large differences between the independent estimate and the proposed vendor cost, one
of two things is happening: either the statement of work (SOW) or the terms of the contract
or both are not detailed enough to allow the vendor to come up with an accurate cost. Or
the vendor simply failed to respond to all the requirements laid out in the contract or SOW.

Advertising
Advertising is letting potential vendors know that an RFP is available. The company's Internet
site, professional journals, or newspapers are examples of where advertising might appear.

Internet Search
Internet searches have several useful features in this process. You can use Internet searches
to find vendors, perform research on their past performance, and compare prices. You can
also use the Internet to purchase items that are readily available and are generally offered
for a fixed price. Internet searches are probably not useful when you're conducting high-risk
or complex procurements, but you could do some research on company performance and
reputation to help in choosing a vendor.

Procurement Negotiation
In procurement negotiation, both parties come to an agreement regarding the contract
terms. Negotiation skills are put into practice here as the details of the contract are ironed
out between the parties. At a minimum, contract language should include price, responsi-
bilities, regulations or laws that apply, and the overall approach to the project.
    The complexity of the contract will determine how extensive the contract negotiations
will be. Simple contracts may have predetermined, nonnegotiable elements that only require
seller acceptance. Complex contracts may include any number of elements, including financ-
ing options, overall schedule, proprietary rights, service level agreements, technical aspects,
and more. In either case, once agreement is reached and the negotiations are finished, the
contract is signed by both buyer and seller and is executed.
                                                        Conducting Procurements              383




   You might see the term fait accompli show up on the exam. Fait accompli tactics are
used during contract negotiation when one party tries to convince the other party discuss-
ing a particular contract item that it is no longer an issue. It can be a distraction technique,
when the party practicing fait accompli tactics is purposely trying to keep from negotiating
an issue and claims the issue cannot be changed. For example, during negotiations the ven-
dor tells you that the key resource they're assigning to your project must start immediately
or you'll lose that resource and they'll get assigned work elsewhere. However, you don't
know--because the vendor didn't tell you--that the vendor can reserve this resource for
your project and hold them until the start date. In this instance, they used fait accompli
tactics to push you into starting the project, or hiring this resource, sooner than you would
have otherwise.
   The literal translation of fait accompli into English is fact realized or accomplished.
And this tactic does not always produce a negative result. For example, when then Presi-
dent Elect Obama was running for the White House, he promised his daughters that if he
won the election, they could get a dog. Once he won the election, getting a dog was no
longer in question; it became a fact realized or a done deal you might say.

Vendor Selection for Fitness Counts HR System

Amanda Jacobson is the project manager for Fitness Counts, a nationwide chain of gyms
containing all the latest and greatest fitness equipment, aerobics classes, swimming
pools, and such. Fitness Counts is converting its human resources data management sys-
tem. The RFP addressed several requirements, including the following:

NN   The new system must run on a platform that's compatible with the company's cur-
     rent operating system.
NN   Hardware must be compatible with company standards.
NN   Data conversion of existing HR data must be included in the price of the bid.
NN   Fitness Counts wants to have the ability to add custom modules using internal
     programmers.
NN   Training of Fitness Counts programmers must be included in the bid.
384         Chapter 9   n    Conducting Procurements and Sharing Information




The project team is in the Conduct Procurements process and has received bids based
on the RFP published earlier this month. Fitness Counts is using a combination of selec-
tion criteria and a weighted scoring model to choose a vendor.

One of the evaluation criteria said that the vendor must have prior experience with a
project like this. Four vendors met that criteria and proceeded to the weighted scoring
selection process.

Amanda is one of the members of the selection committee. She and four other members
on the committee rated the four vendors who met the initial selection criteria. They read
all of the proposals and rated the criteria using factors they had predetermined for each.
For example, vendors who proposed a SQL database as part of the "Platform" criteria
(along with the other predetermined factors) should receive a total weighted score of 5.
Table 9.1 shows their results.

Vendor C is the clear winner of this bid. Based on the weighted scoring model, their
responses to the RFP came out ahead of the other bidders. Amanda calls them with the
good news and also calls the other vendors to thank them for participating in the bid. Vendor
C is awarded the contract, and Amanda moves on to the Contract Administration process.

Conduct Procurements Outputs
The Conduct Procurements process has six outputs:
NN   Selected sellers
NN   Procurement contract award
NN   Resource calendars
NN   Change requests
NN   Project management plan updates
NN   Project document updates
  The selected sellers output is obvious; you choose the seller (or sellers) to whom
you'll award the project and execute the contract. I'll talk more about the procurement
contract award next. I've discussed all the other outputs previously.


                     According to the PMBOK(R) Guide, a negotiated draft contract is one of the
                     requirements of the selected sellers output. Also note that senior manage-
                     ment signatures may be required on complex, high-risk, or high-dollar
                     contracts. Make certain to check your organization's procurement policies
                     regarding the authority level and amounts you are authorized to sign for. In
                     my organization, not only do our contracts require senior management sig-
                     nature, they also require signatures from two other external departments.
                     We have to account for the multiple reviews, signatures, and question and
                     answer sessions required to get to contract signature. This has a definite
                     impact on the project schedule and must be accounted for in time estimates
                     for these tasks.

Elements of a Procurement Contract Award
You might recall that a contract is a legally binding agreement between two or more parties,
typically used to acquire goods or services. Contracts have several names, including agree-
ments, memorandums of understanding (MOUs), subcontracts, and purchase orders.
   The type of contract you'll award will depend on the product or services you're procuring
and your organizational policies. I talked about the types of contracts--fixed price, cost reim-
bursable, and so on--in Chapter 6 if you need a refresher. If your project has multiple sellers,
you'll award contracts for each of them.
   The contract should clearly address the elements of the SOW, time period of perfor-
mance, pricing and payment plan, acceptance criteria, warranty periods, dispute resolution
procedures, and so on.
   Since contracts are legally binding and obligate your organization to fulfill the terms, they'll
likely be subject to some intensive review, often by several different people. Be certain you
understand your organization's policies on contract review and approval before proceeding.
   Contracts, like projects, have a life cycle of their own. You might encounter questions on
the exam regarding the stages of the contract life cycles, so we'll look at this topic next.

Contract Life Cycles
The contract life cycle consists of four stages:
NN     Requirement
NN     Requisition
NN     Solicitation
NN     Award
   These stages are closely related to the following Project Procurement Knowledge Area
processes from the PMBOK(R) Guide:
NN     Plan Procurements
NN     Conduct Procurements
      A description of each of the contract life cycles follows.
Requirement The requirement stage is the equivalent of the Plan Procurements process I dis-
cussed in Chapter 7. You establish the project and contract needs in this cycle, and you define
the requirements of the project. The SOW defines the work of the project, the objectives, and
a high-level overview of the deliverables. You develop a work breakdown structure (WBS), a
make-or-buy analysis takes place, and you determine cost estimates.
The buyer provides the SOW to describe the requirements of the project when it's performed
under contract. The product description can serve as the SOW.
Requisition In the requisition stage, the project objectives are refined and confirmed.
Solicitation materials such as the request for proposals (RFP), request for information
(RFI), and request for quotations (RFQ) are prepared during this phase. Generally, the
project manager is the one responsible for preparing the RFP, RFI, and RFQ. A review of
the potential qualified vendors takes place, including checking references and reviewing
                                      Laying Out Quality Assurance Procedures              387




other projects the vendor has worked on that are similar to your proposed project. Requisi-
tion occurs during the Plan Procurements process.
Solicitation The solicitation stage is where vendors are asked to compete for the contract
and respond to the RFP. You can use the tools and techniques of the Conduct Procurements
process during this contract stage. The resulting output is the proposals. Solicitation occurs
during the Conduct Procurements process.
Award Vendors are chosen and contracts are awarded and signed during the award stage.
The Conduct Procurements process is the equivalent of the award phase.
The project manager--or the selection committee, depending on the organizational policy--
receives the bids and proposals during the award phase and applies evaluation criteria to
each in order to score or rank the responses. After ranking each of the proposals, an award is
made to the winning vendor, and the contract is written.
   Once you have a contract, someone has to administer it. In large organizations, this
responsibility will fall to the procurement department. The project manager should still
have a solid understanding of administering contracts because that person will work with
the procurement department to determine the satisfactory fulfillment of the contract.
   Now we're going to switch courses and discuss the quality assurance aspects of the
project. We discussed the Plan Quality process back in Chapter 7, which prepared us for
the Perform Quality Assurance process that's conducted during the Executing process
group. We'll look at it next.



Laying Out Quality Assurance
Procedures
The Plan Quality process laid out the quality standards for the project and determined
how those standards are satisfied. The Perform Quality Assurance process involves per-
forming systematic quality activities and uses quality audits to determine which processes
should be used to achieve the project requirements and to assure they are performed effi-
ciently and effectively.
   The project team members, the project manager, and the stakeholders are all responsible
for the quality assurance of the project. Continuous process improvement can be achieved
through this process, bringing about improved process performance and eliminating unnec-
essary actions.
   A quality assurance department or organization may be assigned to the project to over-
see these processes. In that case, quality assurance might be provided to (rather than by)
the project team. The project manager will have the greatest impact on the quality of the
project during this process.
   You'll review the inputs to this process next and then spend some time exploring a few
new tools and techniques for assuring a quality product and project.
388         Chapter 9   n   Conducting Procurements and Sharing Information




Inputs to Perform Quality Assurance
The inputs to Perform Quality Assurance are what you use to measure the organizational
project quality management processes against. The quality management processes were
defined during Quality Planning. The inputs to the Perform Quality Assurance process are
as follows:
NN    Project management plan
NN    Quality metrics
NN    Work performance information
NN    Quality control measurements
   You've heard about the inputs to Perform Quality Assurance before, so we'll move right
into the tools and techniques of this section.



Exam Spotlight

The most important point to remember about Perform Quality Assurance is that
quality management processes are what you use to make certain the project satisfies
the quality standards laid out in the project management plan.




Perform Quality Assurance Tools and Techniques
The Perform Quality Assurance process has three tools and techniques: Plan Quality and
Perform Quality Control tools and techniques, quality audits, and process analysis.
   I discussed Plan Quality planning tools and techniques during the Quality Planning pro-
cess in Chapter 7. You'll recall that the tools and techniques are cost-benefit analysis, cost of
quality, control charts, benchmarking, design of experiments, statistical sampling, flowchart-
ing, proprietary quality management methodologies, and additional quality planning tools.
When we discuss the Perform Quality Control process in Chapter 11, "Controlling Work
Results," we'll add even more tools to our quality tool bag with some Perform Quality Con-
trol tools and techniques. All of these tools and techniques from both the Plan Quality and
Perform Quality Control processes can be used during the Perform Quality Assurance pro-
cess as well to measure project performance.
   We'll look at the remaining tools and techniques in the following sections.

Quality Audits
Quality audits are independent reviews performed by trained auditors or third-party review-
ers. The purpose of a quality audit is the same as the purpose of the Perform Quality Assur-
ance process--to identify ineffective and inefficient activities or processes used on the project.
These audits might examine and uncover inefficient processes and procedures as well as pro-
cesses that are not in compliance with organizational practices.
                                       Laying Out Quality Assurance Procedures                 389




   You can perform quality audits on a regular schedule or at random depending on the orga-
nizational policies. Quality audits performed correctly will provide the following benefits:
NN   The product of the project is fit for use and meets safety standards.
NN   Applicable laws and standards are adhered to.
NN   Corrective action is recommended and implemented where necessary.
NN   The quality plan for the project is adhered to.
NN   Quality improvements are identified.
NN   The implementation of approved change requests, corrective actions, preventive
     actions, and defect repairs are confirmed.
NN   Gaps or shortcomings in the process are identified.
   Quality improvements come about as a result of the quality audits. During the course
of the audit, you might discover ways of improving the efficiency or effectiveness of the
project, thereby increasing the value of the project and more than likely exceeding stake-
holder expectations.
   Quality improvements are implemented by submitting change requests and/or taking
corrective action. Quality improvements interface with the Monitoring and Controlling
processes because of the need to submit change requests.


                  You'll look at change requests and change request procedures in Chapter 10,
                  "Measuring and Controlling Project Performance."

   Experienced specialists generally perform quality audits. The specialist's job is to produce
an independent evaluation of the quality process. Some organizations are large enough to
have their own quality assurance departments or quality assurance teams; others might have
to hire contract personnel to perform this function. Internal quality assurance teams report
results to the project team and management team of the organization. External quality
assurance teams report results to the customer.

Process Analysis
Process analysis looks at process improvement from an organizational and technical
perspective. According to the PMBOK(R) Guide, process analysis follows the steps in the
process improvement plan and examines the following:
NN   Problems experienced while conducting the project
NN   Constraints experienced while conducting the work of the project
NN   Inefficient and ineffective processes identified during process operation
   One of the techniques of process analysis includes performing root cause analysis. (I talked
about root cause analysis in the Identify Risks process in Chapter 6.) While you're examining
problems and constraints, for example, you should look for what's causing the problem. The
result of this exercise will allow you to develop preventive actions for problems that are similar
to the problem you're examining or that have the similar root causes.
390         Chapter 9   n   Conducting Procurements and Sharing Information




Perform Quality Assurance Outputs
The Perform Quality Assurance process has four outputs:
NN    Organizational process assets updates
NN    Change requests
NN    Project management plan updates
NN    Project document updates
   These aren't new, but there is one new idea embedded in the change requests output.
During this process, any recommended corrective actions, whether they are a result of
a quality audit or process analysis, should be acted upon immediately. Let's say you're
manufacturing parts for one of the deliverables of your project. Obviously, the moment you
discover that the parts are not correct, you'd correct the process by calibrating the machine
perhaps, or by using different raw materials, to make certain the parts are produced
accurately.



Quality Improvements

Although it isn't stated as an output, one of the overarching goals of the Perform Quality
Assurance process is to provide a foundation for continuous process improvements. As the
name implies, continuous improvements are iterative. This process of continuous improve-
ments sets the stage, so to speak, for improving the quality of all the project processes.
This can mean project management processes, but it also means the processes and activi-
ties involved in accomplishing the work of the project.

The advantage of continuous process improvement is that it reduces the time the project
team spends on ineffective or inefficient processes. If the activities don't help you meet
the goals of the project or, worse yet, hinder your progress, it's time to look at ways to
improve them.



   Once again we're going to shift gears and talk about a new process. We'll look at best
practices regarding sharing and distributing information next.



Distributing Project Information
The Distribute Information process is concerned with getting stakeholders information
about the project in a timely manner. This can come about in several ways: status reports,
project meetings, review meetings, and so on. Status reports are actually part of the work
performance information you saw in the output of the Direct and Manage Project Execu-
tion process. Status reports inform stakeholders about where the project is today in regard
                                                Distributing Project Information           391




to project schedule and budget, for example. They also describe what the project team has
accomplished to date. This might include milestones completed to date, the percentage of
schedule completion, and what remains to be completed. The Distribute Information process
describes how this report, and other information, are distributed and to whom.
    In the Distribute Information process, the communications management plan that was
defined during the Plan Communications process is put into action. Remember that this plan
is a subsidiary of the project management plan, which is an input to this process. The other
inputs include performance reports and organizational process assets. Plan Communications
and Distribute Information work together to report the progress of the project team.
    Distribute Information has some new tools and techniques, which we'll look at next.


Tools and Techniques of Distribute Information
The tools and techniques of this process are as follows:
NN   Communication methods
NN   Information distribution tools
   Communication methods include all means feasible to communicate project information
to the appropriate recipients, such as meetings, email, videoconferences, conference calls,
and so on.
   Communication skills are probably the single most important skill in your project
management toolbox. You can't employ communication methods without some sound
communication skills, so let's take a look at this topic next.

Developing Great Communication Skills
Every aspect of your job as a project manager will involve communications. It has been esti-
mated that project managers spend as much as 90 percent of their time communicating in
one form or another. Therefore, communication skills are arguably one of the most impor-
tant skills a project manager can have. They are even more important than technical skills.
Good communication skills foster an open, trusting environment, and excellent communica-
tion skills are a project manager's best asset.
   Throughout this book I've emphasized how important good communication skills are.
Now I'll discuss the act of communication, listening behaviors, and conflict resolution.
You'll employ each of these techniques with your project team, stakeholders, customers,
and management team.

Information Exchange
   Communication is the process of exchanging information. All communication includes
three elements:
Sender The sender is the person responsible for putting the information together in a clear
and concise manner. The information should be complete and presented in a way that the
receiver will be able to correctly understand it. Make your messages relevant to the receiver.
Junk mail is annoying, and information that doesn't pertain in any way whatsoever to the
receiver is nothing more than that.
392       Chapter 9   n   Conducting Procurements and Sharing Information



Message The message is the information being sent and received. It might be written,
verbal, nonverbal, formal, informal, internal, external, horizontal, or vertical. Horizontal
communications are messages sent and received to peers. Vertical communications are mes-
sages sent and received down to subordinates and up to executive management.


                 Make your messages as simple as you can to get your point across. Don't
                 complicate the message with unnecessary detail and technical jargon that
                 others might not understand. A simple trick that helps clarify your mes-
                 sages, especially verbal messages, is to repeat the key information periodi-
                 cally. Public speakers are taught that the best way to organize a speech is
                 to first tell the audience what you're going to tell them; second, tell them;
                 and third, tell them what you just told them.


Receiver The receiver is the person for whom the message is intended. They are respon-
sible for understanding the information correctly and making sure they've received all the
information.
Keep in mind that receivers filter the information they receive through their knowledge of
the subject, culture influences, language, emotions, attitudes, and geographic locations.
The sender should take these filters into consideration when sending messages so that the
receiver will clearly understand the message that was sent.


                 This book is an example of the sender-message-receiver model. I'm the
                 sender of the information. The message concerns topics you need to know
                 to pass the PMP exam (and if I've done my job correctly, is written in a
                 clear and easily understood format). You, the reader, are the receiver.


Methods of Information Exchange
Senders, receivers, and messages are the elements of communication. The way the sender
packages or encodes the information and transmits it and the way the receiver unpacks or
decodes the message are the methods of communication exchange.
    Senders encode messages. Encoding is a method of putting the information into a format
the receiver will understand. Language, pictures, and symbols are used to encode messages.
Encoding formats the message for transmitting.
    Transmitting is the way the information gets from the sender to the receiver. Spoken
words, written documentation, memos, email, and voicemail are all transmitting methods.
    Decoding is what the receiver does with the information when they get it. They convert
it into an understandable format. Usually, this means they read the memo, listen to the
speaker, read the book, and so on.
Forms of Communication
Communication occurs primarily in written or verbal form. Granted, you can point to some-
thing or indicate what you need with motions, but usually you use the spoken or written
word to get your message across.
                                                  Distributing Project Information            393




    Verbal communication is easier and less complicated than written communication, and
it's usually a fast method of communication. Written communication, on the other hand, is
an excellent way to get across complex, detailed messages. Detailed instructions are better
provided in written form because it gives the reader the ability to go back over information
they're not quite sure about.
    Both verbal and written communication might take a formal or an informal approach.
Speeches and lectures are examples of formal verbal communication. Most project status
meetings take more of a formal approach, as do most written project status reports. Gener-
ally speaking, the project manager should take an informal approach when communicating
with stakeholders and project team members outside of the status meetings. This makes
you appear more open and friendly and easier to approach with questions and issues.

Effective Listening Skills
What did you say? Often we think we're listening when we really aren't. In all fairness, we
can take in only so much information at one time. But it's important to perform active listen-
ing when someone else is speaking. As a project manager, you will spend the majority of your
time communicating with team members, stakeholders, customers, vendors, and others. This
means you should be as good a listener as you are a communicator.
   You can use several techniques to improve your listening skills. Many books are devoted
to this topic, so I'll try to highlight some of the most common techniques here:
NN   Appear interested in what the speaker is saying. This will make the speaker feel at ease
     and will benefit you as well. By acting interested, you become interested and thereby
     retain more of the information being presented.
NN   Making eye contact with the speaker is another effective listening tool. This lets the
     speaker know you are paying attention to what they're saying and are interested.
NN   Put your speaker at ease by letting them know beforehand that you're interested in
     what they're going to talk about and that you're looking forward to hearing what they
     have to say. While they're speaking, nod your head, smile, or make comments when
     and if appropriate to let the speaker know you understand the message. If you don't
     understand something and are in the proper setting, ask clarifying questions.
NN   Another great trick that works well in lots of situations is to recap what the speaker
     said in your own words and tell it back to them. Start with something like this, "Let
     me make sure I understand you correctly, you're saying...," and ask the speaker to con-
     firm that you did understand them correctly.
NN   Just as your mother always said, it's impolite to interrupt. Interrupting is a way of
     telling the speaker that you aren't really listening and you're more interested in telling
     them what you have to say than listening to them. Interrupting gets the other person
     off track, they might forget their point, and it might even make them angry.
    Not to disagree with Mom, but there probably are some occasions where interrupting
is appropriate. For example, if you're in a project status meeting and someone wants to
take the meeting off course, sometimes the only way to get the meeting back on track is
to interrupt them. You can do this politely. Start first by saying the person's name to get
their attention. Then let them know that you'd be happy to talk with them about their topic
394         Chapter 9   n   Conducting Procurements and Sharing Information



outside of the meeting or add it to the agenda for the next status meeting if it's something
everyone needs to hear. Sorry, Mom.

Resolving Conflicts
We discussed conflict resolution techniques in Chapter 8. These are also a form of commu-
nication skills. You may recall the conflict resolutions techniques:
NN    Forcing
NN    Smoothing/accommodating
NN    Compromise
NN    Confrontation/problem solving
NN    Collaborating
NN    Withdrawal/avoidance
   Keep in mind that group size makes a difference when you're trying to resolve conflict or
make decisions. Remember the channels of communication you learned about in Chapter 5?
The larger the group, the more lines of communication and the more difficult it will be to
reach a decision. Groups of 5 to 11 people have a manageable number of participants and
have been shown to make the most accurate decisions.
   Use communication, listening, and conflict resolution skills wisely. As a project manager,
you'll find that your day-to-day activities encompass these three areas the majority of the
time. Project managers with excellent communication skills can work wonders. Communi-
cation won't take the place of proper planning and management techniques, but a project
manager who communicates well with their team and the stakeholders can make up for a
lack of technical skills any day, hands down. If your team and your stakeholders trust you
and you can communicate the vision and the project goals and report on project status accu-
rately and honestly, the world is your oyster.

Information Distribution Tools
Information distribution tools are ways of getting the project information to the project team
or stakeholders. As the name implies, these are ways to distribute the information and might
include email, hard copy, voicemail, videoconferencing, and so on. It also includes electronic
project management tools like schedules and meeting software for maintaining project records.



Exam Spotlight

According to the PMBOK(R) Guide, it's a project manager's professional obligation to hold
lessons learned meetings.




                   I'll talk more about lessons learned in Chapter 11.
                                                 Distributing Project Information          395




Output of Distribute Information
The output of the Distribute Information process is organizational process assets updates.
The updates here consist of six elements:
Stakeholder notifications Remember that the focus of this process is distributing informa-
tion. Stakeholder notifications involve notifying stakeholders when you have implemented
solutions and approved changes, have updated project status, have resolved issues, and so on.
Project reports Project reports include the project status reports and minutes from proj-
ect meetings, lessons learned, closure reports, and other documents from all the process
outputs throughout the project. If you're keeping an issue log, the issues would be included
with the project reports as well.
Project presentations Project presentations involve presenting project information to the
stakeholders and other appropriate parties when necessary. The presentations might be for-
mal or informal and depend on the audience and the information being communicated.
Project records Project records include, as you might guess, memos, correspondence, and
other documents concerning the project. The best place to keep information like this is in a
project notebook or in a set of project notebooks, depending on the size of the project. The
project notebooks are ordinary three-ring binders where project information gets filed. They
are maintained by the project manager or project office and contain all information regarding
the project. You could also keep the information on a project website, the company intranet,
or CDs. If you're keeping the information electronically, make certain it's backed up regu-
larly. Individual team members might keep their own project records as well in notebooks or
electronically. These records serve as historical information once the project is closed.
Feedback from stakeholders This one ties into lessons learned. Feedback you receive from
the stakeholders that can improve future performance on this project or future projects should
be captured and documented. If the information has an impact on the current project, distrib-
ute it to the appropriate team members so that future project performance can be modified to
improve results.
Lessons learned documentation Lessons learned are information that you gather and doc-
ument throughout the course of the project that can be used to benefit the current project,
future projects, or other projects currently being performed by the organization. Lessons
learned might include positive as well as negative lessons.
During the Distribute Information process, you'll begin conducting lessons learned meetings
focusing on many different areas, depending on the nature of your project. These areas might
include project management processes, product development, technical processes, project
team performance, stakeholder involvement, and so on.
Lessons learned meetings should always be conducted at the end of project phases and
at the end of the project at minimum. Team members, stakeholders, vendors, and others
involved on the project should participate in these meetings. It's important to understand,
and to make your team members understand, that this is not a finger-pointing meeting. The
396        Chapter 9   n   Conducting Procurements and Sharing Information



purpose of lessons learned is to understand what went well and why--so you can repeat it
on future projects--and what didn't go so well and why--so you can perform differently
on future projects. These meetings can make good team-building sessions because you're
creating an atmosphere of trust and sharing and you're building on each other's strengths
to improve performance.
You should document the reasons or causes for the issues, the corrective action taken and
why, and any other information that future projects might benefit from.
   We're making one last switch of focus in this chapter and will examine how to manage
stakeholder expectations next.



Managing Stakeholder Expectations
In my experience, managing stakeholder expectations is much more difficult than manag-
ing project team members. Stakeholders are often managers or directors in the organization
who might be higher in the food chain than the project manager and aren't afraid to let you
know it. Having said that, you can manage stakeholder expectations and you do this using
communication.


                 If you need a refresher on the definition and role of stakeholders, please
                 see Chapter 1, "What Is a Project?"

   The Manage Stakeholder Expectations process is about satisfying the needs of the
stakeholders by managing communications with them, resolving issues, improving project
performance by implementing requested changes, and managing concerns in anticipation of
potential problems.
   Stakeholders need lots of communication in every form you can provide. If you are
actively engaged with your stakeholders and interacting with them, providing project sta-
tus, and resolving issues, your chances of a successful project are much greater than if you
don't do these things.



Exam Spotlight

According to the PMBOK(R) Guide, it's the project manager's responsibility to manage
stakeholder expectations. By doing so, it will decrease the potential for project failure.
Managing the expectations of your stakeholders will also increase the chance of meeting
the project goals because issues are resolved in a timely manner and disruptions during
the project are limited.
                                             Managing Stakeholder Expectations                397




Manage Stakeholder Expectations Inputs
     The inputs of Manage Stakeholder Expectations include the following:
NN    Stakeholder register
NN    Stakeholder management strategy
NN    Project management plan
NN    Issue log
NN    Change log
NN    Organizational process assets
   We have discussed each of these inputs previously with the exception of change log. One
thing to note about the issue log in this process is that it acts more like an action item log
where you record the actions needed to resolve stakeholder concerns and project issues they
raise. Issues should be ranked according to their urgency and potential impact on the project.
As with the issue log in the Manage Project Team process, you'll assign a responsible party
and a due date for resolution.



Exam Spotlight

According to the PMBOK(R) Guide, the issue log (or action item log) can be used to promote
communication with stakeholders and to ensure that stakeholders and the project team
have the same understanding of the issues.



   We'll look more closely at change logs in the next chapter, but for purposes of this process,
understand that this is a log that documents all the changes made during the course of the
project. In terms of stakeholder expectations, you'll want to keep stakeholders updated on
changes and their impacts to the project.


Tools and Techniques for Manage
Stakeholder Expectations
The tools and techniques of this process include communication methods, interpersonal
skills, and management skills. It's been a while since we talked about management skills,
but for purposes of this process, they refer primarily to presenting, negotiating, writing,
and public speaking skills. Keep in mind that face-to-face communications are the most
effective with stakeholders.


Manage Stakeholder Outputs
The outputs of the Manage Stakeholder process are organizational process assets updates,
change requests, project management plan updates, and project document updates.
398         Chapter 9   n   Conducting Procurements and Sharing Information



The project documents that may need an update as a result of this process include the
stakeholder management strategy, the stakeholder register, and the issue log.
   You've successfully completed the Executing process group. Remember that the Executing
processes and Monitoring and Controlling processes serve as inputs to each other and that
Executing and Monitoring and Controlling are both iterative process groups. As your project
progresses and it becomes evident that you need to exercise controls to get the project back on
track, you'll come back through the Executing process group and then proceed through the
Monitoring and Controlling processes again. You'll move on to the Monitoring and Control-
ling process group now and find out what it's all about.




Project Case Study: New Kitchen Heaven Retail Store

Dirk Perrier logs on and finds the following status report addressed to all the stakeholders
and project team members from you:

Section 4: Progress Expected This Reporting Period Not Completed
None. Project is on track to date.

Section 5: Progress Expected Next Reporting Period
Build-out will continue. Jake reports that Gomez expects to have electrical lines run and
drywall started prior to the end of the next reporting period.

Ricardo should have a T1 update. There's a slim possibility that the T1 connection will
have occurred by next reporting period.

Section 6: Issues
We had to start the build-out on the last day of the cable run (this is called fast tracking)
to keep the project on schedule. Jake and Ricardo reported only minor problems with
this arrangement in that the contractors got into each other's way a time or two. This did
not impact the completion of the cable run because most of day two this team was in the
back room and Gomez's crew was in the storefront area.

A key member of the Gomez construction crew was out last week because of a family
emergency. Gomez assures us that it will not impact the build-out schedule. They replaced
the team member with someone from another project, so it appears so far that the build-
out is on schedule.

Ricardo is somewhat concerned about the T1 connection because the phone company
won't return his calls inquiring about status. We're still ahead of the curve on this one
because hardware isn't scheduled to begin testing until January 21. Hardware testing
depends on the T1 connection. This is a heads-up at this point, and we'll carry this as an
issue in the status report going forward until it's resolved.

One of the gourmet food item suppliers Jill uses regularly went out of business. She is
in the process of tracking down a new supplier to pick up the slack for the existing stores
and supply the gourmet food products for the new store.

Status Meeting in Early December
"Thank you all for coming," you begin. You note those stakeholders who are present
and pass out the agendas. "First, we have a contract update. Jake, would you give us the
update, please?"

"Gomez Construction has submitted a seller payment request for the work completed
through November 30. Shelly in our contract management office manages the payment
system and handles all payment requests. She'll get a check cut and out to Gomez by the
end of this month. They are doing an outstanding job as always. As you know, I've also
hired an independent inspector, aside from the city and county types, so that we make
sure we're up to code before the city types get there. I don't want to get caught in that
trap and end up delaying the project because we can't get the city inspector back out to
reinspect quickly enough."
400           Chapter 9      n   Conducting Procurements and Sharing Information




"Thank you, Jake. Any problems with those inspections so far?"

Jake clears his throat. "It turned out to be a good move because the contractor did find
some things that we were able to correct before bringing out the official inspectors."

"Ricardo, do you have a contract update for us today?"

"Yes. The contract management office used a fixed-price contract on the hardware and IT
supplies order. That contract is just now making its way through the sign-off processes.
My group will manage the quality control and testing once all this equipment arrives."

"Jill, can you give us the update on the store?" you ask.

"I've ordered all the retail products, have ordered the cookware line, and have lined up
the chef demos. The costs for the new gourmet supplier we're using are higher than our
original vendor. This impacts ongoing operations, but the hit to the project budget is
minimal. I should also mention that a change request was submitted."

You point everyone's attention to the issues list. "In the last meeting I reported that
Gomez had an important crew member out on a family emergency. Gomez was able to
replace the team member with no impact to the schedule. The next issue was the T1 con-
nection--I reported that Ricardo was not receiving return phone calls. Good news--that
issue has been cleared, the date has been set, and we can close this issue. Are there any
new issues to be added this week?"

There were no additional issues reported.

"What's the forecast?" Dirk asks. "Are we on track for meeting the grand opening date
given all these issues?"

"I'll have performance figures for you at the next status meeting, and I have some ideas
on how we can make up this time other ways so that we still meet the date."

You thank everyone for coming and remind them of the next meeting time.

Understanding How This Applies
to Your Next Project
This chapter is jammed with information you need to know for the exam as well as on the
job. But depending on the size of your organization, many of the processes I discussed in the
Executing process group might actually be handled by another department in your organi-
zation. I've worked in small companies (fewer than 100 people) and very large companies
and have always had either a person or a department that was responsible for the vendor
selection, contract negotiation, and contract administration. In all these situations and in my
current role as project manager, I have significant input to these processes, but the person or
department responsible for procurement has the ultimate control. For example, we use only
RFPs (and occasionally RFIs) to solicit vendors. We typically use a weighted scoring model
in combination with a screening and rating system to choose a vendor. For small projects,
we have a list of prequalified vendors from which to choose.
   Someone who is skilled at writing contracts can best handle the contracts, which ideally
should be reviewed by the legal team. The legal team should also review changes proposed
by the vendor before signing on the dotted line. Clear, concise, and specific contracts, in my
experience, are a critical success factor for any project. I've too often seen contract issues
bring a project to a sudden halt. Another classic contract faux pas allows the vendor to
think the work is complete while the buyer believes the vendor is weeks or months away
from meeting the requirements. These types of disputes can almost always be traced back
to an unclear, imprecise contract. It's important to be specific in your statement of work.
Make sure that the project requirements are clear and broken down far enough to be mea-
surable and that deliverables are defined with criteria that allow you to inspect for contract
compliance prior to final acceptance.
402        Chapter 9   n   Conducting Procurements and Sharing Information



   I'll emphasize one last time the importance of communication, good communication skills,
and getting that information into the appropriate hands at the right time. Enough said.
   Managing your stakeholder's expectations is as important as managing the project team.
Stakeholders need plenty of communication, and issues need to be discussed and resolutions
agreed upon. Remember the old adage that most people need to hear the same information
six times before it registers with them. Stakeholders, understandably, are notorious for hear-
ing what they want to hear. Here's an example: If I asked you to picture an elephant, you
would likely picture an elephant in your mind. It might be live or the stuffed variety and it
could be gray, brown, or pink, but you'd clearly understand the concept. Elephant is a word
that's pretty hard to misinterpret. But what if I asked you to picture a three-bedroom house?
There's lots of room for interpretation there. When I said three-bedroom house, I meant
ranch style with the master on one end of the house and the other two bedrooms at the other
end of the house. What did you picture? Make certain you're using language your stakehold-
ers understand, and repeat it often until you're certain they get it.



Summary
This chapter finished up the Executing process group. We looked at Conduct Procure-
ments, Perform Quality Assurance, Distribute Information, and Manage Stakeholder
Expectations.
   Conduct Procurements involves obtaining responses to bids and proposals from potential
vendors, selecting a vendor, and awarding the contract. In this process, the selection com-
mittee will use proposal evaluation techniques to prioritize the bids and proposals, and the
outcome is that a seller (or sellers) is selected and contracts awarded.
   Contracts have cycles of their own, much like projects. Phases of the contracting life
cycle include requirement, requisition, solicitation, and award. Changes to the contract are
managed with change requests.
   Changes that cannot be agreed upon are contested changes. These take the form of
disputes, claims, or appeals. They might be settled among the parties directly, through a
court of law, or through arbitration.
   During the Perform Quality Assurance process, quality audits are performed to ensure that
the project will meet and satisfy the project's quality standards set out in the quality plan.
   Distribute Information is concerned with making certain project information is available
to stakeholders at the right time and in the appropriate format. Distribute Information is
performed throughout the life of the project.
   The Manage Stakeholder Expectations process concerns making certain communication
needs and expectations of the stakeholders are met, managing any issues stakeholders might
raise that could become future issues, and resolving previously identified issues.
                                                                 Exam Essentials           403




Exam Essentials
Be able to describe the purpose of the Conduct Procurements process. Conduct Procure-
ments involves obtaining bids and proposals from vendors, selecting a vendor, and award-
ing a contract.

                                                    Answers to Review Questions              411



16. B. Status meetings are to report on the progress of the project. They are not for demos
    or show-and-tell. Option C is not correct because stakeholders are not concerned about
    the content of the technical documentation; they need to know that a qualified techni-
    cian has reviewed the technical documentation and that the documentation task is accu-
    rate and complete.

17. D. The selected sellers output requires a negotiated contract. Independent estimates are a
    tool and technique of this process.

18. A. The project manager alone is responsible for managing stakeholder expectations.

19. B. Procurement negotiations, a tool and technique of Conduct Procurements, can become
    its own process with inputs and outputs for large or complex projects.

20. C. The solicitation phase is where bids and proposals are prepared. The award phase of the
    contract life cycle is where bids and proposals are received and evaluation criteria used to
    determine a winner.

          The PMP exam content from the
          Executing the Project performance
          domain covered in this chapter
          includes the following:

           Verify and Manage Changes to the Project

                              This chapter introduces the Monitoring and Controlling pro-
                              cess group. The Monitoring and Controlling process group
                              involves taking measurements and performing inspections to
find out whether there are variances in the plan. If you discover variances, you need to take
corrective action to get the project back on track and repeat the affected project Planning
processes to make adjustments to the plan as a result of resolving the variances.
   We'll start with the Monitor and Control Project Work process. This involves tracking,
reviewing, and adjusting and controlling progress to meet the project performance objec-
tives. We'll also look at Administer Procurements, Report Performance, and Perform Inte-
grated Change Control.
   Administer Procurements is where contract performance is monitored, procurement rela-
tionships are managed, and corrections or changes are implemented where needed.
   Performance reports are an output of the Report Performance process and are used dur-
ing the Monitoring and Controlling processes, along with tools and techniques, to measure
project performance. These measurements and control tools allow the project manager to
take corrective action during the Monitoring and Controlling processes to remedy wayward
project results and realign future project results with the project management plan.
   Perform Integrated Change Control lays the foundation for all the control processes that
we'll talk about in Chapter 11, such as Monitor and Control Risk, Control Costs, Control
Schedule, and more. I'll take the time during this discussion to explain how change control
and configuration management works. Remember when you're reading these sections that
the information from the Perform Integrated Change Control process applies to all the con-
trol processes we'll talk about in Chapter 11.
   You've learned a lot about project management by this point and have just a few more
topics to add to your study list. Keep up the good work. You're getting closer to exam day.



Monitoring and Controlling Project Work
The processes in the Monitoring and Controlling process group concentrate on monitoring
and measuring project performance to identify variances from the project plan and get it
back on track.
   The Monitor and Control Project Work process is concerned with monitoring all the
processes in the Initiating, Planning, Executing, and Closing process groups. Collecting
data, measuring results, and reporting on performance information are some of the activi-
ties you'll perform during this process.
                                       Monitoring and Controlling Project Work              415




   According to the PMBOK(R) Guide, the Monitor and Control Project Work process
involves the following:
NN   Reporting and comparing actual project results against the project management plan
NN   Analyzing performance data and determining whether corrective or preventive action
     should be recommended
NN   Monitoring the project for risks to make certain they're identified and reported, their
     status is documented, and the appropriate risk response plans have been put into action
NN   Documenting all appropriate product information throughout the life of the project
NN   Gathering, recording, and documenting project information that provides project status,
     measurements of progress, and forecasting to update cost and schedule information that
     is reported to stakeholders, project team members, management, and others
NN   Monitoring approved change requests


Monitor and Control Project Work Inputs
The inputs of this process include project management plan, performance reports, enterprise
environmental factors, and organizational process assets. The enterprise environmental factors
input in this process includes elements like standards, work authorization systems, risk toler-
ances of your stakeholders, and project management information systems. Let's look briefly at
work authorization systems.


                 A curious thing happens here. The PMBOK(R) Guide lists work authoriza-
                 tion systems as a tool in its glossary but it's noted as an enterprise envi-
                 ronmental factor input in the Monitor and Control Project Work process. I
                 recommend that you understand what a work authorization system is for
                 the exam and how you use it. And for the record, you'll use these systems
                 during the Executing processes.

   A work authorization system is a subsystem of the project management system. This is a
formal, documented procedure that describes how to authorize work and how to begin that
work in the correct sequence and at the right time. This system describes the steps needed
to issue a work authorization, the documents needed, the method or system you'll use to
record and track the authorization information, and the approval levels required to autho-
rize the work. You should understand the complexity of the project and balance the cost of
instituting a work authorization system against the benefit you'll receive from it. This might
be overkill on small projects, and verbal instructions might work just as well. For purposes
of the exam, understand that project work is assigned and committed via a work authoriza-
tion system.
   Work is usually authorized using a form that describes the task, the responsible party,
anticipated start and end dates, special instructions, and whatever else is particular to the
activity or project. Depending on the organizational structure, the work is generally assigned
416        Chapter 10   n   Measuring and Controlling Project Performance



and authorized by either the project manager or the functional manager. Remember that the
system includes documentation on who has the authority to issue work authorization orders.
   The only tool and technique of this process is expert judgment, so we'll move right into
the outputs next.


Monitor and Control Project Work Outputs
The outputs of the Monitor and Control Project Work process will also look familiar. They
are as follows:
NN    Change requests
NN    Project management plan updates
NN    Project document updates
   Remember from Chapter 9 that change requests may take the form of corrective actions,
preventive actions, or defect repairs. Corrective actions bring the work of the project into
alignment with expected future performance. Preventive actions are implemented to help
reduce the probability of negative project risks. Defect repairs either correct or replace com-
ponents that are substandard or malfunctioning.
   Project management plan updates may include updates to one or more of the manage-
ment plans, including schedule, cost, or quality, and may require updates to the baselines,
including scope, schedule, and cost performance.
   Project document updates may include updates to forecasts, performance reports, and
the issue log.


                  You'll examine several formulas and other tools and techniques that will
                  help you do update forecasts in the next chapter.




Administering Procurements
We'll now take another look at the procurement arena. We learned about Conduct Procure-
ments in Chapter 9. Now that the contract has been awarded, you need to administer it.
   The Administer Procurements process concerns monitoring the vendor's performance
and ensuring that all the requirements of the contract are met. When multiple vendors are
providing goods and services to the project, Administer Procurements entails coordinat-
ing the interfaces among all the vendors as well as administering each of the contracts. If
vendor A has a due date that will impact whether vendor B can perform their service, the
management and coordination of the two vendors become important. Vendor A's contract
and due dates must be monitored closely because failure to perform could impact another
vendor's ability to perform, not to mention the project schedule. You can see how this situa-
tion could multiply quickly when you have six or seven or more vendors involved.
                                                     Administering Procurements               417




                  It's imperative that the project manager and project team are aware of any
                  contract agreements that might impact the project so the team does not
                  inadvertently take action that violates the terms of the contract.

    Depending on the size of the organization, administering the contract might fall to some-
one in the procurement department. This doesn't mean you're off the hook as the project
manager. It's still your responsibility to oversee the process and make sure the project objec-
tives are being met, regardless of whether a vendor is performing the activities or your project
team members are performing the activities. You'll be the one monitoring the performance
of the vendor and informing them when and if performance is lacking. You'll also monitor
the contract's financial conditions. For example, the seller should be paid in a timely manner
when they've satisfactorily met the conditions of the contract, and it will be up to you to let
the procurement department know it's OK to pay the vendor. If administering the contract
is your responsibility, you might have to terminate the contract when the vendor violates the
terms or doesn't meet the agreed-upon deliverables. If the procurement department has this
responsibility, you'll have to document the situation and provide this to the procurement
department so that they can enforce or terminate the contract.
    Administering the contract is closely linked with project management processes. You'll
monitor the progress of the contract, execute plans, track costs, measure outputs, approve
changes, take corrective action, and report on status, just as you do for the project itself.
According to the PMBOK(R) Guide, you must integrate and coordinate the Direct and Man-
age Project Execution, Report Performance, Perform Quality Control, Perform Integrated
Change Control, and Monitor and Control Risk processes during the Administer Procure-
ments process.



Exam Spotlight

Buyers and sellers are equally responsible for monitoring the contract. Each has a vested
interest in ensuring that the other party is living up to their contractual obligations and
that their own legal rights are protected.




Contracting Inputs
Administer Procurements has six inputs:
NN   Procurement documents
NN   Project management plan
NN   Contract
NN   Performance reports
NN   Approved change requests
NN   Work performance information
418         Chapter 10   n   Measuring and Controlling Project Performance



   Procurement documents and project management plan are outputs from previous
processes. We will cover performance reports in more detail in the section "Establishing
Performance Measurements" later in this chapter. Performance reports for the Administer
Procurements process include information related to the seller (or vendor).

Approved Change Requests
Sometimes as you get into the work of the project, you'll discover changes need to be made.
This could entail changes to the contract as well. Approved change requests are used to
process the project or contract changes and might include things such as modifications to
deliverables, changes to the product or service of the project, changes in contract terms, or
termination for poor performance. Contracts can be amended at any time prior to contract
completion provided the changes are agreed to by all parties and conform to the change
control processes outlined in the contract.



Exam Spotlight

Work performance information is an output of the Direct and Manage Project Execution
process. The results you gather in the Administer Procurements process are actually
collected as part of the Direct and Manage Project Execution work result output.




Work Performance Information
Work performance information concerns monitoring work results and examining the ven-
dor's deliverables. This includes monitoring their work results against the project manage-
ment plan and making certain activities are performed correctly and in sequence. You'll
need to determine which deliverables are complete and which ones have not been completed
to date. You'll also need to consider the quality of the deliverables and the costs that have
been incurred to date.
   Vendors request payment for the goods or services delivered in the form of seller
invoices. Seller invoices should describe the work that was completed or the materials that
were delivered and should include any supporting documentation necessary to describe
what was delivered. The contract should state what type of supporting documentation is
needed with the invoice.


Administering Procurements Tools and Techniques
The Administer Procurements process has several tools and techniques:
NN    Contract change control system
NN    Procurement performance reviews
NN    Inspections and audits
NN    Performance Reporting
                                                      Administering Procurements             419



NN    Payment systems
NN    Claims administration
NN    Records management system
     You will look at each of these in the following sections.

Contract Change Control System
Much like the management plans found in the Planning processes, the contract change
control system describes the processes needed to make contract changes. Since the con-
tract is a legal document, changes to it require the agreement of all parties. A formal pro-
cess must be established to process and authorize (or deny) changes. (Authorization levels
are defined in the organizational policies.)
   The purpose of the contract change control system is to establish a formal process for
submitting change requests. It documents how to submit changes, establishes the approval
process, and outlines authority levels. It includes a tracking system to number the change
requests and record their status. The procedures for dispute resolution are spelled out in the
contract change control system as well.
   The change control system, along with all the management plan outputs, becomes part
of the Perform Integrated Change Control process that I'll discuss later in this chapter.

Procurement Performance Reviews
Procurement performance reviews examine the seller's performance on the contract to
date. These reviews can be conducted at the end of the contract or at intervals during the
contract period. Procurement reviews examine the contract terms and seller performance
for elements such as these:
NN    Meeting project scope
NN    Meeting project quality
NN    Staying within project budgets
NN    Meeting the project schedule
   The performance reviews themselves might take the form of quality audits or inspec-
tions of documents as well as the work of the product itself. The point of the review is
to determine where the seller is succeeding at meeting scope, quality, cost, and schedule
issues, for example, or where they're not measuring up. If the seller is not in compliance,
action must be taken to either get them back into compliance or terminate the contract.
The yardstick you're using to measure their performance against is the contract SOW and
the terms of the contract. When the RFP is included as part of the contract, you might also
use it to determine contract compliance.

Inspections and Audits
I talked about quality audits as part of the Perform Quality Assurance process. The idea is
the same here. The buyer, or some designated third party, will physically inspect the work
of the seller and perform audits to determine whether there are any deficiencies in the seller's
product or service.
420        Chapter 10   n   Measuring and Controlling Project Performance



Performance Reporting
Performance reporting is a large part of project management. This tool and technique
entails providing your managers and stakeholders with information about the vendor's
progress in meeting the contract objectives. This information is also part of the Report
Performance process that I'll discuss in depth later in this chapter.

Payment Systems
Vendors submit seller invoices as an input to this process, and the payment systems tool
and technique is used to issue payments. The organization might have a dedicated depart-
ment, such as accounts payable, that handles vendor payments, or it might fall to the
project manager. In either case, follow the policies and procedures the organization has
established regarding vendor payments and make certain the payments themselves adhere
to the contract terms.

Claims Administration
Claims administration involves documenting, monitoring, and managing contested changes
to the contract. Changes that cannot be agreed upon are called contested changes. Con-
tested changes usually involve a disagreement about the compensation to the vendor for
implementing the change. You might believe the change is not significant enough to justify
additional compensation, whereas the vendor believes they'll lose money by implementing
the change free of charge. Contested changes are also known as disputes, claims, or appeals.
These can be settled directly between the parties themselves, through the court system, or
by a process called arbitration. Arbitration involves bringing all parties to the table with a
third, disinterested party who is not a participant in the contract to try to reach an agree-
ment. The purpose of arbitration is to reach an agreement without having to go to court.



Exam Spotlight

According to the PMBOK(R) Guide, when the parties cannot reach an agreement them-
selves, they should use an alternative dispute resolution (ADR) process, like arbitration.
Also note that the preferred method of settling disputes is negotiation.




Records Management System
It has been a while since I've talked about documentation, but discussing the records man-
agement system reminds me of the importance of having an organized system for contract
documentation. A records management system involves not just documentation, but policies,
control functions, and automated tools. These can all be considered part of the project man-
agement information system you use to manage project documents and should include your
                                                      Administering Procurements               421




contract documents. Records management systems typically index documents for easy filing
and retrieval.


Managing Contract Outputs
The outputs to the Administer Procurements process are as follows:
NN   Procurement documentation
NN   Organizational process asset updates
NN   Change requests
NN   Project management plan updates
   These outputs relate to the tools and techniques just talked about and in practice, work
hand in hand with them. I've talked about project management plan updates before and I
don't have anything new to add here. The remaining outputs have some additional informa-
tion you need to know.

Procurement Documentation
Here's your favorite topic again. This output includes (but isn't limited to) all of the following:
NN   Contract
NN   Performance information
NN   Warranties
NN   Financial information (such as invoices and payment records)
NN   Inspection and audit results
NN   Supporting schedules
NN   Approved and unapproved changes
   The records management system I talked about earlier is the perfect place to keep all
these documents.

Organizational Process Asset Updates
Organizational process assets updates consist of organizational policies, procedures, and
so on. Three elements of this output relate to contracts:
Correspondence Correspondence is information that needs to be communicated in writing
to either the seller or the buyer. Examples include changes to the contract, clarification of con-
tract terms, results of buyer audits and inspections, and notification of performance issues.
You'll use correspondence to inform the vendor if their performance is unsatisfactory. If they
don't correct it, you'll use correspondence again to notify a vendor that you're terminating the
contract because performance is below expectations and is not satisfying the requirements of
the contract.
422        Chapter 10   n   Measuring and Controlling Project Performance



Payment schedules and requests Many times, contracts are written such that payment
is made based on a predefined performance schedule. For example, perhaps the first
payment is made after 25 percent of the product or service is completed. Or maybe the
payment schedule is based on milestone completion. In any case, as the project manager,
you will verify that the vendor's work (or delivery) meets expectations before the pay-
ment is authorized. It's almost always your responsibility as the project manager to verify
that the terms of the contract to date have or have not been satisfied. Depending on your
organizational policies, someone from the accounting or procurement department might
request written notification from you that the vendor has completed a milestone or made
a delivery. Monitoring the work of the vendor is as important as monitoring the work of
your team members.
If the procurement department is responsible for paying the contractor, then that depart-
ment manages the payment schedule (which is one of the terms of the contract). The seller
submits a payment request, an inspection or review of their performance is conducted to
make certain the terms of the contract were fulfilled, and the payment is made.
Seller performance evaluation Seller performance evaluation is a written record of the
seller's performance on the contract and is prepared by the buyer. It should include infor-
mation about whether the seller successfully met contract dates, whether the seller fulfilled
the requirements of the contract and/or contract statement of work, whether the work was
satisfactory, and so on. Seller performance evaluations can be used as a basis for terminat-
ing the existing contract if performance is not satisfactory. It can also be used to determine
penalty fees in the case of unsatisfactory performance or incentives that are due accord-
ing to the terms of the contract. They should also indicate whether the vendor should be
allowed to bid on future work. Seller performance evaluations can also be included as part
of the qualified sellers lists.

Change Requests
Requested contract changes are coordinated with the Direct and Manage Project Execu-
tion and Perform Integrated Change Control processes so that any changes impacting the
project are communicated to the project team and appropriate actions are put into place
to realign the objectives. This might also mean you'll have to change or modify the project
management plan, the cost baseline, or the project schedule. That requires you to jump
back to the Planning process group to bring the project management plan, or other docu-
ments, up-to-date. Once the plan is updated, the Direct and Manage Project Execution pro-
cess might require changes as well to get the work of the project in line with the new plan.
Remember that project management is an iterative process, and it's not unusual to revisit
the Planning or Executing processes, particularly as changes are made or corrective actions
are put into place.
   Contract changes will not always impact the project management plan, however. For
example, late delivery of key equipment probably would impact the project management
plan, but changes in the vendor payment schedule probably would not. It's important that
                                      Establishing Performance Measurements                 423




you are kept abreast of any changes to the contract so that you can evaluate whether the
project management plan needs adjusting.



Exam Spotlight

I recommend remembering the inputs, tools and techniques, and outputs of the contract-
ing processes, including Plan Procurements, Conduct Procurements, and Administer Pro-
curements. Be certain you understand the purposes of these processes and don't simply
memorize their components. Here's a brief recap:

NN   Plan Procurements: Preparing the SOW and procurement documents and determining
     source selection criteria
NN   Conduct Procurements: Obtaining bids and proposals from potential vendors,
     evaluating proposals against predetermined evaluation criteria, selecting vendors,
     and awarding the contract
NN   Administer Procurements: Monitoring vendor performance to ensure that contract
     requirements are met




Establishing Performance Measurements
As mentioned, the Monitoring and Controlling process group concentrates on monitoring
and measuring project performance to identify variances from the project plan. Report
Performance is the process where the collection of baseline data occurs and is documented
and reported. Report Performance is part of the Communications Management Knowl-
edge Area, as is the Manage Stakeholder Expectations process. Thus, it involves collecting
information regarding project progress and project accomplishments and reporting it to
the stakeholders. This information might also be reported to project team members, the
management team, and other interested parties. Reporting might include information con-
cerning project quality, costs, scope, project schedules, procurement, and risk, and it can be
presented in the form of status reports, progress measurements, or forecasts.



Exam Spotlight

According to the PMBOK(R) Guide, the performance reports produced as a result of this
process should include project completion forecasts. We'll talk about forecasting methods
as a tool and technique of this process.
424         Chapter 10    n   Measuring and Controlling Project Performance




Report Performance Inputs
You've examined most of the inputs to the Report Performance process previously. They
are as follows:
NN    Project management plan
NN    Work performance information
NN    Work performance measurements
NN    Budget forecasts
NN    Organizational process assets
   The project management plan contains the project management baseline data (typically
cost, schedule, and scope factors), which you'll use to monitor and compare results. Devia-
tions from this data are reported to management. Work performance measures are taken
primarily during the Control Cost, Control Schedule, and Perform Quality Control pro-
cesses, which we'll look at in the next chapter.


Report Performance Tools and Techniques
The following are tools and techniques of this process:
NN    Variance analysis
NN    Forecasting methods
NN    Communication methods
NN    Reporting systems
   We will talk in depth about variance analysis in Chapter 11, and we'll examine the
remaining tools and techniques next.

Forecasting Methods
Forecasting involves examining the actual project performance data to date and making
predictions about future project performance based on this data. According to the PMBOK(R)
Guide, forecasting methods fall into four different categories and each category has several
types of forecasting methods. We'll look at a brief description of each of the categories next.
The methods listed within these categories are beyond the scope of this book to describe.
Time series methods This forecasting method uses historical data to predict future
performance. Earned value, moving average, extrapolation, trend estimation, linear pre-
diction, and growth curve are some of the methods the PMBOK(R) Guide states fall into
this category. We'll cover earned value in Chapter 11.
Causal/econometric methods Causal methods are based on the ability to identify variables
that may cause or influence the forecast. A drop in interest rates, for example, may spur
an increase in home sales. The methods included in this category are regression analysis,
autoregressive moving average (ARMA), and econometrics.
                                      Establishing Performance Measurements                425




Judgmental methods If your mom is anything like mine, judging others was an activity we
were forbidden to participate in. This category of forecasting does just that, only it doesn't
judge people. It uses opinions, intuitive judgments, and probability estimates to determine
possible future results. Methods within this category include composite forecasts, the Delphi
method, surveys, technology forecasting, scenario building, and forecast by analogy.
Other methods Other types of forecasting methods include simulation (like Monte Carlo
analysis), probabilistic forecasting, and ensemble forecasting.

Communication Methods
Communication methods in this process include status review meetings. Status meetings are
a type of push communication and are important functions during the course of the project.
(I introduced status review meetings with the Information Distribution Process in the previ-
ous chapter.) The purpose of the status meeting is to provide updated information regarding
the progress of the project. These are not show-and-tell meetings. If you have a prototype to
demo, set up a different time to do that. Status meetings are meant to exchange information
and provide project updates. They are a way to formally exchange project information. I've
worked on projects where it's not unusual to have three or four status meetings conducted for
different audiences. They can occur between the project team and project manager, between
the project manager and stakeholders, between the project manager and users or customers,
between the project manager and the management team, and so on.
    Notice that the project manager is always included in status review meetings. Take care
that you don't overburden yourself with meetings that aren't necessary or meetings that could
be combined with other meetings. Having any more than three or four status meetings per
month is unwieldy.


                 Regular, timely status meetings prevent surprises down the road because
                 you are keeping stakeholders and customers informed of what's happening.
                 Team status meetings alert the project manager to potential risk events and
                 provide the opportunity to discover and manage problems before they get
                 to the uncontrollable stage.

   The project manager is usually the expediter of the status meeting. As such, it's your job
to use status meetings wisely. Don't waste your team's time or the stakeholders' time either.
Notify attendees in writing of the meeting time and place. Publish an agenda prior to the
meeting, and stick to the agenda during the meeting. Every so often, summarize what has
been discussed during the meeting. Don't let side discussions lead you down rabbit trails, and
keep irrelevant conversations to a minimum. It's also good to publish status meeting notes at
the conclusion of the meeting, especially if any action items resulted from the meeting. This
will give you a document trail and serves as a reminder to the meeting participants of what
actions need to be resolved and who is responsible for each action item.
   It's important that project team members are honest with the project manager and that
the project manager is in turn honest about what they report. A few years ago, a depart-
ment in my agency took on a project of gargantuan proportions and unfortunately didn't
426         Chapter 10   n   Measuring and Controlling Project Performance



employ good project management techniques. One of the biggest problems with this project
was that the project manager did not listen to the highly skilled project team members. The
team members warned of problems and setbacks, but the project manager didn't want to
hear about it. The project manager took their reports to be of the "Chicken Little" ilk and
refused to believe the sky was falling. Unfortunately, the sky was falling! Because the project
manager didn't believe the reports, she refused to report the true status of the project to the
stakeholders and oversight committees. Millions of dollars were wasted on a project that
was doomed for failure while the project manager continued to report that the project was
on time and activities were completed when in fact they were not.
   There are hundreds of project stories like this, and I'll bet you've got one or two from
your experiences as well. Don't let your project become the next bad example. Above all,
be honest in your reporting. No one likes bad news, but bad news delivered too late along
with millions of dollars wasted is a guaranteed career showstopper.

Reporting Systems
Reporting systems are used to record, store, and distribute information about the project,
including cost, schedule progress, and performance information. According to the PMBOK(R)
Guide, spreadsheet analysis, presentations, table reporting, and graphic capabilities are
types of distribution formats.


Report Performance Outputs
The Report Performance process has several outputs:
NN    Performance reports
NN    Organizational process assets updates
NN    Change requests
   Performance reports are the primary output of this process. It's here that performance
information is documented and reported to the stakeholders as outlined in the communication
management plan. These reports might take many forms, including S curves (cost baselines are
recorded this way), bar charts, tables, and histograms. Earned value information and variance
analysis is often reported during this process as well. We'll examine the earned value topic in
the next chapter during the discussion of the Cost Control process.
   Performance reports may range from simply stated status reports to highly detailed
reports. Dashboards are an example of a simple report that may use indicators like red-
yellow-green to show the status of each area of the project at a glance. Red means the item
being reported is in trouble or behind schedule, yellow means it's in danger and corrective
action should be taken, and green means all is well.
   More detailed reports may include the following elements according to the
PMBOK(R) Guide:
NN    Analysis of project performance for previous periods
NN    Risk and issue status
NN    Work completed in the current reporting period
                                    Managing Perform Integrated Change Control                   427



NN   Work expected to be completed during the next reporting period
NN   Changes approved in the current reporting period (or a summary if there are numer-
     ous changes)
NN   Results of variance analysis
NN   Time completion forecasts and cost forecasts
NN   Other information stakeholders want or need to know
   The updates needed to the organizational process assets output won't be a surprise.
They include lessons learned documentation, report formats, causes of issues, and correc-
tive actions taken. The change requests process includes recommended corrective actions to
bring performance in alignment with the project management plan and preventive actions
to reduce probable future negative performance.



Managing Perform Integrated
Change Control
The Perform Integrated Change Control process serves as an overseer, so to speak, of the
Monitoring and Controlling processes. This is where you establish the project's change con-
trol process. Changes, which encompass corrective actions, preventive actions, and defect
repair, are common outputs across all the Monitoring and Controlling processes. (And
don't forget that change requests are also an output of the Direct and Manage Project Plan
Execution process, which is an Executing process.) Both processes can generate the change
requests that are managed through the Perform Integrated Change Control process.
   You're likely to see exam questions on several topics that involve change and the Perform
Integrated Change Control process. Configuration management, for example, isn't listed
as a tool and technique of this process, but you really can't perform the Perform Integrated
Change Control process without it. I'll discuss this shortly. First, though, you'll look at
change, what it is, and how it comes about.
   Changes come about on projects for many reasons. It's the project manager's responsibil-
ity to manage these changes and see to it that organizational policies regarding changes are
implemented. Changes don't necessarily mean negative consequences. Changes can produce
positive results as well. It's important that you manage this process carefully, because too
many changes--even one significant change--will impact cost, schedule, scope, and/or
quality. Once a change request has been submitted, you have some decisions to make. Ask
yourself questions such as these:
NN   Should the change be implemented?
NN   If so, what's the cost to the project in terms of project constraints: cost, time, scope,
     and quality?
NN   Will the benefits gained by making the change increase or decrease the chances of
     project completion?
428         Chapter 10   n   Measuring and Controlling Project Performance



   Just because a change is requested doesn't mean you have to implement it. You'll always
want to discover the reasons for the change to determine whether they're justifiable, and you'll
want to know the cost of the change. Remember that cost can take the form of increased time.
Let's say the change you're considering will result in a later schedule completion date. That
means you'll need human resources longer than expected. If you've leased equipment or project
resources for the team members to use during the course of the project, a later completion date
means your team needs the leased equipment for a longer period of time. All this translates to
increased costs. Time equals money, as the saying goes, so manage time changes wisely, and
dig deep to find the impacts that time changes might make on the budget.


How Change Occurs
As the project progresses, the stakeholders or customers might request a change directly.
Team members might also recommend changes as the project progresses. For example,
once the project is underway, they might discover more efficient ways of performing tasks
or producing the product of the project and recommend changes to accommodate the new
efficiencies. Changes might also come about as a result of mistakes that were made earlier
in the project in the Planning or Executing processes. (However, I hope you've applied all
the great practices and techniques I've talked about to date and you didn't experience many
of these.)
    Changes to the project might occur indirectly as a result of contingency plans, other
changes, or team members performing favors for the stakeholders by making that one
little change without telling anyone about it. Many times, the project manager is the last
to know about changes such as these. There's a fine line here because you don't want to
discourage good working relationships between team members and stakeholders, yet at the
same time, you want to ensure that all changes come through the change control process.
If a dozen little changes slip through like this, your project scope suddenly exits stage left.


Change Control Concerns
Perform Integrated Change Control, according to the PMBOK(R) Guide, is primarily con-
cerned with the following:
NN    Influencing the factors that cause change control processes to be circumvented
NN    Promptly reviewing and analyzing change requests
NN    Managing approved changes
NN    Maintaining the integrity of the project baselines (including scope, quality, schedule,
      cost, and performance measurement baseline) and incorporating approved changes into
      the project management plan and other project documents
NN    Promptly reviewing and analyzing corrective and preventive actions
NN    Coordinating and managing changes across the project
NN    Documenting requested changes and their impacts
                                  Managing Perform Integrated Change Control                 429




   Factors that might cause change include project constraints, stakeholder requests, team
member recommendations, vendor issues, and many others. You'll want to understand the
factors that are influencing or bringing about change and how a proposed change might
impact the project if implemented. Performance measures and corrective actions might dictate
that a project change is needed as well.


                  Modifications to the project are submitted in the form of change requests
                  and managed through the change control process. Obviously, you'll want
                  to implement those changes that are most beneficial to the project. I'll talk
                  more about change requests later in this chapter.

   Managing changes might involve making changes to the project scope, schedule, or
cost baseline, also known as the performance measurement baseline. This baseline might
also involve quality or technical elements. The performance measurement baseline is the
approved project management plan that describes the work of the project. This is used
through Executing and Monitoring and Controlling to measure project performance and
determine deviations from the plan. It's your responsibility to maintain the reliability of the
performance measurement baselines. Changes that impact an existing or completed project
management process will require updates to those processes, which might mean additional
passes through the appropriate Planning and Executing processes.
   The management plans created during the Planning process group should reflect the
changes as well, which might require updates to the project management plan or the project
scope statement. This requires a close eye on coordination among all the processes that are
impacted. For example, changes might require updates to risk response alternatives, schedule,
cost, resource requirements, or other elements. Changes that impact product scope always
require an update to the project scope.



Exam Spotlight

Managing changes involves maintaining accurate and reliable performance measure-
ment baselines; coordinating all processes impacted as a result of the change, including
revisiting Planning and Executing processes where needed; and updating project scope
to reflect any changes in product scope.



   I caution you to not change baselines at the drop of a hat. Examine the changes, their
justification, and their impacts thoroughly before making changes to the baselines. Make
certain your project sponsor approves baseline changes and that the project sponsor under-
stands why the change occurred and how it will impact the project. And be sure to keep a
copy of the original baseline for comparison purposes and for lessons learned.
430        Chapter 10   n   Measuring and Controlling Project Performance




Configuration Management
Configuration management is generally a subsystem of the project management informa-
tion system. It involves managing approved changes and project baselines. I'll talk about
each of these topics later in this chapter.
   The following items are what the PMBOK(R) Guide notes as activities associated with
configuration change management in the Perform Integrated Change Control process:
Configuration identification Configuration identification describes the characteristics of
the product, service, or result of the project. This description is the basis that's used to ver-
ify when changes are made and how they're managed. Configuration identification is also
used to label products or documents, manage changes, and verify changes.
Configuration status accounting This activity doesn't really have to do with financials
as you might guess from its title. It's about accounting for the status of the changes by
documenting and storing the configuration information needed to effectively manage the
product information. This includes the approved configuration identification, the status of
proposed changes, and the status of changes currently being implemented.
Configuration verification and auditing Verification and audits are performed to determine
whether the configuration item is accurate and correct and to make certain the performance
requirements have been met. It assures that changes are registered in the configuration man-
agement system and that they are assessed, approved, tracked, and implemented correctly.



Exam Spotlight

Understand for the exam that configuration management involves identifying the
physical characteristics of the product, service, or result of the project (or its individual
components); controlling changes to those characteristics; and documenting changes
to verify that requirements are met. It also includes the change management system
and documents the process for requesting, tracking, and determining whether change
requests should be approved or denied.




Change Control System
If you were to allow changes to occur to the project whenever requested, you would prob-
ably never complete the project. Stakeholders, the customer, and end users would continu-
ally change the project requirements if given the opportunity to do so. That's why careful
planning and scope definition are important in the beginning of the project. It's your job as
project manager to drive out all the compelling needs and requirements of the project during
the Planning process so that important requirements aren't suddenly "remembered" half-
way through the project. However, we're all human, and sometimes things are not known,
                                 Managing Perform Integrated Change Control                431




weren't thought about, or simply weren't discovered until a certain point during the project.
Stakeholders will probably start thinking in a direction they weren't considering during the
Planning process, and new requirements will come to light. This is where the change control
system comes into play.

The Purpose of the Change Control System
Change control systems are documented procedures that describe how the deliverables of
the project and associated project documentation are controlled, changed, and approved.
It also often describes how to submit change requests and how to manage change requests.
They may include preprinted change request forms that provide a place to record general
project information such as the name and project number, the date, and the details regard-
ing the change request. Change control systems are usually subsystems of the configuration
management system.
    The change control system also tracks the status of change requests, including their
approval status. Not all change requests will receive approval. Those changes that are not
approved are also tracked and filed in the change control log for future reference.
    The change control system might define the level of authority needed to approve changes,
if it wasn't previously defined in the configuration management system. Some change requests
could receive approval based on the project manager's decision; others might need a review
and formal approval by the project sponsor, executive management, and so on.


                 The change control system is a subset of the configuration management
                 system.

   Procedures should be defined that detail how emergency changes are approved as well. For
example, you and your team might be putting in some weekend hours and are close to the
completion of a deliverable when you discover that thing 1 will not talk to thing 2 no matter
what you do. The team brainstorms and comes up with a brilliant solution that requires a
change request. Do you stop work right then and wait until the change control board or com-
mittee can meet sometime next week and make a decision, or do you--the project manager--
make the decision to go forward with this solution and explain the change to the appropriate
parties later? That answer depends on the change procedures you have in place to handle situ-
ations like this and on the authority you have to make emergency changes as outlined in the
change control system.
   Many organizations have formal change control or change request systems in place. If
that's the case, you can easily adopt those procedures and use the existing system to man-
age project change. But if no procedures exist, you'll have to define them.



Exam Spotlight

The change control system and configuration management system together identify,
document, and control the changes to the performance baseline.
432         Chapter 10   n   Measuring and Controlling Project Performance



  The PMBOK(R) Guide states three objectives you should know about for implementing
and using configuration management systems and change control processes:
NN    Establish a method to consistently identify changes, request changes to project base-
      lines, and analyze and determine the value and effectiveness of the changes.
NN    Continuously authenticate and improve project performance by evaluating the impact
      of each change.
NN    Communicate all change requests--whether approved, rejected, or delayed--to all the
      stakeholders.




But I Thought You Said

Marcus is working on a web redesign project for a division of the marketing department
in his organization. The project started out as a simple redesign of the look and feel of the
site. Marcus made the mistake of not defining change control procedures for the project
from the beginning because he reasoned that the project was small, the design changes
were well understood by all, and the project could be finished in a matter of weeks.

After the work of the project started, Marcus's team showed the initial design results to
the business lead, Kendra. Kendra asked for a few modifications that seemed minor, and
Marcus was happy to accommodate. When his team finished the work and turned the site
over for initial testing, Kendra created a list of changes that extended beyond the initial
scope of the project. Marcus thought everyone had agreed that the project involved only
an update to the look and feel of the site, but Kendra was now requesting changes to the
applications people used to order products from the website. Marcus knew that applica-
tion changes need their own set of requirements and testing. Changing the look of the
site is a lot different from changing the way an application works and the results it pro-
duces. Kendra and Marcus were in disagreement over what the changes entailed. Kendra
thought she had carte blanche to make changes until she was satisfied with the project.
Marcus knew that the projects waiting in the queue were going to suffer because of the
never-ending stream of changes to Kendra's project. The additional time her project was
taking already had pushed the deliverable of the next project on their list by two weeks.

To resolve the dilemma, Marcus had to negotiate with Kendra on the list of changes she
had requested. He agreed to all changes that required less than four hours to complete,
and the remaining changes were moved to a new project request. Marcus also vowed to
implement change control procedures for all projects from this point forward, no matter
what the size or complexity of the project.

Requirements for Change
You should require two things at the beginning of all projects regarding change. First,
require that all change requests be submitted in writing. This is to clarify the change and
make sure there's no confusion about what's requested. It also allows the project team to
accurately estimate the time it will take to incorporate the change.
   Second, all change requests must come through the formal change control system. Make
sure no one is allowed to go directly to team members and request changes without the
project manager knowing about them. Also make certain your stakeholders understand
that this can cause schedule delays, cost overruns, and sacrifices to quality and that it isn't
good change management practice. Encourage them from the beginning of the project to
use the formal procedures laid out in the change control system to request changes.


                  It's good practice to require all change requests in writing. This should be
                  a documented procedure outlined in your change control system. Beware!
                  Stakeholders are notorious for asking for changes verbally even when
                  there is a detailed process in place. If they don't want to follow the process,
                  someone on the project team should have the responsibility for document-
                  ing and logging the change requests for future reference.



Change Control Board
In some organizations, a change control board (CCB) is established to review all change
requests. The board is given the authority to approve or deny change requests as defined by
the organization. It's important that its authority is clearly defined and that separate pro-
cedures exist for emergency changes. The CCB might meet only once a week, once every
other week, or even once a month, depending on the project. When emergencies arise, the
preestablished procedures allow the project manager to implement the change on the spot.
This always requires follow-up with the CCB and completion of a formal change request,
even though it's after the fact.
   CCB members might include stakeholders, managers, project team members, and others
who might not have any connection to the project at hand. Some organizations have per-
manent CCBs that are staffed by full-time employees dedicated to managing change for the
entire organization, not just project change. You might want to consider establishing a CCB
for your project if the organization does not have one.



Exam Spotlight

For purposes of the exam, note that the PMBOK(R) Guide states that the CCB is made up of
a group of stakeholders who review and then approve, delay, or reject change requests.
434          Chapter 10   n   Measuring and Controlling Project Performance



   Some organizations use other types of review boards that have the same responsibilities as
the CCB. Some other names you might see are technical assessment board (TAB), technical
review board (TRB), engineering review board (ERB), and configuration control board (CCB).


Perform Integrated Change Control Inputs,
Tools and Techniques, and Outputs
The inputs for the Perform Integrated Change Control process are as follows:
NN     Project management plan
NN     Work performance information
NN     Change requests
NN     Enterprise environmental factors
NN     Organizational process assets
   Remember that the project management plan includes all the documents together that
make up that plan--the project schedule, budget, scope statement, and so on.
   You've seen all the tools and techniques for Perform Integrated Change Control in
previous processes:
NN     Expert judgment
NN     Change control meetings
      The outputs of the Perform Integrated Change Control process are as follows:
NN     Change request status updates
NN     Project management plan updates
NN     Project document updates
    Project management plan updates are typically required as a result of an approved
change or corrective action, especially those changes that impact a project baseline. It may
sound obvious, but I'll tell you anyway: changes made to baselines should reflect changes
from the current point in time forward. You cannot change past performance. These
changes are noted in the change control system or the configuration management system,
and stakeholders are informed at the status meetings of the changes that have occurred,
their impacts, and where the description of the changes can be found.
    You should document all the actions taken in the Perform Integrated Change Control
process (whether implemented or not) as part of the project document updates output. You
should also record the reason for the change request. In other words, how did this particu-
lar change request come about? How did it change the original project management plan?
Is this something you could or should have known about in the Planning processes? You
should note the corrective action taken and the justification for choosing that particular
corrective action as part of lessons learned also. You can use the information you cap-
ture here in your configuration management system as lessons learned for future projects.
When you take on a new project, it's a good idea to review the lessons learned from similar

projects so that you can plan appropriately and avoid, where possible, the variances that
occurred in those projects.
   In the next chapter, you'll explore the individual change control processes (like Control
Cost and Control Schedule) and the measurement tools you'll use to provide the variance
measurements that are gathered and reported to the stakeholder via the Report Perfor-
mance process that we discussed earlier in this chapter.




Project Case Study: New Kitchen Heaven Retail Store

Your regularly scheduled status meeting is in progress. Let's see how it's progressing.

Your next agenda item is an update on change requests. Ricardo submitted a change
request regarding the hardware installation at the new store site. A new, much anticipated
operating system was just released, and Ricardo has plans to upgrade the entire company
to the new operating system. Since he must purchase new equipment for this store any-
way, he contends that it makes sense to go ahead and purchase the hardware with the new-
est operating system already loaded. His staff won't have to upgrade this store as part of
the upgrade project because the store will already have the new operating system.

Ricardo's change request was submitted in writing through the change control system.
A CCB was set up during the Planning stages of this project to handle change requests. At
the CCB meeting, the following questions come up regarding Ricardo's request: Has the
new operating system been tested with the existing system? Are there compatibility prob-
lems? If so, what risks are associated with getting the problems resolved and the equipment
installed by opening day? Is the vendor ready to ship with the new operating system?

The CCB defers their decision for this request until Ricardo gives them answers to these
questions.

During the next CCB meeting, the board reviews a change request from Jill. The gourmet
food supplier she used went out of business and Jill contracted with a new vendor. She
received a sample shipment from the new vendor and was very unhappy with the results.
Upon inspecting the products, she found broken containers and damaged packaging.
Meanwhile, Jill found another vendor, who has sent her a sample shipment. She is very
pleased with the new vendor's products and service. However, this vendor's prices are
even higher than the first replacement vendor she contracted with. Jill submitted a cost
change request to the CCB because of the increased cost of the gourmet food product
shipment. The change in cost does not have a significant impact on the budget.

Jake reported that payments have been made to the vendor supplying the store's display
cases and shelving and also gave an update on the vendor supplying the lighting for the
store. Both vendors met or exceeded performance requirements and he's happy with
their service.
436           Chapter 10   n   Measuring and Controlling Project Performance




You hold a seat on the CCB and are aware of the change requests and their impacts to the
project. Ricardo satisfactorily answered all the questions the CCB had, so his request and
Jill's request were both approved during the meeting.

"Now I'd like to give a brief update on the project forecast," you tell the group. "Based
on the preliminary data I've gathered, we are somewhat behind schedule but budget
appears to be on track. I will have some forecast numbers for you at the next meeting."

Understanding How This Applies
to Your Next Project
I've learned from experience the value of having a change control process in place for all
projects. I've never managed a project that didn't encounter change. And there are hundreds
of reasons that bring about change. One of the ways to help reduce the amount of change
you might experience is to make certain you've documented the requirements of the project
                                                                        Summary             437




accurately and have obtained sign-off from the stakeholders. Be aware--just because the
stakeholders have agreed to the requirements doesn't mean they won't want change. As
you elaborate the deliverables and requirements, the product or end result becomes clearer,
and that means some elements not previously known or at least not known in their entirety
early in the planning process will require change.
   If you don't already have a change control process in place, I recommend setting one up
before you begin your next project. Document the procedures for requesting, tracking, and
approving or denying changes. Make them one of the agenda items for discussion at your
project kickoff meeting. It's easier to enforce change procedures (and deny changes that are
out of scope) if the process is discussed with the stakeholders early in the project. You will
likely want to include important stakeholders on the change control board, and that gives
you another great opportunity to discuss and reinforce the process.
   Administering contracts and procurements, as I mentioned earlier, may be managed by
someone in your procurement department. In my experience, there is always someone from
this department involved from the request process through contract administration. How-
ever, it will likely be up to you to monitor vendor performance, make sure deliverable dates
are met, and verify timecards against the submitted invoice.



Summary
This chapter examined several change control processes starting with the Monitor and
Control Project Work process. This process is responsible for reviewing, tracking, and con-
trolling project progress. It ensures that the performance objectives outlined in the project
management plan are met.
   The Administer Procurements process is concerned with managing vendor relationships,
monitoring performance, and implementing changes or corrections when necessary. Both
buyer and seller are responsible for administering the contract (or other procurement vehicle)
to assure that contractual obligations are being met.
   Perform Integrated Change Control is an important part of the project process. It's your
responsibility as project manager to manage change and implement corrective action where
needed to keep the project on track with the plan. Perform Integrated Change Control con-
cerns influencing the things that cause change and managing the change once it has occurred.
One or more of the project baselines may be affected when change occurs. Managing change
might involve changes to the project plan, the project schedule, the project budget, project
scope, and so on. Changes that impact processes you've already completed require updates
to those processes. Corrective action is often a result of a change and ensures that the future
performance of the project lines up with the project management plan.
   Configuration management systems typically include change control systems that
document the procedures to manage change and how change requests are implemented.
Change requests might come in written or verbal forms, but ideally you should ask for all
your change requests in writing. Change requests are processed through a formal change
control system, and configuration control boards have the authority to approve or deny
change requests.

Exam Essentials
Name the outputs of the Monitor and Control Project Work process. The outputs are
change requests (which includes corrective action, preventive action, and defect repair),
project management plan updates, and project document updates.
Name the processes that integrate with the Administer Procurement process. Direct
and Manage Project Execution, Report Performance, Perform Quality Control, Perform
Integrated Change Control, and Monitor and Control Risk.
Describe the purpose of the Report Performance process. Report Performance concerns
collecting and distributing performance information about the project, including status
reports, progress to date, and forecasts.
Name the purpose of the Perform Integrated Change Control process. Perform Integrated
Change Control is performed throughout the life of the project and involves reviewing all
the project change requests, establishing a configuration management and change control
process, and approving or denying changes.
Be able to define the purpose of a configuration management system. Configuration
management systems are documented procedures that describe the process for submitting
change requests, the processes for tracking changes and their disposition, and the processes
for defining the approval levels for approving and denying changes. The configuration man-
agement system also includes a process for authorizing the changes. Change control systems
are generally a subset of the configuration management system. Configuration management
also describes the characteristics of the product of the project and ensures accuracy and
completeness of the description.
Be able to describe a CCB. The change control board (CCB) has the authority to approve
or deny change requests. Their authority is defined and outlined by the organization. A CCB
is made up of stakeholders.

Review Questions
1.    You are a project manager for an international marketing firm. You are ready to assign
      resources to your new project using a work authorization system. Which of the following
      statements is not true?
      A. Work authorization systems clarify and initiate the work for each work package.
      B.   Work authorization systems are written procedures defined by the organization.
      C.   Work authorization systems are used throughout the project Execution processes.
      D.   Work authorization systems are a tool and technique of the Monitor and Control
           Project Work process.

2.    You are working on a project and discover that one of the business users responsible for
      testing the product never completed this activity. She has written an email requesting that
      one of your team members drop everything to assist her with a problem that could have
      been avoided if she would have performed the test. This employee reports to a stakeholder,
      not to the project team. You estimate that the project might not be completed on time as a
      result of this missed activity. All of the following are true except for which one?
      A. You should recommend a corrective action to bring the expected future project per-
         formance back into line with the project management plan because of this employee's
         failure to perform this activity.
      B.   You should recommend a preventive action to reduce the possibility of future project
           performance veering off track because of this employee's failure to perform this activity.
      C.   You should recommend a change request, which is an output of the Monitor and
           Control Project Work process, to get the project performance back in alignment with
           the project management plan.
      D.   You might have to request a change to the project schedule as a result of this missed
           activity.

5.   You are a project manager for an engineering company. Your company won the bid to add
     ramp-metering lights to several on-ramps along a stretch of highway at the south end of the
     city. You subcontracted a portion of the project to another company. The subcontractor's work

Answers to Review Questions
1.   D. Work authorization systems are a tool used during Project Execution processes and are
     a subset of the project management information system considered part of the enterprise
     environmental factors input of the Monitor and Control Project Work process. They for-
     mally initiate the work of each work package and clarify the assignments.

2.   B. You are in the Monitor and Control Project Work process and should recommend a
     change request that can take the form of a corrective action. Preventive actions reduce the
     possibility of negative impacts from risk events and do not apply to this situation.

3.   D. Negotiation is the preferred method of settling claims or disputes in the Administer
     Procurements process.

4.   D. The tools and techniques of the Administer Procurements process are contract change
     control system, procurement performance reviews, inspection and audits, performance
     reporting, payment systems, claims administration, and records management system.

5.   C. The contract change control system describes the processes you'll use to make changes
     to the contract; it is not a means of communication. The changes might include contract
     term changes, date changes, and termination of a contract.

6.   B . According to the PMBOK(R) Guide, the Contract Administration process is closely coordi-
     nated with the Direct and Manage Project Execution, Report Performance, Perform Quality
     Control, Perform Integrated Change Control, and Monitoring and Control risk processes.

7.   A. According to the PMBOK(R) Guide, status meetings are a form of push communication.

8.   A. This question describes the Report Performance process, which is concerned with col-
     lecting and reporting information regarding project progress and project accomplishments
     to the stakeholders.

9.   A. The tools and techniques of the Report Performance process are variance analysis, fore-
     casting methods, communication methods, and reporting systems.

10. B. The Delphi method, technology forecasting, scenario building, and forecast by analogy
    are all in the judgmental methods category of forecasting.

11. B. Status meetings are to report on the progress of the project. They are not for demos or
    show-and-tell. Option D could be correct but there isn't enough information in the question
    to know that a change request was submitted.

12. B. Forecasting is a tool and technique of the Report Performance process.

13. B. Change requests are submitted through other process like the Monitor and Control
    Project Work process and are reviewed, tracked, managed, analyzed, and documented in
    this process.
446        Chapter 10   n   Measuring and Controlling Project Performance



14. D. Change control systems are documented procedures that describe how to submit change
    requests. They track the status of the change requests, document the management impacts
    of change, track the change approval status, and define the level of authority needed to
    approve changes. Change control systems do not approve or deny the changes--that's the
    responsibility of the change control board (CCB).

15. C. The key to this question was that the characteristics of the product were documented
    with this tool. Configuration management documents the physical characteristics and the
    functionality of the product of the project.

16. C. Change control boards (CCBs) review change requests and have the authority to
    approve or deny them. Their authority is defined by the configuration control and change
    control process.

17. A. The three activities associated with configuration management are configuration identi-
    fication, configuration status accounting, and configuration verification and auditing.

18. D. Configuration management systems are a way to manage approved changes and baselines.

19. C. These are elements the Monitor and Control Project Work process is concerned with.

20. C. The TAB stands for technical assessment board, TRB is a technical review board, and
    ERB is an engineering review board.

                               You've almost made it to the homestretch. This chapter covers
                               the last group of project processes in the Monitoring and Con-
                               trolling group. There's a significant amount of information
packed into this chapter, and I recommend you memorize all the formulas presented here
for the exam.
   I'll cover the Monitor and Control Risks, Control Costs, Control Schedule, Perform
Quality Control, Verify Scope, and Control Scope processes in this chapter.
   Monitor and Control Risks monitors the project for risks and monitors the risk response
plans that have been put into action or might need to be put into action. The Control Cost
and Control Schedule processes are similar to Perform Integrated Change Control, which we
discussed in the last chapter. Remember when you're reading these sections that the informa-
tion from the Perform Integrated Change Control process applies to these areas as well.
   The Perform Quality Control process involves several new tools and techniques that
might show up on the exam. Take some time here to understand the tools and techniques
in the Perform Quality Control process and to differentiate them from the tools and tech-
niques associated with the Plan Quality and Perform Quality Assurance processes.
   Verify Scope involves verifying and accepting work results. Control Scope is like the
change control processes I discussed in Chapter 10 and is concerned with controlling changes
to project scope.



Monitoring and Controlling Risk
The Monitor and Control Risks process involves implementing response plans, tracking and
monitoring identified risks, and identifying and responding to new risks as they occur. You
will examine performance information, and use the tools and techniques of this process, to
analyze and implement other functions of this process, including the following:
NN   Evaluating risk response plans that are put into action as a result of risk events
NN   Monitoring the project for risk triggers
NN   Reexamining existing risks to determine if they have changed or should be closed out
NN   Monitoring residual risks
NN   Reassessing project assumptions and determining validity
NN   Ensuring that policies and procedures are followed
NN   Ensuring that risk response plans and contingency plans are put into action appropriately
     and are effective
                                                 Monitoring and Controlling Risk            449



NN   Ensuring that contingency reserves (for schedule and cost) are updated according to the
     updated risk assessment
NN   Evaluating the overall effectiveness of the Risk processes
   Monitor and Control Risks is a busy process. During the course of the project, risk
responses, which were developed during the Planning process group, have been imple-
mented and have reduced or averted the impact of risk events (or you hope they did).


Monitor and Control Risks Inputs
This process has four inputs:
NN   Risk register
NN   Project management plan
NN   Work performance information
NN   Performance reports
   You'll recall that the risk register tracks and ranks individual risks, identifies the risk
owner, describes risk triggers and residual risks, and lists the response plans and strategies
you should implement in the event of an actual risk event. Keep in mind that some risk events
identified in risk planning will happen and some will not. You will have to stay alert for risk
event occurrences and be prepared to respond to them when they do occur. This means you
should monitor the risk register regularly.
   Work performance information includes information that may help you identify that a
new risk event is about to occur, or it may assist you in monitoring previously identified
risks. Work performance information includes elements such as the status of deliverables,
costs to date, cost changes, schedule progress to date, schedule changes, and/or scope
changes.
   Performance reports include information such as status reports, performance measure-
ments, and forecasts. These should also be examined from the perspective of risks or risk
response plans that might need close monitoring or changes to the response plans to coincide
with the performance reports data.
   Additional risk response planning might be needed to deal with the new risks or with
expected risks whose impact might be greater than expected. This might require repeating
the Plan Risk Responses process to create new contingency plans or alternative plans to
deal with the risk, or it might require modification to existing plans.


Monitor and Control Risks Tools and Techniques
The tools and techniques of Monitor and Control Risks are used to monitor risks through-
out the life of the project. You should perform periodic reviews, audits, and new earned
value analyses to check the pulse of risk activity and to make certain risk management is
enacted effectively.
450           Chapter 11   n   Controlling Work Results



      The tools and techniques of this process are as follows:
NN     Risk reassessment
NN     Risk audits
NN     Variance and trend analysis
NN     Technical performance measurement
NN     Reserve analysis
NN     Status meetings
   You'll look at risk reassessment, risk audits, and technical performance measurements
next. You've examined all the other tools and techniques of this process in discussions of
previous processes.

Risk Reassessment
Periodic, scheduled reviews of identified risks, risk responses, and risk priorities should
occur during the project. The idea here is to monitor risks and their status and determine
whether their consequences still have the same impact on the project objectives as when
they were originally planned. Every status meeting should have a time set aside to discuss
and review risks and response plans.
   Risk identification and monitoring is an ongoing process throughout the life of the proj-
ect. Risks can change, and previously identified risks might have greater impacts than origi-
nally thought as more facts are discovered. Reassessment of risks should be a regular activity
performed by everyone involved on the project. Monitor the risk register, including those
risks that have low scores, and risk triggers. You should also monitor the risk responses that
have been implemented for their effectiveness in dealing with risk. You might have to revisit
the Perform Qualitative and Perform Quantitative Risk Analysis processes when new risk
consequences are discovered or risk impacts are found to be greater than what was origi-
nally planned.

Risk Audits
Risk audits are carried out during the entire life of the project by risk auditors. Risk auditors
are not typically project team members and are expertly trained in audit techniques and risk
assessment. Risk audits are specifically interested in examining the implementation of response
plans and their effectiveness at dealing with risks and their root causes.

Technical Performance Measurements
This tool and technique compares the technical accomplishments of project milestones
completed during the Executing processes to the technical milestones defined in the project
Planning processes. Variances might indicate that a project risk is looming, and you'll want
to analyze and prepare a response to it if appropriate. For example, a technical milestone
for a new computer software project might require that the forms printed from a particular
module include a bar code at the bottom of the page. If the bar code functionality does
not work once the module is coded, a technical deviation exists, which means you should
reexamine project risks. In this particular example, project scope is likely at risk.

Monitor and Control Risks Outputs
Monitor and Control Risks should occur throughout the life of the project. Identified risks
are monitored and plans are reexamined to determine whether they will adequately resolve
the risk as it approaches during this process. Several outputs might come about as a result
of monitoring risks:
NN   Risk register updates
NN   Organizational process assets updates
NN   Change requests (recommended corrective and preventive actions)
NN   Project management plan updates
NN   Project document updates
   I've discussed these outputs before, so I'll just bring to your attention the new points you
need to know here about risk register updates and change requests.

Risk Register Updates
The risk register should be updated under two conditions. The first condition is when a risk
audit or risk reassessment concludes that some element of the original risk information has
changed--for example, the impact or probability scores are updated to reflect new conditions,
the priority of the risk has changed, or the response plan has been updated. The second condi-
tion for updating the risk register is when the risk needs to be closed. If a risk event occurs,
you'll record that in the risk register along with the effectiveness of the response plan. This
information becomes an input to the Close Project Process, which I'll cover in the next chapter.

Change Requests
Change requests must be processed through the Perform Integrated Change Control pro-
cess. You might find that a workaround is needed when implementing a requested change
or recommended corrective action. A workaround is an unplanned response to a negative
risk event. It attempts to deal with the risk in a productive, efficient manner. If no risk
response plan exists (this might be the case when you accept a risk event during the Plan-
ning process) or an unplanned risk occurs, workarounds are implemented to deal with the
consequences of the risk.



Managing Cost Changes
The Control Costs process monitors the project budget and manages changes to the cost base-
line. It's concerned with monitoring project costs to prevent unauthorized or incorrect costs
from being included in the cost baseline. This means you'll also use Control Costs to assure
that the project budget isn't exceeded (resulting in cost overruns). If a change is implemented,
you'll have to make certain the budget for the changed item stays within acceptable limits. All
budget changes should be agreed to and approved by the project sponsor where applicable (the
452         Chapter 11    n   Controlling Work Results



criteria for approvals should be outlined in the change control system documentation). Stake-
holders should also be made aware of budget changes.
    The following list includes some of the activities you'll be involved in during this process:
NN    Monitoring changes to costs or the cost baseline and understanding variances from
      the baseline
NN    Monitoring change requests that affect cost and resolving them in a timely manner
NN    Informing stakeholders of approved changes and their costs
NN    Assuring the project budget does not exceed acceptable limits by taking action when
      overruns are imminent


Control Costs Inputs
The Control Costs process includes the following inputs:
NN    Project management plan
NN    Project funding requirements
NN    Work performance information
NN    Organizational process assets
   These inputs are examined using the tools and techniques of this process to determine
whether revised cost estimates or budget updates are required. One thing you should note
regarding the project management plan input is that it includes the cost performance baseline
and the cost management plan. You'll use the cost performance baseline to compare actual
expenditures to date on the project to the baseline. The cost management plan details how
costs should be monitored and controlled throughout the life of the project. I've covered each
of these inputs in previous chapters.


Control Costs Tools and Techniques
The tools and techniques of the Control Costs process are as follows:
NN    Earned value measurement (EVM)
NN    Forecasting
NN    To-complete performance index (TCPI)
NN    Performance reviews
NN    Variance analysis
NN    Project management software
   We'll look at each of these next with the exception of project management software.
This output has been discussed previously, but you should know that in this process it can
help automate and calculate the formulas we're going to examine next. It can also display
the results in graphical form for status reporting purposes.
                                                       Managing Cost Changes                453




Earned Value Management
You can accomplish performance measurement analysis using a technique called earned
value measurement (EVM). Simply stated, EVM compares what you've received or pro-
duced to what you've spent.
   The EVM continuously monitors the planned value, earned value, and actual costs
expended to produce the work of the project (I'll cover the definition of these terms
shortly). When variances that result in cost changes are discovered (including schedule
variances and cost variances), those changes are managed using the project change control
system. The primary function of this analysis technique is to determine and document the
cause of the variance, to determine the impact of the variance, and to determine whether a
corrective action should be implemented as a result. We'll walk through various examples
of how to determine these variances later in this section.
   EVM looks at schedule, cost, and scope project measurements together and compares
them to the actual work completed to date. It is the most often used performance measure-
ment method. EVM is performed on the work packages and the control accounts of the
WBS. To perform the EVM calculations, you need to first gather the three measurements
mentioned earlier: the planned value (PV), actual cost (AC), and earned value (EV).


                 If you do any research on your own regarding these values, you might come
                 across acronyms that are different from what you see here. I've included
                 their alternate names and acronyms at the end of each description. They are
                 also noted in the glossary of the PMBOK(R) Guide. I recommend you memo-
                 rize planned value (PV), actual cost (AC), and earned value (EV) and make
                 certain you understand the meaning of each before progressing.

   Let's take a look at some definitions of these key measurements before diving into the
actual calculations:
Planned value The planned value (PV) is the cost of work that has been authorized and
budgeted for a schedule activity or WBS component during a given time period or phase.
These budgets are established during the Planning processes. PV is also called budgeted
cost of work scheduled (BCWS).



Exam Spotlight

Remember to read exam questions carefully. PV might mean present value (as I talked
about in Chapter 2) or planned value, as defined here.



Actual cost Actual cost (AC) is the cost of completing the work component in a given
time period. Actual costs might include direct and indirect costs but must correspond to
what was budgeted for the activity. If the budgeted amount did not include indirect costs,
454         Chapter 11   n   Controlling Work Results



do not include them here. Later you'll see how to compare this to PV to come up with vari-
ance calculation results. AC is also called actual cost of work performed (ACWP).
Earned value Earned value (EV) is the value of the work completed to date as it compares
to the budgeted amount (PV) assigned to the work component. EV is typically expressed as
a percentage of the work completed compared to the budget. For example, if our budgeted
amount is $1,000 and we have completed 30 percent of the work so far, our EV is $300.
Therefore, EV cannot exceed the PV budget for the activity. EV is also called budgeted cost
of work performed (BCWP).



Exam Spotlight

PV, AC, and EV are really easy to mix up. In their simplest forms, here's what each means:

NN    PV : The approved budget assigned to work to be completed during a given time period
NN    AC : Money that's actually been expended during a given time period for
      completed work
NN    EV : The value of the work completed to date compared to the budget



   According to the earlier definition, EV is the sum of the cumulative budgeted costs for
completed work for all activities that have been accomplished as of the measurement date.
For example, if your total budget is $1,000 and 50 percent of the work has been completed
as of the measurement date, your EV would equal $500. You can plot all the PV, AC, and
EV measurements graphically to show the variances between them. If there are no variances
in the measurements, all the lines on the graph remain the same, which means the project is
progressing as planned. Figure 11.1 shows an example that plots these three measurements.

                                                       Managing Cost Changes             455




   All of these measurements include a cost component. Costs are displayed in an S curve
because spending is minimal in the beginning of the project, picks up steam toward the
middle, and then tapers off at the end of the project. This means your earned value mea-
surements will also take on the S curve shape.
   Now you can calculate whether the project is progressing as planned or if variances exist
in the approved baseline by using a variety of formulas discussed in the following sections.
Use Figure 11.1 as your example for the formulas that follow. The Figure 11.1 totals are as
follows: PV = 400, EV = 375, AC = 325.

Cost Variance
Cost variance is one of the most popular variances that project managers use, and it tells
you whether your costs are higher than budgeted (with a resulting negative number) or lower
than budgeted (with a resulting positive number). It measures the actual performance to date
or during the period against what's been spent.
   The cost variance (CV) is calculated as follows:
    CV = EV - AC
Let's calculate the CV using the numbers from Figure 11.1:
    375 - 325 = 50
The CV is positive, which means you're spending less than what you planned for the work
that you have completed as of July 1 (which Figure 11.1 shows because AC is less than EV).
   If you come up with a negative number as the answer to this formula, it means that costs
are higher than what you had planned for the work that was completed as of July 1 and
these costs are often not recoverable.

Schedule Variance
Schedule variance, another popular variance, tells you whether the schedule is ahead or
behind what was planned for this period. This formula is most helpful when you've used
the critical path methodology to build the project schedule. The schedule variance (SV) is
calculated as follows:
    SV = EV - PV
Let's plug in the numbers:
    375 - 400 = -25
The resulting schedule variance is negative, which means you are behind schedule, or
behind where you planned to be as of July 1.
   Together, the CV and SV are known as efficiency indicators for the project and can be
used to compare performance of all the projects in a portfolio.

Performance Indexes
Cost and schedule performance indexes are primarily used to calculate performance effi-
ciencies, and they're often used to help predict future project performance.
   The cost performance index (CPI) measures the value of the work completed against
actual cost. It is the most critical of all the EVM measurements according to the PMBOK(R)
456         Chapter 11   n   Controlling Work Results



Guide because it tells you the cost efficiency for the work completed to date, or at the com-
pletion of the project. If CPI is greater than 1, your spending less than anticipated. If CPI is
less than 1, you are spending more than anticipated for the work completed.
   The schedule performance index (SPI) measures the progress to date against the progress
that was planned. This formula should be used in conjunction with an analysis of the critical
path activities to determine if the project will finish ahead or behind schedule. If SPI is greater
than 1, you are ahead of schedule. If SPI is less than 1, you are behind schedule.
   The cost performance index (CPI) is calculated this way:
      CPI = EV / AC
Let's plug in the numbers and see where you stand:
      375 / 325 = 1.15
This means cost performance is better than expected. You get an A+ on this assignment!
   Cumulative CPI is a commonly used calculation to predict project costs at the comple-
tion of the project. It also represents the cumulative CPI of the project at the point the
measurement is taken. First you need to sum the earned value calculations taken to date, or
cumulative EV, and the actual costs to date, or cumulative AC. The formula looks just like
the CPI formula only it uses the cumulative sums as follows:
      Cumulative CPI = cumulative EV / cumulative AC
   The difference between this and the CPI formula earlier is that the CPI formula is used
for a single work period whereas the cumulative CPI is calculated using the sum of all the
costs of every work component for the project. Additionally, you might also use cumulative
CPI to calculate the total cost of a work component such as a deliverable, for example. Let's
say you have a deliverable that has five work packages. You would total the EV and AC at
the measurement date for all five work packages to determine the cost performance index
for the deliverable.
   The schedule performance index (SPI) is calculated this way:
      SPI = EV / PV
Again, let's see where you stand with this example:
      375 / 400 = .94
Uh-oh, not so good. Schedule performance is not what you expected. Let's not grade this one.
   Cumulative SPI predicts schedule performance at the completion of the project. Like
cumulative CPI, it also represents the cumulative SPI of the project at the point the mea-
surement is taken. The formula is as follows:
      Cumulative SPI = cumulative EV / cumulative PV

Forecasting
Forecasting uses the information you've gathered to date and estimates the future con-
ditions or performance of the project based on what you know when the calculation is
performed. Forecasts are based on work performance information (an output from the
Executing process group) and your predictions of future performance.
                                                         Managing Cost Changes               457




   The forecasting formulas you'll see later in this section are called estimate at completion
(EAC). EAC estimates (or forecasts) the expected total cost of a work component, a schedule
activity, or the project at its completion. This is the probable final value for the work compo-
nent (or project). EAC is most often calculated by using actual costs incurred to date plus a
bottom-up ETC estimate. The formula for the most typical EAC looks like this:
    EAC = AC + bottom-up ETC
   The bottom-up estimate to complete (ETC) is an estimate provided by the members
of the project team actually working on the project activities. They provide the project
manager with an estimate of the amount of effort remaining (and therefore the cost of the
effort) based on the activities they have completed to date and what they believe will occur
in the future. Their estimates are summed to come up with a total ETC. We'll look at two
other ETC formulas at the end of this section.
         There are three EAC forecasting formulas outlined in the PMBOK(R) Guide that
we'll look at next. They reference a new parameter you haven't seen yet called budget at
completion (BAC). BAC is the sum of all the budgets established for all the work in the
work package, control account, schedule activity, or project. It's the total planned value
for the work component or project.
   The first EAC formula is called "EAC forecast for ETC work performed at the budgeted
rate." I know that's a mouthful. Here's what you should know. This formula calculates EAC
based on the actual costs to date and the assumption that ETC work will be completed at
the budgeted rate. The formula looks like this:
    EAC = AC + BAC - EV
Let's assume your AC to date is $800, BAC is $1,200, and EV is $600. EAC, assuming work
ETC will be completed at the budgeted rate, is as follows:
    $800 + $1,200 - $600 = $1,400
In English, you'll spend $1,400 to complete this work component, assuming the remaining
work is performed at the budgeted rate.
   The next EAC formula is called "EAC forecast for ETC work performed at the present
CPI." I didn't make up these titles! Here's what you need to know. This forecast assumes
that future performance will be just like the past performance for the project. The formula
looks like this:
    EAC = BAC / cumulative CPI
For this example, let's assume that BAC is $2,200 and cumulative CPI is 1.2. The formula
looks like this:
    $2,200 / 1.2 = $1833.33
This formula predicts you will spend less than the originally budgeted amount for the project.
   The last formula is called "EAC forecast for ETC work considering both SPI and CPI
factors." This formula assumes two things: there is a negative cost performance to date and
the project schedule dates must be met. The formula looks like this:
    EAC = AC + [(BAC - EV) / (cumulative CPI * cumulative SPI )]
458         Chapter 11   n   Controlling Work Results



Let's assume AC is $1,000, BAC is $1500, EV is $900, cumulative CPI is .97, and cumula-
tive SPI is 1.05. Here's the resulting EAC:
      $1,000 + [($1,500 - $900) / (.97 * 1.05)] = $1,598.10
Based on the assumption that cost performance to date is negative and we must meet the
project schedule date, EAC is $1,598.10.



Exam Spotlight

For study purposes, the EAC formula and the three EAC calculations are shown
together here:

      The EAC formula
          EAC = AC + bottom-up ETC
      EAC using actual costs to date and assuming ETC uses budgeted rate
          EAC = AC + BAC - EV
      EAC assuming future performance will behave like past performance
          EAC = BAC / cumulative CPI
      EAC when cost performance is negative and schedule dates must be met
          EAC = AC + [(BAC - EV) / (cumulative CPI * cumulative SPI )]



   In addition to the bottom-up ETC, there are two other formulas for calculating ETC
that you should be aware of for the exam. They are discussed next.
   When you believe that future cost variances will be similar to the types of variances
you've seen to date, you'll use this formula to calculate ETC:
      ETC = (BAC - cumulative EV) / cumulative CPI
Assuming your cumulative earned value (cumulative EV) is 725, cumulative CPI value is
1.12, and BAC is 1,000, plug in the numbers:
      (1,000 - 725) / 1.12 = 245.5
Therefore, at the measurement date, you need $245.50 to complete all the remaining work
of this work component (or project if you're using project totals), assuming variances in the
future will be the same as they have been to date.
   When you believe that future cost variances will not be similar to the types of variances
you've seen to date, you'll use this formula to calculate ETC:
      ETC = (BAC - cumulative EV)
Now calculate your value:
      (1,000 - 725) = 275
In this case, you need $275 to complete all the remaining work of this work component,
assuming variances in the future are different than they have been to date.
                                                         Managing Cost Changes             459




Exam Spotlight

For study purposes, the ETC formulas are shown here.

    Bottom-up ETC
        Summation of the costs of the remaining work based on estimates from the project
        team members working on these activities
    ETC when future cost variances will be similar to past variances
        ETC = (BAC - cumulative EV) / cumulative CPI
    ETC when future cost variances are expected to be atypical
        ETC = (BAC - cumulative EV)




To-Complete Performance Index
To-complete performance index (TCPI) is the projected performance level the remaining
work of the project must achieve in order to meet the BAC or EAC. It's calculated by dividing
the work that's remaining by the funds that are remaining.
   The formula for TCPI when using the BAC is as follows:
    (BAC - EV) / (BAC - AC)
Assume for this example that BAC is $1,000, EV is $700, and AC is $800.
    ($1,000 - $700) / ($1,000 - $800) = 1.5
This means you'll need to reach a CPI rate that's 1.5 times what you've experienced to date
in order to meet the BAC goal. If the result is less than one, future work does not have to be
performed as efficiently as past performance.
   When the BAC is no longer attainable, the project manager should calculate a new EAC
and this new estimate becomes the goal you'll work toward once it's approved by manage-
ment. The TCPI formula when EAC is the goal you're aiming for is as follows:
    (BAC - EV) / (EAC - AC)
We'll use the same assumptions as we did in the formula earlier and note that EAC is $1,200.
The formula looks like this:
    ($1,000 - $700) / ($1,200 - $800) = .75
    There is one last thing to note regarding this formula. If cumulative CPI falls below one,
all future project work must be performed at the TCPI

Performance Reviews
Performance reviews compare cost performance over time and the estimates of funds
needed to complete the remaining work. Three types of analyses are associated with perfor-
mance reviews: variance analysis, trend analysis, and earned value performance.
460         Chapter 11   n   Controlling Work Results



    According to the PMBOK(R) Guide, trend analysis determines whether project performance
is improving or worsening over time by periodically analyzing project results. These results
are measured with mathematical formulas that attempt to forecast project outcomes based on
historical information and results. You can use several formulas to predict project trends, but
it's outside the scope of this book to go into them. For the exam, you're expected to under-
stand the concept behind trend analysis, not the formulas used to calculate it. You'll want to
remember that you can use the results you've analyzed using trend analysis formulas to pre-
dict future project behavior or trends.
    I've already covered earned value performance and variance analysis is its own technique,
so we'll look at it next.

Variance Analysis
Variance analysis in the Control Costs process examines the difference between the perfor-
mance cost baseline and actual performance. One formula you can use with this technique
is called variance at completion (VAC). This calculates the difference between the budget
at completion and the estimate at completion. It looks like this:
      VAC = BAC - EAC
   If the result is a negative number, it means you're not doing as well with costs as you
anticipated and that variance exists. Assuming your project performance is improving, as
the project progresses, variances will become smaller.


                  You'll be given some scratch paper when you go into the exam. I recommend
                  that you write these formulas down on a piece of your scratch paper before
                  you start the exam and keep it handy. That way, the formulas are off your
                  mind and you've got them in front of you to reference when you get to the
                  portion of the exam where these questions appear. You might want to use
                  this tip for other items you've memorized as well. If you write them down
                  before you begin, you don't have to jog your memory on every question. If
                  you forget something, leave a blank space where it goes and as soon as you
                  remember it or see a question that reminds you what it is, fill in the blank.




Control Costs Outputs
The Control Costs process has six outputs:
NN    Work performance measurements
NN    Budget forecasts
NN    Organizational process assets updates
NN    Change requests
NN    Project management plan updates
NN    Project document updates
                                                           Managing Cost Changes              461




     I've discussed most of these before, or they are self-explanatory.



Recap of Formulas

You have a lot of formulas to memorize. Keep in mind that you'll be given a calculator when
you take the exam, so you don't have to do the math manually. Variance and trend analysis
are part of the project performance reviews tool and technique. Here are the formulas I've
covered in this chapter:

NN    Performance measurements

      Cost variance: CV = EV - AC
      Schedule variance: SV = EV - PV

NN    Performance indexes

      Cost performance index: CPI = EV / AC
      Cumulative cost performance index: Cumulative CPI = cumulative EV / cumulative AC
      Schedule performance index: SPI = EV / PV
      Cumulative schedule performance index: Cumulative SPI = cumulative
      EV / cumulative PV

NN    Forecasting

      EAC formula: EAC = AC + bottom-up ETC
      EAC using actual costs to date and assuming ETC uses budgeted rate: EAC = AC +
      BAC - EV
      EAC assuming future performance will behave like past performance: EAC = BAC /
      cumulative CPI
      EAC when cost performance is negative and schedule dates must be met: EAC = AC +
      [(BAC - EV) / (cumulative CPI * cumulative SPI )]
      Bottom-up ETC: Summation of the costs of the remaining work based on estimates
      from the project team members working on these activities
      ETC when future cost variances will be similar to past variances: ETC = (BAC -
      cumulative EV) / cumulative CPI
      ETC when future cost variances are expected to be atypical: ETC = (BAC -
      cumulative EV)

NN    Variance analysis

      Variance analysis: VAC = BAC - EAC
462        Chapter 11   n   Controlling Work Results




                  Problems with costs come about for many reasons, including incorrect
                  estimating techniques, predetermined or fixed budgets with no flexibility,
                  schedule overruns, inadequate WBS development, and so on. Good project
                  management planning techniques during the Planning processes might
                  prevent cost problems later in the project. At a minimum, proper planning
                  will reduce the impact of these problems if they do occur.

   Always inform appropriate stakeholders of revised budget or cost estimates and any
changes of significant impact to the project. Keep them updated on changes, status, and
risk conditions during regularly scheduled project meetings.




Mustang Enterprises's New Accounting System

You are a stakeholder of the New Accounting System project for Mustang Enterprises.
The existing accounting system resides on a mainframe, and some of the programs used
to process data are more than 15 years old. Your company decided to hire a contract soft-
ware services firm to write a thin-client, browser-based version of the accounting system
so that the mainframe programs could be retired. You've also assigned a senior program-
mer to act as the project manager on behalf of your organization.

The project is in the Monitoring and Controlling process group, and the project manager
keeps reporting that everything is OK and on schedule. When you asked him detailed
questions and requested performance data, the project manager patted you on the back
and said, "Don't worry, I've got everything under control."

You are a little worried because some of the key project team members have come to you
confidentially to inform you of the progress of the project.

After further investigation, you discover that the project manager changed the database
from SQL to Oracle midway through the project and didn't tell anyone except the project
team. The project scope stated specifically that project development required a SQL data-
base. The change in database products changed the project scope and product scope with-
out letting the stakeholders know.

This change has caused schedule delays because the project team members have told you
they need training in the new database development tools before they can proceed. Addi-
tionally, many of the programs have already been written to interface with SQL, not Oracle,
and will have to be modified. To add insult to injury, the database switch will impact the proj-
ect budget in two ways. First, purchasing the Oracle database involves substantially more
money than purchasing the SQL database, and it requires the purchase of new development
tools for the programming team. Second, several members of the programming staff will
have to attend multiple training sessions on the new database product to fully integrate the
programs and system. Training is currently running $2,200 per session per person.
                                 Monitoring and Controlling Schedule Changes                    463




Since you're a key stakeholder, you decide to bring this information out into the open at the
next project status meeting. Additionally, you plan to meet with the project sponsor and
the procurement department to determine what alternatives you have to request that the
contracting firm realign the project to meet the original contractual requirements. How-
ever, you fear that since the project manager is the one who gave the orders to change the
database, your organization might not have a lot of recourse. You will also make the project
sponsor aware that the project manager doesn't have the skills needed to conduct this proj-
ect and a new project manager should be hired as soon as possible. The project manager
is invaluable to the organization as a programmer, but he doesn't have the project manage-
ment experience needed to conduct a project of this size and complexity. This might cause
further setback to the project, but the project management plan and project schedule will
require updates anyway as a result of the existing project manager's decisions. You also
determine to document all that has happened as a lesson learned and to set up a change
control process to prevent this from happening in the future.




Monitoring and Controlling
Schedule Changes
The Control Schedule process involves determining the status of the project schedule,
determining whether changes have occurred or should occur, and influencing and manag-
ing schedule changes. In the following sections, you'll look at this process's inputs, tools
and techniques, and outputs.


Control Schedule Inputs
Control Schedule inputs include the following:
NN   Project management plan
NN   Project schedule
NN   Work performance information
NN   Organizational process assets
   I've covered each of these inputs previously. Keep in mind that the Control Schedule
process works hand in hand with the Perform Integrated Change Control process we
covered in Chapter 10 (as all the change control processes do).


                  Keeping the schedule on track means you're monitoring and controlling
                  time--one of the classic triple constraints.
464         Chapter 11    n   Controlling Work Results




Schedule and Control Tools and Techniques
The tools and techniques of the Control Schedule process are as follows:
NN    Performance reviews
NN    Variance analysis
NN    Project management software
NN    Resource leveling
NN    What-if scenario analysis
NN    Adjusting leads and lags
NN    Schedule compression
NN    Scheduling tool
    We've covered all of these tools and techniques previously. I'll give you a few new points
you should know regarding performance reviews.
    Performance reviews in this process examine elements such as actual start and end dates
for schedule activities and the remaining time to finish uncompleted activities. If you've
taken earned value measurements, the SV and SPI will be helpful in determining the impact
of the schedule variations and in determining if corrective actions are necessary.
    The PMBOK(R) Guide notes that if you're using the critical chain method to construct the
schedule, you should compare the amount of buffer needed to the amount of buffer remaining
to help determine if the schedule is on track. This will also indicate whether corrective actions
are necessary to adjust the schedule.
    In the Control Schedule process, because you're dealing with time issues, it's impera-
tive that you act as quickly as possible to implement corrective actions so that the schedule
is brought back in line with the plan and the least amount of schedule delay as possible is
experienced.


                  Schedule changes might be potential hot buttons with certain stakeholders
                  and can burn you if you don't handle them correctly. No one likes to hear
                  that the project is going to take longer than originally planned. That doesn't
                  mean you should withhold this information, however. Always report the
                  truth. If you've been keeping your stakeholders abreast of project status,
                  they should already know that the potential for schedule changes exists.
                  Nevertheless, be prepared to justify the reason for the schedule change or
                  start dusting off your resume--maybe both, depending on the company.

   Make sure to examine the float variance of the critical path activities when monitoring
the schedule. Thinking back to the Develop Schedule process, you'll recall that float is the
amount of time you can delay starting an activity without increasing the amount of time it
takes to complete the project. Because the activities with the least amount of float have the
potential to cause the biggest schedule delay, examine float variance in ascending order of
critical activities.
                                  Monitoring and Controlling Schedule Changes                 465




    Keep in mind that not all schedule variances will impact the schedule. For example, a
delay to a noncritical path task will not delay the overall schedule and might not need cor-
rective action. Use caution here, though--if a delay occurs on a noncritical path task or
its duration is increased for some reason, that task can actually become part of the critical
path. Delays to critical path tasks will always cause delays to the project completion date
and require corrective action. Careful watch of the variances in schedule start and end
dates helps you control the total time element of the project.


Control Schedule Outputs
The Control Schedule process has the following outputs:
NN   Work performance measurements
NN   Organizational process assets updates
NN   Change requests
NN   Project management plan updates
NN   Project document updates
   Project management plan updates include making updates to the schedule baseline and the
cost baseline. Changes to the cost baseline may be necessary when you've used a schedule com-
pression or crashing technique. Changes to approved schedule start and end dates in the sched-
ule baseline are called revisions. These generally occur as a result of a project scope change, or
changes to activity estimates, and might result in a schedule baseline update. Schedule baseline
updates occur when significant changes to the project schedule are made like the changes just
mentioned. This means a new schedule baseline is established that reflects the changed project
activity dates. Once the new baseline is established, it is used as the basis for future perfor-
mance measurements. Never rebaseline a schedule without first having it approved by the proj-
ect sponsor and archiving a copy of the original baseline and schedule.


                  Take care when rebaselining a project schedule. Don't lose the original base-
                  line information. Why do you care? Because the original baseline serves as
                  historical information to reference for future projects. Make a backup copy
                  of the original schedule so that you have a record of the original baseline as
                  a reference. Even though some project management software allows you
                  to save several baselines plus the original, it's still good practice to make a
                  backup copy of the original.

   Changes to the project schedule might or might not require updates to other elements of
the project plan as well. For example, extending a schedule activity involving a contractor
might impact the costs associated with that activity.
   The project document updates output may require updates to either the schedule data or
project schedule or both. For example, project schedule network diagrams require updates
as a result of schedule model data updates. Don't forget to document these changes and
inform your stakeholders.

Utilizing Perform Quality
Control Techniques
Plan Quality, Perform Quality Assurance, and Perform Quality Control are part of the
project Quality Management Knowledge Area. These processes work together to define and
monitor the work of the project and to make certain the quality activity results meet the
quality requirements laid out in the plan.
   Perform Quality Control is specifically concerned with monitoring work results to
see whether they comply with the standards set out in the quality management plan. You
should practice Perform Quality Control throughout the project to identify and remove
the causes of unacceptable results. Remember that Perform Quality Control is concerned
with project results both from a management perspective, such as schedule and cost perfor-
mance, and from a product perspective. In other words, the end product should conform to
the requirements and product description defined during the Planning processes.


Perform Quality Control Inputs
Perform Quality Control includes the following inputs:
NN     Project management plan
NN     Quality metrics
NN     Quality checklists
NN     Work performance measurements
NN     Approved change requests
NN     Deliverables
NN     Organizational process assets
      I've discussed each of these inputs previously, so I'll move on to tools and techniques.


Perform Quality Control Tools and Techniques

                  The first seven Perform Quality Control tools and techniques are collec-
                  tively known as Ishikawa's seven basic tools of quality. We talked about
                  the fishbone diagram (a cause-and-effect diagram), also known as the
                  Ishikawa diagram, in Chapter 6, "Risk Planning." You recall that the fish-
                  bone diagram is used to help determine root causes. Kaoru Ishikawa is not
                  known only for the fishbone diagram, he was also a significant contributor
                  in the realm of quality.

    The primary purpose of each of these tools is to examine the product, service, or result
as well as the project processes for conformity to standards. If the results fall within the
tolerance range specified, the results are acceptable. Alternatively, if the results fall within
the control limits set for the product (as defined by the various tools and techniques I'll dis-
cuss in the following sections), the process you are examining is said to be in control. Spend
time understanding these tools and techniques and their individual uses because you might
see exam questions about each of them.
    I talked about cause-and-effect diagrams as a diagramming technique in the Risk
Identification process in Chapter 6. This technique helps identify root causes. If you
need a refresher, refer to Figure 6.2 in that chapter.
    I also discussed flowcharts in the same section of Chapter 6. Flowcharts are diagrams
that show the logical steps that must be performed in order to accomplish an objective.
They can also show how the individual elements of a system interrelate. Flowcharting can
help identify where quality problems might occur on the project and how problems happen.
This is important because it gives the project team the opportunity to develop alternative
approaches for dealing with anticipated quality problems identified with this tool and tech-
nique. Refer to Figure 6.3.
    Histograms are typically bar charts that depict the distribution of variables over time.
Chapter 7, "Planning Project Resources," contains an example histogram. In Perform
Quality Control, the histogram usually depicts the attributes of the problem or situation.
(I'll discuss attributes shortly.)
    We will look at the other tools and techniques in more detail in the following sections.

Control Charts
Control charts measure the results of processes over time and display the results in graph
form. Control charts are a way to measure variances to determine whether process variances
are in control or out of control.
   A control chart is based on sample variance measurements. From the samples chosen
and measured, the mean and standard deviation are determined. Perform Quality Con-
trol is usually maintained--or said to be in control--within plus or minus three standard
468        Chapter 11   n   Controlling Work Results



deviations. In other words, Perform Quality Control says that if the process is in control
(that is, the measurements fall within the control limits), you know that 99.73 percent of
the parts going through the process will fall within an acceptable range of the mean. If you
discover a part outside of this range, you should investigate and determine whether correc-
tive action is needed.
   Figure 11.2 illustrates an example control chart.

                                                                          Limit


   Let's assume you've determined from your sample measurements that 5 mm is the mean
in the example control chart. One standard deviation equals 0.02. Three standard devia-
tions on either side of the mean become your upper and lower control points on this chart.
Therefore, if all control points fall within plus or minus three standard deviations on either
side of the mean, the process is in control. If points fall outside the acceptable limits, the
process is not in control and corrective action is needed.
   Control charts are used most often in manufacturing settings where repetitive activities
are easily monitored. For example, the process that produces widgets by the case lot must
meet certain specifications and fall within certain variances to be considered in control.
However, you aren't limited to using control charts only in the manufacturing industry.
You can use them to monitor any output. You might consider using control charts to track
and monitor project management processes. You could plot cost variances, schedule vari-
ances, frequency or number of scope changes, and so on to help monitor variances.

Pareto Chart
You have probably heard of the 80/20 rule. Vilfredo Pareto is the person credited with dis-
covering this rule. He observed that 80 percent of the wealth and land ownership in Italy
was held by 20 percent of the population. Over the years, others have shown that the 80/20
rule applies across many disciplines and areas. As an example, generally speaking, 80 percent
of the deposits of any given financial institution are held by 20 percent of its customer base.
                                       Utilizing Perform Quality Control Techniques         469




Let's hope that rule doesn't apply to project managers, though, with 20 percent of the project
managers out there doing 80 percent of the work!
   The 80/20 rule as it applies to quality says that a small number of causes (20 percent) cre-
ate the majority of the problems (80 percent). Have you ever noticed this with your project or
department staff? It always seems that just a few people cause the biggest headaches. But I'm
getting off track.
   Pareto charts are displayed as histograms that rank-order the most important factors--
such as delays, costs, and defects, for example--by their frequency over time. His theory is
that you get the most benefit if you spend the majority of your time fixing the most impor-
tant problems. The information shown in Table 11.1 is plotted on an example Pareto chart
shown in Figure 11.3.

   The problems are rank-ordered according to their frequency and percentage of defects.
The defect frequencies in this figure appear as black bars, and the cumulative percentages
of defects are plotted as circles. The rank-ordering of these problems shows you where
corrective action should be taken first. You can see in Figure 11.3 that problem A should
receive priority attention because the most benefit will come from fixing this problem.

Run Charts
Run charts are used to show variations in the process over time or to show trends (such as
improvements or lack of improvements) in the process. Differences in results will occur in
processes because there is no such thing as a perfect process. When processes are considered
in control, differences in results might occur because of common causes of variances or
special-cause variances.
   Common causes of variances come about as a result of circumstances or situations
that are relatively common to the process you're using and are easily controlled at the
operational level. Special-cause variances are variances that are not common to the pro-
cess. For example, perhaps you have very detailed processes with specific procedures that
must be followed in order to produce the output and a process gets missed. Or maybe
your project requires the manufacturing of a certain part and a machine on the line has
a problem and requires a special calibration. This is an easy set of terms to remember
because their names logically imply their definitions.
   For the exam, you should understand the three types of variances that make up common
causes of variances:
Random variances Random variations might be normal, depending on the processes
you're using to produce the product or service of the project, but they occur as the name
implies, at random.
Known or predictable variances Known or predictable variances are variances that you
know exist in the process because of particular characteristics of the product, service, or
result you are processing. These are generally unique to a particular application.
Variances that are always present in the process The process itself will have inherent
variability that is perhaps caused by human mistakes, machine variations or malfunctions,
the environment, and so on, which are known as variances always present in the process.
These variances generally exist across all applications of the process.
   Common cause variances that do not fall within the acceptable range are difficult to cor-
rect and usually require a reorganization of the process. This has the potential for significant
impact, and decisions to change the process always require management approval.



Exam Spotlight

According to the PMBOK(R) Guide, when a process is in control, it should not be adjusted.
When a process falls outside the acceptable limits, it should be adjusted.
                                  Utilizing Perform Quality Control Techniques            471




   Trend analysis is another technique that's carried out using run charts. Trend analysis in
the Perform Quality Control process is a mathematical technique that uses historical results
to predict future outcomes. Trend analysis often tracks variances in cost and schedule per-
formance by monitoring the number of activities completed with significant variances within
a certain time period. This information can then be used to forecast future performance.
Trend analysis also tracks technical performance by determining the number of defects
observed and the number of defects not corrected. Technical performance measurements
compare the technical accomplishments of project milestones completed to the technical
milestones defined in the project Planning process group.

Scatter Diagrams
Scatter diagrams use two variables, one called an independent variable, which is an input,
and one called a dependent variable, which is an output. Scatter diagrams display the rela-
tionship between these two elements as points on a graph. This relationship is typically
analyzed to prove or disprove cause-and-effect relationships. As an example, maybe your
scatter diagram plots the ability of your employees to perform a certain task. The length
of time (in months) they have performed this task is plotted as the independent variable on
the X axis, and the accuracy they achieve in performing this task, which is expressed as a
score--the dependent variable--is plotted on the Y axis. The scatter diagram can then help
you determine whether cause-and-effect (in this case, increased experience over time versus
accuracy) can be proved. Scatter diagrams can also help you look for and analyze root causes
of problems.
   The important point to remember about scatter diagrams is that they plot the dependent
and independent variables, and the closer the points resemble a diagonal line, the closer
these variables are related. Figure 11.4 shows a sample scatter diagram.

Statistical Sampling
Statistical sampling involves taking a sample number of parts from the whole population and
examining them to determine whether they fall within acceptable variances. The formula to
calculate the correct sample size is beyond the scope of this book. However, Creative Research
Systems has an online calculator and an explanation of statistical sampling that you might find
useful. You can find them at http://www.surveysystem.com/sscalc.htm.
   Perhaps you determine to statistically sample 25 parts out of a lot or run. The quality
plan outlines that the lot will pass if four parts or fewer fall outside the allowable variance.
   Statistical sampling might also involve determining the standard deviation for a process,
as discussed in the control chart tool and technique. The quality plan determines whether
plus or minus two standard deviations--95.44 percent of the population--is adequate or
whether plus or minus three standard deviations--99.73 percent--is adequate.

Inspection
Inspection involves physically looking at, measuring, or testing results to determine
whether they conform to the requirements or quality standards. It's a tool used to gather
information and improve results. Inspections might occur after the final product is pro-
duced or at intervals during the development of the product to examine individual com-
ponents. Acceptance decisions are made when the work is inspected and the work is either
accepted or rejected. When work is rejected, it might have to go back through the process
for rework. Inspection is also known as reviews or peer reviews.



Exam Spotlight

Don't confuse inspection with prevention; they're two different tools. Inspection keeps
errors in the product from reaching the customer. Prevention keeps errors from occurring
in the process. It always costs less to prevent problems in the first place than it does to
fix problems built into the product after the fact. Rework, labor costs, material costs, and
potential loss of customers are all factors to consider when weighing prevention costs
versus the cost of rework. Philip Crosby developed the theory of Zero Defects, which deals
with prevention costs. Loosely translated, Zero Defects means doing it right the first time.



   Inspection might take actual measurements of components to determine whether they meet
requirements. Maybe a component part for your product must be exactly 5 mm in length. To
pass inspection, the parts are measured and must meet the 5 mm length requirement. If they
measure 5 mm, they pass; if they do not, they fail.
   Measurements can vary even if the variances are not noticeable. Machines wear down,
people make mistakes, the environment might cause variances, and so on. Measurements
that fall within a specified range are called tolerable results. So, instead of 5 mm exactly,
maybe a range between 4.98 mm and 5.02 mm is an acceptable or tolerable measurement
                                    Utilizing Perform Quality Control Techniques                473




for the component. If the samples that are measured fall within the tolerable range, they
pass; otherwise, they fail inspection.
   One inspection technique uses measurements called attributes. The measurements taken
during attribute sampling determine whether they meet one of two options, conforming
or nonconforming. In other words, the measurements conform or meet the requirement or
they do not conform. This can also be considered a pass/fail or go/no-go decision.
   Attribute conformity and inspections are not necessarily performed on every component
part or every end product that's produced. That's time-consuming and inefficient when
you're producing numerous components. Inspection in cases like this is usually performed
on a sampling of parts or products where every x number of parts is tested for conformity
or measurement specifics.
   Inspection will tell you where problems exist and gives you the opportunity to correct
them, thus leading to quality improvements. The other tools and techniques I'll talk about
in these sections also lead to quality improvements in the product or process or in both.




An Ounce of Prevention

One of the main thoroughfares into your city requires a bridge replacement. You were
appointed the project manager for the city and have managed this project since its initiation
15 months ago.

The project entailed hiring a contractor to build the new bridge and manage the contract
and the work of the contracting agency to bring the project to a successful completion.

Approximately 28,000 vehicles travel across this bridge on a daily basis, carrying com-
muters and college students back and forth to the downtown area. One of the require-
ments was the closure of no more than three of the six lanes of traffic at one time during
construction. Each piece of steel was required to be painted (two coats) before bringing
it on-site. A third coat of paint was to be applied at the site after construction. The paint
was to be guaranteed to last 25 to 30 years.

An on-site quality control inspection revealed that some of the paint was peeling. After
further investigation, you discovered that the contractor did not allow the first coat of
paint to cure properly, so when the second coat was applied, it peeled and flaked.

You've instructed the contractor that, according to the terms of the contract and the SOW
specifications, they're required to apply three coats of paint to the bridge, and the paint
is required to last 25 to 30 years. Paint that peels before construction is completed does
not comply with specifications. Corrective action is needed. As a result, the contract com-
pany decides to subcontract out the painting work to another company while they finish
up their remaining tasks on the project.
474        Chapter 11   n   Controlling Work Results




Unfortunately, the subcontractor who was hired found they were in way over their heads
and were not able to complete the paint job. Several months have passed, and the origi-
nal project completion date was missed long ago. Obviously, revisions to the project
schedule were required when it became clear that the subcontractor wasn't going to
make the date. Now another revision to the project schedule is necessary because of the
subcontractor's failure to complete the painting task.

The original contractor did some searching and found another subcontractor capable of
completing the painting job. It's now the middle of winter. Because the temperatures are
cold, the painting crew must hang insulated tarps between the bays on the bridge and
use heaters to warm up small areas of steel to the proper temperature to apply the paint.
This process extended the completion date by more than three times its original estimate
and ultimately delayed the completion of the project by two years. Additional costs were
incurred to hire the subcontractor and rent the heaters.

Corrective action was taken as a result of the inspection, and eventually the project was
completed, but not without schedule delays, schedule changes, scope changes, and
rework--not to mention the increased cost to the original contractor. Since the contract
was a fixed-price contract, the contractor's profit was eaten away paying for the paint-
ing job. The cost to correct the quality issue did not impact the city, but it did impact the
contractor. This is a case where an ounce of prevention would have been worth several
gallons of cure, as the old saying goes.




Perform Quality Control Outputs
Quality improvements, as mentioned in the Perform Quality Assurance process discussed
in Chapter 9, are a primary goal of the quality processes. Failure to meet quality require-
ments can have a significant impact on the project and the project team and might result
in rework. Rework causes a project to take longer and cost more than originally planned
because the project team has to repeat processes to correct the work. You should try to
keep rework to a minimum so as not to impact the project schedule and budget. Rework
has the potential to cause morale issues as well, especially if the team members thought
they were doing a good job all along. Rework might require the project team to put in extra
long hours, which in turn might cause more errors or other negative consequences. Monitor
quality periodically so that rework is kept to a minimum.


                  Perform Quality Assurance is concerned with assuring that the project
                  is using the correct and most efficient processes to meet the project
                  requirements; Perform Quality Control is concerned with the accuracy of
                  the project results.

     Perform Quality Control has several outputs:
NN    Quality control measurements
NN    Validated changes
NN    Validated deliverables
NN    Organizational process assets updates
NN    Change requests
NN    Project management plan updates
NN    Project document updates
   I've already discussed many of these outputs, but I'll add a few quick notes here.
   Validated changes are the results of changes, defect repairs, or variances that have been
inspected and corrected. The resulting change, particularly corrective and preventive actions,
can contribute to overall quality improvements and should be noted in the lessons learned
documentation. Remember that processes that are in control should not be adjusted. Pro-
cesses out of control might require adjusting, but this should occur only as a result of a man-
agement decision.
   Validating deliverables involves using the tools and techniques of this process to deter-
mine if the deliverable is correct and accurate. This output becomes an input to the next
process we'll discuss, Verify Scope, which entails accepting the deliverables.
   Completed checklists become part of the project's documentation and are included as
part of the organizational process asset updates. Lessons learned should include the causes
of variances found during this process and why the corrective actions were recommended.
   Updates to the quality management plan and the process improvement plan may be
required as part of the project management plan updates output of this process. Quality
standards may also need updating as a result of this process, and they are included in the
project document updates output.



Verifying Project Scope
Managing and reporting on project progress make up the primary focus of the Monitor-
ing and Controlling processes. One of the Monitoring and Controlling processes that helps
manage and control project progress is the Verify Scope process. The primary purpose of the
Verify Scope process is to formally accept completed deliverables and obtain sign-off that
the deliverables are satisfactory and meet stakeholders' expectations.
   The inputs of the Verify Scope are the project management plan, requirements documen-
tation, requirements traceability matrix, and validated deliverables. This process involves
evaluating these inputs to determine whether the work is complete and whether it satisfies
the project objectives. Evaluation is performed using inspection, which is the only tool and
technique of this process. You should perform Verify Scope even if the project is canceled
to document the degree to which the project was completed. This serves as historical infor-
mation, and if the project is ever started up again, you've got documentation that tells you
what was completed and how far the project progressed.
476         Chapter 11   n   Controlling Work Results




Exam Spotlight

The most important fact you should know about the Verify Scope process is that Verify
Scope formalizes the acceptance of the project scope and is primarily concerned with the
acceptance of work results. Don't confuse this process with the Perform Quality Control
process I just discussed.

You can remember the difference between Verify Scope and Perform Quality Control
this way:

NN    Perform Quality Control = checking for correct work results and assuring that the
      quality requirements are met
NN    Verify Scope = accepting work results



   The outputs of Verify Scope are accepted deliverables, change requests, and project doc-
ument updates. Accepted deliverables is concerned with the formal acceptance of the work
by the stakeholders. Remember that stakeholders include customers, the project sponsor,
the project team, the management team, and so on. Document their acceptance with formal
sign-off, and keep this with your project documents.



Controlling Scope
The Scope Management Knowledge Area includes Collect Requirements, Define Scope,
Create WBS, Verify Scope, and Control Scope. You'll recall that project scope describes
the work required to produce the product, service, or result of the project. This broad
statement usually includes the product scope statement and the product description, which
describes the characteristics, features, and functionality of the product, service, or result.
The Control Scope process involves monitoring the status of both the project and the
product scope, monitoring changes to the project and product scope, and monitoring work
results to ensure that they match expected outcomes. Any modification to the agreed-upon
WBS is considered a scope change. (It has been eons ago that you looked at this, so remem-
ber that the work breakdown structure is a deliverables-oriented hierarchy that defines the
total work of the project.) This means the addition or deletion of activities or modifications
to the existing activities on the WBS constitute a project scope change.
   Changes in product scope require changes to the project scope as well. Let's say one of
your project deliverables is the design of a piece of specialized equipment that's integrated
into your final product. Now let's say that because of engineering setbacks and some mis-
calculations, the specialized equipment requires design modifications. The redesign of this
equipment impacts the end product or product scope. Since changes to the product scope
impact the project requirements, which are detailed in the scope document, changes to
                                                              Controlling Scope            477




project scope are also required. This change, along with recommended corrective actions,
should be processed through the Perform Integrated Change Control process.
   Unapproved or undocumented changes that sometimes make their way into the project
are referred to as scope creep. How often have you overheard a stakeholder speaking directly
with a project team member asking them to make "this one little change that doesn't impact
anybody...really, no one will notice." Make certain your project team members are well
versed in the change control process and insist that they inform you of shenanigans like this.
Scope creep can kill an otherwise viable project. Little changes add up and eventually impact
budget, schedule, and quality.


Control Scope Inputs
The Control Scope process has five inputs, all of which you've seen before:
NN   Project management plan
NN   Work performance information
NN   Requirements documentation
NN   Requirements traceability matrix
NN   Organizational process assets
    There isn't any new information you need to know about these inputs for this process, so
let's move on to tools and techniques.


Control Scope Tools and Techniques
The Control Scope process has one tool and technique: variance analysis. Variance analy-
sis includes reviewing project performance measurements to determine whether there are
variances in project scope. It's also important to determine and document the cause of vari-
ances and examine those against the scope baseline so that you can implement corrective
actions if needed.


                 If you are using a configuration management system to control product
                 scope, the change control system must also integrate with it. The configura-
                 tion management system manages changes to product and project scope
                 and ensures that these changes are reasonable and make sense before
                 they're processed through the Perform Integrated Change Control process.




Control Scope Outputs
The outputs of the Control Scope process are as follows:
NN   Work performance measurements
NN   Organizational process assets updates
478        Chapter 11   n   Controlling Work Results



NN    Change requests
NN    Project management plan updates
NN    Project document updates
   Changes to scope will likely require that you repeat some of the project Planning
processes and make any needed adjustments, including updating the project documents.
Scope changes require an update to the project scope statement. This may require
an update to the WBS and WBS dictionary as well. Pop quiz: what are the scope
statement, WBS, and WBS dictionary collectively known as? Answer: the scope baseline.
Scope baseline updates are part of the project management plan updates output of
this process.
   Scope changes include any changes to the project scope as defined by the agreed-
upon WBS. This in turn might require changes or updates to project objectives, costs,
quality measures or controls, performance measurements baselines, or time in the form
of schedule revisions. Scope changes almost always affect project costs and/or require
schedule revisions.


                  Schedule revisions are almost always needed as a result of scope
                  changes. But not all scope changes lengthen the project schedule. Some
                  scope changes (a reduction in overall project requirements, for example)
                  might reduce the number of hours needed to complete the project, which
                  in turn might reduce the project budget. This most often occurs when
                  the schedule is the primary constraint on the project and the start or end
                  dates cannot be changed.

   When scope changes are requested, all areas of the project should be investigated to
determine what the changes will impact. The project team should perform estimates of
the impact and of the amount of time needed to make the change. Sometimes, however, the
change request is so extensive that even the time to perform an estimate should be evalu-
ated before proceeding. In other words, if the project team is busy working on estimates,
they aren't working on the project. That means extensive change requests could impact the
existing schedule because of the time and effort needed just to evaluate the change. Cases
like these require you to make a determination or ask the change control board (CCB) to
decide whether the change is important enough to allow the project team time to work on
the estimates.
   Always remember to update your stakeholders regarding the changes you're implement-
ing and their impacts. They'll want to know how the changes impact the performance base-
lines, including the project costs, project schedule, project scope, and quality.
   This process concludes the Monitoring and Controlling process groups. You'll look at
the Closing processes in the next chapter.

Project Case Study: New Kitchen Heaven Retail Store

Stakeholders have asked for an updated status on the project schedule as well as a remain-
ing cost projection. You decide to provide several cost and schedule performance figures
for the project on the status report.

"Build-out is behind schedule. They were scheduled to be completed by the 15th of January,
but they aren't going to finish up until the 24th."

"What's that going to do to my schedule?" Jill asks. "I'm starting interviews for the
store positions on the 16th. I hope to have that wrapped up by the 19th. As long as
I have the majority of the staff hired by the 20th, we can have them stocking shelves
starting the 22nd."

"Let's finish up the status of the other items, and I'll come back to that."

You've calculated some performance measurements, including earned value measures,
and you show them to Jill and Dirk (all figures are in millions of dollars):

NN   BAC = 2; PV = 1.86; cumulative EV = 1.75; cumulative AC = 1.70
NN   Cumulative CPI is 1.03 (1.75 / 1.70)
NN   SPI is .94 (1.75 / 1.86)
NN   EAC is 1.94 (1.70 + ((2 - 1.75) / 1.03)))
NN   ETC is .25 (2 - 1.75)

"What is all this telling us?" Dirk asks.

"The cost performance index tells us we're getting a good return for the money spent on
the project so far. In other words, we've experienced a $1.03 value for every dollar spent
to date," you respond.

"The schedule performance index isn't as cheery, but it's not dreadful news either. This
performance indicator says that work is progressing at 94 percent of what we anticipated
by this point.

"The estimate at completion tells us that based on what we know today, the total project
will cost $1.94 million. That's coming in under the original $2 million we had budgeted
for completion, so we're on track with the project budget. The last figure is the estimated
cost of the remaining work."

"It looks like we're a little behind schedule based on what you have figured here," Dirk says.
480           Chapter 11   n   Controlling Work Results




"Yes, that's correct," you reply. "That brings us back to Jill's question. I have two alterna-
tives to propose. One, we overlap the schedule and allow Gomez's crew to complete their
work while Jill's staff starts stocking shelves."

Jill says, "I don't like this option. We'll be tripping over each other, and I don't want mer-
chandise damaged by workers who are still dragging equipment around inside the store.
What's your other option?"

"We could ask Gomez to increase the crew size so that they complete on time according to
the contract. We have a provision in the contract that stipulates they add crew members if it
looks as though they'll miss the scheduled completion date. I will instruct the contract man-
agement department to inform Gomez that we're requiring additional crew members."

"That will do the trick," Jill says. "We need the storefront to ourselves when stocking and
preparing for opening. I'm glad you had that stipulation in the contract."

You report that sign-off has been obtained for the completed deliverables to date. Quality
inspections and comparisons of the deliverables to the acceptance criteria were completed
to Jill and Ricardo's satisfaction on the work performed to date.

Understanding How This Applies
to Your Next Project
With the exception of the Perform Integrated Change Control process, we covered the
meaty portion of the Monitoring and Controlling process group in this chapter. It's critical
                          Understanding How This Applies to Your Next Project                  481




to monitor every process we discussed in order to keep the project in alignment with the
objectives and to be able to take corrective action as soon as possible.
   Monitoring and Controlling Risk is a process you'll perform once the work of the proj-
ect begins throughout the remainder of the project. Just like change, risk is something that
will occur on most every project you undertake. I've never managed a project (except for
projects that were started and finished within a matter of days) that didn't encounter risk.
And I'd say my experience has been that most risks are unknown, which makes contingency
reserves (both time and money) essential on any project. For example, during the writing
of this book, we moved to a new home. I did the smart thing and got three estimates from
three reputable moving companies in the area. The estimates are based on an hourly rate for
a certain number of movers. Two estimates came back very close to each other and the third
was more than double the other estimates. So I picked the company that said they could get
us moved in two days rather than the three their competitor quoted. Fortunately, we don't
move very often. Unfortunately, I didn't realize moving companies woefully underbid the
amount of time it actually takes to pack you up, load the truck, and unload at the other end.
By the third day, I had to insist they complete the job in four hours because we were at more
than double the original quote at that point. It's a good thing I had a reserve tucked away for
the unexpected, but this overrun wiped out the entire contingency fund! Taking on a project
without knowing that risks will occur and without having some contingency set aside is a
huge gamble because even the smallest projects have risks.
   Earned value measurement is a tool you can't live without for measuring performance
on your project, particularly the cost and schedule variance and the cost and schedule per-
formance indexes. The size and complexity of the project will dictate how often you should
run the performance measurements. The mantra of stakeholders everywhere is "on time
and on budget." Therefore, controlling the project budget and the schedule will likely be
two of your most time-consuming project management tasks. Use the tools we discussed in
this chapter to keep yourself and your stakeholders informed of what's happening regarding
these two important areas. If cost or schedule changes must occur, it's imperative you com-
municate what happened, why it happened, and if it's expected to happen again and that
you realign stakeholders' expectations with the new forecasted estimates.
   Perform Quality Control and Verify Scope work together to measure, inspect, and accept
the project deliverables. Verifying and accepting the work of the project shouldn't be a mind-
boggling task at this point if you've been following the project management processes all
along. For example, you should monitor and inspect deliverables as they're completed. At
project's end, there might be additional testing or inspection needed to be certain all the deliv-
erables work together (if they're required to do so), but many issues or problems you've dis-
covered regarding the deliverables should have been discovered by now. However, I know that
exceptions do exist. It isn't always possible to inspect the work of the project as it progresses
because some projects aren't complete until the last piece of the puzzle is put into place. In that
case, inspection, testing, and deliverables acceptance won't occur until the end of the project.
But again, if you've used sound Monitoring and Controlling tools and techniques to monitor
the processes, ideally you won't encounter any big surprises at this stage.
   Control Scope is absolutely essential for all projects. Time and again I've seen changes to
scope end up pitting stakeholders against the project team because the requirements weren't
482        Chapter 11   n   Controlling Work Results



defined adequately in the first place and because neither party clearly understood what was
being requested. Scope changes can kill a project by significantly delaying the finish date or
by so drastically modifying the original objective of the project that it no longer resembles
what it set out to accomplish. I try to keep the questions regarding scope change simple,
as in "Do you absolutely have to have this to meet the objective of this project?" That isn't
always easy for people to understand because we often confuse wants with needs. So, I
might come up with an analogy they can relate to--something like this: "Let's say your one
and only culinary skill is boiling water. Do you really need a designer stove with dual fuel
options and a built-in warming oven to boil water? Wouldn't a simple store brand work in
that case?"



Summary
We covered a lot of material in this chapter, and we also closed out the Monitoring and
Controlling process group.
   Monitor and Control Risks responds to risks as they occur and implements workarounds
for unplanned risk events. Some risks planned for during the Plan Risk Responses process
will occur, and some will not. Perhaps risks that were previously identified do occur, and
their impacts are much greater than anticipated during the Plan Risk Responses process.
These will require updates to the risk management plan or workarounds.
   Cost Control involves managing changes to project costs. It's also concerned with
monitoring project budgets to prevent unauthorized or incorrect costs from getting
included in the cost baseline. Cost Control uses tools and techniques such as earned value
measurement (such as CV, SV, CPI, SPI), forecasting (ETC and EAC), and project perfor-
mance reviews (variance analysis, trend analysis, and EVM) to monitor costs.
   Schedule Control involves determining the status of the project schedule, determining
whether changes have occurred or should, and influencing and managing schedule changes.
   Perform Quality Control monitors work results to see whether they fulfill the quality
standards outlined in the quality management plan. Perform Quality Control should occur
throughout the life of the project. It uses many tools and techniques. Inspection measures
results to determine whether the results conform to the quality standards. Attributes are
measurements that either conform or do not conform. Control charts measure the results of
processes over time, and Pareto charts are histograms that rank-order the most important
quality factors by their frequency over time. You should not adjust processes that are in
control; however, you can change these processes to realize improvements.
   Verify Scope involves verifying and accepting work results, while Control Scope is
concerned with controlling changes to project scope.

Exam Essentials
Describe the purpose of Monitor and Control Risks. Monitor and Control Risks involves
identifying and responding to new risks as they occur. Risk monitoring and reassessment
should occur throughout the life of the project.
Name the purpose of the Control Costs process. The Control Costs process is concerned
with monitoring project costs to prevent unauthorized or incorrect costs from getting
included in the cost baseline.
Be able to describe earned value measurement techniques. Earned value measurement
(EVM) monitors the planned value (PV), earned value (EV), and actual costs (AC) expended
to produce the work of the project. Cost variance (CV), schedule variance (SV), cost perfor-
mance index (CPI), and schedule performance index (SPI) are the formulas used with the
EVM technique.
Be able to name the tools and techniques of the Control Costs process. The tools and
techniques of the Control Costs process are earned value measurement, forecasting, to-
complete performance index, performance reviews, variance analysis, and project manage-
ment software.
Be able to name the purpose of the Perform Quality Control process. The purpose of the
Perform Quality Control process is to monitor work results to see whether they comply
with the standards set out in the quality management plan.
Name the purpose of the Verify Scope process. The purpose of Verify Scope is to determine
whether the work is complete and whether it satisfies the project objectives.
Be able to describe product verification. Product verification confirms that all the work of
the project was completed accurately and to the satisfaction of the stakeholder.

Review Questions
1.   You are working on a project that was proceeding well until a manufacturing glitch
     occurred that requires corrective action. It turns out the glitch was an unintentional
     enhancement to the product, and the marketing people are absolutely crazy about its
     potential. The corrective action is canceled, and you continue to produce the product with
     the newly discovered enhancement. As the project manager, you know that a change has
     occurred to the product scope because the glitch changed the characteristics of the product.
     Which of the following statements is true?
     A. Changes to product scope should be reflected in the project scope.
     B.   Changes to product scope should be documented in the scope management plan.
     C.   Changes to product scope will result in cost changes.
     D.   Changes to product scope are a result of corrective action.

2.   You are working on a project that was proceeding well until a manufacturing glitch
     occurred that requires corrective action. It turns out the glitch was an unintentional
     enhancement to the product, and the marketing people are absolutely crazy about its
     potential. The corrective action is canceled, and you continue to produce the product with
     the newly discovered enhancement. As the project manager, you know that a variance has
     occurred. Which of the following is true?
     A. Common causes of variance, also known as special-cause variances, are situations that
        are unique and not easily controlled at the operational level.
     B.   Random variances, known or predictable variances, and variances that are always
          present in the process are known as common causes of variance.
     C.   Attribute inspection determines whether measurements fall within tolerable results.
     D.   Scatter diagrams display the relationships between an independent and a dependent
          variable to show variations in the process over time.

3.   Your project has experienced some changes to the agreed-upon WBS elements. The changes
     were approved through the proper change control process. The WBS changes might in turn
     require which of the following? Choose the best answer.
     A. Scope changes
     B.   Cost changes

5.    You are the project manager for a top-secret software project for an agency of the United
      States government. Your mission--should you choose to accept it--is to complete the project
      using internal resources. The reason is that getting top-secret clearances for contractors takes
      quite a bit of time and waiting for clearances would jeopardize the implementation date. Your
      programmers are 80 percent of the way through the programming and testing work when
      your agency appoints a new executive director. Your programmers are siphoned off this proj-
      ect to work on the executive director's hot new project. Which of the following addresses the
      purpose of Verify Scope in this case?
      A. Verify Scope determines the correctness and completion of all the work.
      B.   Verify Scope documents the level and degree of completion.
      C.   Verify Scope determines whether the project results comply with quality standards.
      D.   Verify Scope documents the correctness of the work according to stakeholders'
           expectations.

6.    Which of the following statements is true regarding schedule variances?
      A. Schedule variances impact scope, which impacts the schedule.
      B.   Schedule variances sometimes impact the schedule.
      C.   Schedule variances always impact the schedule.
      D.   Schedule variances never impact the schedule.

7.    You are a project manager for Laurel's Theater Productions. Your new project is coming in
      over budget and requires a cost change through the cost change control system. You know
      all of the following statements are true regarding Control Costs except for which one?
      A. A description of how cost changes should be managed and controlled is found in the
         cost management plan.
      B.   Cost changes are reflected in the cost baseline.
      C.   EVM is used to determine the cost performance that must be realized for the remaining
           work of the project to meet the goal.
      D.   This equation, EAC = BAC / cumulative CPI, is used to forecast an estimate at comple-
           tion assuming future project performance will be the same as past performance.
                                                                     Review Questions              487

    the budget.
     A. PV
     B.   AC
     C.   EV
     D.   EAC

11. You are a contract project manager for a wholesale flower distribution company. Your project
    is to develop a website for the company that allows retailers to place their flower orders online.
    You will also provide a separate link for individual purchases that are ordered, packaged, and
    mailed to the consumer directly from the grower's site. This project involves coordinating the
    parent company, growers, and distributors. You are preparing a performance review and have
    the following measurements at hand: PV = 300, AC = 200, and EV = 250. What do you know
    about this project?
     A. The EAC is a positive number, which means the project will finish under budget.
     B.   You do not have enough information to calculate CPI.
     C.   The CV is a negative number in this case, which means you've spent less than you
          planned to spend as of the measurement date.
     D.   The CV is a positive number in this case, which means you're under budget as of the
          measurement date.

12. A negative result from an SV calculation means which of the following?
     A. PV is higher than EV.
     B.   PV equals 1.

Answers to Review Questions
1.    A. Changes to product scope should be reflected in the project scope.

2.    D. Scatter diagrams display the relationship between an independent and dependent variable
      over time.

3.    C. WBS element changes are scope changes. According to the PMBOK(R) Guide, schedule
      revisions are often required as a result of scope changes.

4.    C. The Verify Scope process is concerned with the acceptance of work results. It also
      formalizes the acceptance of the project scope.

5.    B. Verify Scope should document the level and degree of completion of the project given the
      circumstances in this question. If you come back at a later date and restart this project, Verify
      Scope will describe how far the project progressed and give you an idea of where to start.

6.    B. Schedule variances will sometimes--but not always--impact the schedule. Changes to
      noncritical path tasks will not likely impact the schedule, but changes to critical path tasks
      will always impact the schedule.

7.    C. To-complete performance index determines the cost performance that must be realized
      for the remaining work of the project to meet a goal such as BAC or EAC.

8.    D. Budget updates might require cost rebaselining.

9.    A. Schedule variance is (EV - PV) and schedule performance index is (EV / PV).

10. C. Earned value is referred to as the value of the work that's been completed to date
    compared to the budget.

11. D. The CV is a positive number and is calculated by subtracting AC from EV as follows:
    250 - 200 = 50. A positive CV means the project is coming in under budget, meaning
    you've spent less than you planned as of the measurement date.

12. A. The SV calculation is EV - PV. If PV is a higher number than EV, you'll get a negative
    number as a result.

13. B. CPI is calculated as follows: EV / AC. In this case, 250 / 200 = 1.25.

14. B. When you accept project performance to date and assume future ETC work will be
    performed at the budgeted rate, EAC is calculated as follows: AC + BAC - EV. Therefore,
    the calculation for this question looks like this: (200 + 800) - 250 = 750.

15. C. The correct formula for ETC for this question is as follows: BAC - cumulative EV.
    Therefore, ETC is as follows: 375 - 250 = 125.

16. A. When project performance is expected to behave like past performance, EAC is calcu-
    lated as follows: EAC = BAC / cumulative CPI. Therefore, the calculation for this question
    looks like this: 800 / 1.25 = 640.
                                                    Answers to Review Questions                 491



17. D. You first have to calculate EAC in order to calculate VAC. EAC for variances that are
    atypical is AC + BAC - EV. So our numbers are 275 + 500 - 250 = 525. VAC is calculated this
    way: BAC - EAC. Therefore, 500 - 525 = -25. Our costs are not doing as well as anticipated.

18. C. You must first calculate cumulative CPI in order to calculate ETC. Cumulative CPI
    is cumulative EV / cumulative AC. We have 250 / 275 = .91. ETC with typical variances is
    (BAC - cumulative EV) / cumulative CPI. Our numbers are (500 - 250) / .91 = 274.7.

19. B. Workarounds are unplanned responses. They deal with negative risk events as they
    occur. As the name implies, workarounds were not previously known to the project team.
    The risk event was unplanned, so no contingency plan existed to deal with the risk event,
    and thus it required a workaround.

20. A. CPI is considered the most critical EVM metric. It measures the cost efficiency of the
    project work completed at the measuring date.

                               ishing this chapter will be well equipped to take the Project
                               Management Professional (PMP) exam.
   The last process group we'll cover is the Closing process group, and it has two processes:
Close Project or Phase and Close Procurements. The Close Project or Phase process is con-
cerned with verifying that the work of the project was completed correctly and to the stake-
holders' satisfaction. Close Procurements supports the Close Project or Phase process and also
verifies that the work of the project was completed correctly and the deliverables accepted.
   Once you've obtained the PMP designation, you have an obligation to maintain integrity,
apply your subject matter knowledge and project management knowledge, and maintain the
code of conduct published by the PMI. You'll also be required to balance the interests and
needs of stakeholders with the organization's needs. The exam might include questions on
any of these topics.
   As a project manager, you'll find yourself in many unique situations, different organiza-
tions, and possibly even different countries. Even if you never get involved in international
project management, you will still come in contact with people from different cultures and
backgrounds than yours. If you work as a contract project manager, you'll be exposed to
many different organizations that each has its own culture and ways of doing things. You
should always strive to act in a professional, courteous manner in these situations.
   I'll talk about each of these topics in this chapter.



Formulating Project Closeout
All good projects must come to an end, as the saying goes. Ideally, you've practiced all the
topics I've talked about that have led up to this point, and you've delivered a successful
project to the stakeholders and customers. You've also put some of the vital tools of project
management into play--planning, executing, controlling, and communicating--to help you
reach that goal.
   But how do you know when a project has ended successfully? Delivering the product or
service of the project doesn't mean it has been completed satisfactorily. Remember back to
the opening chapters, I said a project is completed successfully when it meets or exceeds
stakeholders' expectations and satisfies the goals of the project. During the Closing pro-
cesses--Close Project or Phase and Close Procurements--you'll document the acceptance
of the product of the project with a formal sign-off and file it with the project records for
future reference. The formal sign-off is the way stakeholders indicate that the goals have
been met and that the project meets or exceeds their expectations so that the project ends.
                                                      Formulating Project Closeout          495




Characteristics of Closing
A few characteristics are common to all projects during the Closing processes. One is that
the probability of completing the project is highest during this process and risk is lowest.
You've already completed the majority of the work of the project--if not all of the work--
so the probability of not finishing the project is very low.
   Stakeholders have the least amount of influence during the Closing processes, while
project managers have the greatest amount of influence. Costs are significantly lower
during this process because the majority of the project work and spending has already
occurred. Remember those cost S curves we talked about in the Cost Budgeting process?
This is where they taper off as project spending comes to an end.
   One last common characteristic of projects during closing is that weak matrix organi-
zations tend to experience the least amount of stress during the Closing processes. This is
because, in a weak matrix organization, the functional manager assigns all tasks (project-
related tasks as well) so the team members have a job to return to once the project is com-
pleted and there's no change in reporting structure.
   All projects do eventually come to an end. You'll now examine a few of the reasons
for project endings before getting into the Close Project or Phase and Close Procurements
processes.


Project Endings
Projects come to an end for several reasons:
NN    They're completed successfully.
NN    They're canceled or killed prior to completion.
NN    They evolve into ongoing operations and no longer exist as projects.
     Four formal types of project endings exist that you might need to know for the exam:
NN    Addition
NN    Starvation
NN    Integration
NN    Extinction
     You'll look at each of these ending types in detail in the following sections.

Addition
Projects that evolve into ongoing operations are considered projects that end because of addi-
tion; in other words, they become their own ongoing business unit. An example of this is the
installation of an enterprise resource planning system. These systems are business manage-
ment systems that integrate all areas of a business, including marketing, planning, manufac-
turing, sales, financials, and human resources. After the installation of the software, these
systems can develop into their own business unit because ongoing operations, maintenance,
and monitoring of the software require full-time staff. These systems usually evolve into an
arm of the business reporting system that no one can live without once it's installed.
496         Chapter 12   n   Applying Professional Responsibility



  A project is considered a project when it meets these criteria: it is unique, has a definite
beginning and ending date, and is temporary in nature. When a project becomes an ongoing
operation, it is no longer a project.

Starvation
When resources are cut off from the project or are no longer provided to the project, it's
starved prior to completing all the requirements, and you're left with an unfinished project
on your hands. Starvation can happen for any number of reasons:
NN    Other projects come about and take precedence over the current project, thereby cutting
      the funding or resources for your project.
NN    The customer curtails an order.
NN    The project budget is reduced.
NN    A key resource quits.
   Resource starving can include cutting back or withholding human resources, equipment
and supplies, or money. In any case, if you're not getting the people, equipment, or money
you need to complete the project, it's going to starve and probably end abruptly.
   This is one of those cases where documentation becomes your best friend. Organizations
tend to have short memories. As you move on to bigger and better projects, your memory
regarding the specifics of the project will fade. Six months from now when someone impor-
tant wonders why that project was never completed and begins the finger-pointing routine,
the project documents will clearly outline the reasons why the project ended early. That's
one of the reasons project documentation is such an important function. I'll talk more
about documenting project details shortly.

Integration
Integration occurs when the resources of the project--people, equipment, property, and
supplies--are distributed to other areas in the organization or are assigned to other projects.
Perhaps your organization begins to focus on other areas or other projects, and the next
thing you know, functional managers come calling to retrieve their resources for other, more
important things. Again, your project will come to an end due to lack of resources because
they have been reassigned to other areas of the business or have been pulled from your
project and assigned to another project.


                   The difference between starvation and integration is that starvation is
                   the result of staffing, funding, or other resource cuts while integration
                   is the result of reassignment or redeployment of the resources.

   Again, good documentation describing the circumstances that brought about the end-
ing of a project because of integration should be archived with the project records for
future reference.
                                                      Formulating Project Closeout                497




Extinction
This is the best kind of project end because extinction means the project has been completed
and accepted by the stakeholders. As such, it no longer exists because it had a definite ending
date, the goals of the project were achieved, and the project was closed out.




Pied Piper

Jerome Reed is the project manager for Pied Piper's newest software project. His team is
working on a program that will integrate the organization's human resource information,
including payroll records, leave-time accruals, contact information, and so on. His top
two programmers, Brett and Kathy, are heading up the coding team and are in charge of
the programming and testing activities.

Pied Piper recently hired a new CIO who started working with the company just a few
weeks ago. Jerome is concerned about his human resources project. It was the former
CIO's pet project, but he's not sure where it falls on the new CIO's radar screen.

Jerome is in the computer room checking out the new hardware that just arrived for his
project. Liz Horowitz, the director of network operations, approaches Jerome.

"That's a nice piece of hardware," Liz comments.

"It sure is. This baby is loaded. It's going to process and serve up data to the users so fast
they'll be asking us to upgrade all the servers."

Liz replies, "You're right about that. I've asked Richard to burn it in and load the software."

"What software?" Jerome asks.

"You know, the new customer relationship management software. The CIO hired some
vendor she has worked with before to come in and install their CRM system here. She
said it was our top priority. I knew this new server was already on order, and it happens to
be sized correctly for the new CRM system."

"I purchased this server for the human resources project. What am I supposed to use
for that?"

Liz answers, "I've got a server over there on the bottom of the third rack that might
work, or maybe you can order another one. But you should take this up with the CIO.
All I know is she authorized me to use this server. She understood I was taking it from
your project, so maybe she's thinking about going another direction with the human
resources project.
498        Chapter 12   n   Applying Professional Responsibility




"You probably should know I also asked to have Brett and Kathy assigned to the CRM
project. Even though it's a vendor project, it still requires some of our coders. The CIO
wanted the best, and they're the best we've got. It shouldn't take them long to make the
changes I need, and then you can have them back for your project. In the meantime, they
can give directions to your other programmers so they can keep working."

"I'm going to go see whether the CIO is in," Jerome replies.

This is a case where Jerome's project ends by integration because of the reassignment
of resources. The new CIO came on board and changed the direction and focus of the
project priorities, making her new project a higher priority than the previous project. As a
result, Jerome's hardware and his top two resources were reassigned to the new project.
Had the CIO cut the resources and equipment on the original project altogether, it would
have ended because of starvation.




Closing Out the Project
The key activity of the Close Project or Phase process is concerned with gathering project
records and disseminating information to formalize the acceptance of the product, service,
or result as well as to perform project closure. You'll want to review the project documents
to make certain they are up-to-date. For example, perhaps some scope change requests were
implemented that changed some of the characteristics of the final product. The project infor-
mation you're collecting during this process should reflect the characteristics and specifica-
tions of the final product. Don't forget to update your resource assignments as well. Some
team members will have come and gone over the course of the project; you need to double-
check that all the resources and their roles and responsibilities are noted.
    Once the project outcomes are documented, you'll request formal acceptance from the
stakeholders or the customer. (I'll cover formal acceptance later when I talk about the out-
puts.) They're also interested in knowing whether the product or service of the project meets
the goals the project set out to accomplish. If your documentation is up-to-date, you'll have
the project results at hand to share with them.
    The Close Project or Phase process is also concerned with analyzing the project manage-
ment processes to determine their effectiveness and to document lessons learned concerning
the project processes. And one of the other key functions of the Close Project or Phase process
is to archive all project documents for historical reference. You can probably guess that Close
Project or Phase belongs to the Project Integration Management Knowledge Area since this
process touches so many areas of the project.
    Every project requires closure. According to the PMBOK(R) Guide, the completion of
each project phase requires project closure as well.
                                                          Closing Out the Project           499




Exam Spotlight

Project closure occurs at the end of each phase of the project in order to properly docu-
ment project information and keep it safe for future reference. You shouldn't wait until
project completion to perform the Close Project or Phase process but rather perform it at
the end of every phase, no matter whether the project phase was completed successfully
or ended for some other reason.




Close Project or Phase Inputs
The Close Project or Phase process gathers all the project records and verifies that they are
up-to-date and accurate. The project records must correctly identify the final specifications
of the product or service the project set out to produce. Close Project or Phase is the place
to ensure that this information accurately reflects the true results of the project.
   The inputs to the Close Project or Phase process are as follows:
NN    Project management plan
NN    Accepted deliverables
NN    Organizational process assets
     I've talked about all of these inputs previously.


Close Project or Phase Tools and Techniques
The only tool and technique of Close Project or Phase is expert judgment. When you're
conducting administrative closure activities, which we'll discuss next, the subject matter
experts can help assure that the process is performed according to the organization's and to
project management standards.
   Administrative closure procedures involve collecting all the records associated with
the project, analyzing the project success (or failure), documenting and gathering lessons
learned, and archiving project records. Keep in mind that when projects are performed
under contract, the archiving of financial records is especially important. These records
might need to be accessed if there are payment disputes, so you need to know where they
are and how they were filed. Projects with large financial expenditures also require particu-
lar attention to the archiving of financial records for the same reasons. Financial informa-
tion is especially useful when estimating future projects, so again, make sure to archive the
information so it's easily accessible.
   All of these documents should be indexed for reference and filed in a safe place. Don't
forget to include electronic databases and electronic documents as part of your project
archives as well. These records can be stored on a network drive or copied onto a CD that's
kept with the project binder.
500           Chapter 12   n   Applying Professional Responsibility



   Administrative closure procedures also document the project team members' and stake-
holders' roles and responsibilities in performing this process. According to the PMBOK(R)
Guide, this should include the processes and methodologies for defining the following:
NN     Approval requirements of the stakeholders for project deliverables and changes to
       deliverables.
NN     Assuring and confirming that the project meets the requirements of the stakeholders,
       customers, and sponsor. This includes documenting necessary actions to verify that the
       deliverables have been accepted and exit criteria have been met.
NN     Assuring and confirming that the exit criteria for the project are satisfied.


Close Project or Phase Outputs
Sometimes you'll work on projects where everything just clicks. Your project team func-
tions at the performing stage, the customers and stakeholders are happy, and things just
fall into place according to plan. I often find it difficult to perform Close Project or Phases
on projects that have progressed particularly well, just because I don't want them to end.
Believe it or not, the majority of your projects can fall into this category if you practice
good project management techniques and exercise those great communication skills.
   The Close Project or Phase process has the following outputs:
NN     Final product, service, or result transition
NN     Organizational process assets updates
      We'll take a brief look at each in the following sections.

Final Product, Service, or Result
The name of this output is somewhat misleading. This actually refers to the acceptance of
the final product, service, or result and the turnover of the product to the organization. This
usually requires a formal sign-off (I'll talk about that next), and in the case of a project per-
formed on contract, it definitely requires a formal sign-off or receipt indicating acceptance of
the project.
   Formal acceptance includes distributing notice of the acceptance of the product or service
of the project by the stakeholders, customer, or project sponsor to stakeholders and custom-
ers. You should require formal sign-off indicating that those signing accept the product of
the project.


                     The final product, service, or result is concerned with obtaining formal
                     acceptance; organizational process assets involves documenting and
                     archiving formal acceptance.


Organizational Process Assets Updates
The organizational process assets output is where the formal sign-off of the acceptance
of the product is documented, collected, and archived for future reference. Documenting
                                                           Closing Out the Project           501




formal acceptance is important because it signals the official closure of the project, and it is
your proof that the project was completed satisfactorily.
    Another function of sign-off is that it kicks off the beginning of the warranty period.
Sometimes project managers or vendors will warranty their work for a certain time period
after completing the project. Projects that produce software programs, for example, might
be warranted from bugs for a 60- or 90-day time frame from the date of implementation
or acceptance. Typically in the case of software projects, bugs are fixed for free during
the warranty period. Watch out, because users will try to squeeze new requirements into
the "bug" category mold. If you offer a warranty, it's critical that the warranty spells out
exactly what is covered and what is not.
    This is also where the other project records and files are collected and archived. This
includes the project planning documents (project scope statement, budget, schedule, risk
responses, quality plan and baselines, and so on), change records and logs, issue logs, and
so on.
    Project or phase closure documents are included in this output. These include documen-
tation showing that the project or phase is completed and that the transfer of the product
of the project to the organization (or department responsible for ongoing maintenance and
support) has occurred. In the case of a phase completion, the transfer would be the offi-
cial hand-off to the next phase of the project rather than to an operations or maintenance
group. If your project is canceled or ends prematurely, you should document the reasons for
its premature end as well as the procedures for transferring the completed and uncompleted
deliverables.
    Historical information and lessons learned are used to document the successes and fail-
ures of the project. As an example, lessons learned document the reasons specific corrective
actions were taken, their outcomes, the causes of performance variances, unplanned risks
that occurred, mistakes that were made and could have been avoided, and so on.
    Unfortunately, sometimes projects do fail. You can learn lessons from failed projects as
well as from successful projects, and you should document this information for future ref-
erence. Most project managers, however, do not document lessons learned. The reason for
this is that employees don't want to admit to making mistakes or learning from mistakes
made during the project. And they do not want their name associated with failed projects
or even with mishaps on successful projects.


                  Lessons learned can include some of the most valuable information you'll
                  take away from a project. We can all learn from our experiences, and what
                  better way to have even more success on your next project than to review
                  a similar past project's lessons learned document? But lessons learned will
                  be there only if you document them now. I strongly recommend you not
                  skip this step.

   You and your management team will have to work to create an atmosphere of trust and
assurance that lessons learned are not reasons for dismissing employees but are learning
opportunities that benefit all those associated with the project. Lessons learned allow you
to carry knowledge gained on this project to other projects you'll work on going forward.
502        Chapter 12    n   Applying Professional Responsibility



They'll also prevent repeat mistakes in the future if you take the time to review the project
documents and lessons learned prior to undertaking your new project.
   Post-implementation audits aren't an official output, but they are a good idea. These go
hand in hand with lessons learned because they examine the project from beginning to end
and look at what went right and what went wrong. They evaluate the project goals and deter-
mine whether the product or service of the project satisfies the objectives. Post-implementation
audits also examine the activities and project processes to determine whether improvements
are possible on future projects.
   Organizations might conduct post-implementation audits instead of lessons learned ses-
sions. Documenting and gathering information during this procedure can serve the same
function as lessons learned if you're honest and include all the good, the bad, and the ugly.
Let's hope there's very little ugly.




Cimarron Research Group

The Cimarron Research Group researches and develops organic pesticides for use on food
crops. It is a medium-sized company and has established a project management office
(PMO) to manage all aspects of project work. The PMO consists of project managers and
administrative staff who assist with information handling, filing, and disbursement.

Terri Roberts is the project manager for a project that has just closed. Terri diligently
filed all the pertinent project documents as the project progressed and has requested
the research files and engineering notes from the director of engineering to include them
with the project archives as well. All information regarding the research on this project is
included with the project archives. The engineering department chooses to keep its own
set of research records as well, but it's important to keep a copy of these notes with the
project archives so that all the information about the project is in one place.

Terri's assistant has indexed all the project documents and recently sent notice of formal
acceptance and approval of this project to the stakeholders, project sponsor, and manage-
ment team. This notice officially closes the project. The next step is to archive the files onto
CDs and store them.




Closing Out the Procurements
Procurements have life cycles of their own--just like projects. I talked about the contract
life cycles in Chapter 9. As such, procurements and contracts come to a close just as proj-
ects come to a close. As you might guess, there is a process that deals with procurement
closings; it's called Close Procurements.
                                                   Closing Out the Procurements              503




   The Close Procurements process is concerned with completing and settling the terms of
the procurement. It supports the Close Project or Phase process because the Close Procure-
ments process determines whether the work described in the procurement documentation
or contract was completed accurately and satisfactorily. This is called product verification.
Projects that have multiple deliverables may have procurements for some of the deliverables
but not all. Obviously, this process applies only to those phases, deliverables, or portions of
the project that were performed under some form of procurement.
   Close Procurements updates records and archives the information for future reference.
These records detail the final results of the work of the project. I'll talk about the specifics
of this when I cover the Close Procurements outputs.
   Procurement documents might have specific terms or conditions for completion and
closeout. You should be aware of these terms or conditions so that project closure isn't held
up because you missed an important detail. If you are not administering the procurement
yourself, be certain to ask your procurement department whether there are any special con-
ditions that you should know about so that your project team doesn't inadvertently delay
contract or project closure.


                  Close Project or Phase verifies and documents the project outcomes just
                  like the Close Procurements process. Keep in mind that not all projects are
                  performed under contract, so not all projects require Close Procurements.
                  However, all projects do require the Close Project or Phase process. Since
                  verification and documentation of the project outcomes occur in both of
                  these processes, projects that are performed under contract need to have
                  project results verified only one time.




Exam Spotlight

For the exam, remember that product verification, which determines whether all of
the work of the project was completed correctly according to the contract or other pro-
curement terms and satisfactory according to stakeholder expectations, is performed
during the Closing processes. Product documentation is verified and accepted during
the Verify Scope process. One more note: when projects end prematurely, the Verify
Scope process is where the level of detail concerning the amount of work completed
gets documented.




Close Procurements Inputs
The Close Procurements process has two inputs:
NN   Project management plan
NN   Procurement documentation
504        Chapter 12   n   Applying Professional Responsibility



   I've discussed both these inputs before, but you should know a few more things about
procurement documentation for this process. Procurement documentation includes the
contract itself (or other procurement form) and all the supporting documents that go along
with it. These might include things such as the WBS, the project schedule, change control
documents, technical documents, financial and payment records, quality control inspection
results, and so on. This information--along with all the other information gathered during
the project--is filed once the project is closed out so that anyone considering a future project
of similar scope can reference what was done.


Close Procurements Tools and Techniques
The Close Procurements process has three tools and techniques: procurement audits,
negotiated settlements, and records management system. The records management system
here serves the same function as the records management system I talked about in the
discussion of the Contract Administration process in Chapter 9. Procurement audits are
reviews of procurement processes to determine whether they are meeting the right needs
and are being performed correctly and according to standards. The PMBOK(R) Guide says
procurement audits are concerned with reviewing the procurement process, starting with
the Plan Procurements process through Administer Procurements
   The primary purpose of the procurement audit is to identify lessons learned during the
procurement process. Procurement audits examine the procurement process to determine
areas of improvement and to identify flawed processes or procedures. This allows you to
reuse the successful processes on other procurement items for this project, on future projects,
or elsewhere in the organization. It also alerts you to problems in the process so that you
don't repeat them.
   Procurement audits might be used by either the buyer or the vendor, or by both, as an
opportunity for improvement. Documenting the lessons learned--including the successes
and failures that occurred--allows you to improve other procurement processes currently
underway on this project or other projects. It also gives you the opportunity to improve the
process for future projects.
   Negotiated settlements occur when using an alternative dispute resolution (ADR)
technique due to disagreements about deliverables, payments, performance, and so
on. Reaching a negotiated settlement through the aid of ADR techniques is the most
favorable way to resolve the dispute.


Close Procurements Outputs
One of the purposes of the Close Procurements process is to provide formal notice to the
seller--usually in written form--that the procurement is complete. The output of Close
Procurements that deals with this is called closed procurements. This is a formal acceptance
and closure of the procurement. It's your responsibility as project manager to document the
formal acceptance of the procurement. Many times the provisions for formalizing accep-
tance and closing the procurement are spelled out in the procurement documents.
                                                   Closing Out the Procurements                505




   If you have a procurement department that handles contract administration, they will
expect you to inform them when the procurement is completed and will in turn follow the
formal procedures to let the seller know it's complete. However, you'll still note the pro-
curement completion in your copy of the project records.


                  Depending on the terms of the procurement, early termination (whether by
                  agreement, via default, or for cause) might result in additional charges to
                  the buyer. Be certain to note the reasons for early termination in your pro-
                  curement documentation.

   The other output of Close Procurements is organizational process updates. This includes
updating the procurement file, deliverables acceptance, and lessons learned. The procure-
ment file is simply a file of all the procurement records and supporting documents. These
records should be indexed for easy reference and included as part of the project files in the
Close Project or Phase process.



Exam Spotlight

The PMBOK(R) Guide does not state in which order these processes should be performed. In
practice, you will likely close out the procurement before closing the project and archiving
the project documents. However, in prior editions of the PMBOK(R) Guide, the Close Procure-
ments process (or its equivalent name in previous editions) was performed last.



   This process is your organization's way of formally accepting the product of the proj-
ect from the vendor and closing out the procurement. The deliverable acceptance portion
of the organizational process updates includes the formal written notice from the buyer
that the deliverables are acceptable and satisfactory or have been rejected. If the product
or service does not meet expectations, the vendor will need to correct the problems before
you issue a formal acceptance notice. Ideally, quality audits have been performed during
the course of the project, and the vendor was given the opportunity to make corrections
earlier in the process than the closing stage. It's not a good idea to wait until the very end
of the project and then spring all the problems and issues on the vendor at once. It's much
more efficient to discuss problems with your vendor as the project progresses because it
provides the opportunity for correction when the problems occur.
   Lessons learned include information and documentation about what worked well and
what didn't work well regarding the procurement processes. You can use this information
on future projects to improve performance and prevent inefficiencies.


Celebrate!
I think it's a good idea to hold a celebration at the conclusion of a successfully completed
project. The project team should celebrate their accomplishment, and you should officially
506        Chapter 12   n   Applying Professional Responsibility



recognize their efforts and thank them for their participation. Any number of ideas come to
mind here--a party, a trip to a ball game, pizza and sodas at lunchtime. This shouldn't be
the only time you've recognized your team, as discussed during the Team Development pro-
cess, but now is the time to officially close the project and thank your team members. Even
if no funds are available for a formal celebration, your heartfelt "thank you" can go a long
way with the members of your team. It's tough for team members to remain disgruntled,
and it's easier to revive them, when they know their efforts are appreciated.
    A celebration helps team members formally recognize the project end and brings closure
to the work they've done. It also encourages them to remember what they've learned and to
start thinking about how their experiences will benefit them and the organization during
the next project.


Releasing Project Team Members
Releasing project team members is not an official process. However, it should be noted that
at the conclusion of the project, you will release your project team members, and they will
go back to their functional managers or be assigned to a new project if you're working in a
matrix type organization.
   You will want to keep the functional managers or other project managers informed as
you get closer to project completion so that they have time to adequately plan for the return
of their employees. Start letting them know a few months ahead of time what the schedule
looks like and how soon they can plan on using their employees on new projects. This gives
the other managers the ability to start planning activities and scheduling activity dates.
   In all the excitement of wrapping up the project we shouldn't forget about our stakehold-
ers. Let's take a look at balancing the stakeholders' interests and assuring we've met their
expectations in the next section.



Balancing Stakeholders' Interests
at Project Close
I know we discussed Managing Stakeholder Expectations in Chapter 9. Since stakeholder
satisfaction is the key to project success and acceptance, I want to add some closing thoughts
on this topic and discuss a few new concepts.
   Projects are undertaken at the request of customers, project sponsors, executive managers,
and others. You'll recall that stakeholders are those who have something to gain or lose by
implementing the project. As such, stakeholders have different interests and needs, and one of
your jobs is to balance the needs of the stakeholders.
   Customer satisfaction is probably the primary goal you're striving for in any project. If
your customer is satisfied, it means you've met or exceeded their expectations and delivered
the product or service they were expecting. You've got a winning combination when the
customer is satisfied with the product, and you've also provided excellent customer service
                             Balancing Stakeholders' Interests at Project Close             507




along the way. Satisfied customers tell others about your success and will most likely use
your services in the future.
    One of the key ways to assure that customer satisfaction is achieved is to apply appropri-
ate project management techniques to your project. This includes taking the time to discover
all the requirements of the project and documenting them in the scope statement. You will
find that stakeholders who have a clear understanding of the requirements and have signed
off on them won't suffer from faulty memory and pull the ever-famous "I thought that was
included" technique. Take the time to define your requirements and get stakeholder sign-off.
You can't forget or fudge what's written down.
    In the following sections, I'll discuss how to juggle the competing needs of stakeholders,
how to handle the issues and problems with stakeholders, and finally, how to balance project
constraints against stakeholder needs.


Competing Needs
Stakeholders come from all areas of the organization and include your customer as well.
Because stakeholders do not all work in the same areas, they have competing needs and
interests. One stakeholder's concern on a typical IT project might take the form of system
security issues, while another stakeholder is concerned about ease of use. As the project
manager, you will have situations in which stakeholder needs compete with each other, and
you'll have to decide between them and set priorities. Sometimes you'll be able to accom-
modate their needs, and sometimes you'll have to choose. You want to examine the needs
against the project objectives and then use your negotiation and communication skills to
convince the stakeholders of priorities.
   Individual stakeholders might or might not have good working relationships with other
stakeholders. Because of this, office politics come into play. I advise you to stay away from
the politics game but get to know your stakeholders. You'll want to understand their business
processes and needs in order to make decisions about stakeholder requirements.


Dealing with Issues and Problems
Problems will occur on your project--it's part of the process. I've talked throughout this book
about how to deal with problems and risks and how to use conflict resolution techniques in
handling problems. Balancing stakeholder needs comes into play here also.
   You'll have to determine alternatives that will meet the key requirements of the project
without jeopardizing the competing needs of stakeholders. Once you're into the Executing
processes of the project and beyond, redefining scope becomes less and less of an option. So
your responsibility is to resolve issues and determine alternative solutions to problems as they
occur without changing the original objectives of the project. Enlist the help of your project
team members and stakeholders during these times. Use some of the techniques I talked about
in Chapter 6 such as brainstorming and the Delphi technique, to find solutions.
   You might also have difficulty trying to make stakeholders understand your decision or the
technical nature of a problem. Again, this is where communication skills help you immensely.
Take the case of a technical problem that's cropped up on your project. You should not expect
508        Chapter 12    n   Applying Professional Responsibility



your stakeholder to understand the technical aspects of rocket science if they work in the
finance department, for example. It's up to you to keep the explanation at a level they can
understand without loading them down with technical jargon and specifications. Keep your
explanations simple, yet don't skip important details they'll need to make decisions.


Balancing Constraints
Your toughest issues will almost always center on the triple constraints: time, cost, and
scope. Because of the nature of the constraints, one of these is the primary driver, and one is
the least important. Keep a close eye on stakeholders who want to switch the priority of the
constraints for their own purposes. Let's say the project sponsor already told you that time
is the primary constraint. Another stakeholder tells you that a requirement of the project
is being overlooked and quality is suffering. Be careful that the stakeholder isn't trying to
divert the primary constraint from time to quality to suit their own objectives.




The Geographic Information System

Ryan Loveland is a project manager for a multinational company. He's working on a com-
plex software project that involves rewriting the organization's mainframe accounting
system to become a browser-based system running on thin-client architecture. A major
problem with the existing system occurs when new accounts are entered into the system
or account information changes. The accounts are tied to geographic areas, which are
assigned to individual sales associates. Sales commissions are paid based on where the
account resides. To date, the process of determining which territory an account belongs
to has been done manually by looking at a map.

The project sponsor, Victor, requested a geographic information system (GIS) as part of
the requirements of this project. The hope is that errors will be eliminated and commis-
sions will be processed correctly. The sponsor is hoping that Ryan's internal team can
write the GIS that will tie to the accounting system. Let's drop in on Ryan and Victor's
conversation.

"I just don't understand," Victor says. "I can go onto that Internet site and plug in an address
and get directions and a map detailing those directions from my house to anywhere in the
country. It seems easy enough to me. Why can't your team write code like that?"

"It isn't that we can't write a program to do that. But there are several issues surrounding this
request that I'd like to explain to you. I'd like you to understand why I'm asking to purchase a
software product from an external vendor that will take care of these functions for us."

"Let's hear it," Victor says.
                                                        Professional Responsibility               509




"One of the first problems is that our sales force is multinational. It would take us
months just to obtain address information to populate the program. The second issue is
that our sales districts are not divided by any known boundaries. Most GIS systems work
off of latitude and longitude or geographic boundaries such as county borders or zip
code boundaries."

Victor interrupts, "Well, here's what we do. You give me a set of maps, I'll hand-draw in
the sales districts, and then you can scan it into the system."

"Unfortunately, it's not that easy. Our sales district boundaries are not consistent with
known boundaries, and our existing address database is not standardized. For example,
some addresses use the word Street spelled out; some use the abbreviation St. All of
the addresses need to be standardized, and then we have to figure out which addresses
belong to which territory.

"This process could take a great deal of time. There are vendors that specialize in GIS that
could have us operational in a matter of weeks. I've already checked on a couple of the top
vendors, and there aren't any problems interfacing with our new system. The time we'd
save in the long run far outweighs the cost associated with purchasing this system from a
vendor. And one last point: if I were to build this system internally, I'd have to take our top
programming team off of existing project priorities to put them on this. GIS is extremely
complicated. We're talking several months delay --if not a year or more--to get our pro-
grammers up to speed on GIS techniques and then write the programs."

Victor says, "If we're talking about a major delay in the schedule as you say, we can at least
look at what these vendors have to offer. It's important that this system is accurate as well,
and I think I hear you saying, `Why reinvent the wheel?' Let's have a look at the costs."



   We have officially closed out the project and hopefully satisfied our stakeholders' expec-
tations. We have also completed our study of all of the project management processes from
Initiating to Closing. But there's one more area you need to know about for the exam. We'll
look at it next.


Professional Responsibility
As a certified Project Management Professional, you are required to adhere to the PMI
Code of Ethics and Professional Conduct. You can find a copy of this code inside the
PMP Handbook.
   You should read and understand this code because you will be agreeing to adhere to its
terms as part of the certification process. The PMI Code of Ethics and Professional Conduct
outlines four areas of responsibility:
NN   Responsibility
NN   Respect
510         Chapter 12   n   Applying Professional Responsibility



NN    Fairness
NN    Honesty



Exam Spotlight

Each of these areas is described in the code, along with sections called "Aspirational
Standards" and "Mandatory Standards" for each one. We will not cover every standard in
this chapter, so I recommend you read them and understand them for the exam.



  You will find at least a few exam questions regarding professional responsibility on the
exam, so we'll look at each of these areas and a few others for good measure.


Responsibility
Responsibility is the act of making decisions that are for the good of the organization
rather than ourselves, admitting our mistakes, being responsible for the decisions we make
and the consequences that result, along with other actions. We'll look at several elements
that fall within the responsibility arena.

Ensuring Integrity
As a project manager, one of your professional responsibilities is to ensure integrity of the
project management process, the product, and your own personal conduct. I've spent the
majority of this book discussing how to achieve project management integrity by following
the project management processes.


                 A product that has integrity is one that is complete and sound or fit for use.



   Correctly applying the project management processes you've learned will ensure the
integrity of the product. The effective execution of the Planning, Executing, and Monitoring
and Controlling processes, including documenting scope, performing quality inspections,
measuring performance, and taking corrective actions, will ensure that a quality product is
produced that satisfies the requirements of the stakeholders (and the project plan). And as
you learned earlier, you will seek acceptance of the product from the stakeholders and cus-
tomer during the Closing process group.

Accepting Assignments
This topic, as well as many of the others discussed in these sections, cross two of the areas
noted in the PMI Code of Ethics and Professional Conduct--responsibility and honesty.
You should always honestly report your qualifications, your experience, and your past
                                                        Professional Responsibility            511




performance of services to potential employers, customers, PMI, and others. You should
not knowingly accept assignments that are beyond your capabilities or experience.
    Be honest about what you know and what you don't know as it relates to your experience.
For example, the Control Quality processes as described in the PMBOK(R) Guide are used
extensively in the manufacturing industry. However, the information technology field looks
at quality issues in different ways. If you're a project manager in the information technology
field, you've probably never used control charts and cause-and-effect diagramming tech-
niques. Don't lead others to believe that you have used techniques you haven't used or that
you have experience you don't have.
    Emphasize the knowledge you do have and how you've used it in your specific indus-
try, and don't try to fudge it with processes and techniques you've never used. Potential
clients and employers would much rather work with you and provide training where you
might need it than think they've got someone fully experienced with the project or indus-
try techniques needed for a project when they don't.
    If you're working on contract or you're self-employed, you have a responsibility to ensure
that the estimates you provide potential customers are accurate and truthful. Make certain
you clearly spell out what services you're providing and let the customer know the results
they can expect at the end of the project. Accurately represent yourself, your qualifications,
and your estimates in your advertising and in person.

Laws and Regulations Compliance
This might seem obvious, but as a professional, you're required to follow all applicable
laws and rules and regulations that apply to your industry, organization, or project. This
includes PMI organizational rules and policies as well. You should also follow any ethical
standards and principles that might govern your industry or the state or country in which
you're working. Remember that rules or regulations you're used to in the United States
might or might not apply to other countries and vice versa.

Confidential Information
Many project managers work for consulting firms where their services are contracted out to
organizations that need their expertise for particular projects. If you work in a situation like
this, you will likely come across information that is sensitive or confidential. Again, this might
seem obvious, but as part of the PMI Code of Ethics and Professional Conduct, you agree not
to disclose sensitive or confidential information or use it in any way for personal gain.
   Often when you work under contract, you'll be required to sign a nondisclosure agreement.
This agreement simply says that you will not share information regarding the project or the
organization with anyone--including the organization's competitors--or use the information
for your personal gain.
   However, you don't have to work on contract to come into contact with sensitive or private
information. You might work full-time for an organization or a government agency that deals
with information regarding its customer base or citizens. For example, if you work for a bank,
you might have access to personal account information. If you work for a government agency,
you might have access to personal tax records or other sensitive material. It would be highly
512        Chapter 12   n   Applying Professional Responsibility



unethical and maybe even illegal to look up the account information of individuals not asso-
ciated with the project at hand just to satisfy your own curiosity. In my organization, that is
grounds for dismissal.


                  Don't compromise your ethics or your organization's reputation by sharing
                  information that is confidential to the organization or would jeopardize an
                  individual's privacy.


Company Data
Although it might seem obvious that you should not use personal information or an organi-
zation's trade secrets for personal gain, sometimes the organization has a legitimate need to
share information with vendors, governmental agencies, or others. You need to understand
which vendors or organizations are allowed to see sensitive company data. In some cases,
you might even need to help determine which individuals can have access to the data. When
in doubt, ask.
    Here are some examples. Maybe the company you're working with has periodic mailings
it sends to its customer base. If one of your project activities includes finding a new vendor
to print the mailing labels, your organization might require the vendor to sign a nondis-
closure agreement to guard the contents of the customer lists. Discovering just who should
have access to this information might be tricky.
    Another example involves data on citizens that is maintained by the government. You
might think that because the data belongs to one agency of the government--say the Internal
Revenue Service--any other agency of the government can have access to it. This isn't the
case. Some agencies are refused access to the data even though they might have good reason
to use it. Others might have restricted access, depending on the data and the agency policy
regarding it. Don't assume that others should have access to data because it seems logical.
    Most organizations require vendors or other organizations to sign nondisclosure agree-
ments when the vendors or others will have access to sensitive company data. It's your
responsibility to ensure that the proper nondisclosure agreements are signed prior to releasing
the data. The procurement department often handles this function.

Intellectual Property
You are likely to come into contact with intellectual property during the course of your project
management career. Intellectual property includes items developed by an organization that
have commercial value but are not tangible and copyrighted material such as books, software,
and artistic works. It might also include ideas or processes that are patented. Or it might
involve an industrial process, business process, or manufacturing process that was developed
by the organization for a specific purpose.
   Intellectual property is owned by the business or person who created it. You might have to
pay royalties or ask for written permission to use the property. Intellectual property should
be treated just like sensitive or confidential data. It should not be used for personal gain or
shared with others who should not have access to it.
                                                         Professional Responsibility            513




Respect
Respect involves several areas as well, including the way we conduct ourselves, the way we
treat others, listening to other viewpoints, conducting ourselves in a professional manner,
and so on. We'll look at some of the elements of respect next.

Professional Demeanor
Acting in a professional manner is required of most everyone who works in the business
world. Although you are not responsible for the actions of others, you are responsible for
your own actions and reactions. Part of acting professionally involves controlling your-
self and your reactions in questionable situations. For example, a stakeholder or customer
might lash out at you but have no basis for their outburst. You can't control what they
said or did, but you can control how you respond. As a professional, your concern for the
project and the organization should take precedence over your concern for your own feel-
ings. Therefore, lashing out in return would be unprofessional. Maintain your professional
demeanor, and don't succumb to shouting matches or ego competitions with others.
   As project manager, you have a good deal of influence over your project team members.
One of the items on the agenda at the project team kickoff meeting should be a discussion
of where the team members can find a copy of organizational policies regarding conflict of
interest, cultural diversity, standards and regulations, and customer service and standards
of performance. Better yet, have copies with you that you can hand out at the meeting or
have available the addresses of website where they can find these documents.
   When you see project team members acting out of turn or with less-than-desirable customer
service attitudes, coach and influence those team members to conform to the standards of
conduct expected by you and your organization. Your team members represent you and the
project. As such, they should act professionally. It's your job as the project leader to ensure that
they do.

Reporting Ethics Violations
As a PMP, one of the responsibilities that falls into this category is your responsibility to
report violations of the PMP code of conduct. To maintain integrity of the profession, PMPs
must adhere to the code of conduct that makes all of us accountable to each other.
   When you know a violation has occurred and you've verified the facts, notify PMI. Part
of this process--and a requirement of the code of conduct--is that you'll verify that an ethics
violation has occurred (in other words, don't report bogus or unsubstantiated reports) and
will assist PMI in the investigation by supplying information, confirming facts and dates, and
so on. This includes anything listed as violations in the PMI Code of Ethics and Professional
Conduct, such as conflicts of interest, untruthful advertising, and false reporting of PMP
experience and credentials, appearances of impropriety, and so on. This one calls for some
judgment on your part, but it's mostly based on common sense. For example, a PMP in most
situations should not have a family member working on the project team reporting to them
(unless they own and run a family business).
514        Chapter 12   n   Applying Professional Responsibility



Cultural Awareness
More and more companies compete in the global marketplace. As a result, project man-
agers with multinational experience are increasingly in demand. This requires a height-
ened awareness of cultural influences and customary practices of the country where
they're temporarily residing.
   If you are used to working in the United States, for example, you know that the culture
tends to value accomplishments and individualism. U.S. citizens tend to be informal and
call each other by their first names, even if they've just met. In some European countries,
people tend to be more formal, using surnames instead of first names in a business setting,
even when they know each other well. Their communication style is more formal than in
the United States, and although they tend to value individualism, they also value history,
hierarchy, and loyalty. The Japanese, on the other hand, tend to communicate indirectly
and consider themselves part of a group, not as individuals. The Japanese value hard work
and success, as most of us do.
   One thing I've witnessed when working in foreign countries is U.S. citizens trying to
force their own culture or customs on those with whom they're visiting or working. That
isn't recommended, and it generally offends those you're trying to impress. Don't expect
others to conform to your way of doing things, especially when you're in their country. You
know the saying "When in Rome, do as the Romans do"? Although you might not want to
take that literally, the intent is good. For example, a quick kiss on both cheeks is a custom-
ary greeting in many countries. If that is the case and it's how you're greeted, respond with
the same.

Culture Shock
Working in a foreign country can bring about an experience called culture shock. When
you've spent years acting certain ways and expecting normal, everyday events to follow a
specific course of action, you might find yourself disoriented when things don't go as you
expected.
   One of the ways you can avoid culture shock is to read about the country you're going
to work in before getting there. The Internet is a great resource for information such as
this. Your local library is another place to research customs and acceptable practices in
foreign countries.
   When in doubt about a custom or what you should do in a given situation, ask your
hosts or a trusted contact from the company you'll be working with to help you. People are
people all over the world, and they love to talk about themselves and their culture. They're
also generally helpful, and they will respect you more for asking what's expected rather
than acting as though you know what to do when you clearly do not.

Diversity Training
Sometimes you might find yourself working with teams of people from different countries
or cultures. Some team members might be from one country and some from another. The
best way to ensure that cultural or ethical differences do not hinder your project is to pro-
vide training for all team members.
                                                      Professional Responsibility           515




   Team-building activities are ways to build mutual trust and respect and bond team mem-
bers with differing backgrounds. Choose activities that are inoffensive and ones in which
everyone can participate.
   Diversity training makes people aware of differences between cultures and ethnic groups,
and it helps them to gain respect and trust for those on their team. Provide training regarding
the project objectives and the company culture as well.


                  Remember that project objectives are why you are all together in the first
                  place. Keeping the team focused on the objectives cuts across cultural
                  boundaries and will help everyone concentrate on the project and tasks at
                  hand rather than each other.


Respecting Your Neighbors
Americans tend to run their lives at high speed and get right down to business when
working with vendors or customers. It isn't unusual for a businessperson to board a plane
in the morning, show up at the client site and take care of business, and hop another
flight to the next client site that night.
    You'll find that this is not that common in many other countries. People in other countries
will often expect you to take time to get to know them first, building an atmosphere of trust
and respect. Some cultures build relationships first and then proceed to business. And don't
expect to do that relationship building in a few hours. It could take several days, depend-
ing on the culture. They might even want you to meet their family and spend time getting to
know them. Resist the urge to get right down to business if that's not customary in the culture
because you'll likely spoil the deal or damage relationships past the point of repair.


                  Spend time building relationships with others. Once an atmosphere of
                  mutual trust and cooperation is established, all aspects of project planning
                  and management--including negotiating and problem solving--are much
                  easier to navigate.



Perceiving Experiences
All of us see the world through our own experiences. Your experiences are not someone
else's experiences, and therefore what you perceive about a situation might be very different
from what others believe. Keep this in mind when it appears that a misunderstanding has
occurred or that someone you're working with didn't respond as you expected. This is espe-
cially true when you're working with someone from another country. Always give others
the benefit of the doubt and ask for clarification if you think there is a problem. Put your
feelings in check temporarily, and remember that what you think the other person means is
not necessarily as it appears.
516        Chapter 12   n   Applying Professional Responsibility




Fairness
Fairness includes avoiding favoritism and discrimination against others, avoiding and
reporting conflict of interest situations, and maintaining impartiality in our decision making
process. We'll focus on conflict of interest in this section.

Conflict of Interest
The PMI Code of Ethics and Professional Conduct discusses your responsibility to report
to the stakeholders, customers, or others any actions or circumstances that could be con-
strued as a conflict of interest.
   A conflict of interest is when you put your personal interests above the interests of
the project or when you use your influence to cause others to make decisions in your
favor without regard for the project outcome. In other words, your personal interests
take precedence over your professional obligations, and you make decisions that
allow you to personally benefit regardless of the outcome of the project. Let's look
at a few examples.

Associations and Affiliations
Conflicts of interest might include your associations or affiliations. For example, perhaps
your brother-in-law owns his own construction company and you are the project manager
who has just published an RFP. Your brother-in-law bids on the project and ends up win-
ning the bid.
   If you sit on the decision committee and don't tell anyone about your association with
the winning bidder, that is clearly a conflict of interest. If you influence the bid decision
so that it goes to your brother-in-law, he benefits from your position--again, a conflict of
interest. You put your personal interests, or in this case the interests of your associations,
above the project outcome. Even if you did not influence the decision in any way, when oth-
ers on the project discover the winning bidder is your brother-in-law, they will assume a
conflict of interest occurred. This could jeopardize the awarding of the bid and your own
position as well.
   The correct thing to do in this case would be to, first, inform the project sponsor and the
decision committee that your brother-in-law intends to bid on the project. Second, refrain
from participating on the award decision committee so as not to unduly influence others in
favor of your brother-in-law. And last, if you've done all these things and your brother-in-
law still wins the bid, appoint someone else in your organization to administer the contract
and make the payments for the work performed by him. Also, make certain you document
the decisions you make regarding the activities performed by him and keep them with the
project files. The more documentation you have, the less likely someone can make a conflict
of interest accusation stick.

Vendor Gifts
Some professionals work in situations where they are not allowed to accept gifts in excess
of certain dollar amounts. This might be driven by company policy, the department
                                                     Professional Responsibility           517




manager's policy, and so on. I have worked in organization where it was considered a con-
flict of interest to accept anything from a vendor, including gifts (no matter how small),
meals, or even a cup of coffee. Vendors and suppliers often provide their customers and
potential customers with lunches, gifts, ballgame tickets, and the like. It's your responsi-
bility to know whether a policy exists that forbids you from accepting these gifts. It's also
your responsibility to inform the vendor if they've gone over the limit and you are unable
to accept the gift.
    The same situation can occur here as with the brother-in-law example earlier. If you
accept an expensive gift from a vendor and later award that vendor a contract or a piece
of the project work, it looks like and probably is a conflict of interest. This violates PMI
guidelines and doesn't look good for you personally either.


                 Using the "I didn't know there was a policy" reasoning probably won't
                 save you when there's a question of conflict of interest. Make it your busi-
                 ness to find out whether the organization has a conflict of interest policy
                 and understand exactly what it says. Get a copy, and keep it with your
                 files. Review it periodically. Put a note on your calendar every six months
                 to reread the policy to keep it fresh in your mind. This is a case where not
                 knowing what you don't know can hurt you.

   Don't accept gifts that might be construed as a conflict of interest. If your organiza-
tion does not have a policy regarding vendor gifts, set limits for yourself depending
on the situation, the history of gift acceptance by the organization in the past, and the
complexity of the project. It's always better to decline a gift you're unsure about than to
accept it and later lose your credibility, your reputation, or your PMP status because of
bad judgment.

Stakeholder Influence
Another potential area for conflict of interest comes from stakeholders. Stakeholders are
usually folks with a good deal of authority and an important position in the company.
Make certain you are not putting your own personal interests above the interests of the
project when you're dealing with powerful stakeholders. They might have the ability to pro-
mote you or reward you in other ways. That's not a bad thing, but if you let that get in the
way of the project or let a stakeholder twist your arm with promises like this, you're getting
mighty close to a conflict of interest. Always weigh your decisions with the objectives of the
project and the organization in mind--not your own personal gain.
   Keep in mind that you might not always be on the receiving end of the spectrum.
You should not offer inappropriate gifts or services or use confidential information you
have at your disposal to assist others because this can also be considered a conflict
of interest.

The Golf Trip

Amanda Lewis is a project manager for a network upgrade project for her organization.
This project will be outsourced to a vendor. Amanda will manage the vendor's work. She
also wrote the RFP and is a member of the selection committee.

The project consists of converting the organization's network from 100MB Ethernet to
Gigabit Ethernet. This requires replacing all of the routers and switches. Some of the
cabling in the buildings will need to be replaced as well. The RFP requires that the vendor
who wins the bid install all the new equipment and replace the network interface cards
in each of the servers with Gigabit Ethernet cards. The grand total for this project is esti-
mated at $1.2 million.

Steve James is a vendor with whom Amanda has worked in the past. Steve is very inter-
ested in winning this bid. He drops in on Amanda one day shortly after the RFP is posted.

"Amanda, it's good to see you," Steve says. "I was in the neighborhood and thought I'd
stop in to see how things are going."

"I'm great" Amanda replies. "I'll bet you're here to talk to me about that RFP. You know I
can't say anything until the whole process closes."

"You bet we bid on the project. I know you can't talk about the RFP, so I won't bring it up.
I wanted to chat with you about something else. My company is sending 15 lucky con-
testants and one friend each to Scottsdale, Arizona, for a `conference.' The conference
includes the use of the Scottsdale Golf Club (green fees paid, of course), and all the hotel
and meal expenses are on us for the length of the trip. I know Scottsdale is one of your
favorite places to golf, so I thought of you. What do you say?"

Amanda sits forward in her chair and looks at Steve for a minute. "That sounds fabulous,
and I do love Scottsdale. But you and I both know this isn't a conference. I wouldn't feel
right about accepting it."

"Come on, Amanda. Don't look a gift horse in the mouth. It is a conference. I'll be there
and so will the top brass from the company. We have some presentations and demonstra-
tions we'd like to show you while you're there, no obligation of course, and then you're
free to spend the rest of the time however you'd like."

"I appreciate the offer. Thanks for thinking of me, but no thanks. I'm on the selection
committee for the RFP, and it would be a conflict of interest if I attended this conference.
Besides, the value of the conference is over the $100 limit our company sets for vendor
gifts and meals," Amanda says.

"OK, we'll miss you. Maybe next time."
                                                        Professional Responsibility            519




Honesty
Honesty can include a lot of topics: reporting the truth regarding project status, being honest
about your own experience, not deceiving others, not making false statements, and so on.
  One of the aspects of honesty includes your truthfulness about your PMP application
and certification, your qualifications, and the continuing reports you provide to PMI to
maintain your certification. Let's look at a few others.

Personal Gain
Honesty involves not only information regarding your own background and experience,
but information regarding the project circumstances as well. For example, let's say you're a
project manager working on contract. Part of your compensation consists of a bonus based
on total project billing. Now let's suppose your project is finishing sooner than antici-
pated, and this means your personal profit will decrease by $1,500. Should you stretch the
work to meet the original contracted amount so that your personal bonus comes in at the
full amount even though your project team is finished? I think you know the answer is of
course not.
   Your personal gain should never be a consideration when billing a customer or working on
a project. Personal gain should never be a factor in any project decision. If the project finishes
sooner than planned, you should bill the customer according to the terms of the procurement
agreement. Compromising the project for the sake of your personal gain shows a lack of
integrity, which could ultimately cost you your PMP status and even your job.

Truthful Reporting
As a project manager, you are responsible for truthfully reporting all information in your
possession to stakeholders, customers, the project sponsor, and the public when required.
Always be up front regarding the project's progress.


                  Nothing good will come of telling stakeholders or customers that the
                  project is on track and everything looks great when in fact the project
                  is behind schedule or several unplanned risk events have occurred that
                  have thrown the project team a curveball. I've personally witnessed the
                  demise of the careers of project managers who chose this route.

   Tell the truth regarding project status, even when things don't look good. Stakeholders
will likely go to great lengths to help you solve problems or brainstorm solutions. Some-
times, though, the call needs to be made to kill the project. This decision is usually made by
the project sponsor or the stakeholders based on your recommendation and predictions of
future project activities. Don't skew the reporting to prevent stakeholders from making this
decision when it is the best solution based on the circumstances.
   Truthful reporting is required when working with the public as well. When working in
situations where the public is at risk, truthfully report the facts of the situation and what
steps you're taking to counteract or reduce the threats. I recommend you get approval from
520         Chapter 12   n   Applying Professional Responsibility



the organization regarding public announcements prior to reporting the facts. Many orga-
nizations have public relations departments that will handle this situation for you.


                  You probably remember something your mother always told you: Actions
                  speak louder than words. Always remember that you lead by example.
                  Your team members are watching. If you are driven by high personal ethics
                  and a strong desire for providing excellent customer service, those who
                  work for you will likely follow your lead.




Role Delineation Study
In addition to the areas covered in the PMI Code of Ethics and Professional Conduct, you
should be aware of four other focus areas that PMI discusses in its role delineation study.
This study was published in PMI's publication Project Management Professional (PMP (R))
Examination Specification. The four focus areas are as follows:
NN    Ensure Personal Integrity and Professionalism
NN    Contribute to the Project Management Knowledge Base
NN    Enhance Personal Professional Competence
NN    Promote Interaction Among Team Members & Other Stakeholders
   I've covered most of the concepts surrounding these focus areas throughout this chapter
with the exception of contributing to the project management knowledge base. We'll look
at that topic next.



Applying Professional Knowledge
Professional knowledge involves the knowledge of project management practices as well as
specific industry or technical knowledge required to complete an assignment.
   As a PMP, you should apply project management knowledge to all your projects.
Take the opportunity to educate others by keeping them up-to-date on project manage-
ment practices, training your team members to use the correct techniques, informing
stakeholders of the correct processes, and then sticking to those processes throughout
the course of the project. This isn't always easy, especially when the organization doesn't
have any formal processes in place. But once the stakeholders see the benefits of good
project management practices, they'll never go back to the "old" way of performing
their projects.
   One way to apply professional knowledge is to become and remain knowledgeable in
project management best practices techniques. I'll cover this topic next along with how to
become a PMI education provider and the importance of having industry knowledge.
                                              Applying Professional Knowledge              521




Project Management Knowledge
Project management is a growing field. Part of your responsibility as a PMP is to stay abreast
of project management practices, theories, and techniques. You can do this in many ways,
one of which includes joining a local PMI chapter. There are hundreds of local chapters
throughout the United States and in other countries as well. You can check the PMI website
(www.pmi.org) to find a chapter near you.
   Chapter meetings give you the opportunity to meet other project managers, find out what
techniques they're using, and seek advice regarding your project. Usually guest speakers
appear at each chapter meeting and share their experiences and tips. Their stories are always
interesting, and they give you the opportunity to learn from someone else's experiences and
avoid making wrong turns on your next project. You might have a few stories of your own
worth sharing with your local chapter. Volunteer to be a speaker at an upcoming meeting,
and let others learn from your experiences.
   One of the things you'll get when you join the PMI organization and pay your yearly
dues is its monthly magazine. This publication details real-life projects and the techniques
and issues project managers have to deal with on those projects. Reading the magazine is
a great way to learn new project management techniques or reinforce the information you
already know. You might discover how to apply some of the knowledge you've already
learned in more efficient ways as well.
   PMI offers educational courses through their local chapters and at the national level as
well. These are yet another way for you to learn about project management and meet others
in your field.


Education Providers
PMI has a program that allows you or your organization to become a Registered Education
Provider (REP). This enables you--once you're certified--to conduct PMI-sanctioned project
management training, seminars, and conferences. The best part is that your attendees are
awarded professional development units (PDUs) for attending the training or seminar. As a
PMP, and especially as an REP, you have a responsibility to the profession and to the PMI to
provide truthful information regarding the PMI certification process, the exam applications,
the PDU requirements, and so on. Keep up-to-date on the PMI's certification process by peri-
odically checking the website.


Industry Knowledge
Contributing and applying professional knowledge goes beyond project management
experience. You likely have specific industry or technical experience as well. Part of
applying your professional knowledge includes gaining knowledge of your particular
industry and keeping others informed of advances in these areas.
   Information technology has grown exponentially over the past several years. It used to
be that if you specialized in network operations, for example, it was possible to learn and
522        Chapter 12     n   Applying Professional Responsibility



become proficient in all things related to networks. Today that is no longer the case. Each
specialized area within information technology has grown to become a knowledge area in
and of itself. Many other fields have either always had individual specialties or just recently
experienced this phenomenon, including the medical field, bioengineering, manufacturing,
and pharmaceuticals, to name a few. You need to stay up-to-date regarding your industry
so that you can apply that knowledge effectively. Today's fast-paced advances can leave you
behind fairly quickly if you don't stay on top of things.
   I mentioned in the beginning of the book that as a project manager you are not required
to be a technical expert, and that still holds true. But it doesn't hurt to stay abreast of
industry trends and knowledge in your field and have a general understanding of the specif-
ics of your business. Again, you can join industry associations and take educational classes
to stay on top of breaking trends and technology in your industry.




Project Case Study: New Kitchen Heaven Retail Store

Dirk strolls into your office maintaining his formal and dignified manners as always and
then sits down in the chair beside your desk.

"I just want to congratulate you on a job well done," he says. "The grand opening was a
success, and the store had a better-than-expected week the first week. I'm impressed you
were able to pull this off and get the store opened prior to the Garden and Home Show.
That was the key to the great opening week."

"Thank you, Dirk. Lots of people put in a lot of hard work and extra hours to get this job
done. I'm glad you're happy with the results."

"I thought the banner with our logo, `Great Gadgets for People Interested in Great Food,'
was a wonderful touch."

"That was Jill's idea. She had some great ideas that made the festivities successful. As
you know, though," you continue, "we did have some problems on this project. Fortu-
nately, they weren't insurmountable, but I think we learned a thing or two during this
project that we can carry forward to other projects."

"Like what?" Dirk asks.

"We should have contracted with Gomez Construction sooner so that we didn't have to
pay overtime. We had a very generous budget, so the overtime expense didn't impact
this project, but it might impact the next one.

"And we came fairly close to having a hardware disaster on our hands. Next time, we
should order the equipment sooner, test it here at headquarters first, and then ship it out
to the site after we know everything is working correctly."
                                                  Applying Professional Knowledge                 523




"Good ideas. But that's old news. Now that this project is over, I'd like to get you started
on the next project. We're going to introduce cooking classes in all of our retail stores. The
focus is the home chef, and we might just call the classes the Home Chef Pro series. We'll
offer basic classes all the way to professional series classes if the project is a hit. We'll bring
in guest chefs from the local areas to give demos and teach some of the classes as well."

"I'm very interested in taking on this project and can't wait to get started. I'm thrilled that
you want me to head this up. But I do have a few things here to wrap up before I start
work on the new project," you reply.

Dirk says, "The project is over. The grand opening was a success. It's time to move on.
Let Jill take over now; the retail stores are her responsibility."

"Jill has taken over the day-to-day operations. However, I've got to finish collecting the
project information, close out the contract with Gomez, and make the final payment. Jake
verified that all the work was completed correctly and to his satisfaction. Then I need to
publish the formal acceptance notice to all of the stakeholders via email. I will also cre-
ate a document that outlines those things I told you earlier that we should remember and
reference during the next project; that document is called lessons learned. Then after all
those things are completed, all of the project records need to be indexed and archived. I
can have all that done by the end of the week and will be free starting Monday to work on
requirements gathering and the charter document for the new project."

"This is just like the planning process discussion we got into with the tree, the breakdown
structure thing, and all the planning, I suspect. I do have to admit all the planning paid off.
I'll give you until the end of the week to close out this project. Come see me Monday to
get started on Home Chef Pro."

Jill Overstreet thought you did such a great job of managing this project that she has offered
to buy you lunch at one of those upscale, white tablecloth-type French restaurants. The iced
teas have just been delivered, and you and Jill are chatting about business.

"I'm impressed with your project management skills. This store opening was the best on
record. And you really kept Dirk in line--I admire that. He can be headstrong, but you had
a way of convincing him what needed doing and then sticking to it."

"Thanks," you reply. "I've got several years of project management experience, so many of
those lessons learned on previous projects helped me out with this project. I enjoy project
management and read books and articles on the subject whenever I get the chance. It's nice
when you can learn from others' mistakes and avoid making them yourself."

Jill takes a long drink of tea. She glances at you over the top of her glass and pauses
before setting it down. "You know," Jill starts, "we almost didn't hire anyone for your
position. Dirk wanted to do away with the project management role altogether. He had a
real distaste for project management after our last project."

"Why is that?"
524           Chapter 12   n   Applying Professional Responsibility




"The last project manager got involved in a conflict of interest situation. She was work-
ing on a project that involved updating and remodeling all the existing stores. Things like
new fixtures, signs, shelving, display cases, and such were up for bid. And it was a very
sizable bid. Not only did she accept an all-expenses-paid weekend visit to a resort town
from one of the vendors bidding on the contract, she also revealed company secrets to
them, some of which leaked to our competitors."

Your mouth drops open. "I can't believe she would accept gifts like that from a vendor.
And revealing company secrets is even worse. Conflict of interest situations and not
protecting intellectual property violate the code of professional conduct that we agree to
adhere as certified PMPs. I can understand why Dirk didn't want to hire another project
manager. Behavior like that makes all project managers look bad."

"I'm glad you kept things above board and won Dirk back over. The project management
role is important to Kitchen Heaven, and I know your skills in this discipline are what
made this project such a success."

"Jill, not only would I never compromise my own integrity through a conflict of interest sit-
uation, I would report the situation and the vendor to the project sponsor and to the PMI as
an ethics violation. It's better to be honest and let the project sponsor or key stakeholders
know what's happening than to hide the situation or, even worse, compromise your own
integrity by getting involved in it in the first place. You have my word that I'll keep business
interests above my own personal interests. I'll report anything that even looks like it would
call my actions into question just to keep things honest and out in the open."

"That's good to hear," Jill replies. "Congratulations on your new assignment. Dirk and
I were discussing the new Home Chef Pro project yesterday. We're venturing into new
territory with this project, and I'm confident you'll do an excellent job heading it up. Dirk
made a good choice."

Understanding How This Applies
to Your Next Project
Closing out the project should always include a formal sign-off (from the project sponsor
and key stakeholders at a minimum) that the work of the project is acceptable and complete.
Also, you've probably experienced, as I have, stakeholders with short-term memory lapses.
For example, I'll get to the end of the project and find the stakeholder has a list of additional
requirements longer than their arm. Some of this goes back to assuring that requirements are
accurately defined during the Planning processes and that ongoing communication regard-
ing project status, along with feedback from the stakeholders, is occurring on a regular basis.
Another key here is making certain you are managing stakeholder expectations throughout the
project. You might indeed have identified all the requirements and accurately documented the
objective of the project. But if the stakeholder had expectations that weren't captured or that
took shape after the work of the project began, you could end up with a very unhappy stake-
holder on your hands and, potentially, a failed project. In my experience, stakeholder expecta-
tions tend to stray midway through the project. That's because they are beginning to see nearly
completed deliverables and new possibilities for the product begin to develop that they hadn't
thought of during the Planning stage. It's similar to buying a new house based on blueprints
and then going on that first walk-through when the framing is finished. It's during walk-
through that you think, "Gee, I thought that closet was bigger than this." Tune in to what
your stakeholders are saying and get at the basis of their questions (dig deep) so that there are
no hidden expectations and you're able to manage any new expectations that pop up.
   The professional responsibility section of this chapter can easily be boiled down to the
golden rule, "Do unto others as you would have them do unto you." I wish I could tell you
that everything I talked about here is practiced by all project managers everywhere. But you've
likely read, as I have, the endless stories in the news of this corporate exec or the other act-
ing in their own best interest rather than that of the organization. Project managers make the
news as well, especially when they're working on projects that involve public funds or charita-
ble organizations. In my humble opinion, ignoring the practices and advice in this chapter isn't
worth the damage it might cause to my organization, to the project, or to my career.
526         Chapter 12   n   Applying Professional Responsibility



    I'd also add that if your first thought on a new project is what a great resume builder it's
going to be for you and how you'll likely score that next big promotion after the project is
complete, you've started off on the wrong foot. Although I'm the first to admit big projects
(when they are executed well and satisfy the stakeholder expectations) are resume builders, it's
the wrong reason to take on a project. Consider your experience level and how and what you'll
be able to contribute to the project to make it a success. It's OK if the project is a stretch for
you--you can't grow your experience without taking on more complex projects as your career
progresses. But also be wise enough to know when you might be in over your head.
    There's no substitute for integrity and honesty when conducting your projects. Once
you've tarnished your integrity, whether intentional or not, it's almost impossible to regain
the trust of your stakeholders and management staff. Because of this, I'm never afraid of
telling anyone, "I don't know," but I always follow it up with, "But I'll find out." You're
a project manager, not a miracle worker. No one expects you to have all the answers any-
more than they expect you to perform every single task on the project.
    I've had the unfortunate experience of being instructed to lie about project status and
to purposely withhold project information from oversight boards. I spent a few sleepless
nights worrying about where I'd find my next job because I immediately disobeyed those
orders and reported the truth. I knew it would cost me my job. But I also knew it was better
for me to lose the job than to compromise my integrity. As it turned out, I found a new job
quickly. And in retrospect, if I had not left the position when I did, my reputation would
have taken a hit--not because of anything I had done but through association with the
people on the project who had compromised when they shouldn't have.
    I hope you've found this study guide helpful both for your studies for the PMP exam and
for your next project. Thank you for spending some time with me in the pages of this book.
I wish you the best of luck in your project management endeavors.



Summary
Project closure is the most often neglected process of all the project management processes.
The two processes in the Closing process group are Close Project or Phase and Close Pro-
curements. The four most important tasks of closure are as follows:
NN    Checking the work for completeness and accuracy
NN    Documenting formal acceptance
NN    Disseminating project closure information
NN    Archiving records and lessons learned
   Close Project or Phase involves checking that the work of the project was completed cor-
rectly and to the satisfaction of the stakeholders. Documenting formal acceptance of the
product of the project is an important aspect of project closure as well. This assures that
the stakeholder or customer is satisfied with the work and that it meets their needs.
   Projects come to an end in one of four ways: addition, starvation, integration, or extinction.
Addition is when projects evolve into their own business unit. Starvation happens because the
                                                                         Summary             527




project is starved of its resources. Integration occurs when resources are taken from the exist-
ing project and dispersed back into the organization or assigned to other projects. And extinc-
tion is the best end because the project was completed, accepted, and closed.
    Close Project or Phase is performed at the end of each phase of the project as well as at
the end of the project. Close Project or Phase involves documenting formal acceptance and
disseminating notice of acceptance to the stakeholders, customer, and others. All documen-
tation gathered during the project and collected during this process is archived and saved
for reference purposes on future projects.
    Close Procurements is concerned with settling the contract and completing the contract
according to its terms. Its primary outputs include the contract file and formal acceptance
and closure (both are components of the organizational process assets update).
    Lessons learned document the successes and failures of the project and of the procurement
processes. Many times lessons learned are not documented because staff members do not
want to assign their names to project errors or failures. You and your management team need
to work together to assure employees that lessons learned are not exercises used for disciplin-
ary purposes but benefit both the employee and the organization. Documenting what you've
learned from past experiences lets you carry this forward to new projects so that the same
errors are not repeated. It also allows you to incorporate new methods of performing activi-
ties that you learned on past projects.
    Project management professionals are responsible for reporting truthful information
about their PMP status and project management experience to prospective customers,
clients, and employers and to the PMI. As a project manager, you're responsible for the
integrity of the project management process and the product. In all situations, you are
responsible for your own personal integrity.
    Personal integrity means adhering to an ethical standard. As a PMP, you'll be required to
adhere to the PMI Code of Ethics and Professional Conduct established by the PMI. Part of
this code involves avoiding putting your own personal gain above the project objectives.
    As a professional, you should strive to maintain honesty in project reporting. You're
required to abide by laws, rules, and regulations regarding your industry and project man-
agement practices. You should also report any instances that might appear to be a conflict
of interest. It's always better to inform others of an apparent conflict than to have it discov-
ered by others and have your methods called into question after the fact.
    You will likely come across confidential information or intellectual property during your
project management experiences. Respect the use of this information and always verify
who might have permission to access the information and when disclosures are required.
    Stakeholders have competing needs and business issues and as such will sometimes cause
conflict on your project. You will be required to balance the needs and interests of the
stakeholders with the project objectives.
    Many project managers today are working in a global environment. It's important
to respect and understand the cultural differences that exist and not try to impose your
cultural beliefs on others. Culture shock is an experience that occurs when you find
yourself in a different cultural environment than you're familiar with. Training is a good
way to provide project team members with relationship management techniques regard-
ing cultural and ethnic differences.

Key Terms
We discussed two processes in this chapter that you need to understand for the exam.

Close Procurements                           Close Project or Phase

   Once again, you've learned some new key words in this chapter. PMI has worked hard
to develop and define standard project management terms that apply across industries.
Here are the terms you came across in this chapter:

addition                                  PMI Code of Ethics and Professional Conduct
conflict of interest                      procurement audits

Review Questions
1.    You are the project manager for a top-secret software project for an agency of the United
      States government. Your mission--should you choose to accept it--is to complete the
      project using internal resources. The reason is that finding contractors with top-secret
      clearances takes quite a bit of time, and waiting for clearances would jeopardize the imple-
      mentation date. Your programmers are 80 percent of the way through the programming
      and testing work when your agency appoints a new executive director. Slowly but surely
      your programmers are taken off this project and reassigned to the executive director's hot
      new project. Which of the following type of project ending is this?
      A. Starvation
      B.   Extinction
      C.   Addition
      D.   Integration

         made a decision about which vendor you're going to choose.
      B.   Thank them, and decline. You know this could be considered personal gain, which
           could call your integrity into question.
      C.   Thank them, and accept. You don't believe there is a conflict of interest or a personal
           integrity issue.

13. You are a project manager working on contract with a company in a foreign country. At the
    project kickoff meeting, you are given an expensive-looking gift. The person who presented
    this to you said that it is customary in their country to give their business partners gifts.
    What is the most appropriate response?
    A. Thank them, and decline. Explain that this is considered personal gain, which is unac-
       ceptable in your country.
    B.   Thank them, and accept. You don't believe there is a conflict of interest or an integrity
         issue at stake.
    C.   Thank them, and decline. Explain that this is considered a conflict of interest, which is
         unacceptable in your country.
    D.   Thank them, and accept since you know that it would be considered offensive to
         decline the gift in their culture. Immediately report the acceptance of the gift to the
         appropriate parties at your company so that your actions are not called into question
         later.

14. Life seems to be going very well for your close friend, a fellow PMP. She has taken a trip
    to France, bought a new car, and stocked her wine cellar with a couple dozen expensive
    bottles of wine, all within the last six months. After a few cocktails one evening, she tells
    you her secret. The vendor she's working with on the $4 billion project she's managing has
    given her all of these items as gifts. Which scenario is the most appropriate? (Choose the
    best answer.)
    A. You tell your friend these gifts probably aren't appropriate and leave it at that.
    B.   You and your friend have a long conversation about the gifts, and she decides to return
         them (with the exception of the trip) and not accept any more gifts in the future.
    C.   You're happy for your friend and say nothing.
    D.   Your friend doesn't see a problem with accepting these gifts at all. You know this is a
         conflict of interest situation and should be reported as an ethical violation.

17. You are a contract project manager working with the State of Bliss. Your latest project
    involves rewriting the Department of Revenue's income tax system. One of the key stake-
    holders is a huge movie buff, and she has the power to promote you into a better position
    at the conclusion of this project. She has discovered that one of her favorite superstars lives
    in the State of Bliss and therefore must file income tax returns in that state. She asks you to
    look up the account of this movie star. What is the most appropriate response?
      A. Report her to the management team.
      B.   Refuse to comply with the request, citing conflict of interest and violation of confiden-
           tial company data.
      C.   Look up the information she has requested. Since the data is considered part of the
           project, there is no conflict of interest.
      D.   You believe that tax records are public information, so you comply with the request.

18. You are a contract project manager working with the State of Bliss. Your latest project
    involves rewriting the Department of Revenue's income tax system. As project manager,
    you have taken all the appropriate actions regarding confidentiality of data. One of the key
    stakeholders is a huge movie buff, and she has the power to promote you into a better posi-
    tion at the conclusion of this project. She's reviewing some report data that just happens to
    include confidential information regarding one of her favorite movie superstars. What is the
    most appropriate response?
      A. Report her to the management team.
      B.   Request that she immediately return the information, citing conflict of interest and
           violation of confidential company data.
      C.   Do nothing, because she has the proper level of access rights to the data and this infor-
           mation showed up unintentionally.
      D.   Request that she immediately return the information until you can confirm that she
           has the proper level of access rights to the data.

19. You are a project manager with several years of experience in project management. You've

20. You are a project manager for a software manufacturing firm. The project you've just fin-
    ished created a new software product that is expected to become a number-one seller. All
    prerelease of software is handled through the marketing department. A friend of yours is
    a certified software instructor. They have asked you for a copy of the software prior to the
    beta release so they can get familiar with it. What is the most appropriate response?
    A. Decline the request because the software is the intellectual property of the company.
    B.   Ask them to sign a nondisclosure agreement before releasing a copy of the software.
    C.   Decline the request since you stand to gain from this transaction by receiving free
         training.
    D.   Since your friend is certified to teach your company's brand of software, provide them
         with a copy of the software.

Answers to Review Questions
1.    D. Integration occurs when resources, equipment, or property are reassigned or redeployed
      back to the organization or to another project.

2.    A. Starvation occurs because the project no longer receives the resources needed to
      continue. Resources could include people, equipment, money, and the like.

3.    A. Extinction is the best type of project end because it means the project was completed
      successfully and accepted by the sponsor or customer.

4.    C. The project manager is responsible for documenting the formal acceptance of the work of
      the contract. This should be done during Close Procurements when projects are performed
      under contract or during Close Project or Phase if no work was performed under contract.
      In cases where part of the work was performed under contract and part with in-house staff,
      formal acceptance should occur in both of these processes.

5.    A. Procurement audits are used to review the procurement process and identify and
      document any lessons learned during the procurement process for future reference.

6.    A. Lessons learned document the experiences, successes, and failures that occurred during
      this project for future reference. There isn't enough information in the question to deter-
      mine whether B or D is correct. C is not correct because the project was completed.

7.    A. According to the PMBOK(R) Guide, the procurement audit examines the procurement
      processes from Plan Procurements through Administer Procurements.

8.    A. You are not responsible for the personal integrity of others, but as project manager you
      do have influence over others, such as your project team members.

9.    C. Integrity means you'll honestly report project outcomes and status. Your personal gain
      should not be placed above the satisfaction of the customer.

10. D. The best answer to this problem is to develop alternative solutions to address the design
    error. Reducing technical requirements might be an alternative solution, but it's not one
    you'd implement without looking at all the alternatives. Ignoring the error and going
    forward with production will result in an unsatisfactory product for the customer.

11. A. A luncheon date could be considered a conflict of interest prior to awarding a contract
    to a vendor. Consider what a competitor of this vendor would think if they spotted you
    having lunch together.

12. B. The best response to this situation is to thank the vendor and decline based on the fact
    that this could be considered personal gain on your part. Option D might seem correct, but
    remember, you're not responsible for the integrity of others. And it's often common business
    practice for vendors to offer gifts to potential customers.

13. D. The best response in this case is to accept the gift because it would cause great offense
    to the other party if you were to decline. Report the gift and the circumstances as soon as
    possible to the appropriate parties at your company.

14. D. This is a conflict of interest situation, and you should report it as a violation of the
    PMI Code of Ethics and Professional Conduct.

15. A. Documenting the requirements and meeting them is one of the key things you can do
    to ensure customer satisfaction. The requirements describe what the customer is looking
    for, and the final product is compared against them to determine whether all of the require-
    ments were met.

16. A. The most correct response is to first provide training to your team members to teach
    them how to respect and work with others from different cultures. Co-location might not
    be possible when you're working with team members from two different countries. Team-
    building exercises are a good idea as well but are not your first course of action.

17. B. The situation presented here requires you to put the interest of the company and the
    confidentiality of the data above your own personal interests or those of your stakeholders.
    D is not the most correct response because it says you believe the information is public. This
    implies you haven't verified whether the data is private or public. Until you know, treat the
    data as confidential. In this case, the information is confidential and should be shared only
    with those who have a valid reason for using it.

18. C. As project manager, it's your responsibility to make sure the people you will be sharing
    data with have the proper permissions to see the data; this question indicated that you did
    that. In this case, D is not correct because it implies that you did not verify ahead of time that
    the stakeholder had the proper level of approvals to use the data.

19. D. Culture shock is the disoriented feeling that people might experience when working in a
    foreign country.

20. A. The most appropriate response is to deny the request. Software is considered intellectual
    property and should not be used for personal gain or given to others without prior consent
    from the organization. This question states that the release of the beta software is handled
    through the marketing department, so you should not give your friend a copy of the soft-
    ware outside of this process.

                            What You'll Find on the CD
The following sections are arranged by category and summarize the software and
other goodies you'll find on the CD. If you need help with installing the items provided
on the CD, refer to the installation instructions in the "Using the CD" section of this
appendix.
   Some programs on the CD might fall into one of these categories:
    Audio files are MP3 files that can be played on your computer, on music listeners such
    as iTunes, or burned to a CD and played on an MP3 player.
    Shareware programs are fully functional, free, trial versions of copyrighted programs.
    If you like particular programs, register with their authors for a nominal fee and
    receive licenses, enhanced versions, and technical support.
    Freeware programs are free, copyrighted games, applications, and utilities. You can
    copy them to as many computers as you like--for free--but they offer no technical
    support.
    GNU software is governed by its own license, which is included inside the folder of
    the GNU software. There are no restrictions on distribution of GNU software. See the
    GNU license at the root of the CD for more details.
    Trial, demo, or evaluation versions of software are usually limited either by time or by
    functionality (such as not letting you save a project after you create it).

Troubleshooting
Wiley has attempted to provide programs that work on most computers with the minimum
system requirements. Alas, your computer may differ, and some programs may not work
properly for some reason.
   The two likeliest problems are that you don't have enough memory (RAM) for the pro-
grams you want to use or you have other programs running that are affecting installation
or running of a program. If you get an error message such as "Not enough memory" or
"Setup cannot continue," try one or more of the following suggestions and then try using
the software again:
      Turn off any antivirus software running on your computer. Installation programs
      sometimes mimic virus activity and may make your computer incorrectly believe that
      it's being infected by a virus.
      Close all running programs. The more programs you have running, the less memory is
      available to other programs. Installation programs typically update files and programs;
      so if you keep other programs running, installation may not work properly.
      Have your local computer store add more RAM to your computer. This is, admittedly,
      a drastic and somewhat expensive step. However, adding more memory can really help
      the speed of your computer and allow more programs to run at the same time.

ect. When the project is external to the organization, the buyer typically writes the SOW. The
SOW should consider the business need for the project, the product scope description, and the
organization's strategic plan.

statistical samplingT his means making a sample number of parts from the whole popu-
lation and examining them to determine whether they fall within the variances outlined in
the quality management plan. Statistical sampling is a tool and technique of the Perform
Quality Control process.

status review meetingsStatus meetings are a component of the Report Performance
process. The purpose of status meetings is to provide updated information regarding the
progress of the project. They are not show-and-tell meetings.

steering committeeThis is a group of high-level managers or executives in the organization
who manage project prioritization and various project decisions. The steering committee typi-
cally represents functional areas or departments within the organization.

successor activitiesT hese are activities that follow predecessor activities.



T
tailoringThis means determining which processes and process groups should be performed
for the project. The project manager and project team should take into consideration the size
and complexity of the project and the various inputs and outputs of each of the processes when
determining which ones to perform. It's generally accepted that performing all five process
groups is good practice for any project.

team buildingTeam building activities are a tool and technique of the Develop Project
Team process. They involve getting a diverse group of people to work together in the most
efficient and effective manner possible.

technical performance measurementsThese measurements are usually determined during
trend analysis (which is used with the run chart tool and technique of the Perform Quality
Control process) to compare the technical accomplishments of project milestones completed
to the technical milestones defined in the project Planning processes.

Theory XThis is a motivational management theory that proposes that most people do not
like work and will try to steer clear of it. It postulates that people have little to no ambition,
need constant supervision, and won't actually perform the duties of their job unless threatened.
592        Glossary



Theory YThis is a motivational management theory that proposes that people are interested
in performing their best given the right motivation and proper expectations.

three-point estimatesT hree-point estimates are a tool and technique of the Estimate
Activity Durations process used to determine activity estimates. The three estimates are
the most likely estimate, an optimistic estimate, and a pessimistic estimate.

time and materials (T&M) contractT his is a type of contract that is a cross between the
fixed-price contract and the cost-reimbursable contract. Preset unit rates are agreed to at
contract signing, but costs are charged to the buyer as they're incurred.

time-phased budgetT he cost performance baseline is the authorized time-phased budget
for the project. Time-phased budgets disburse funds at different periods throughout the life
of the project.

to-complete performance index (TCPI) The to-complete performance index (TCPI) is the
projected performance level the remaining work of the project must meet in order to satisfy a
management goal such as meeting BAC or EAC.

tolerable resultsT hese are quality measurements that fall within a specified range.
Tolerable results are a concern of the Perform Quality Control process. These are also
known as tolerances.

top-down estimatingSee analogous estimating.

tornado diagramThis is a diagramming method for sensitivity analysis data. The variables
with the greatest effect on the project are displayed as horizontal bars at the top of the graph
and decrease in impact as they progress down through the graph. This gives a quick overview
of how much the project can be affected by uncertainty in the various elements and which
risks have the greatest impact on the project.

total floatT his is the amount of time the earliest start of a task can be delayed without
delaying the ending of the project.

Total Quality Management (TQM)W. Edwards Deming is considered the founder of TQM.
This quality theory states that the process is the problem, not people. TQM stipulates that
quality must be managed in and that quality improvement should be a continuous process,
not a one-time task.

trainingT his tool and technique of the Develop Project Team process improves the com-
petencies of the project team members.

transferTransference is a strategy for negative risks or threats, which is a tool and tech-
nique of the Plan Risk Responses process. This strategy transfers the consequences of a risk
to a third party. Insurance is an example of transference.

triggersT hese are risk symptoms that imply a risk event is about to occur. Triggers can
also be referred to as symptoms or warning signs.
                                                                           Glossary         593




V
variance at completion (VAC)T his is an earned value analysis technique that calculates
the difference between the budget at completion (BAC) and the estimate at completion
(EAC): VAC = BAC - EAC.

Verify ScopeT his process formalizes the acceptance of the project scope and is primarily
concerned with the acceptance of work results.

virtual teamsVirtual teams are teams that don't necessarily work in the same location
but all share the goals of the project and have a role on the project. This type of team allows
the inclusion of resources from different geographic locations, those who work different
hours or shifts from the other team members, those with mobility limitations, and so on.



W
weighted scoring modelSee weighting system.

weighting systemT his is a way to rank and score vendor proposals or project proposals.
Weighting systems assign numerical weights to evaluation criteria and then multiply this by
the weight of each criteria factor to come up with total scores for each project or vendor.
These systems keep personal biases to a minimum.

withdrawalT his conflict resolution technique occurs when one of the parties gets up and
leaves and refuses to discuss the conflict. This never results in resolution.

work authorization systemsWork authorization systems clarify and initiate the work of
each work package or activity. This is a formal procedure that authorizes work to begin in the
correct sequence and at the right time. Work authorization systems are usually written proce-
dures defined by the organization. These are used in the Executing processes of the project.

work performance informationWork performance information is an input to the Adminis-
ter Procurements process. Work performance information is used to monitor work results and
examine the vendor's deliverables and compares their work results against the project man-
agement plan. It also makes certain activities are performed correctly and in sequence.

workaroundT his is an unplanned response to a risk event that was unknown and
unidentified or an unplanned response to a risk that was previously accepted. Workaround
plans are an element of the Monitor and Control Risks process.



Z
zero defectsZero defects is a quality theory attributed to Philip B. Crosby. Zero defects
means perform the task right the first time to avoid engaging in rework, loss of productivity,
and increased costs.
