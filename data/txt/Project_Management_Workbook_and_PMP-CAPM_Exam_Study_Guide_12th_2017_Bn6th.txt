Preface




The purpose of this workbook is to provide students of project management with
meaningful exercises and homework problems that will enhance the knowledge of
the subjects included in the textbook Project Management: A Systems Approach to
Planning, Scheduling, and Controlling (12th edition) by Harold Kerzner, Ph.D.
   The material in the workbook is directly related to the subjects and knowledge areas
associated with the Project Management Institute's Project Management Professional
(PMP)(R) exam and the Certified Associate Project Manager (CAPM)(R) exam and will
provide a sound framework for exam preparation.
   The workbook is designed to engage the student in activities that will provide prac-
tical application of the concepts of project management as described in the textbook
and in the PMI(R) Guide to the Project Management Body of Knowledge (PMBOK(R)
Guide), Sixth Edition.
   Included in the workbook are topic-specific glossaries, common project terms and acro-
nyms, knowledge area summaries, examples of typical project management mathematic
formulas and equations, and key project terms, and logic problems. The workbook also
includes PMP(R) exam study tips, situational exercises, and sample questions designed to
simulate the type of questions that may be encountered on the actual PMP(R) exam.
   We hope you will find this book enjoyable and educational.

Project Management
Overview



Project management has been practiced for hundreds, actually thousands, of years.
Long before computers and sophisticated scheduling techniques became available, the
ancestors of today's professional project managers had to determine resource require-
ments, arrange for material and equipment, and strive to meet a schedule imposed by,
in many cases, a powerful leadership entity. They knew that any construction type of
undertaking or project endeavor, large or small, required a goal, a set of objectives, a
plan, coordination with many functional groups, the management of resources, and the
ability to manage change. Additionally, it became very clear that every project requires
strong and adaptive leadership. Project managers, by nature of the position, will work
with and manage teams and a variety of stakeholders, some of whom can be expected
to be a real a challenge to work with. Considering this factor, project managers must
continue to develop the skills necessary to balance the expectations and demands of
each stakeholder while managing project deliverables. This is driving a change in the
role of "project manager" to that of "project leader." Today's project managers see
themselves as managing part of a business as well as managing a project.
   As the world's business and financial environment has changed and evolved, organiza-
tional leaders have recognized the value of project management and the competent project
manager. Project management has also become a key factor in strategic planning.
   Today, project management is practiced, to some extent, in almost every organiza-
tion from small businesses to Fortune 500 companies to local and state governments.
Some organizations follow a very formal methodology, and many organizations have
adopted a "management by projects" approach. Some organizations have established
project management offices (PMOs) to assist them in developing standards for manag-
ing projects and processes and to ensure that these standards are followed. Studies have
indicated that the application of project management results in significantly higher
levels of performance than those of organizations that do not have a project manage-
ment discipline. As the project management discipline is adapted into the culture of an
organization, the benefits of project management are quickly realized. These benefits
include more efficient scheduling of resources, improved and more reliable estimating,
higher quality of deliverables, early identification of project risks, issues and problems,

                                                                                                                    Applying project management is certainly a factor in achieving organizational

                                                                                                                 Projects are defined as temporary endeavors with specific start and end dates, and they

support functional lines and activities or organizational changes.
Program A group of related projects managed in a coordinated way to obtain benefits
and control not available from managing them separately. Generally, projects in a pro-
gram are interrelated.
Project A temporary endeavor undertaken to create a unique product, service, or
result. A project has a specific objective, defined start and end dates, and funding limi-
tations. Projects consume resources including human (labor), equipment and materials.
A project is generally multifunctional or cross-organizational in nature. Projects gener-
ally produce one or more deliverables and deliverables can be tangible or intangible.
Project-driven organization Also known as "project based." In these organizations
all work is characterized through projects. Projects are arranged as separate cost cen-
ters and the sum of all project work is associated with organizational goals and strate-
gic objectives.
Project management Application of knowledge skills, tools, and techniques to proj-
ect activities to meet project requirements. Project management involves the utilization
of the five major process groups: initiation, project planning, executing, monitoring
and controlling, and closing. These processes are applied to each project phase and
enable the project manager to effectively integrate the 10 project management knowl-
edge areas described in the Guide to the Project Management Body of Knowledge
(PMBOK(R) Guide) developed by the Project Management Institute, or PMI.
Project sponsor Generally, described as the person or organization that authorizes the
project and provides the financial resources required to plan, execute, and deliver the
project objectives. The sponsor may be joined by other stakeholders to provide com-
mittee sponsorship and/or guidance for this project or for a portfolio of projects.
Triple constraint This term has been used for many years to describe the effects of
changes to the competing project demands of time (schedule), cost (budget), and scope
(specifications) usually depicted as a triangle. Specifically, the triple constraint empha-
sized that a change to any one side or element of the triangle will have an effect on
the other elements. The triple constraint was also considered to display the key factors
that define project success. The triple constraint has been modified and is now part of
a list of several competing demands, including scope, time, cost, quality, risk, safety,
business value, and resources. Project success is defined using several success factors,
including quality, business value added, and fitness for use.

    d. No functional input into the planning phase
    e. No one person responsible for the total project
    f. Poor control of design changes
    g. Poor control of customer changes
    h. Poor understanding of the project manager's job
    i. Wrong person assigned as project manager
    j. No integrated planning and control
    k. Company resources are overcommitted
    l. Unrealistic planning and scheduling
    m. No project cost accounting ability
    n. Conflicting project priorities

    tive is a critical factor and can mean the difference between project success and
    failure. What actions can be taken by the project manager to ensure that a strong
    and supportive relationship exists between the project manager and the project
    sponsor?

    the project manager is often faced with several obstacles that must be overcome to
    achieve the desired performance and business benefits. Describe at least three of
    these obstacles and provide suggestions for overcoming them.

Information System (PMIS), and the expert judgment of the functional managers to
complete the project and perform all final administrative procedures. The processes
required to obtain formal acceptance and completion of project files for reference as
historical information.
Configuration management Process that will ensure that configuration changes
(changes to features, functions, dimensions, physical characteristics) are managed and
approved to prevent or reduce the risks of additional cost and scope changes, or other
impacts to the project.
Constraints and assumptions Constraints are the limitations the project manager
and team must operate within. Examples: predetermined schedule and budget, limited
resources. Assumptions in the project management context are items that, for planning
purposes can be believed to be true, real, or certain. Assumptions are not grounded in
fact and should be verified.
Enterprise environmental factors Internal and external factors may influence the
project outcome and must be considered by the project manager and team during proj-
ect planning and implementation such as the organizational culture, industry standards,
resource availability and capability, risk tolerance, and political environment.
Historical records Data and information gathered during project planning and execu-
tion and recorded for legal purposes, references, and lessons learned.
Integrated change control The 10 knowledge areas are managed in an integrated
manner with an understanding that a change in one area can impact any or all of
the other knowledge areas. Example: A change in the scope of a project may impact
the schedule and budget. A change in quality requirements may impact the budget
and the human resource requirements. It is recommended that the project team con-
sider the impact of the change before implementing the change by using a predefined
change control process. A change control process generally has three major objec-
tives: Obtain approval for the change, determine if change has occurred through
comparison of the baseline with actual results, and determine when and how to intro-
duce the change to minimize the impact on ongoing operations.
Monitor and control project work Agreed upon processes for managing work per-
formance, managing change requests, utilization of earned value techniques, identify-
ing corrective and preventive actions.
Organizational process assets Standard policies and procedures established by an
organization and expected to be followed such as safety procedures, quality assur-
ance reviews, and project health checks. Process assets may also include available
planning templates, financial controls, change control procedures, and risk manage-
ment processes.
Organizational strategies How an organization will achieve its goals and objectives.
A formal project management process may be an organizational strategy. Consider
how your project impacts or supports your organization's objectives. Make sure you
can link your project to the organizational goals.

12. The functional manager provides the resources and technical expertise. Challenges
    include different priorities among project managers and projects, managing the
    demands of multiple project managers, limited resources, unreasonable time
    frames, and internal politics.
13. Establish expectations at the start of the project. Include communications require-
    ments, escalation procedures, planning processes and methodology, and clear
    objectives.
14. There are many possible answers and solutions to the causes. This exercise is
    intended to emphasize the importance of identifying potential project problems
    and encourage proactive thinking and action. Any combination of causes may
    affect the outcome of the project.
15. The project manager is considered an integrator and coordinator for all major
    project activities. The project manager is held accountable for successful
    completion of the project. The project manager is a liaison between the proj-
    ect team and the project sponsor or executive steering committee. Other roles
    include team builder, conflict manager, coach, mentor, facilitator, leader, and
    motivator.
16. The project manager can develop better relationships with the functional manag-
    ers through listening and understanding the priorities of the functional manag-
    ers, their work environment, and issues associated with the functional manager's
    position.
17. Establish expectations clearly and intentionally between the project manager and
    the project sponsor or executive.
18. A project is a temporary endeavor undertaken to create a unique product, service,
    or result.
19. Technical project management, leadership, and strategic and business management
    skills.
20. Project complexity: Ensure that a detailed project scope statement is prepared.
    Organizational structure: Develop working relationships with the leaders/manag-
    ers of the organizations you expect to engage in your project activities. Changing
    requirements: Establish a well-defined change process and ensure that it is
    observed. Other obstacles include changing technology, internal politics, and orga-
    nizational silos.
21.      Integrating the activities necessary to develop a project plan
         Integrating the activities necessary to execute the plan
         Integrating the activities necessary to make changes to the plan
22. Provide behind-the-scenes assistance to project personnel for projects both internal
    to the company and external.

Project Management
Growth: Concepts and
Definitions



This chapter focuses on the general evolution of project management from the 1940s
through today's business environment. Formal project management has its roots in the
1940s, particularly in the area of military and complex weapons systems. These projects
consumed enormous amounts of resources, and today we refer to very large implementa-
tions as "mega" projects. In the past four decades, project management has grown from a
means to achieve successful completion of small, intermediate, and large complex proj-
ects or endeavors (sometimes referred to as engagements) to a key element in strategic
planning. The use of powerful technology-based tools, enterprise-wide methodologies,
and processes to control activities and manage people and resources have become an
accepted part of business management. The project life cycle, systems thinking, and the
influence of project management processes on an organization's critical success factors
have had a significant impact on overall organizational performance.

    Glossary of Terms

General systems management When applied to organizational structure, it is a manage-
ment technique designed to cross many organizational disciplines. For example: finance,
manufacturing, engineering, and marketing. Systems management refers to the need to
understand how each component of a system affects the operation of the entire system.
Mature project management The implementation of a standard methodology and
accompanying processes that creates a high probability of repeated successes. Maturity
in this context refers to a "culture" of project management where project processes are
embedded in normal business practices.
Product scope The features and functions that characterize the final project deliv-
erable. This includes dimensions, physical characteristics, and the complexity of the
product. Product scope is often displayed using a PBS, product breakdown structure.
Program A group of related projects managed in a coordinated way to obtain ben-
efits and control that is not available from managing them individually. Programs

                                                                                          21

2. As project management evolved, it became apparent to many executives that a for-
   mal project management process might not provide benefits significant enough to
   justify the expense associated with developing a formal methodology. In many orga-
   nizations, project management was considered as overhead. The driving forces of
   rapid technology changes, the increasing complexity of projects, and the increased
   demand for resources with specialized knowledge all contributed to the need for an
   effective project management methodology. How can a project management method-
   ology assist in managing and resolving issues related to these driving forces? What
   benefits are obtained through the use of a project management methodology? Should
   some flexibility be given to the project manager in the use of the methodology? What
   other driving forces might influence the decisions associated with establishing a proj-
   ect management methodology in an organization?

   achievement of success. For each obstacle listed, explain how a properly and effec-
   tively implemented project management methodology can overcome the obstacle.

                                 Knowledge Note
Project success depends on setting objectives, establishing plans, orga-
nizing resources, staffing the team appropriately, establishing controls, and
motivating the team. In addition, an understanding of the business value
expected to be achieved at project completion will impact the percep-
tion of project success. Remember the importance of addressing the many
competing demands in the project environment that may challenge the
ability to achieve success.

6. The utilization of project management within an organization will vary depending
   on the type of business the organization is involved in. An organization may be
   project-driven, use a hybrid approach that combines elements of project manage-
   ment with operations, or be non-project-driven when projects are few and are gen-
   erally used for internal process and operations improvements and changes. Review
   the list of characteristics that follows and select the appropriate industry classifica-
   tion for each (project-driven, hybrid, or non-project-driven).
   Characteristic                                                   Classification
   a. Project manager has P&L responsibility
   b. Primarily production driven but with many projects
   c. Emphasis on new product development
   d. Income comes from projects
   e. Long life cycle products
   f. Large brick walls (functional structure)
   g. Multiple career paths
   h. Marketing-oriented
   i. Short product life cycles
   j. Project management is a recognized profession
   k. Very few projects
   l. Need for rapid development process
   m. Profitability from production

7. To complete a project successfully a project manager is generally held accountable
   for a specific set of tasks, activities, and behaviors. Place a check next to each item
   that is typically associated with a project manager's role during the project life cycle.
   Set objectives
   Estimate activity costs
   Organize resources
   Estimate activity duration
   Establish plans
   Motivate personnel
   Provide staffing
   Define how tasks will be done
   Issue directives
   Control each project task
   Remain flexible
   Establish project controls

8. Few projects are completed without making decisions about trade-offs. This means
   that occasionally priorities will change, depending on project performance and

10. Quantitative and qualitative failure. Occasionally projects become troubled and
    sometimes fail. There are several contributing factors to project failure. Some fac-
    tors are quantitative and are directly associated with metrics and procedures will
    other are less tangible and qualitative. Review each of the following items and
    identify which items are considered quantitative and which are considered qualita-
    tive failures:
    Quantitative = 1 Qualitative = 2

    Ineffective planning
    Poor motivation
    Poor productivity
    Ineffective scheduling
    Ineffective estimating
    Poor morale
    Project objectives changing or not defined clearly
    Poor human relations
    Lack of control processes
    Lack of employee involvement and commitment
    No functional management commitment
    Conflicting priorities

 Important Terms to Remember
Interpersonal skills Interpersonal relationships are key elements to the success of any
project. Project managers must utilize effective communication, the ability to influence
project teams and functional groups to "get things done," leadership, motivation, con-
flict management, negotiation, and problem solving to manage teams and achieve proj-
ect objectives.
The project environment The project manager must maintain an awareness of the
cultural and social environment, the international and political environment, and the
physical environment when planning and implementing projects. These include such
factors as education, ethnicity, economics, demographics, religion, time zone differ-
ences, regional holidays, and the physical surrounding that may affect how the project
is managed. These elements are associated with the domain of project management
known as "professional responsibility." Professional responsibility is embedded in
the work activities and the role of the project manager. (Note: Professional and social
responsibility were previously defined by the PMI as the sixth domain that project
managers are held accountable for. The current domains are Initiating, Planning,
Executing, Monitoring and Controlling, and Closing.)
Progressive elaboration Proceeding in steps and adding more detail as the project
moves forward.
Phases and project life cycles We divide projects into phases to provide better man-
agement control. Project life cycles generally define what technical work will be done
in each phase, when a deliverable is required, who will be involved in each phase, and
how each phase will be controlled. The project life cycle may also be used to define
how a phase and the associated deliverables will be approved.
Cost and staffing At the start of a project cost and staffing are generally low. As the
project progresses, the cost and the required staff will increase through each progressive
phase as a result of the increase in the number of activities. Work activities will peak dur-
ing the intermediate phases, and then drop off rapidly as the project reaches closure.
Risk and uncertainty Generally, risk and uncertainty are considered to be at the great-
est level during the start of the project but the certainty of project success progressively

Organizational Structures



There are many factors that influence decision makers regarding the type of organi-
zational structure that would be most appropriate for their specific business purpose.
These factors include the strategic objectives of the organization, management span of
control, specialization capabilities, physical locations, and the path for management
escalations and approvals. The organizational structure and how departments, business
units, human resources, functional responsibilities, and job assignments are arranged,
will affect the project planning process and will influence how project communication
will be conducted. The authority of the project manager is also directly associated with
the type of structure selected by executive decision makers. An understanding of orga-
nizational structure is essential for project managers to successfully negotiate with, and
influence the stakeholders who control the functional entities, including operations,
where project resources may be obtained.
   Organizational structures vary by company and create unique challenges for the proj-
ect manager. The business environment has gone well beyond the familiar Functional,
Matrix, and Projectized structures. Project managers are now working within multi-
divisional organizations with no project management centralization and where replica-
tion of functions may exist. Many organizations are largely virtual, employ the use of
Project Management Offices (PMOs) or are a composite or hybrid type of structure in
which project responsibility and authority levels are mixed and sometimes ambiguous.
The project manager must therefore develop and continually enhance a set of key com-
petencies as described in the PMI(R) Talent Triangle, which includes Technical Project
Management, Leadership, and Strategic and Business Management


    Glossary of Terms

Accountability To be answerable for the satisfactory completion of a specific assign-
ment. The project manager is typically held "accountable" for project success (or fail-
ure), but sometimes accountability is shared with the functional managers that provide
the resources.
Authority The power granted to individuals (possibly by their positions) that enables
them to make decisions. This is also referred to as legitimate or formal power.

                                   Remember
Project success in a matrix structure is more likely to be achieved if there is
a good working relationship between the project manager and functional
managers. Strong coordination and effective communication between the
functional groups is also essential. This will help to ensure that project
goals and objectives are understood at the functional and project level.
The project manager works within the organizational culture and attempts
to create the integrative environment and cross-organizational relation-
ships that will drive project success.

   directive.
   Remember that projects are divided into phases for control purposes and the number
   of phases depend on the control needs of the organization and the key stakeholders.
   Each phase of a project is initiated, planned, executed, monitored and controlled,
   and closed.

   Basic factors that influence the selection of a project organizational
   form:
1. Project size and complexity
2. Project length (duration)
3. Experience with project management organization and methodologies
4. Philosophy and visibility of upper-level management
5. Project location
6. Available resources
7. The unique aspects about the project (the deliverables, new technologies, visibility,
   type of resources to be used, experience of the project manager, stakeholder needs
   and expectations, impact of the project on organizational objectives)


     Answers to Questions and Exercises

1. Advantages: Specific manager, budgeting and cost control are easier to manage,
   effective control of technical issues and expertise, flexibility in the use of people
   resources, communications channels are well established, control over personnel,
   continuity of policies and procedures.
      Disadvantages: No specific responsibility for a project, coordination is difficult,
   decisions are based on politics and the influence of the strongest functional group,
   response to customer issues may be slow, tendency toward functional loyalty
   instead of project loyalty, communication through levels is slow and may become
   distorted.
2. Projectized or pure project. The project manager has the greatest level of author-
   ity and influence over the team. The team is a dedicated resource to the project
   with no other priorities. The project team performance reviews are linked to proj-
   ect success.
3. Functional: 1, 2, 8, 9, 13
    Weak matrix: 3, 7
    Balanced matrix: 5
    Strong matrix: 6
    Projectized: 4, 10, 11, 12, 14

10. Defining enterprise environmental factors and organizational process assets, estab-
    lishing mutually agreed upon rule and procedures, utilizing a standardized plan-
    ning process, establishing a hierarchal referral or escalation process.
11. Flexibility in the use of resources is limited. Resources cannot be easily transferred
    to other projects and may result in additional cost to the organization. Resources
    are often held on projects longer than necessary resulting in lost opportunities.
    Motivating the project team may be challenging because projects are considered
    temporary and project employees that are reassigned from functional positions will
    be concerned about job security and future job assignments within their functional
    groups.
12. Power struggles, different priorities causing conflicts, shifting people between
    projects causing delays, reduced ability to gain specialized skills.

    of project personnel.

       lessons learned
    b. Controlling: Requires compliance to specific governance frameworks
    c. Directive: Takes control of projects and manages projects directly
15. Technical project management: The knowledge of tool and techniques associated
    with planning, scheduling, managing costs and risks, and other traditional and
    agile approaches to managing projects.
       Strategic and business management skills: The ability to see the high-level strat-
    egy, mission, goals, and objectives of the organization. Understanding business
    risks, financial implications, and cost-benefit analysis
       Leadership skills: Ability to guide, motivate and direct teams. Building trust,
    seeking consensus, persuading, developing teams.

Organizing and Staffing the
Project Office and Team



Project management is not a one-person operation; it requires a group of individu-
als, part time and/or full time, dedicated to the achievement of a specific goal. Project
management includes:
   A project manager
   Assistant project managers if necessary
   A project (home) office
   A project team
   Achieving the objectives of a project and ensuring customer satisfaction are the
main goals of the project manager. This requires a project team that is knowledge-
able, has the necessary skill set, is fully committed to the project, and is managed by a
project manager who possesses effective managerial, organizational, communication,
and leadership skills. Staffing the project with the appropriate team members is often
a challenge due to organizational policies, organizational structure, and availability of
resources. During the staffing process, the project manager generally attempts to obtain
the most highly qualified and capable team members from the various functional or
technical support groups. These resources are in high demand and may not be avail-
able for the required project time frame, and the project manager must often accept
team member who are defined as "competent performers." These team members will
typically need additional training and may require a higher level of direct supervision,
coaching, and mentoring. Organizing the project team by establishing a project orga-
nization chart will facilitate the communications between team members and clearly
identify roles, responsibilities, and linkages between project team members. It also
provides a basis for escalation and defines the project's decision chain of command.

reporting relationships with the specific project environment. Detail depends on project
complexity and size of the project team.
Project role This is the label or specific function assigned to a project team member or
stakeholder. It describes the portion of a project that will be completed, or the function
that will be performed, by the individual. Roles and responsibilities of project team
members are often established by developing a Responsibility Assignment Matrix.
Project team The personnel assigned to the project, including the project manager,
functional managers, and in some cases the project sponsor and customer.
Responsibility Assignment Matrix A Responsibility Assignment Matrix (RAM)
uses the Work Breakdown Structure (WBS) and the organizational structure to link
project deliverables to the person assigned as responsible for their successful comple-
tion. The RAM provides a picture of the key stakeholders involved in the project and
clearly shows who is responsible for each major deliverable. Another common form
of a responsibility assignment matrix is the RACI chart: Responsible, Accountable,
Consult, and Inform.
Staffing management plan This subset of the project management plan describes
when and how human resource requirements will be met. The staffing management
plan is developed based on the specific needs of the project. The plan includes pro-
cesses for acquisition of team members, a timetable for obtaining or recruiting team
members, the allocation of work among the resources, and the release criteria. Training
requirements, recognition and reward procedures, safety requirements, and compliance
requirements are also generally included in the staffing management plan. The plan
also addresses the impact of the project staffing process on the organization.

   Resources reluctant to accept project
   assignment due to temporary nature of
   projects (start and end dates).
   Performance appraisals remain
   responsibility of functional manager.
   Resources are assigned to multiple projects
   and you cannot get them to commit
   sufficient time to your project.
   Resources prefer to perform some of
   the work according to their own way of
   doing things rather than according to the
   project plan.
   Certain "prima donna" resources prefer to
   work by themselves rather than in a group.
   Resources want their functional managers
   to bless their work before submitting it to
   the project manager.

                              Age is often confused with work maturity, ability, and

 Chapter Five 



Management Functions



General management functions such as planning, organizing, delegating, and admin-
istration are closely related to and, in many cases, overlap with the roles and respon-
sibilities of the project manager. It is important for the project manager to fully
understand the connection between his or her role as the key integrator for planning
and effective management of the project team, while maintaining an awareness of
organization and project priorities. To be successful, project managers must monitor
and assess the total project environment. This includes the cultural and social environ-
ment, the international and political environment, and the physical environment. This
understanding, combined with general management skills, interpersonal skills, and
the appropriate application of project management skills, tools, and techniques, will
establish a foundation for project success. Specifically, the success of the project man-
ager depends on a balance between leadership and managerial skills. It is essential for
the project manager to develop an understanding of the team's physiological needs,
emotional needs, and motivational needs and to be flexible depending on the behaviors
displayed when people perform in groups and in teams.


                                     Remember
An understanding of the social, cultural, political, and international factors
that may affect a project and the project stakeholders is necessary in
today's global project environment and is directly related to a project
manager's professional and social responsibility.

Upward communication Primarily associated with information of interest to
high-level or executive management for assessing overall project performance.
This type of communication includes status of milestones, dashboards, major proj-

to provide project status or feedback about production or customer satisfaction
issues when a major issue arises. See also Downward communication; Lateral
communication.


In addition to the glossary terms, you should also familiarize yourself with
the following authors and contributors to the study and practice of manag-
ing people. These are referenced later in this chapter.

   There are numerous references and books about human behav-
ior, leadership, and management effectiveness. The contributors listed
have been traditionally included in PMP(R) study programs. As the project
environment evolves and social and business values change, it will be
necessary to review new theories and modifications of existing human

                         Theory X, Theory Y, and Theory Z
Understanding the effect of managerial styles on a project team is
extremely important. The style of management and the motivational tech-
niques used can significantly impact project team performance. Project
managers may exhibit many styles of management throughout the
project life cycle. The Theory X manager believes significant supervision
is required. The Theory Y manager believes workers can perform unsuper-
vised. Theory Z refers to a collective decision-making environment.



 The X, Y, and Z Factors
Theory X and Theory Y are theories about human motivation created and developed by
Douglas McGregor in the 1960s and have been used in the study of human resource man-
agement, organizational behavior, and organizational development. They describe two very
different attitudes about employees and workers regarding the willingness to complete
assignments. McGregor felt that companies followed either one approach or the other.
   Theory Z focuses on increasing employee loyalty to the company by providing a job
for life with a strong focus on the well-being of the employee, both on and off the job.
According to Dr. William Ouchi, its leading proponent, Theory Z management tends to
promote stable employment, high productivity, and high employee morale and satisfaction.

        True
        False
9. Maslow postulated that once a need is satisfied, it loses its motivational importance
   and is replaced by a different need.
        True
        False

 Herzberg's Motivator Hygiene Theory
Frederick Herzberg viewed motivation from a different perspective than Maslow. He
believed that certain factors, if present, can result in dissatisfaction among employ-
ees; these are referred to as hygiene factors. The work environment is associated with
hygiene factors, but the existence of a good work environment does not necessarily
result in a motivated work force. In addition to a pleasant work environment, the man-
ager must include motivating factors that will encourage employees or project teams to
expand their potential and increase their interest in achieving project objectives.
10. Review the following list of factors and place them in the appropriate columns as
    either a hygiene factor or a motivator.
     Compensation (pay)
     Sense of responsibility
     Opportunity for advancement
     Level of supervision
     Opportunity for personal growth
     Peer relationships
     Company policies and administrative procedures
     Challenging work
     Reward and recognition
     Working conditions
     Variety in the work
     A more autonomous environment

14. Project managers are frequently required to obtain performance results and achieve
    project objectives by influencing others to perform activities that they would not
    normally become involved in; therefore an understanding of interpersonal influ-
    ences and types of power is critical for a project manager to be successful.
       Match each definition with the correct type of interpersonal influence (legitimate
    or formal power, reward power, penalty power, expert power, or referent power).

    Definition                                                      Type of influence
    a. A person has the authority or is enabled to offer salary
       increases, promotions, bonuses, and future work assignments.
    b. Officially empowered by rank or position in the
       organization (also known as position power).
    c. A person has strong ties to another person of much greater
       authority and influence.
    d. Ability to coerce people through actions that are perceived
       as resulting in unpleasant or undesirable results; use of
       disciplinary actions or the threat of disciplinary action.
    e. Ability to influence others through special knowledge,
       experience, or demonstrated ability.

18. Leadership. Project managers are expected to manage the project by integrat-
    ing all of the components of the project, communicating information, negotiating
    for resources, and maintaining control of overall project performance. For many
    project managers this means working with a team of people that may not report
    directly to the project manager. To accomplish the objectives of the project, the
    project manager must be perceived by the project team as a strong leader. This
    includes the development and communication of clear and complete project as
    well as individual expectations.


                                   Remember
Project leadership is the ability to get things done well through others. It
is the ability to attract followers by providing a clear destination, inspiring
high performance, and motivating team members to succeed. The effec-
tive leader attracts people through sincerity and commitment and then
motivates the team to perform at a level higher than each team member
believed he or she was capable of.

Many project managers experience barriers that impede communications or distort
information. These barriers can disrupt project plans, create conflict, and ultimately
affect the outcome of the project. It is the responsibility of the project manager to cre-
ate an environment in which project communications requirements have been aligned
properly with the stakeholders involved. Many barriers can be overcome or prevented
by clearly stating objectives, establishing roles and responsibilities, and identifying the
specific requirements of the stakeholders involved in the project.


                                     Remember

Typical communications barriers
  Sender credibility
  Personality and interests
  Attitude and emotion
  Position or rank
  Existing relationships
  Selective listening
  Lack of feedback
  Evaluative tendency
  Assumptions about the sender

   Listening is one of the most important factors in effective communication.

Communications barriers are likely to be encountered during the project life cycle. Project
managers must maintain an awareness of potential barriers and develop methods to
prevent them or resolve them to minimize the potential negative impact on the project.
Examples include language, time zones, culture, politics, leadership style, gender, and age.
   Every meeting should be considered to be a project. Meetings should be planned
appropriately to minimize unproductive time and should always include an agenda.
Avoid unnecessary meetings and establish meeting guidelines to ensure greatest pro-
ductivity and accomplishment of meeting objectives. Project managers assume both
leadership and managerial roles during project planning and implementation.


Managerial Styles
There are many theories about how and why managers behave the way they do. As
you study it is important to be able to explain the differences between McGregor's
Theory X and Theory Y and Ouchi's Theory Z. Theory X implies distrust of the
workers and employees, Theory Y promotes a trusting and participative environ-
ment, and Theory Z focuses on the well-being of employees and the larger goals of
an organization.
   It is also important to become familiar with two specific theories about motivation.
   Maslow focused on the Hierarchy of Needs: physiological needs, safety, social
needs, esteem, and self-actualization.
   Herzberg focused on hygiene factors and motivating factors. Hygiene factors
include work environment, level of supervision, and compensation. Motivating factors
include the chance for advancement, rewards, challenging work, and bonuses.
   Another factor associated with the management of people is the perception of
power and how people influence others. There are five basic types of power: (1) reward
power, (2) penalty power, (3) expert power, (4) formal/legitimate power, and (5) refer-
ent power.
   Other terms that are associated with resource management and the management of
people include:
   Responsibility Assignment Matrix (RAM). The RAM is a table or matrix that is used
   to assign responsibility for completion of tasks identified in the work breakdown
   structure with specific stakeholders or project team members.
   Enterprise Environmental Factors. These are inputs to many project management
   processes and will influence how plans are developed and how decisions are made.
   Examples of EEFs are organizational culture, geographic distribution, competencies
   of resources, and marketplace conditions.                         Additional tips and prac-
   Organizational Process Assets. These are policies, proce-         tice items for the PMP(R)
   dures, checklists, and other artifacts developed by an organiza-  exam are included in each

   Examples are HR policies and procedures, safety policies, tem-    "PMP(R) and CAPM(R) Exam

Communications
Management



Project communications management includes the processes designed to ensure that
project stakeholders receive the information needed to make decisions, support project
activities, initiate changes, and remain updated about project performance and work
progress. The project communications plan is a subsidiary to the project management
plan and defines how information will be gathered, who will receive information, and
how information will be controlled. The three main processes in communications
management are: plan communications management, manage communications, and
monitor communications.
   Project communication is focused on the effective exchange of information and may
be accomplished in written form, verbally, through gestures, tone of voice, and body
language. Communication can also be conducted in a formal structured environment
using documentation and specific procedures, or through informal channels such as
social media.
   It is clear and has been proven through years of lessons learned that proper commu-
nication is vital to the success of a project. Typical definitions of effective communica-
tion include:
   An exchange of information
   An act or instance of transmitting information
   A verbal or written message
   A technique for expressing ideas effectively
   A process by which meanings are exchanged between individuals through a com-
   mon system of symbols
   Key communications topics include:
   The communications plan
   Communications methods
   The sender-receiver model

                  Rules and actions for meeting management

 All meetings should have an agenda.
 Meetings should have specific time limitations.
 Ensure that the purpose of the meeting has been clearly communicated.
 Prepare meeting participants in advance by sending meeting documents
 in advance.
 Ensure that invitations are sent to the appropriate people.
 Focus on interests, not positions.
 Be prepared and show up early (especially if you are the meeting
 organizer).
 Stick to the schedule.
 Conclude meetings with a clear statement of next steps.


   Project management quick note: A common cry among project managers is "I
have to implement plans I didn't design, but if the project fails, I'm responsible." This
can be a serious situation for a project manager. Whenever possible, become involved
in planning decisions. Explain your concerns using factual information. Develop your
ability to influence others. Communicate status frequently and engage the sponsor and
decision makers early when problems develop.
 3. Project managers may communicate using different methods. The type of message,
    the urgency of delivery, and the type of audience are all factors in determining the
    method of communication. Review the situations in the first column below and
    identify the appropriate communication method for each (interactive, push com-
    munication, or pull communication).

    Situation                                               Communication method
    a. An argument is developing and could create a
       serious project delay.
    b. Updated meeting minutes to be sent to the
       project team
    c. Updates to lessons learned repository
    d. Urgent situation requiring immediate response
    e. A press release updating key stakeholders about
       project status
    f. Memo to project team members about a change
       in policy
    g. All-employee notice about a town hall meeting

   Listening actively will result in greater engagement of team members
and stakeholders.
   Meetings should always have a PALpurpose, agenda, and limitation
(a scheduled time to end).
   Become aware of politics and power struggles within the organization.
   The formula for calculating the number of channels of communication
within a team is N (N - 1) / 2 where N = the number of people in the team.
This formula assists in determining the complexity of the communications
network within a team and illustrates the number of potential interfaces
where communications breakdown may occur.


 7. You are managing a team of 10 people. How many channels of communications
    exist?
8. Problems are often encountered during project planning and implementation. What
   is the first step in the problem-solving process?

3. Monitor communications: ensuring that stakeholders receive the appropriate infor-
   mation throughout the project life cycle.
  Communication is accomplished through written, spoken, formal, and informal
methods, and through gestures and body language. The 5 Cs of communication will
guide the project manager and enhance the delivery of the message.
  Communications may be tailored based on the following considerations:
   Stakeholders internal and external to the organization
   Physical location of the team and stakeholders
   Communications technology available
   Knowledge management: availability of repositories and access to data
   Enterprise environmental factors and organizational process assets are key inputs to
the plan communications management process.
   The number of channels of communication in a team is calculated by the formula
N (N - 1) / 2.
   The basic sender-receiver model describes the process by which a sender delivers
a message to the receiver. The message is encoded, noise factors must be managed,
the message is decoded, and a feedback process is used to ensure communication is
successful.
   Interpersonal skills will significantly affect the communication process. Style of
communication, political awareness, and cultural awareness will improve the ability to
engage stakeholders and team members.
   Manage meetings effectively. Make sure meetings have an agenda, have a good
   reason to be scheduled, include the right people, and start
   and end on time.

Conflicts



Conflict is defined in simple terms as:
   A struggle for power, property, or position
   Strong disagreement between people or groups that often results in angry argument
   A difference that prevents agreement
   Conflicts can be expected to be encountered in most, if not all, phases of a project
life cycle. They may occur at any level of management, between functional groups, and
among any of the project stakeholders. Conflicts often arise when discussing resource
requirements, developing schedules, estimating activity durations, negotiating con-
tract terms, and determining levels of product or deliverable quality. Project managers
often assume the role of conflict manager in addition to many other roles and may be
required to respond to and resolve a wide range of issues that have developed between
project personnel or between other stakeholders. The ability to execute this role effec-
tively is critically important in achieving successful project completion.
   The ability to manage conflict requires an understanding of why conflicts occur, the
sources of the conflict, and the specific needs of the stakeholders involved. In many
cases conflict begins with poorly defined objectives and unclear roles and responsibili-
ties. Another major root cause of conflict is poor communication. Many conflicts can
be prevented and others reduced in intensity if the parties involved focus on the very
basic concepts of effective communication.


                                     Remember
Project Objectives. To avoid conflict, project objectives should be based
on the following criteria: specific, not overly complex, measurable, tangi-
ble, verifiable, realistic, attainable, established within resource constraints,
and consistent with organizational plans, policies, and procedures. These
criteria are often summed up using the acronym SMART--specific, measur-
able, attainable, realistic, and time-based. Team members who have been

Smoothing does not necessarily resolve a conflict but may provide a short period of
calmness. Smoothing encourages dialogue and is used to make people feel comfort-
able by saying, "We've agreed on two points thus far, and we can certainly find some
agreement on the remaining three points." Smoothing actually tries to "smooth out" the
emotional arena where conflicts take place such that people are willing to remain at the
bargaining table.
Values Values are beliefs or principles we consider to be very important. Serious
conflicts arise when people hold incompatible values or when values are not clear.
Conflicts also arise when one party refuses to accept the fact that the other party holds
something as a value rather than a preference. Values may include such items as timeli-
ness, teamwork, quality, safety, respect, integrity, trust, truthfulness, courage.
Withdrawing Avoiding or stepping away from a conflict and taking time to rethink
one's position. Withdrawal does not necessarily mean that the conflict no longer exists.

 Importance of Objectives in Conflict Management
The specific objectives of the project must be communicated to all stakeholders. Failure to
provide clearly defined objectives will result in different interpretations at all levels of man-
agement and across all organizations involved in the project. Key points about conflict:
   Conflict is not always negative. It can lead to positive outcomes when effectively
   managed.
   Well-managed conflict may result in improved personal performance, the genera-
   tion of innovative ideas, higher levels of performance, and significant organizational
   growth.
   Conflict often results in a change from the normal or routine thinking process
   and can generate new ways for solving problems and increased creative thinking.
   Conflict may result in a change in managerial approach to a more participative style
   that encourages idea generation and collaboration through techniques such as brain-
   storming, mind mapping, and simply listening to new ideas.

10. Explain how conflict may be beneficial to a project team or an organization as a whole.




                                      Remember
Many executives feel that the best method for minimizing and resolving con-
flicts is to establish very specific priorities. This will work most effectively when
priorities are not changed frequently and when only a "reasonable" number of
priorities are established.


11. The connection between the organizational goals and project priorities is estab-
    lished by the project manager and the:
    a. Project team
    b. Customer
    c. Sponsor
    d. Stockholders
12. During the project life cycle, a project team will go through several stages of team
    development. As the project life cycle progresses, the level of conflict generally
    decreases in intensity. In some cases the conflict intensity resulting from person-
    ality clashes can increase significantly to the point where it becomes a sensitive
    issue. Likewise, issues such as cost changes, schedule changes, or failure to deliver
    qualified resources when promised can also cause increased levels of conflict as
    the project progresses. The project manager must address these challenges through
    leadership and facilitation. Considering the progressive changes in the relationship
    of team members, name the five stages of team development as described in the
    Tuckman model and explain how conflict intensity changes in each phase.

 Conflict Management in Practice: Applying Techniques
When conflict is experienced, it is generally a good practice to analyze the situation
before taking action. Consider asking each of the following questions and, using the
information obtained, develop strategies that will result in a positive outcome or reduce
the intensity of the conflict.
   Who are the groups involved?
   Why are they involved?
   How are they organized?
   Are the groups capable of working together?
   What is the history between the groups?
   How did the conflict develop?
   What are the main issues? What are the secondary issues?
   How can negative issues be reframed into more positive statements?
   How negotiable are the positions that have been taken?
   What are the common issues?
   What values and interests have been challenged?
   What external constraints or other influences must be considered?
   What past positive experiences can be used to influence cooperation?
   What is the timeline or urgency of the conflict and the need for a solution?
   How would an outside negotiator be received?
   Is an external negotiator needed?


                                       Remember
Identifying potential conflicts early in the project life cycle is important.
This will allow the team to develop preventive action to minimize the pos-
sibility of a conflict occurrence and to determine the appropriate cor-
rective action that will prevent escalation of the conflict. The longer the
project manager waits, the greater the chance that conflict intensity will
increase to the point where fewer options are available for its resolution.

Special Topics



Managing a project can become a challenging assignment depending upon the com-
plexity of the project. In addition to the responsibilities generally associated with
project planning and execution, the project manager may be expected to address and
manage a number of administrative items and organizational processes, policies, and
procedures. During the assignment, the project manager's main focus of attention is the
successful delivery of business value at the completion of the project, but the type of
project, the diversity of the project team, the types of personal interfaces, and the over-
all project environment may require the project manager to address and manage many,
if not all, of the following items:
   Performance measurement
   Compensation and rewards
   Managing small projects
   Managing mega projects
   Morality, ethics, and the corporate culture
   Internal partnerships
   External partnerships
   Training and education
   Integrated project teams
   Virtual teams
   Innovation projects
   Agile project management team member performance appraisals
   The specific responsibilities of the project manager will vary by industry and
organization, and the level of authority will depend on organizational structure and
policy. But the project manager should be prepared to manage or participate in an
environment where a blend of project management and organizational administrative
duties exists. This can also be dependent on the organization's project management
maturity level.

performance and to motivate an employee to continue to reach for higher
levels of performance.

 Study Notes: Professional and Social Responsibility, Morality,
 Ethics, and Corporate Culture
Professional responsibility is generally the mastery of a special body of advanced knowl-
edge that bears directly on the well-being of others. The special moral responsibilities
and requirements of a chosen field constrain professionals to apply their knowledge in
ways that benefit that community. Project managers must maintain sensitivity to cultural,
ethical, political, and geographical factors when planning a project and managing a team.
There are factors both internally and externally that may create significant challenges for
the project manager and impact how decisions are made.

about ethics, guidelines, and requirements that professional project managers are
expected to honor. The purpose of the Code of Ethics is to instill confidence among
business leaders, business owners, and their clients in the project management pro-
fession and in the business and personal values of the individual practitioner.
   The PMI(R) Code of Ethics and Professional Conduct focuses on: responsibility,
respect, fairness, and honesty.
   Your personal integrity is the key factor in professional responsibility.
   Performance appraisals, just like project reviews, should be conducted at specific
intervals to measure progress and identify areas for improvement.
   Become familiar with your company's policies regarding diversity, culture, and
ethics.
   Review the differences between Enterprise Environmental Factors (EEFs) and
Organizational Process Assets (OPAs).
   Examples of EEFs: Organizational culture, geographic distribution, infrastructure,
employee capability
   Examples of OPAs: policies and procedures, project artifacts, lessons learned
   Review performance measurement criteria and expectations with your project team
at the start of the project. Communicate objectives early and provide feedback about
performance on a regular basis. Plan to recognize good performance.
   Review project constraints (time cost, scope, resources), and assumptions (planning
items and statements that have not been verified and may have significant risk) during
project status meetings and scheduled performance reviews.
   Creating internal partnerships with functional managers is an effective way of ensur-
ing that project objectives will be accomplished. Maintain an awareness of functional
manager priorities and constraints, and establish positive working relationships.
   Project managers are required to develop the team and maintain their engagement
throughout the project life cycle. The Tuckman model refers to five stages of team
development: forming, storming, norming, performing, and adjourning.
   Forming: Learning about the project
   Storming: Differing ideas surface about the project management approach, roles,
   work assignments
   Norming: Team begins to work together, some trust is developing
   Performing: A well-organized and supportive team structure
   Adjourning: Work is completed, team is reassigned, some regret is experienced

The Variables for Success



Project success for many executives, managers, project managers, and project teams
refers to the elements of what has been referred to in the past as the triple constraint:
the balance of time (schedule), cost (budget), and scope (quality and performance
specifications). Today, success is actually defined much more specifically and more
comprehensibly than completing the project within the parameters of the triple con-
straint. Success depends on a systems approach to the project where all project ele-
ments, planning components, and deliverables of the project are coordinated in an
interrelated manner and managed with an understanding that failure in one area will
most likely have an effect on many other areas of the project. Today, the competing
demands associated with project success have grown in complexity. They reach deeply
into the values of the supplier organization and the buyer organization and are directly
connected with the creation of business value, short and long term. Safety, aesthetics,
risk sensitivity, and the values of society impact the perception of success.
   It is important to note that establishing success criteria with project stakeholders and
communicating that information to project team members are two of the key responsi-
bilities of the project manager. During the planning process, the project manager pro-
vides the team with the information needed to prepare the project plan and establish
the controls to keep the project on track to achieve client satisfaction and project suc-
cess. Common variables for project success include:
   Setting expectations early and intentionally
   Planning, including the relationships with the triple constraint and other competing
   demands
   Predicting project success, through analysis and performance measurement
   Project management effectiveness
   Project success, in many ways, depends on the actions of three key stakeholder
groups: the project manager and team (including external contractors), the project
sponsor or parent organization, and the customer or client organization (the end users,
the group that will ultimately receive the final project deliverable). Ensuring project
success requires the following actions:
   Select the "right" people for the project team.

    Glossary of Terms

Here are key terms and definitions to review and remember.
Benefit-cost ratio An indicator, used in the formal discipline of cost-benefit analy-
sis, that attempts to summarize the overall value for money of a project or proposal. A
BCR is the ratio of the benefits of a project or proposal, expressed in monetary terms,
relative to its costs, also expressed in monetary terms. All benefits and costs should be
expressed in discounted present values.
Best practice Something that works well on a repetitive basis. Something that leads
to a competitive advantage. Something that provides value to both the buyer and seller.
A process, technique, or action that has been proven to produce superior results consis-
tently and can be applied enterprise-wide.
Deliverable A tangible, verifiable work output. Projects are generally expected to
produce several deliverables that will be integrated to achieve the final aggregated or
summary deliverable. Project management deliverables include the project manage-
ment plan, subsidiary plans, work breakdown structure, status reports, and project
documents.
Expectation Something that is considered reasonable, due, necessary, or obligatory.
The project manager and team set expectations early in the project life cycle.
Expectations may be focused on timeliness, quality, communication, level of preci-
sion, and reliability.
Functional manager Generally a subject matter expert or technical expert from a spe-
cific functional group, such as engineering, design, or other technological areas, who
may control or manage resources required to meet project objectives. The functional
manager is a person with management authority over a specific organizational unit that
performs a specialized function or produces a product.
Internal rate of return Internal rate of return (IRR) is a metric used in capital bud-
geting measuring the profitability of potential investments. Internal rate of return is a
discount rate, determined through iterations, that will drive the net present value (NPV)
of all cash flows from a particular project to be equal to zero.
Lessons learned Information obtained through experience that may be shared to
improve performance, increase opportunity, or prevent occurrence of negative events,
results, or activities.
Net present value Net Present Value (NPV) is the difference between the present
value of cash inflows and the present value of cash outflows. NPV is used in capital
budgeting to analyze the profitability of a projected investment or project.
Payback period The payback period is the length of time required to recover the cost
of an investment. The payback period of a given investment or project is an important
determinant of whether to undertake the position or project, as longer payback periods
are typically not desirable for investment positions. The payback period ignores the
time value of money, unlike other methods of capital budgeting, such as net present
value, internal rate of return, or discounted cash flow.

 Major Causes of Project Failure
Project managers concentrate on the successful completion of a project but should
maintain an awareness of why projects may fail. There are several reasons for project
failure, but the most common causes are:
   Selection of a concept that is not applicable or does not have a sound basis
   Forcing a change at an inappropriate time
   Selecting the wrong person as project manager: assigning a person who possesses
   significant technical skills but does not have sufficient managerial and interper-
   sonal skills
   Executive or upper management is not supportive of the project: Lack of support
   from management will, in most cases, create significant roadblocks and eventually
   result in project cancellation.
   Inadequately defined tasks: A system for planning that includes task definition,
   development of a schedule, estimated costs, and control processes is required,
   or the project team will experience considerable amounts of rework, delays, and
   additional costs.
   Management techniques: A tendency to do more than what is required, failure to
   build teamwork, lack of motivation, over-supervision, and poor communications
   skills will contribute to project failure.
   Unplanned project termination: may be caused by a change in strategic direction,
   loss of funding, uncontrolled costs, poor quality, lack of team commitment, or con-
   tract default


                                         Note
Project Management Knowledge Note: Long before the project ends, the
project manager should plan for its end:
 Disposition of personnel
 Disposal of material and other resources
 Transfer of knowledge
 Closing out work orders
 Customer/contractor financial payments and reporting

   recommended preventive action.

as the project team. Clear expectations between the project manager and all key project




                                                                                                T h e Va r i a b l e s f o r S u c c e s s
stakeholders must be established early in the project-planning process. There are four
key variables in measuring the effectiveness of the project manager in dealing with
stakeholders: credibility, priority, accessibility, and visibility.
 5. Review the following list of characteristics and match them with the four key vari-
    ables of management effectiveness.
    a. Credibility:
    b. Priority:
    c. Accessibility:
    d. Visibility:
     1. Sound decision maker
     2. "Selling" the importance of the project and connecting it with organizational
        goals
     3. Experience from a variety of assignments
     4. Making a positive impression when presenting the project to upper
        management
     5. Emphasizing facts over opinions
     6. Ensuring that others receive appropriate credit for work performed
     7. Obtaining testimonial support for the project from functional groups, custom-
        ers, and other managers
     8. Ability to communicate as needed with stakeholders
     9. Becoming personally known by managers in several departments, including
        upper management
   10. Creating an environment where managers and customers desire your
       involvement
   11. Conducting timely informational meetings
   12. Using available publicity media appropriately
   13. Creating a common understanding about the project through presentations and
       emphasizing project successes



                                    Remember
Generally, a project manager is expected to assume total account-
ability for project success or failure. This means providing timely and
accurate project reports and information, minimizing disruption of orga-
nizational operations during project execution, managing interpersonal
issues among project team members, maintaining a self-starting attitude
and approach, and growing in experience with each assignment.

Lessons can be learned during any phase of a project. To make them use-
ful they should be documented and shared with other project managers
and project teams within your organization. Sharing lessons learned is
associated with the professional and social responsibility domain of project
management. Transfer of knowledge, increasing the project management
historical database of your organization, and enhancing the processes you
work with are all associated with the overall responsibilities of the proj-
ect manager and are factors that impact the continuing success of the
organization.

     Kerzner "Quick Tips" for the Project Management Institute
     PMP(R) and CAPM(R) Exams

The topic "Variables for Success" is most closely related to the following knowledge
areas in the PMBOK(R) Guide Sixth Edition: Understanding the Project Environment,
Interpersonal Skills, Project Life Cycle and Organization, Project Management
Processes, Integration Management.
   The most common factors used to determine project success are the elements of
the triple constraint: time, cost, and scope. (Scope is also associated with quality and
performance specification.)
   Project success is no longer based on managing the triple constraint. Customer satis-
faction, minimizing substantial changes, team satisfaction, and minimizing the impact
of the project on business operations are also key factors.
   There are five major process groups that are integrated in the planning of a project:
initiating, planning, executing, monitoring and controlling, and closing.
   The project manager works in collaboration with the project team to determine how
the processes will be managed and at what level of effort to achieve project success.
The five major process groups are applied to each phase of a project.
   Communicate and utilize lessons learned from project successes and project fail-
ures to improve performance of future projects, enhance the risk management process,
identify potential problem areas, and develop preventive measures.
   Preventive measures are generally less costly than repair, rework, and failure.
Prevention is preferable to correction.
   A project review at the end of a phase or at the completion of a milestone will assist
in identifying areas for improvement and increasing the probability for overall project
success.
   Review stakeholder needs to ensure that project performance is on track with
expectations.

Working with Executives



In most project-based organizations, the project manager is positioned to lead a team
assigned to deliver a product or service that has been determined to have business
value. Generally, the project selection process involves a proposal or submission of
an idea, a vetting process that includes a business case analysis to ensure alignment
with company strategic objectives, and the issuance of a project charter. The proj-
ect charter, usually prepared and signed by the project sponsor, identifies the project
manager and authorizes the project manager to use organizational resources to com-
plete project objectives. The project sponsor is, in most cases a senior-level manager,
an executive, or an executive steering committee. Establishing a positive relationship
with the sponsor and/or project executive and continually interfacing with them as
the project is planned and implemented are major factors in achieving project suc-
cess and securing additional project assignments.
   The role of the executive in the process of managing projects varies significantly
from one organization to another but generally an executive either introduces a project
for selection or is positioned to support a project that has been approved. The execu-
tive aligned with the project is referred to as the project sponsor. The project sponsor
is involved in the organization's project selection process and participates in the deci-
sions that determine which projects are approved for implementation and those proj-
ects that should be denied or terminated. The project sponsor may also be involved
in contract negotiations with clients and suppliers. At completion of the selection pro-
cess, the sponsor provides or authorizes the necessary funding and resources for the
approved project. The project sponsor's role includes providing guidance about proj-
ect objectives and ensuring alignment with organizational strategy, high-level informa-
tion on the enterprise environmental factors, setting business priorities for the project,
and creating or approving the project organizational structure. The project sponsor also
provides oversight during initial planning and may be required to engage in conflict
resolution related to resource assignments, budget approval, and project prioritization.
   In the early stages of the project, the project sponsor will oversee the planning
process and provide support to the project manager in several activities:
   Justification and prioritization of the project within the performing organization
   Establishing and or approving the project objectives

nate. Project sponsors generally do everything possible to support the project manager
and to make sure that the project meets objectives and remains aligned with organiza-
tional strategies to ensure it will continue. The champion determines whether or not
the resources can better serve the company elsewhere, whether the enterprise environ-
mental factors have changed, whether the assumptions are still valid, and whether the
perceived value will be realized at project completion. Champions validate the continu-
ation or termination of the project and generally have the authority to override the deci-
sions of the project sponsor.
Objective A planned or intended outcome. Refer to the acronym "SMART" (Specific,
Measurable, Attainable, Realistic, Time-based).
Organizational process assets Formal and informal processes established and in use
within an organization. These may include standard policies for safety, product quality,
communications requirements, financial controls, change control, risk management,
and project closure procedures.
Portfolio Projects, programs, and operations managed as a group to achieve strategic
objectives.
Project sponsor The person or organization that has authorized the project and
approves or provides the funding and resources to support the project.
Scope creep Unauthorized or uncontrolled changes to the project scope. Scope creep
sometimes occurs when a project team member or project manager attempts to exceed
customer expectations by providing additional work or product features that are not
included in the approved scope of work.
Stakeholder Any person or organization that is directly involved in, or impacted
either positively or negatively as a result of, a project or program.
Stakeholder engagement The processes by which an organization or project leader
involves people who may be affected by a project. Stakeholder engagement involves
communication about project activities, updates about progress, and maintaining active
and ongoing interest in the project. Maintaining stakeholder engagement is a critical
success factor and requires significant project manager attention.
SWOT analysis A strategic planning method used to evaluate the strengths, weak-
nesses, opportunities, and threats (SWOT) involved in a project or in a business
venture. It involves specifying the objective of the business venture or project and iden-
tifying the internal and external factors that may affect the achievement of an organiza-
tion's vision, mission, and business objectives. The SWOT analysis is discussed in the
PMBOK(R) Guide (6th edition), Chapter 11, and in the Kerzner textbook in Chapter 17.

                         The Status Reporting Process
Generally, there are three types of status reporting: progress reports
(what has been accomplished), status reports (the current state of the
project), and forecasts (what is expected to occur). Project managers
must identify specifically what information the project sponsor expects to
receive and when.




                                  Remember
Today, new roles for the project executive are developing, including:
  Establishing a center for excellence in project management
  Establishing a project office or centralized project management
  function
  Creating a project management career path
  Creating a mentorship program for newly appointed project managers
  Creating an organization committed to benchmarking the best practices
  in project management in other organizations
  Providing strategic information for risk management and business
  intelligence

Planning



       "Failure to plan means planning to fail."
                                             --Ben Franklin and Winston Churchill

       "The primary benefit of not planning is that failure will then come as a
       complete surprise rather than being preceded by periods of worry and
       depression."
                                                                       --Anonymous

       "In preparing for battle I have always found that plans are useless, but
       planning is indispensable."
                                                            --Dwight D. Eisenhower

Planning is one of the most important activities performed by the project manager and
project team. It is the process of preparing a sequence of action steps to achieve some
specific goal.
   Planning can best be described as the functions associated with developing and com-
municating objectives of an enterprise, project, or program and then establishing the poli-
cies, procedures, programs, and activities necessary to achieve them. Planning in the project
environment involves a team effort to establish a course of action that will achieve a set of
predetermined objectives within a constrained environment. The constraints are generally
associated with time, cost, scope, quality, risk, and resources. However, there can be other
competing constraints such as safety, image, reputation, and the like.
   From the business value perspective the project manager is the key to successful
project planning and is responsible for identifying, coordinating, and integrating the
functions and activities required to deliver the desired project results. Ideally, to maxi-
mize the output of the planning process, the project manager should be assigned to the
project during contract negotiations or at the earliest stage of the project. The project
manager is positioned as the team leader and remains committed to the project until
completion of objectives or termination of the project.
   Planning requires a systematic yet flexible approach that will identify and define spe-
cific activities, involve the entire project team, and emphasize the need for integration of
all plan components as part of a higher-level project management plan. Project planning

                                                                                                                       3. To obtain a better understanding of objectives
                                                                                                                       4. To provide a basis for monitoring and controlling work

ized plan is developed. It is intended to assist the project managers and project team,
including the project sponsor, in making decisions with a focus on producing the
desired outcome of the project. Effective planning will improve the efficiency of the
team and increase the probability of meeting objectives. It is important to note that
a project plan, created by the project team and based their combined experience, les-
sons learned, expert judgment, and an effective agreed upon methodology, will gener-
ally produce the specified deliverables with minimal scope changes. It is also important
to note that the plan should be expected to change during execution. These changes are
generally associated with stakeholder needs, uncertainty, and shifting project priorities.
The main value of the plan is that it provides the initial guidance required to organize
resources and establishes direction and purpose for the project team.
   Planning is also defined in terms of strategic, tactical, and operational perspectives.
Strategic planning generally refers to a longer-term view of three to five years and
focuses on an organization's vision and direction. Tactical planning may include a one-
to two-year view and focuses on the interim steps necessary to achieve the strategic
goals. Operational planning addresses a shorter-term view generally associated with a
six months to one year and is focused on the ongoing production of goods and ser-
vices, business efficiency, and optimization of resources. Operations and project man-
agement may intersect at various points during a product life cycle. These points may
include the project closeout phase and the development of plans to improve operational
efficiency or to change product
   When planning a project, the project manager and team should consider the purpose
of the project and the relationship of the project objectives and final deliverable to the
higher-level strategic objectives of the organization. A clear connection between proj-
ect objectives and organizational strategic objectives will, in most cases, generate sus-
tained upper management support.
   General planning and project planning have a number of similarities. These include:
   Setting objectives
   Relationship to a higher level program or business operation
   A schedule
   A budget
   Forecasting: a projection and estimate of the desired results and other factors that
   may impact objectives
   An organization: the duties and responsibilities associated with achieving objectives
   Policy: guidelines for decision making
   Procedures: the method for carrying out policies and plans
   Standards: guidelines for acceptable performance
   Project planning is actually a system that includes a process for:
   Setting objectives
   Developing work descriptions

together to facilitate effective management of that work to meet strategic business
objectives.
Procedure A series of steps followed in a definite order to accomplish a desired
objective or result.
Process A set of interrelated actions and activities designed to bring about a specific result.
Program A group of projects managed in a coordinated way to obtain benefits and
control not available from managing them individually.
Progressive elaboration A process of continually moving forward in increments, add-
ing greater levels of detail.
Project A temporary endeavor (has a start and finish date) undertaken to create a
unique product or service, and most likely involving multifunctional disciplines.
Project charter The document that formally authorizes the existence of the project
and the use of organizational resources perform project activities. Usually issued or
approved by the project sponsor or project initiator.
Project life cycle Generally, the project life cycle is a collection of sequential project
phases that define the work and duration of the project. In some cases, based upon the
assessment of risk, project life cycle phases can overlap to compress the total duration
of the project. This technique is known as fast tracking).
Project phase A discrete component or element of a project that includes specific
work activities to be completed in a scheduled time frame. Project phases are bound
by specific start and end dates often referred to as milestones. The project life cycle is
composed of a series of project phases the number of which are determined by the con-
trol needs of the organization.
Project scope The work that must be performed to deliver the product, service, or
desired result of the project.
Rolling wave planning Rolling wave planning is the process of planning for a project
in a progressive manner where work to be accomplished in the near term is planned in
detail and work that is planned for the future is planned at a higher level and elaborated
later as the project continues through the life cycle. Rolling wave planning is also used
when downstream work cannot be clearly defined at the low levels of the WBS until
certain upstream information such as test results can be evaluated.
Scope The sum of the products and services to be provided as a project.
Scope statement Description of the major deliverables, project objectives, and project
assumptions. The scope statement provides a basis for making future decisions about the
project. The scope statement is developed to answer the questions: What must be accom-
plished? Why is it necessary? Who will perform the work? When must the work be
accomplished? Where will the work be performed? How will the work be accomplished?
Standard A document established by consensus and/or history that provides for com-
mon and repeated use. Generally considered as rules or guidelines to be followed in an
organization.

    5. Is this where we want to be? Where would we like to be? In one year? In five years?
    6. What might prevent us from getting there? What might help us get there?
    7. Where will we go if we continue as before? Is that where we want to go? How
       could we get to where we want to go?
    8. What is the best course for us to take? What are the potential benefits? What are
       the risks?
2. What are the most common reasons that cause projects to fail?

 Life Cycle Phases
An effective approach to planning is to divide the project into specific phases that
define the entire project life cycle. Applying a project life cycle approach provides con-
sistency within an organization by defining key phase deliverables and also establishes
a greater ability to plan and control the activities in each phase. Analyzing the results
or accomplishments of each phase assists the project manager and sponsor in determin-
ing if the project should continue on to the succeeding phase. These "end of phase"
reviews are commonly referred to as phase exits, stage gates, or go and no-go deci-
sion points. End of phase reviews assist in determining the "health" of a project and
can prevent an organization from continuing with a project that will not meet financial
goals, achieve the desired value, or use resources that could be deployed more effec-
tively and beneficially on other projects.

   Key points about project life cycles and project phases
   All projects go through a life cycle that includes specific and describable phases
   Each phase is initiated, planned, executed, monitored, controlled, and brought to closure
   Phases generally have specific deliverables or intended accomplishments that, upon
   completion, provide the starting point for the next phase. These are referred to as
   interim deliverables.
   Generally, the costs at the start of the project life cycle are low (staffing has just
   begun, procurement is minimal) and increase throughout the project as work activity
   and resource usage increases.
   Transitions from one phase to another provide an ideal time to conduct reviews to
   compare performance with baselines
   Study note: Project phases can overlap to compress the total project schedule if the
   risks are considered acceptable. This technique is referred to as fast tracking.

 Project Planning: The Importance of Objectives
Planning starts with an understanding of the objectives of the project. The sponsor, the
project manager, and the project team should all have the same understanding about
what must be accomplished. There may be several levels of objectives depending on
the complexity of the project, but all objectives should be interrelated and support the
overall goals and acceptance criteria of the project.

    "SMART." Fill in the blanks with the correct description of each letter of the word
    SMART as it relates to writing objectives:

                                       Remember
       Common causes of misinterpretations of the statement of work
Mixing tasks, specifications, approvals, and special instructions
  Using imprecise language (e.g., nearly, approximately)
  No pattern, structure, or chronological order
  Wide variation in size of tasks and details
  Failing to obtain a "third-party review"



Milestone Schedules
In the early stages of project planning, before project details are identified, some proj-
ect scheduling constraints or timing requirements may be defined in association with
contractual agreements. These specific dates or milestones include:
   The project start date
   The project end date
   Other milestones such as phase completions or a requirement for a completion of a
   deliverable
   Reports or data items
   Certifications and approvals
   A point where future work is restrained
16. PM Quick Check: A milestone can best be described as:
    a. A significant event in the project schedule
    b. An activity in the project that consumes a large amount of project resources and time
    c. The activities included in the close of a phase or the project


 The Business Case and the Project Charter
The business case provides the organization's decision makers with the necessary informa-
tion to determine whether the expected outcomes of the project justify the investment.
   Typical information that may be included as part of a business case:
   The business need: the gap that currently exists and the rationale
   The connection to strategic business objectives
   The value/benefits that may be realized: cost savings, additional profits, or new
   opportunities
   Assumptions that justify the project
   Financial analysis including benefit-to-cost ratio, cash flow considerations, strategic
   options, opportunity costs, return on investment, net present value
   Project risks: business, legal, technical, financial

                                      Remember
All projects should support the organization's strategic goals and business
plans. The strategic goals and business plans should be a major factor in
the project selection process.
Requirements
Collecting requirements is the process of gathering, documenting, and
determining the needs of project stakeholders to achieve the functionality
that will meet project objectives. There are several techniques that may be
used to collect requirements:
 Brainstorming
 Focus groups
 Interviews
 Questionnaires
 Benchmarking
 Prototypes
  The "collect requirements" process will result in documentation about
how the identified requirements will meet the business needs of the proj-
ect. Requirements may be classified as:
 Business requirements
 Functional requirements: data interactions
 Nonfunctional requirements: safety, reliability, performance, supportability


 The Project Scope Statement
The project scope statement is a definition of the project and what must be accomplished.
It describes in detail the project deliverables and the work required to achieve those deliv-
erables. In some organizations a preliminary scope statement is developed that addresses
the characteristics, boundaries, and constraints of the project, including the deliverables,
products, services, and the methods by which the scope will be controlled, verified, and
accepted. The final scope statement may include the following items:
   Project and product objectives
   Service requirement and product characteristics
   Product acceptance criteria
   Constraints and assumptions
   Schedule milestones
   Initial defined risks
   A high level or order of magnitude cost estimate
   Configuration management requirements
   Approval requirements

 Decomposition and the Work Breakdown Structure
The work breakdown structure (WBS) is a deliverable-oriented grouping of proj-
ect tasks and activities shown in a hierarchal arrangement and in descending levels
of detail. The WBS displays the complexity of the project and defines the total scope
of the project. The purpose of the WBS is to subdivide the project into smaller, more
manageable parts and to provide the appropriate level of detail for further planning.
The lowest levels of the branches of the WBS are referred to as work packages. The
work packages contain the specific activities that must be performed by the project
team or assigned resources. These activities are defined at a detail to meet the needs of
the project, estimated in terms of duration and resource requirements, schedules, their
costs estimated, and their progress monitored and controlled.


                                      Exam Tip
The work package is a deliverable at the lowest level of the WBS where
work is to be controlled. The activities in the work package must be
performed to produce the deliverable. Work packages are generally
associated with a cost account to track the actual costs of the work
performed.


   The process of breaking the project down into smaller, more manageable parts is
known as decomposition. This process continues until the appropriate level of detail for
planning purposes has been achieved. A common practice is to create a WBS template
from a similar project to save time and accelerate the planning process. In some cases,
where tasks are scheduled to be completed much later in the project, decomposition
may not be possible. In these cases a technique referred to as "rolling wave" planning
may be used. In this process, the details are added progressively throughout the proj-
ect, generally phase by phase.

                                                                                                                   into smaller and smaller components and grouped in phases or by deliverables.

                                                                                                                   tasks and activities. The lowest level deliverable in a branch of a WBS is referred to

 Project Phase-Outs, Transfer, and Closing
Projects have a specific end date (at least by definition), and therefore, transfer of proj-
ect deliverables to the customer or intended user and the closeout of the project should
be planned. The closeout of the project is actually a project in itself and a very impor-
tant phase of the project. Projects are generally closed based on the following reasons:
   Completion of all project objectives
   Achieving the desired value:
   Achieving agreed-upon contractual terms and conditions
   Preparing for the transition to the operational phase of the project's product
   Analysis and documentation of overall project performance
   Identification of possible follow-on business
   The project is no longer associated with organizational goals, will not achieve its
   targeted value, or has reached a point where it is no longer perceived as financially
   beneficial.

    erable to the operational environment? Make a list of activities that should be

20. A charter authorizes the project. The scope statement defines the project in detail
    and includes the specific objectives.
21. Scope is the sum of all products and services to be delivered as a project. The proj-
    ect scope statement is a narrative description of the project scope and includes the
    major deliverables, objectives, assumptions, and constraints of the project.
22. The sponsor or project initiator.
23. Introduce the project manager to the team, assemble the subject matter experts,
    explain project success criteria, communicate project objectives, define team roles
    and responsibilities, explain constraints and assumptions, begin the detailed plan-
    ning process.
24. Project manager will define: goals and objectives, major milestones, initial require-
    ments. The project manager will also facilitate the establishment of team ground
    rules and the documentation of assumptions. The project manager will communi-
    cate information about time, cost, and performance constraints, operating proce-
    dures, administrative policy and reporting requirements.
       Functional manager or line manager will define: Detailed task descriptions to
    implement objectives requirements, and milestones; detailed schedules and man-
    power allocations to support budget and schedule; and identification of areas of
    risk, uncertainty, and conflict.
       Senior management (project sponsor) will: Act as the negotiator for disagree-
    ments between project and line management; provide clarification of critical
    issues; provide communication link with customers and senior management.
       Special note: Successful planning requires that project, functional, and senior
    management are in agreement with the plan.
25. Assumptions are generally not grounded in fact and failure to validate an assump-
    tion could lead to significant risk situations.

27. The project work is structured into small elements that are:
     Manageable, in that specific authority and responsibility can be assigned
     Independent, or with minimum interfacing with and dependence on other ongo-
     ing elements
     Integrated so that the total package can be seen
     Measurable in terms of progress

41. They are the reference points for measuring project performance. The PMB serves
    as the metric benchmark against which performance is measured in terms of time,
    cost, and scope. It is also used as the basis for business value tracking. The princi-
    pal reasons for establishing PMBs are to ensure achievement of project objectives,
    manage and monitor progress during project execution, ensure accurate informa-
    tion on the accomplishment of the deliverables and requirements, and establish
    performance measurement criteria
42. Why is the change necessary? How much will it cost? Who will do it? How will
    the change affect the schedule, scope, or budget? What are the risks?
43. a. Prepare all documents and project records.

Network Scheduling
Techniques



Network scheduling is an extremely important part of the total integrated project-
planning process. As plans are developed, the project scope statement and work break-
down structure (WBS) provide the project manager and team with the foundation for
more detailed planning. The scope statement and WBS answer the "what" "when,"
"where," "why," and "who" questions and provide the project team with information
about the complexity of the project. Additional planning is required to determine proj-
ect cost, develop the schedule, and ensure that project risks have been considered and
cared for. The tasks and activities of the project, defined in the WBS, must be arranged
in an appropriate and logical sequence to meet predefined schedule requirements, man-
datory dependencies, resource constraints, and other factors defined by the sponsor,
key stakeholders, or contractual agreements.
   Network scheduling is actually a continuation of the project-planning process and
allows the project team to determine the best approach to organizing, managing and
controlling project activities. The process of network scheduling provides an oppor-
tunity to display the logical relationships and dependencies between project activities.
It defines the project critical path, and will identify where the schedule has flexibility,
commonly known as float or slack. Network scheduling will also identify opportunities
for rearranging the sequence of activities to optimize the schedule and ensure the most
efficient use of resources and time. Network scheduling requires input from the entire
project team and may require several iterations before the project schedule is finalized
and approved.


                                     Remember
The WBS is generally considered to be the "cornerstone of project plan-
ning" and provides the basis for network scheduling and the develop-
ment of network diagrams. The project team collaborates to identify the
project components, major tasks, and work package activities and uses
a process known as decomposition to develop the WBS. When com-
pleted, the WBS will clearly display the project and its complexity. Network

the scope baseline, schedule baseline, and budget or cost baseline. The baseline pro-
vides the benchmark for comparing actual results with planned results. The difference
between the actual result and the planned result is referred to as variance.
Crashing A technique for schedule compression where the total project duration is
reduced by identifying activities that can be reduced in duration by adding additional
resources or using overtime. Crashing usually results in increased project costs and
may increase the risk in meeting the project's constraints. Crashing focuses on seeking
opportunities for compressing the project schedule by targeting activities that will pro-
vide the greatest duration reduction at the lowest cost without significantly increasing
the risk. Crashing generally is applied to the critical path where there is minimal flex-
ibility and, in most cases, no slack or float.
Critical activity An activity on a critical path.
Critical path The longest path through a network that determines the earliest com-
pletion date of the project. The critical path is usually defined as the path through a
network where the activities have zero float or slack. It is important to note that the
critical path is not necessarily the path with the greatest overall risk. Secondary or ter-
tiary paths may have greater risk.
Critical path method (CPM) A network analysis technique used to determine the
early start, early finish, late start, and late finish dates for activities on the various logi-
cal paths of a network. Early dates are calculated using a forward pass; late dates are
calculated using a backward pass. The critical path is identified during this process.
Dummy activity An activity of zero duration used to show a logical relationship.
Dummy activities are used in the arrow diagramming method (activity on the arrow)
when special logical relationships are required and must be displayed. Dummy activ-
ities are shown graphically as a dashed or dotted line headed by an arrow and con-
necting two nodes. Dummy activities may be a factor in calculating the critical path.
The activity on the arrow method has been replaced by the PDM or activity-on-node
method.
Duration The number of calendar work periods, commonly expressed in days and
weeks, required to complete an activity or other project element. Duration is generally
estimated by the functional manager responsible for the activity.
EffortThe number of labor units required to complete an activity or other project
element. Effort is associated with skill level, resource competency, and number of
resources available. Effort is related to the determination of activity duration. Example:
an activity may be estimated to have a 3-day duration but may require 2 resources
working 8 hours a day to complete the work, or 48 hours of effort. Effort can also
include part-time assignments.
Fast-tracking Compressing the project schedule by overlapping activities that would
normally be done in sequence. Risk must be considered when utilizing fast-tracking.
Float The amount of time that an activity may be delayed from its early start without
delaying the project finish date. (Also referred to as slack.)

Project network diagram A schematic display of the logical relationships of project
activities.
Resource breakdown structure Hierarchal structure of the identified resources by
resource category and resource type.
Rolling wave planning A technique in which more details are added as the project
progresses. It is a form of progressive elaboration and addresses the issue that informa-
tion about some project activities may not be immediately available. It is a process of
project planning in waves as the project proceeds and later details become available.
As the project progresses, the risks, assumptions, and milestones originally identified
become more defined and reliable.
Slack Generally considered to have the same meaning as float. The amount of flexibil-
ity an activity has in relation to the project end date.
Total float The amount of time that a scheduled activity may be delayed from its
early start date without delaying the project finish date. Total float is associated
with the entire path in the network. The path owns the float, not the individual
activities.


     Time Management Processes: A Brief Review

The following processes are generally associated with the knowledge area project time
management. Network scheduling is directly associated with the time management
process of activity sequencing and is an essential element of the integrated planning
process.
   The PMBOK(R) Guide--Sixth Edition includes the following project time manage-
ment processes:
   Plan schedule management: establishing the processes and procedures for planning,
   developing, and controlling the project schedule
   Define activities: further developing the WBS at the work package level to identify
   specific actions that must be taken to complete project deliverables
   Sequence activities: identifying the specific logical relationships of project activi-
   ties; identifying predecessor and successor relationships
   Estimate activity duration: determining the number of work periods required to
   complete project activities
   Develop schedule: analyzing project resources, activity sequences, activity dura-
   tions, and project constraints to determine the project schedule
   Control schedule: monitoring the project schedule to identify variances, managing
   project changes and updating the project schedule as required

   erate a need to change an activity or refine the schedule.)

 Estimate Activity Duration
This is the process of estimating schedule activity durations using information from the
scope statement, identified resource types, number of resources available, calendars,
ramp-up and ramp-down time (the effect of non-contiguous work assignments)

   Inputs
   Project management plan, project documents, enterprise environmental factors,
   organizational process assets.

   Tools and techniques
   Expert judgment, analogous estimating, parametric estimating, three-point esti-
   mates, bottom-up estimating, data analysis, decision-making techniques, meetings.
    Three-point estimates are based on determining the optimistic, most likely, and pes-
simistic durations of an activity. The weighted average estimate or estimated time is
calculated by the formula
    (O + 4m + P)/6 (The sum of the optimistic estimate plus four times the most likely
estimate plus the pessimistic estimate divided by six)
    The triangular distribution estimate is similar to the weighted average three-point
estimate but the there are no weighted values. This estimate is basically an average of
the three points.
    Analogous estimating uses actual duration figures from similar activities or projects.
Also referred to as a top-down type of estimating. This type of estimating is generally
used early in a project. Estimates are refined as more project data is obtained.
    Parametric estimating calculates duration estimates by using mathematical algo-
rithms such as multiplying the quantity of work in work periods by the cost rate of a
resource. This type of estimate works best for standardized and often repetitive activ-
ities. This is also a top-down type of estimating. Example: Multiplying the cost per
square foot by the desired number of square feet of living space will produce a para-
metric estimate of the cost of building a home.

   The following questions and exercises are most closely associated with the knowl-
edge area of the PMBOK(R) Guide--Sixth Edition: Project Time Management. It is
important to remember that although each knowledge area is presented separately in the
PMBOK(R) Guide for learning purposes, many processes are performed concurrently and
all processes are associated with project integration management. The five major process
groups--initiating, planning, executing, monitoring and controlling, and closing--assist
in the integration of all subprocesses associated with planning and managing a project.
   Review each of the following questions or exercises and provide the answers in the
space provided. Some questions and situations will have more than one appropriate
answer or response. Project managers are aware that many issues they face on a daily
basis may have several possible solutions. These exercises are designed to encourage
you to think about alternatives before taking action.

 Activity Planning: From WBS to Project Network Diagram
After the project has been defined in the scope statement and by developing a work
breakdown structure, the next step in the planning process is to perform the steps
required to develop the project schedule. This process includes identifying activities,
determining resource requirements, estimating activity durations, establishing the
sequence or activities, and managing within project constraints.
 1. PM Quick Check: The process of activity definition is an extension of the devel-
    opment of the                   .
2. PM Quick Check: After the major project deliverables have been defined using
   the process of decomposition, the activities necessary to produce the lower-level
   project deliverables are included in the                    .

The PDM is the most common method used today to display a project net-
work. The PDM uses nodes that represent activities. They are connected
by arrows that represent logical relationships or dependencies.

A normal distribution is an arrangement of a data set in which most val-
ues cluster in the middle of the range and the rest taper off symmetrically
toward either extreme. A graphical representation of a normal distribution
is sometimes called a bell curve because of its flared shape. The precise
shape can vary according to the distribution of the population but the peak
is always in the middle and the curve is always symmetrical.
   Example of normal distribution: Most people are of average height; the
numbers of people that are taller and shorter than average are fairly equal
and a very small number of people are either extremely tall or extremely short.
   In normal distribution the following information is important to remember:
 68.3% of the data points fall within one standard deviation from the mean.
 95.5% of the data points fall with two standard deviations from the mean.
 99.7% of the data points fall within three standard deviations from the mean.
  Basic formula for standard deviation:
  (pessimistic value minus the optimistic value) divided by 6 or (P - O) / 6
  Note: This is a short formula generally accepted for calculating standard
deviation.
  Definitions to remember:
  Mean: The average of all data points
  Median: The midpoint of a frequency distribution. Example: In the series
  1,2,3,4,5,6,7, the median is 4.
  Mode: The most frequent data point value. Example: In 1,1,1,2,2,2,
  2,3,4,4,5,6, the mode is the number 2.
  Range: The difference between the highest value data point and the
  lowest value data point. Example: 10, 20, 40, 50, 70, 80, 100 the ranges =
  100 - 10 or 90

                                                                                                                    Mandatory dependencies or hard logic. This type of dependency is
                                                                                                                    inherent in the nature of the work. They often involve physical limita-
                                                                                                                    tions. The work must be performed in a specific order. Example: Install
                                                                                                                    walls before adding the roof, dig trench before placing pipeline.

                                                                                                                    by the project manager or team and is associated with best practices.

  Example: "There are several possible ways to complete this work and we
  have decided that it is best to do it this way."
 External dependencies are those that are associated with factors that are
 outside of the project or outside the control of the project manager and
 team but may impact the critical path. Example: A local government deci-
 sion or change in regulations may cause a project to be delayed.

Determining Probability Using Normal Distribution

  Remember that the mean is the 50% point. This is interpreted as the
  point where the probability of reaching this value is 50%. Example: If the
  mean is 10 weeks, the project has a 50% probability of completing in 10
  weeks or less. There is a 68% probability of completing a task within 1
  standard deviation.
  The standard deviation includes the (-) and (+) side of the mean.
  Example: If the mean is 20 weeks and the standard deviation is 2, the
  range of 1 standard deviation is 20 +2 or 22 and 20 -2 or 18.
  This means there is a 68% probability the task will be completed
  between 18 and 22 weeks. The 68% spans the + and - side of the
  mean. The probability of completing the task in 22 weeks is calculated
  as 50% (the mean) plus 1/2 of 68 or 34. 50% + 34% = 84%. There is an 84%
  chance the task will be completed in 22 weeks or less.


 Forward Pass
The forward pass is used to determine the earliest start and earliest finish dates of each
activity on the network diagram. The process begins with the first activity on the net-
work (usually a milestone) and continues from left to right, analyzing each path, and
adding activity duration to the start time of the activity. During the process, at any
point where two or more activities converge on another activity the higher value of the
early finish is used to determine the early start of the succeeding activity. This process
continues through each path in the network to determine the total duration of the proj-
ect and the critical path.

    using the precedence diagram method and determine the duration of the project

 Lead and Lag Time
During project planning it may be necessary to adjust the project schedule to
include lag time, a delay of the succeeding activity, or lead time, an acceleration
of a succeeding activity. A common example of lag time is the elapsed time after
the activity of pouring concrete. The concrete must cure for a period of time. Lag
is built into the network to allow for the curing time. An example of lead time is to
indicate that a succeeding activity may start after 70% of a preceding activity has
been completed.

                                                                                          223

30. PM Quick Check: The critical path is the:
     a. Shortest path through the network diagram
     b. Longest path through the project network that determines the earliest time the
        project can be completed
     c. Path with the greatest number of resources assigned
31. You have received the following information from a project team member: the esti-
    mated pessimistic duration to complete an activity is 45 days, the optimistic time is
    15 days, and the most likely time is 25 days. What will you post as the duration for
    this activity using the PERT weighted average technique?
32. Using the same information from the previous question, calculate the standard
    deviation using the short formula.
33. Using normal distribution, what is the probability of completing the activity
    referred to in questions 12 and 13 within 21.67 days and 31.67 days?


34. What is the probability of completing the activity in 31.67 days or less?

  It is important to become familiar with how inputs, tools and techniques, and




                                                                                                         Network Scheduling Techniques
outputs relate to project planning and control. Consider the logic of each process.
Example: It is necessary to define the activities that must be performed before deter-
mining the sequence of the activities.
  PDM has four possible logical relationships:
 1. Finish to start (the most common dependency type): The successor activity's
    start depends on the completion of the successor activity.
2. Finish to finish: The completion of the successor activity depends on the comple-
   tion of the predecessor activity.
3. Start to start: The start of the successor activity depends on the start of the prede-
   cessor activity.
4. Start to finish: The completion of the successor activity depends on the start of
   the predecessor activity.
   Become familiar with different types of scheduling charts: Gantt, milestone, and
schedule networks and what they are used for Gantt charts are generally used to dis-
play progress, network diagrams display dependencies, and milestone charts provide
high-level summary information and significant points in time.
   Be prepared to explain the critical path method and how to determine critical path.
   Understand the difference between the schedule compression techniques of crash-
ing, fast tracking, and managing slack or float.
   Remember the formula for calculating activity durations using PERT--Optimistic
Value + 4 times the Most Likely Value + Pessimistic Value divided by 6:

                                [O + (4 x ML) + P]/6

   Practice forward pass and backward pass calculations to determine which activities
have float or slack.
   Develop network diagrams and practice calculating early            Additional tips and prac-
start, early finish, late start, and late finish.                     tice items for the PMP(R)

Critical path is CFHL
Duration is 23
Standard deviation of G = 1.17
30. b
31. 26.67 days
32. The standard deviation is 5 (45 - 15) / 6.
33. The probability associated with 1 standard deviation in normal distribution is
    68.3%. In this example one standard deviation below the mean is 26.67 - 5 =
    21.67. 26.67 + 5 = 31.67.
34. The probability of finishing the activity in 31.67 days or less is 84%. The mean is
    50% plus 68% /2 = 34%. 31.67 is one standard deviation from the mean. Add the
    mean plus 1/2 of the 68% = 84%.
35. Activity A: $2000/week
    Activity B: $1000/week
    Activity C: $2500/week
    Activity D $1500/week
    Activity E: $2200/week
36. To compress the schedule, you must compress the activities on the critical path
    even though the activities not on the critical path are cheaper. Therefore, crash
    Activity A for one week at an additional cost of $2,000.
37. Crash activity A for 1 week and Activity E for 1 week; additional cost is $4,200.
38. $3,000 does not cover the additional cost of $4,200. The exception would be if you
    need the resources to be available earlier for another project.
39. A: 5 weeks; F: 6 weeks; G: 8 weeks
40. 19 weeks
41. The standard deviation of the activities on the critical path is 2.94 weeks

Pricing and Estimating



The total integrated process of project planning includes several activities that
require collaboration between the project manager, the project team, and many of
the project stakeholders. Estimating the likely costs of material, human resources,
equipment, and work effort required to complete the project is a significant part of
the planning process.
   There are several common techniques available for use in estimating project costs,
activity duration, and project completion date, and the project manager may use a
combination of these techniques to develop the initial project schedule and budget.
Companies today have estimating databases that can be useful. These techniques may
also be used later in the project life cycle depending on the extent of changes intro-
duced to the project plan and on overall project performance. The application of these
techniques will vary depending on project complexity and organizational project man-
agement maturity, but the objective of the estimating process is to determine, within a
desired or expressed degree of reliability and risk, the total cost to produce a product
or project deliverable and the time frame for completion. The difficulty experienced
in estimating project costs and schedules depends on the type of project, the experi-
ence level of the project manager and project team, the number and type of resources
to be used, and the availability of historical estimating data. Use of previous projects
for comparison purposes, lessons learned, and established organizational processes will
affect the reliability of an estimate. Estimating is basically the process of producing
a guess or an approximation of project costs or time durations. It should include risk
assessments and an appropriate management and contingency reserve to address esti-
mating uncertainty.
   Pricing is generally the process of determining the appropriate amount to bill or
charge a client, customer, or receiver of a product or service. Pricing is considered to
be a business decision and is associated with profitability (or margin), the relationship
with clients, the general target market, and what the market will bear. Availability of
materials, difficulty of production, level of quality to be included, competition, and risk
factors are also associated with pricing.
   It is important to emphasize that one of the most crucial inputs in the pricing deci-
sion is the cost estimate or cost baseline of the proposed project. The process of
estimating actually begins before the proposal development process. It starts with

                                                                                                                      There are three major types of estimating techniques that may be used during

baseline.
Cost estimating relationships The output of cost models. Typical cost estimating
relationships (CERs) include:

   Mathematical equations based on regression analysis
   Cost-quantity relationships such as learning curves
   Cost to cost relationships
   Cost-non-cost relationships based on physical characteristics, technical parameters,
   or performance characteristics. There may be some relationships and interfaces that
   will not incur additional cost and will not affect the estimating process. Examples:
   internal transfer of documents, use of support resources that are not billed back to
   the project.
Direct cost A funding amount or price of something that can be completely attributed
to the production of specific goods or services. Examples: supplies, equipment, and
man-hours to produce the deliverable.
Estimating The process of calculating the likely cost of a project, product or service.
It may be a formal or informal process. The act of determining the likely cost of con-
struction works on behalf of either clients or contractors. Determining the probable
cost of future work and/or possible scope changes.
Estimating groups These are people or departments that estimate the cost of new
work without soliciting input from the functional managers. The success of this group
is based upon the quality of the estimating database.
Estimating teams On some projects, the initial group of people assigned to the proj-
ect are functional subject matter experts with knowledge of functional estimating stan-
dards. Once the estimating team completes their tasks, they may be replaced by other
functional employees who will be doing the actual work.
Feasibility study A process to determine if a business idea is capable of being
achieved by an organization. A study of the applicability or ability to develop and
deliver a proposed action or plan.
Forward pricing rates These are long-term forecasts on the salary of the workers
two or three years ahead. This is for estimating on long-term projects. Forward pricing
rates are also used on overhead costs and material costs.
Fully loaded or fully burdened rate The total cost of a resource including salary and
all overhead costs such as benefits. The total of all costs associated with maintaining a
resource. Many organizations establish reference tables that provide the fully burdened
rates of its employees for use in project cost estimating. The estimate may be based
upon a department or pay grade fully loaded rate.
Indirect cost Costs that are not directly associated with a single activity, event, or
other cost object. These costs are frequently aggregated into an overhead cost pool and
allocated to various activities

     Activities, Questions, and Exercises

Refer to Chapter 13 of Project Management: A Systems Approach to Planning,
Scheduling, and Controlling (12th edition) for supporting information. Review each of
the following questions or exercises and provide the answers in the space provided.
   The following questions and exercises are associated with the knowledge areas of
the PMBOK(R) Guide--Sixth Edition: Project Cost Management and Project Time
Management. There is also a relationship to Project Risk Management.


                                          Remember
The reliability of estimating types is a key factor in the planning process.
The type of project, especially where new technology is involved or where
a new product is being developed, may require several adjustments to the
prepared estimates as the project proceeds. This is accomplished through
progressive elaboration.


 1. Review each of the following estimating methods and match with the appropriate
    descriptions and characteristics for each.

    Estimating Method              Generic Type         WBS Relationship    Accuracy
    a. Parametric (or ROM)
    b. Analogy (analogous
       or budgetary)
    c. Engineering or grass
       roots (also bottom up
       or definitive)

     Generic types:                              WBS relationships:        Accuracy:
     ROM (rough order of magnitude)              Top down                  -25% to +75%
     Budget                                      Bottom up                 -10% to +25%

                                   Remember
Variable costs and fixed costs should be considered when planning the
project budget. Variable costs are costs that may change during the proj-
ect life cycle, including material costs, supplies, and salaries. Maintain an
awareness of the use of collective bargaining units or resources that may
be associated with contractual salary or wage increases at points in time
during the project life cycle. Fixed costs generally do not change and may
be associated with nonrecurring or recurring activities. Fixed costs may
include rentals, one-time setup, or leases.


8. PM Quick Check: Using the technique of analogous estimating is also associated
   with the technique known as:
   a. Scope decomposition
   b. Scope definition
   c. Feasibility analysis
   d. Expert judgment
9. PM Quick Check: Before developing the project cost estimates for resources
   the project manager should consider the following organizational expense items:
   building maintenance, fringe benefits, group insurance, office supplies, clerical
   support, postage, retirement plans, sick leave, vacation pay. These items are gener-
   ally associated with:
   a. Contractor direct costs
   b. Overhead rates or costs
   c. Variable costs
   d. External costs

 Depreciation: The reduction in the balance sheet of a company asset to
 reflect its loss of value through age and wear. The decline in the value
 of a capital asset. Depreciation represents a cost of ownership and
 the consumption of an asset's useful life. Generally deductible for tax
 purposes.

 A Problem to Consider: Estimating Person Days
Companies usually estimate work based upon man-months (person-months). If the
work must be estimated in person-weeks, the person-month is then converted to per-
son-weeks. The problem is in the determination of how many person-hours per month
are actually available for actual direct labor work.
   Your company has received a request for proposal (RFP) from one of your custom-
ers and management has decided to submit a bid. Only one department in your com-
pany will be required to perform the work and the department manager estimates that
3,000 hours of direct labor will be required.

   The cost baseline is developed after all costs have been aggregated. The project
cost is allocated across each phase of the project and is managed as a time phased
budget that allows the project costs to be monitored as the project progresses through
each phase.
   Sunk costs are those costs that have been incurred and are generally not considered
when making decisions about the future of the project.
   Opportunity cost is generally considered the loss of revenue that is experienced
when one project is selected over another or when funds are held for one project that
could have been used to generate revenue in another area or on
another more favorable project.                                        Additional tips and prac-

 5. The WBS provides the details of the project activities and allows the team to determine
    the resource requirements and other cost factors to produce a more accurate estimate.
6. A sunk cost is an expenditure that has been incurred while working on a proj-
   ect and cannot be recovered. It is not considered when making decisions about
   the future disposition of the project. Opportunity cost is associated with the loss
   of revenue that could have been attained from one project by holding funds for
   another project.

 Chapter fourteen 



Cost Control



Project cost control includes the processes of monitoring project work activities,
assessing project performance in terms of the variance between planned costs and
actual costs, determining the cause of the variances whether good or bad, tracking and
recording of project data, and taking corrective action as necessary to return project
performance to acceptable levels.
    Key point: Monitoring is tracking performance and control is taking the necessary
steps to correct unfavorable situations. Project managers must do both monitoring and
control.
    Cost control processes, which are often company standardized, are part of integrated
change control and should be introduced to the project team at the start of the project
and especially during the kickoff meeting. The control processes should be agreed to
by all project personnel who are responsible for incurring costs during the project life
cycle.
    Generally, cost control includes managing costs after the project budget has been
approved, cost accounting (managing cash inflows and outflows), and identifying and
correcting unacceptable variances.
    The project budget, prepared by the project manager and project team, includes the
estimated cost of all project deliverables, including the materials, equipment, resources,
and all activities required to produce the deliverables. The budget also includes any
overhead costs, indirect costs, and reserves have been included to address potential
project risk events.
    Typically, the project manager is held accountable for the successful management
and control of project costs and must be prepared to act quickly when project costs
appear to be approaching an unacceptable variance from the plan. Continuous monitor-
ing of project performance, analysis of variances, and identification of possible solu-
tions and alternatives that may be utilized to correct variances are all included in the
list of project manager responsibilities.
    The project manager's main objectives regarding cost control are to maximize the
probability of completing the project within the approved budget by keeping actual
costs at or below planned levels, to minimize the use of available contingency reserves,
and to maximize company profits, or to minimize overall expenses (depending on the
type of project).

dened direct labor or direct cost) on work that has been completed within a given time
period. Also known as AC, or actual cost.
Baseline The original approved plan for a project. There are three major baselines
associated with a project: the scope baseline, the schedule baseline, and the cost base-
line or project budget.
Benefit-cost ratio (BCR) An indicator, used in the formal discipline of cost-benefit
analysis, that attempts to summarize the overall value for money of a project or pro-
posal. A BCR is the ratio of the benefits of a project or proposal, expressed in mone-
tary terms, relative to its costs, also expressed in monetary terms. All benefits and costs
should be expressed in discounted present values.
Budget at completion (BAC) The sum of the total work authorized budgets for a
project. Sum of the budgets for each phase of a project.
Budgeted cost of work performed (BCWP) Amount budgeted or planned to be
expended for work that has been completed. Also known as earned value. The amount
that had been planned to be spent for the work that has been completed. The earned
value is compared with the actual cost. The difference between earned value and actual
cost is the cost variance.
Budgeted cost of work scheduled (BCWS) The budgeted amount of work that has
been scheduled to be completed at the time of measurement. Also known as planned
value. This is the amount that was planned to be paid for the work that was scheduled
to be completed by the time of the actual measurement.
Contingency The planned allotment of time and cost for unforeseeable elements that
may be associated with project planning. A planned reaction or response established to
address an event that may or may not happen.
Contract cost The summation of the cost baseline and the management reserve.
Contract Price The summation of the contract cost and the profit anticipated.
Corrective action Changes made to bring expected future performance of the project
in line with the plan. Actions taken to return project performance to the planned level
or performance or to an acceptable level.
Cost baseline The summation of the distributed (or time-phased) budget and the
undistributed budget. The total project cost including reserves allocated across the
project life cycle.
Cost control The process of controlling variances to the planned costs of a project.
Managing to remain within a predetermined project budget throughout its various
stages or phases.
Cost performance index The cost efficiency ratio of earned value to actual costs,
expressed as the formula CPI = BCWP/ACWP or CPI = EV/AC. It is often used to
predict the magnitude of a possible cost overrun using the formula BAC/CPI =
projected cost at completion or EAC.

Schedule performance index (SPI) The schedule efficiency ratio or earned value




                                                                                               Cost Control
accomplished against the planned value. The SPI describes what portion of the planned
schedule was actually accomplished. SPI = BCWP/BCWS or EV/PV.
Schedule variance Any difference between the scheduled completion of an activity
and the actual completion of the activity. In earned value, BCWP - BCWS or EV - PV.
Scope creep The uncontrolled and unauthorized changes to the project scope. Usually
results in greater cost, lower quality, and unfavorable performance variances.
Undistributed budget A sum of money that you intend to spend but that hasn't been
allocated yet to the work breakdown structure elements or possibly to work authoriza-
tion forms. Undistributed budgets and distributed budgets make up the cost baseline.
Variance Any deviation from the plan, whether favorable or unfavorable.
Work breakdown structure (WBS) A deliverable-oriented grouping of project ele-
ments that organizes and defines the total scope of the project. Each descending level
represents an increasingly detailed definition of the project work.
Work package A deliverable at the lowest level of the work breakdown structure.


 Study Notes: EVM Formulas: A Brief Review and Study Tool
Remember: PMI refers to earned value (BCWP) as EV, planned value (BCWS) as PV,
and actual cost (ACWP) as AC.
  Formulas to remember:

CV or cost variance =                    BCWP - ACWP           or EV - AC
SV or schedule variance =                BCWP - BCWS           or EV - PV
CPI or cost performance index =          BCWP/ACWP             or EV/AC
SPI or schedule performance index =      BCWP/BCWS             or EV/PV
CV % or cost variance percent =          CV/BCWP               or CV/EV
SV % or schedule variance percent =      SV/BCWS               or SV/PV

   EAC or estimate at completion = ACWP + ETC or AC + ETC where ETC is the
estimate to complete. This formula is used when the original estimates appear to be
questionable or are no longer relevant due to changes in the project. (ETC refers to
work that has not been performed and is therefore an estimate of cost.)
   EAC = AC (cumulative) + BAC - EV (cumulative) where BAC is the Budget at
Completion. This formula is used when the variances experienced are atypical and
similar variances are not expected to occur as work proceeds.
   EAC = AC (cumulative) + [BAC - EV (cumulative)] divided by CPI (cost perfor-
mance index). This formula is used when variance experiences are typical and will
continue to be observed as the project continues.

VAC or variance at completion =    BAC - EAC
Project cost at completion =       BAC/CPI (also referred to as EAC)

                                    Remember
The estimating process is the key to cost management. Make sure that
your estimates have been obtained from reliable sources. Generally, esti-
mates should be provided by the functional managers or subject matter
experts that will perform the work. Remember that estimates are actu-
ally guesses or approximations and many factors can impact the accu-
racy of an estimate. Risk should always be considered when developing
estimates.

6. A customer (homeowner) hires a contractor to tile five identical rooms in his home.
   The customer purchased the tiles and the contractor will be reimbursed for labor
   only. Because the tiles are difficult to work with, the contractor assumes two days
   per room at eight hours per day and at $100 per hour. The planned cost is $8,000
   but overtime will also be paid, if necessary, at the same rate of $100 per hour.
      The first room was completed in three days because of difficulty in workman-
   ship and getting an understanding of how to use these special tiles. This included
   two hours of overtime. The second room was completed in two days. Using
   EVMS, the following information would be presented to the homeowner at the end
   of the first week:
    PV = 5 x 800 = $4,000
    EV = 4 x 800 = $3,200
    AC = 42 x 100 = $4,200
    BAC = $8,000
            SV = EV - PV = -$800
    CV = EV - AC = -$1,000
    EAC = (AC/EV) x BAC = $10,500
            VAC = BAC - EAC = -$2,500
    ETC = EAC - BAC = $6,300
    Percent complete = EV/BAC = 40%
    SPI = EV/PV = 0.8
    CPI = EV/AC = 0.76
     Now it is your turn. Having tiled the floors, you now hire a contractor to wall
   paper all of the walls in each of the five rooms. Once again, you purchase the
   wallpaper and will reimburse the contractor just for labor. The contractor works at
   $100 per hour and estimates eight hours of work per room, for a total of five days.

 Chapter Fifteen 



Metrics



Today, almost every company uses project management, and the differentiation is
whether they are simply good at project management or whether they truly excel at
project management. Studies have indicated that companies using project manage-
ment effectively have included a formal process for measuring, tracking results, and
reporting performance through metrics. A business metric is a quantifiable measure
that is used to track and assess the status of a specific business process. This defini-
tion also applies to project management. When determining which metrics to use, it is
important to note that they should be intended to address the decision-making needs
of key stakeholders involved in the project. These stakeholders may include investors,
customers, sponsors, executive committees, and different types of employees. Every
area of a business has specific set performance metrics that should be monitored -
marketers track marketing and social media metrics, such as campaign and program
statistics, sales teams monitor sales performance metrics such as new opportunities
and leads, and executives look at big picture financial metrics. Every area of project
management, such as cost, time, quality, and risk, should also have a set of perfor-
mance metrics.
    Advances in measurement techniques and available performance tracking soft-
ware have given companies the opportunity to look at new metrics, including bene-
fits expected, value created, safety, risk, customer satisfaction, image, reputation, and
many others. With these new techniques and tools, executives, sponsors, and project
managers are now able to make informed decisions based upon evidence rather than
merely upon guesses about the health of the projects.
    Many organizations, especially those with project management offices in place, uti-
lize a project management information system (PMIS) to gather, store, analyze, and
disseminate project performance data. The PMIS can provide significant benefits if
designed properly. These benefits include:
   Relatively quick access to project performance information: activities completed,
   activities in progress, activities that are late, cost and schedule information, earned
   value data
   Satisfying the information needs for the various stakeholders in a timely manner

     The Ground Rules for Metrics

There are certain ground rules that should be established as part of the metric selection
process:
   Make sure that the metrics are worth collecting.
   Make sure that we use what we collect.
   Make sure that the metrics are informative.
   Train the team in the use and value of metrics.



     Glossary of Terms

Balanced score card The balanced scorecard is a strategic planning and management
system used extensively in business and industry, government, and nonprofit organi-
zations worldwide to align business activities to the vision and strategy of the orga-
nization, improve internal and external communications, and monitor organization
performance against strategic goals.
Critical success factor A management term for an element that is necessary for an
organization or project to achieve its mission. Examples: market share, customer satis-
faction, leadership capability
Dashboard A management tool used to provide an overview of enterprise health or
project health. A tool for displaying complex sets of indicators.
Key performance indicator A measurable value that demonstrates how effectively
a company is achieving key business objectives. Organizations use KPIs at multiple
levels to evaluate their success at reaching targets. High-level KPIs may focus on the
overall performance of the enterprise, while low-level KPIs may focus on processes in
departments such as sales, marketing, or a call center.
Measurement A value made meaningful by quantifying into specific units.
Measurements act as labels that make those values more useful in terms of details.
Metric A quantifiable measure used to track, monitor, and assess the success or fail-
ure of various processes, projects, and business activities. The main goal of using met-
rics is to communicate a company's progression toward certain long- and short-term
objectives
Project management information system A system or combination of systems that
is designed to allow an organization to gather, store, analyze, and distribute informa-
tion about projects, programs, and or operations.
Value The importance, worth, or usefulness of something. A fair return in goods,
services, or money for something exchanged. Business value is an informal term
that includes all forms of value used to determine the health and well-being of an

Trade-off Analysis in a
Project Environment



Ideally, a project manager will create an environment that will lead to the completion
of a project on time, within budget, and according to scope and quality requirements,
and will achieve a level of customer satisfaction that can generate additional busi-
ness. In a perfect project environment, this would be relatively easy to achieve if the
requirements were well defined at the start, a well-thought-out plan was in place, the
team was fully trained on the technology involved, the team was ready to handle any
possible change, and risk events were minimal. In actual practice projects seldom
progress exactly as planned. Customers and other stakeholders request changes; the
business, economic, and political environments do not always provide favorable con-
ditions; people make mistakes; estimates are often flawed; work items are omitted or
overlooked; conflicts occur; and team members are changed more frequently than we
would like (churn or turnover of project teams can create rework, impede progress,
and create conflicts).
   This more realistic project environment drives the project manager and team to
continually assess project performance throughout the life of the project to determine
where significant variances to the plan may be occurring. The project team must also
work within a number of constraints that are generally inflexible. This creates a neces-
sity to determine where trade-offs (the giving up of one item to satisfy another need)
must be considered. Project managers must be willing to analyze situations and decide
on actions in a give-and-take project environment. Today we refer to these trade-off
factors as competing demands. Competing demands may include time, cost, quality,
risk, scope, resources, safety, aesthetics, social acceptance, and the values expressed by
the client and organization performing the project work.
   The time, cost, performance triangle, known as the triple constraint, was considered
to be the "magic combination" that provided the basis for project trade-off decisions and
kept the project manager continuously pursuing a balance of these elements to achieve
project success. In the current project management environment, business value is the
key factor in determining success. Completing a project on time, within budget, and
according to scope does not necessarily indicate success. Customers are expecting long-
term value for their business investments. This is generally associated with return on

constraint implies that any change to one of these elements will generally have an impact
on one or both of the other elements. Usually depicted as a triangle, the triple constraint has
generally been replaced with a broader emphasis on a combination of competing demands
that include but are not limited to time, cost, quality, scope, risk, resources, and safety.


     Activities, Questions, and Exercises

Refer to Chapter 16 of Project Management: A Systems Approach to Planning,
Scheduling, and Controlling (12th edition) for supporting information. Review each of
the following questions or exercises and provide the answers in the space provided.
   The following questions and exercises are associated with the knowledge areas of the
PMBOK(R) Guide--Sixth Edition: all knowledge areas, particularly Scope Management,
Schedule Management, Cost Management, Quality Management, and Risk Management.


                                          Remember
There are two major elements of the trade-off analysis process:
 Identifying and displaying how alternatives perform or affect a situation
 or defined criteria
 Assisting stakeholders in articulating and applying their personal val-
 ues to a problem in a rational way to achieve mutual agreement and a
 decision


   Study notes: There are some generally accepted approaches in the trade-off analy-
sis process:
   Trade-off analysis is a systemic approach to managing the competing demands of
time, cost, quality, risk, resources, and performance (scope or specifications). During
the project life cycle, information from cost reviews, schedule reports, and other forms
of project reviews are compared to the original plan to identify variances and potential
problems or opportunities. This information can be used to support the following gen-
erally accepted activities associated with making trade-off decisions.
   Engage the project team in a process-oriented approach to analyze situations and
   lead to consensus.
   Utilize mathematical models and optimization calculations to determine the best
   available plan of action.
   Include key stakeholders in the decision process to maintain engagement and support.
   Recognize potential conflicts that may develop between stakeholders and determin-

may significantly affect a trade-off decision.
   When conducting trade-off analysis, the project manager and other decision makers
will assess the incremental cost of the trade-off, determine how it will resolve or miti-
gate the problem, or improve a situation, and whether an alternative is worth doing.
The process also includes ranking alternatives from best to worst using specific criteria
for comparison.

 2. You are the project manager for a project that is showing a schedule slippage in the
    status report. The report also shows that the budget is under-running the costs for
    the work that has been performed. What are the possible actions you may take to
    correct the schedule slippage? There are several possible answers.




 3. The customer for your project insists on adding requirements that will increase
    the project scope. You are 50% complete with the project when the customer
    introduces a significant change in the configuration of a major deliverable. What
    actions may be taken to address this situation and what are the possible trade-offs
    that could be negotiated?

off decision is required and obtain information about the causes of the problem or the
need for the trade-off. Consider the risks and potential consequences associated with
trade-off decisions.
    Document why corrective action is necessary and consider several alternatives
before deciding on the action to taken.
    Document the rationale behind a trade-off decision and record in a lessons-learned
file or historical database.
    The triple constraint provides a fundamental model for understanding the effects
of trade-off decisions related to schedule, cost, and scope. Changing the value of one
element of the triple constraint will cause a change or require some type of trade-off or
adjustment to at least one other element

    Answers to Questions and Exercises

 1. The triple constraint generally refers to the relationship of three project baselines:
    schedule, cost, and quality or performance specifications.
2. The first step would be to determine the severity of the slippage. It may be early
   in the project and the slippages may not be on the critical path. Overtime could
   be used or additional resources brought. The best approach is not to jump to con-
   clusions or solutions. Obtain information about causes and then make a decision
   when you have all of the available data.
3. Start by ensuring that the change control process is followed. Identify and discuss
   the risks associated with the change request. Alternatives include negotiating for
   more time and more resources, and recommending the initiation of a new project
   after the completion of the current project.
4. Resource availability, imposed start and end dates, skill of the resources, contrac-
   tual milestones, available funding
5. SMART
6. a, d, e, g, i
 7. a and d
8. There are many possible responses. Also consider the trade-offs associated with
   each decision.

  Chapter Seventeen 



Risk Management



The word "risk" is generally associated with danger, or the possibility of a negative experi-
ence. In the financial environment it involves the chance that an investment's actual return
will differ from the expected return, and includes the possibility of losing some or all of
the original business investment. Risk in the project management environment is associ-
ated with both threats (or negative outcomes) and opportunities (or positive outcomes).
Risk is actually a measure of uncertainty. During project planning, risk is assessed by con-
sidering the probability of and consequences associated with a specific event or occurrence
that could result in the failure to achieve a defined project objective or a milestone. Risk is
also associated with potential opportunities that may enhance a project outcome.
   Risk is often viewed from a negative perspective, and the focus of the project man-
ager and team is commonly directed toward managing the harmful, undesired con-
sequences, and expected losses that may occur. It is important to note that decisions
about risk are also associated with the potential to experience beneficial results, such as
reduced cost and greater productivity.
   Project risk management includes the processes associated with planning for risks,
identification of risks, prioritization of risks through analysis, responding to risks, and
monitoring and controlling the project to prepare for new risks or mitigate existing
risks that may be harmful. The objectives of project risk management are to increase
the probability and impact of positive risks (opportunities) and decrease the probability
and impact of negative risks (threats).The processes for risk management as described
in the PMBOK(R) Guide (Sixth Edition) are:
   Plan risk management
   Identify risks
   Perform qualitative risk analysis
   Perform quantitative risk analysis
   Plan risk responses
   Implement risk responses
   Monitor risk responses

Delphi technique A method of decision making that involves obtaining the opinion
of selected experts without bringing them together face to face. The Delphi method
utilizes subject matter experts whose identities may remain anonymous to the other
experts involved in the research, to minimize bias and influence from other experts.
The process includes two or more rounds where the experts provide input, the input is
assessed by the initiator, information is returned to the experts for review and revision,
and then returned to the initiator for final assessment and decision.

by the probability of its occurrence.
Impact The effect resulting from a realized threat or a defined vulnerability.
Insurable risk Also known as "pure" risk. A risk that will only result in loss: fire,
theft, personal injury, direct property damage, legal liability.
Maximin criterion Also known as the Wald criterion. The decision maker is con-
cerned about loss and views risk from a pessimistic perspective.
Maximax criterion Also known as the Hurwicz criterion. An optimistic approach to
risk whereby the decision maker is optimistic about the results and attempts to maxi-
mize the benefits of a decision.
Mitigation The act of making a condition or consequence less severe. The reduction
in probability and/or impact of an adverse risk event so that it is within acceptable
threshold limits, without changing the objectives of the project.
Monte Carlo simulation A method of generating values from a known distribution.
Using random variables to produce failure times. A computerized technique that uses
sampling from a random number sequence to simulate characteristics or events or out-
comes with multiple possible values. Monte Carlo simulation is used to generate prob-
able outcomes of a project based on available data that is processed many thousands of
times to provide probable project results and information for project decision making.
Nominal group technique A group process involving brainstorming for problem
identification, solution generation, and decision making. It involves the use of a voting
process to ensure that everyone's opinion is taken into account.
Non-risk events Variability: Uncertainty about characteristics of a planned event
or activity. Examples: Productivity changes, number of errors found, unseasonable
weather.
Ambiguity: A deficit of knowledge about a particular planning item. Very vague infor-
mation that requires gap analysis to define more clearly the potential risks.
Probability A measure of how likely an event is to occur. A number expressing a ratio
of favorable cases to the whole number of cases. Chance, odds, occurrence of uncertain
events.

 Risk Management Processes: A Brief Review
The following processes are generally associated with the knowledge area project risk
management. These processes are shown as sequential, although in practice many
of these process actions can be performed concurrently. It is important to remem-
ber that risk management begins with project planning and remains an ongoing pro-
cess through each phase of the project life cycle. Refer to the PMBOK(R) Guide (Sixth
Edition) for more information about the details associated with each process

   Organizational process assets

   Tools and Techniques
   Expert judgment
   Data analysis: Risk data quality assessment (determining the reliability of the
   data source and the accuracy of the data obtained), risk probability and impact
   assessment
   Interpersonal and team skills
   Risk categorization: Organizing risks by source
   Communication: Probability and impact matrix
   Meetings
   Risk urgency assessment: Determining which risks have the greatest priority based
   on time frame and must be addressed first

   Other factors that may impact the prioritization of risks
   Urgency
   Proximity: Period of time before the risk might have an impact on one or more proj-
   ect objectives
   Dormancy: Period of time that may elapse before the risk impact is discovered
   Manageability
   Controllability
   Detectability
   Connectivity: How the risk is related to other risks
   Strategic impact
   Propinquity: The degree to which a risk is perceived to matter by an individual or a
   group

   Outputs
   Project documents updates: Assumption logs, issues log, risk register, risk report.
   A specific document that will be updated is the risk register. The relative ranking or
   priority of the identified risks is provided in the risk register.
   Risk register contents: A list of risks identified by project stakeholders, a risk rating
   and ranking determined by probability and impact, causes for the risk, possible risk
   responses, risk owner, risk status, and watch lists for low-priority risks

Perform Quantitative Risk Analysis
This is the process of reviewing and prioritizing risk events that have been identified
and prioritized during qualitative analysis but require further consideration and more
rigorous analysis.

                                    Remember
A very effective tool for identifying project risks is the work breakdown
structure. The WBS displays the project activities and the complexity of
the project and can be used by the project team to identify and then
prioritize risks associated with each major deliverable or at the work
package level. The work breakdown structure can be used to create a
risk breakdown structure that will enable the team to categorize project
risks.

                                                                                                                     This is shown in the following figure:




                                                                                                             304
  At this point, it certainly looks as if you are better off self-publishing. But suppose




                                                                                                   Risk Management
your cost of self-publishing (i.e., materials, printing, marketing, advertising, etc.) is
$600,000. This is an expense that must be subtracted from your revenue of $715,000.
The result is shown in the figure below:




   In the box on the left, you see the two options at this point: $70,500 income if you go
with the publisher and $115,000 if you self-publish. Therefore, $115,000 will go in the
box on the left and, based upon probability theory, the best decision is to self-publish.
While mathematically this might appear as the right decision, there is still another con-
sideration. What happens if the author self-publishes and the market is weak? The author
will receive $50,000 but may have expenses in the hundreds of thousands of dollars. The
author can then lose a considerable sum of money. So, even though the solution says to
self-publish, there is still a concern over the author's tolerance for risk.


Decision Tree Analysis
You are considering the decision whether to purchase a machine for internal produc-
tion or to subcontract the work to an external source. The following information has
been provided by your financial managers:
   Cost to purchase the machine: $35,000
   Cost to subcontract the work: $5,000
   Probability of a good market = 70%
   Probability of a poor market = 30%
   Reward if the prediction occurs:
   In the purchase machine decision good market scenario: $80,000; in the poor market
scenario: $30,000
   In the subcontract decision good market scenario: $50,000; in the poor market sce-
nario: $15,000

                                     Remember
Project managers must be capable of managing in an uncertain environ-
ment. The project environment will change continuously, and a proactive
approach to risk management will help to minimize surprises and prepare
the project team to respond effectively to risk situations. Remember, risk
management is not a one-time event. It is applied through the entire life
cycle of the project.


46. Here's an effective tool for the project manager's toolbox. The project plan is actu-
    ally an integrated plan that includes elements of all 10 knowledge areas of the
    PMBOK(R) Guide. Create a checklist for managing risk by listing all ten knowl-
    edge areas and then, working with the project team, identify the risks that may
    be encountered in each knowledge area. This technique will help the project team
    develop a broader understanding of the project and further illustrate how a project
    actually works as a system.

56. 1.0. The sum of all probabilities will equal 1. Using the rolling of one die as an
    example, there are six possible outcomes: 1/6 + 1/6 +1/6 +1/6 + 1/6 + 1/6 = 1.0
57. 80% x 60% = 48%. There is a 60% chance the project will finish within budget
    (40% chance of being over budget = 60% of being within budget).
58. Mean = 23.67 (optimistic + 4 times the most likely + pessimistic) / 6
    Standard deviation = 4.67 (pessimistic - optimistic) / 6
    Probability of completing the project between 14.33 weeks and 33.01 weeks = 95%
    Mean of 23.67 minus two standard deviations = 14.33. The mean plus two stan-
    dard deviations = 33.01. In normal distribution the probability of achieving a result
    with two standard deviations is 95%.
59. It forces us to focus on the future where uncertainty exists and to develop suitable
    plans of action to prevent potential issues from becoming problems and adversely
    impacting the project.
60. A risk has a probability of occurring. An issue has occurred and does not have prob-
    ability. It is an occurrence that requires attention. Examples: Risk: A fire could
    occur in an equipment room. Issue: A fire has occurred. Risk: An employee may
    leave for a new assignment. Issue: An employee has submitted notice of resignation.
61. Sensitivity analysis is a technique used to determine how different values of an
    independent variable impact a particular dependent variable under a given set of
    assumptions. It is typically presented in the form of a tornado diagram.

    (impact).

Learning Curves



Learning curves were first introduced into the business world in 1936 by T. P. Wright.
Wright described a theory for obtaining estimates based on repetitive production of air-
plane assemblies. The concept of learning curves has since been used for estimating
all types of projects and programs from manufacturing to the space shuttle program.
Learning curves are also known as progress functions and experience curves.
   The theory of learning curves is based on the concept that repeating the same process or
operation many times results in a reduction in the time and effort required to complete the
process. Most people experience learning curves when they try a new product for the first
time, when a new software application is used, or when a new tool has been introduced
to a work process. The first time the tool is used or the process or operation is performed
may take a considerable amount of effort to use properly and may produce errors as the
learning progresses. The more the process, operation, or tool is used or performed the bet-
ter the operator becomes at working with it. This reduces overall effort and decreases the
actual time to complete the operation. The learning curve theory as written by Wright states
that the direct labor hours necessary to complete a unit of production will decrease by a
constant percentage each time production quantity is doubled. Learning curves are used to
emphasize time, but the principle can be related to cost also. (Information adapted from the
National Aeronautics and Space Administration: Cost Estimating Processes.)
   Learning curves are most useful when managing projects or operations that involve
developing and estimating large quantities of deliverables or units. The cost of produc-
ing the first unit may be relatively easy to calculate, but the challenge is to determine
the cost of the 100th, 1,000th, or 10,000th unit. The learning curve process is used to
determine those costs and becomes a useful estimating tool.
   Basically, learning curves are a graphical representation of the familiar principle that as
a task is performed repeatedly, the better one gets at it. Learning curves show the rate of
improvement in performing a task as a function of time, or the rate of change in average
cost (in hours or dollars) as a function of cumulative output. The concept is commonly
used in resource requirements planning. Learning curves are also employed in setting
incentive rate schemes based on the statistical findings that, as the cumulative output is
doubled, the average unit cost declines by a constant percentage. For example, an 80%
learning curve means the "per unit" average cumulative cost (in hours or dollars) falls to
80% of the previous per unit average cumulative cost as the cumulative output doubles.

   Learning curves have the following properties:
   The time required to perform a task decreases as the task is repeated.
   Manufacturing man-hours will decrease by a fixed percentage each time production
   is doubled.
   The rate of improvement has sufficient consistency to allow its use as a prediction tool.
   The following figure shows a typical learning when plotted in Cartesian coordinates.




                Standard Learning Curves

   As the number of units produced increases, the time required for each unit
decreases. Most companies use hours on the Y-axis rather than cost because cost can
change resulting from salary, overhead, and raw material price increases.
   Most companies plot learning curves on log-log paper rather than in Cartesian coor-
dinates. When this is done, the curve will appear as a straight line as shown in the fol-
lowing figure.




                Standard Learning Curves

   If the figure represents an 80% learning curve, then each time production doubles,
the rate of learning will be at the same 80%. As an example, if the 100th unit produced
required 300 hours, then the 200th unit produced would be 80% times 300 hours, or
240 hours. The 400th unit produced would then be 80% of the time needed for the
200th unit, or 80% x 240 hours, which equals 192 hours.
   Learning curves are more appropriate for labor-intensive product lines rather than
automated product lines because people can learn, whereas capital equipment does not
learn. An 80% learning curve is better than a 90% learning curve.

   Learning cannot continue forever. Sometimes learning becomes "pegged" at a spe-
cific level, as shown in the next figure. The pegged level becomes the standard for esti-
mating the time and cost of producing a unit.

                                                                                                                   A. What is the average cost per unit for the first 100 units?

                                                                                                                       From the table, the 100th unit is $92.
                                                                                                                   C. According to learning curve theory, if production doubles to 200 units, the 200th
                                                                                                                      unit should require only 75% of the 100th unit. Is that correct?
                                                                                                                       75% x $92 = $69, which matches the entry in the above table.
                                                                                                                   D. If you have already produced 100 units and you have a customer who wants to
                                                                                                                      purchase another 100 units, what is your average cost per unit for that customer for

                                                                                                                      table at the beginning of the problem, assume that the last two columns are costs
                                                                                                                      rather than hours. Your company has produced 400 units thus far, and next year



                                                                                                             322

                                                                                                   Learning Curves
    and management wants to keep the price fixed for the entire year, using the learning
    curve for pricing what should be the fixed selling price of the product, assuming a
    10% profit margin is desired? This is an example of midpoint pricing.
    The cost for the 400th unit is $52 per unit.
    The cost for the 600th unit is $44 per unit.
    Using midpoint pricing, the selling price = ($52 + $44) / 2 = $48
    Adding in a 10% profit, $48 x (1.10) = $52.80


One more example
You have already produced 200 units, and a new customer appears wanting to purchase
600 units. If your material cost is fixed at $60 per unit, a fully burdened hour is $110
and the above table represents labor hours only, how much should you charge the cus-
tomer if you wish to make a 10% profit (i.e., total cost)? Also assume 1500 hours of
manufacturing labor available per month and management support is 160 hours per
month for the duration of the project.

  Answer: Manufacturing labor hours for 600 units (unit 201 - 800): =
  (52,212 - 22,751) = 29,461 hours
  Support hours = (29,461/1500) x 160 =        3,142 hours
  Labor cost = (29,461 + 3,142) x $110 =       $3,586,330
  Total material cost = 600 units x $60 = $ 36,000
    $3,622,330
  10% profit = 362,233
  $3,984,563
   Now, let's add a small twist to this problem. Assume that learning is pegged when
the 500th unit is produced. In other words, for all units produced after the 500th unit is
manufactured, the hours needed for production of each unit will be at the hours needed
for the 500th unit. How much time is required to produce units 201 - 800?
   Units 201-500 require: 39,442 hours - 22,751 hours = 16,691 hours
   From the table, the 500th unit (the pegged point) = 47 hours
   Units 501-800 require: 300 units x 47 hours/unit = 14,100 hours.
   Therefore, total hours = 16,691 + 14,100 = 30,791 hours.

     PMP(R) and CAPM(R) Exams

The subjects in this chapter are most closely associated with the areas of the PMBOK(R)
Guide--Sixth Edition: Project Time Management and Project Cost Management.
  The basic principles of learning curves are:
 1. The time required to perform a task decreases as the task is repeated.
 2. The amount of improvement decreases as more units are produced.
 3. The rate of improvement has sufficient consistency to allow its use as a prediction tool.
   The learning curve theory is based on the principle that prac-
tice improves performance.                                                    Additional tips and prac-

 Chapter Nineteen 



Contract Management



Contract and procurement management include the processes associated with deter-
mining the products, services, materials, and equipment necessary for project imple-
mentation and the negotiations for the actual purchase, lease, or rental of those services
and products.
   Determining the type of materials, equipment, and resources necessary, and the
appropriate quantity or support level of each that must be obtained or acquired to suc-
cessfully complete project deliverables is a critical and often challenging process.
Negotiating the contracts and agreements that guide the buyer and seller through the
project life cycle can also be very challenging.
   In the contracting and procurement environment, there are two basic viewpoints: the
buyer's position and the seller's position. These two views are often opposing in areas
such as price, schedule, and quality and require effective negotiation to achieve mutu-
ally agreeable terms and conditions.
   The project procurement management process includes the activities that will be
used to determine what to purchase; how to purchase materials or resources; the prepa-
ration of documents that will be used in the process, including requests for proposal
(RFPs); selection of the appropriate qualified suppliers; preparing and approving the
contract; managing the contract; and closing or terminating the contract.
   Contracts create legal obligations for the buyer and seller. Before agreeing to the
obligations, each side will usually conduct a risk assessment to identify poten-
tial liabilities and attempt to mitigate any unfavorable conditions. The risks for the
buyer are generally different than those for the seller and depend on the type of con-
tract and the terms and conditions proposed in the contract. Contract types are gener-
ally selected based on the needs of the buyer and seller. Final terms and conditions
are determined when the buyer and seller have reviewed the information that is avail-
able about the project, the deliverables that must be produced, the environmental fac-
tors that may affect the project, and the ability of the supplier to meet the needs of the
buyer. A significant amount of negotiating may take place before a contract is finalized
and approved. Effective negotiating requires a high level of preparation and skill in
areas such as relationship building, problem solving, creativity, business and technical
knowledge, and willingness to compromise. The ability to plan and facilitate meetings

   operating environment of the project. This strategy is focused at the project level
   and is focused on speed of acquisition and meeting the specific needs of the project.
   Procurement planning generally involves the following decisions or objectives:
   Procure all goods and services from a single source.
   Procure all goods and services from multiple sources.
   Procure only a small portion of goods and services.
   Procure none of the goods and services (all production will take place internally).
   Procure goods and services from a sole source. Only one supplier is available and
   there is no choice but to use that supplier.
   Procurement management also includes the make-or-buy decision, the rent-or-lease
decision, the selection of suppliers, negotiation of the contract terms, selection of
contract type, and the administration of the contract throughout the project life cycle.
At project closeout the contract is reviewed to determine if all terms and conditions,
including all agreed upon deliverables, have been produced and are accepted.


     Glossary of Terms

Acceptance Unconditional agreement to an offer. The agreement creates the con-
tract as solid and binding on both sides. Prior to signing, any party is free to withdraw.
Acceptance is also associated with the hand-off of project deliverables. Acceptance cri-
teria for deliverables is usually specified and documented prior to the initiation of work
and includes a review functionality, quality, and defined scope,
Arbitration Arbitration is a form of alternative dispute resolution (ADR) and is used
for the resolution of disputes outside the courts. The parties involved in a dispute refer
the issue to arbitration by one or more persons (the "arbitrators"), and agree to be
bound by the arbitration decision.
Contracts may have clauses nominating arbitrators in advance for use if the need arises.
Bidder conference A meeting during which information is shared by the buyer to all
sellers who have an interest in presenting a bid or proposal. This is often referred to as
a meeting to provide an "equal level playing field."
Collective agreement Term for agreements made between employees and employers.
Usually involves trade unions. These are often covered by more than one organization
and can be seen as contracts but are not governed by contract law.
Condition A term of fundamental importance to the contract, the breach of which
may cause the contract to be terminated.
Consideration In a contractual agreement, each side benefits in some way and they
give each other some consideration. This would usually be a price paid by one in
exchange for goods supplied by the other. Consideration can be anything of value to
the other party and agreed upon as acceptable.

Project Procurement Management
This chapter refers to the PMBOK(R) Guide chapter "Project Procurement Management."
  The major processes of project procurement management are:
Plan procurements Documenting project procurement decisions. This process is con-
cerned with determining what products or services must be acquired from outside the
organization and what will be produced internally.
Conduct procurements The processes associated with obtaining seller responses,
selecting sellers, and awarding contracts.
Control procurements The processes associated with managing procurement rela-
tionships, monitoring contract performance, making changes and corrections to con-
tractual agreements, and closing the procurements.
The procurement management plan is a subsidiary of the project management plan and
includes guidance about how procurement will be coordinated, a time table for pro-
curement activities, metrics to be used for managing contracts, stakeholder roles and
responsibilities, constraints and assumptions, risk management issues, and direction
about the use of prequalified sellers.

vide the contractor with the greatest incentive for efficient and effective
economic performance.

 To Rent or to Lease: That Is the Question
The lease/rent decision is a financial endeavor that requires some analysis before mak-
ing a decision. Leases are usually longer term than renting. Consider the following
example. A company is willing to rent you a piece of equipment at a cost of $100 per
day. You can lease the equipment for $60 per day plus a one-time cost of $5000. What
is the breakeven point, in days, where leasing and renting are the same?

                              Let X be the number of days.
                                 $100 X = $5000 + $60 X
                                                
                                   Renting Leasing
                                 Solving, X = 125 days

   Ask open-ended questions: Why? Who? When?
   Probing: Ask questions that will help identify the other party's underlying needs.
   Example: I am not sure I understand why this point is so important to you. Can you
   explain your issues and concerns to help me understand?
   Control the documentation: Take notes or minutes to capture the information dis-
   cussed. This will help keep the results of the negotiation accurate and fair.
   Develop alternatives (BATNA, or best alternative to negotiated agreement): What
   other steps may be taken to satisfy specific needs? When the original negotiations
   toward an agreement are not successful, alternatives are introduced that may have a
   better chance of reaching agreement.
   Awareness of hygiene factors: Location selection for negotiations, type of table
   (round or rectangular), time of day, size of the room, room set-up, who sits facing
   the window, number of attendees.
   Set objectives for the minimum that will be accepted by the buyer or the maximum
   that will be offered by the seller.
   Do not offer your minimum or maximum objectives at the start of negotiations.
   These are your objectives and will help to measure your success.


                                    Remember
Negotiations should be planned for. The activities associated with negotia-
tions include:
 Developing objectives: What is the minimum that will be accepted?
 What is the maximum that will be offered?
 Evaluate the other party: Strengths, weaknesses.
 Define your strategy and tactics.
 Gather all the facts you can.
 Perform a complete price/cost analysis: Do your homework!
 Arrange the "hygiene factors" to accommodate the negotiations.

15. The final contract when agreed upon and signed is known as the
                       contract.
16. If work must begin before the contract has been through the complete approval and
    acceptance process to avoid late acquisition of resources (i.e., long-lead items) or
    to avoid potential environmental problems, a
    contract may be approved to allow work to begin while the formal approval pro-
    cess continues.


Contract Types
For the following questions, indicate "seller," "buyer," or both.
17. Who has the greatest risk in a firm fixed-price or lump sum contract?
18. Who has the greatest risk in a cost plus type of contract?
19. Who has the potential to benefit from a cost plus incentive fee contract?

20. In a cost plus fixed fee contract, who pays for all project costs?


21. In the cost reimbursable type contract, who generally has the greatest risk?


22. The cost plus percentage of cost contract (CPPC) reduces the motivation of the

Calculating Project Costs
Review each of the following examples and determine the final price paid by the buyer.
In some cases, a buyer and seller may negotiate an incentive-type project that will ben-
efit both sides if the conditions are met. Incentive contracts may be developed to speed
up completion of a project or reduce buyer costs.

  Example: Cost plus incentive fee contract
  Target cost    $100,000
  Target fee     $20,000
  Target price   $120,000
  Sharing ratio 70/30 (70% to buyer, 30% to seller)
  Actual cost    $90,000
  Additional fee = $100,000 - $90,000 (target cost - actual cost) = $10,000 x .30 =
  $3,000
  Total fee paid = $20,000 (agreed upon fee) plus $3,000 incentive = $23,000
  Total project price = $23,000 + $90,000 = $113,000

                                                                                                    Contract Management
of $14,000. If the seller performs the work at a lower cost than the $200,000, then the
seller will receive additional profit up to a maximum profit of $18,000. If the seller per-
forms the work for more than the target cost of $200,000, then the seller will receive
less profit, but at least the minimum of $4,000.
   The sharing ratio represents the amount of the overrun or underrun shared by
each party. The first number represents the buyer and the second number represents
the seller. If the work is performed below the target cost, the buyer keeps 80% of the
underrun and the seller keeps 20% of the underrun as extra profit up to a maximum
profit of $18,000. If the contract is overrun, the buyer pays 80% of the overrun and the
seller pays 20%, which is subtracted from the target profit as long as the profit is no
less than $4,000. This is shown in Figure 1:




    Figure 1 Principles of incentive contracts


  Consider the following example where the work is performed at $190,000.

  Cost saving is $10,000.
  Seller keeps 20% x 10,000 = $2,000 in extra profit.
  Seller's total profit is therefore $16,000.
  Seller will be reimbursed actual cost plus profit, which equals $206,000.

  Now let's assume the seller spent $240,000 performing the work.

  Cost overrun is $40,000.
  Buyer pays 80% or $32,000.
  Seller pays 20% of $40,000 or $8,000, which is subtracted from profits, resulting in
  a total profit of $6,000.
  Seller will be reimbursed actual cost plus profit, or $246,000.

Each type of contract has some degree of risk that is shared between the buyer and the
seller. Consider the following nine contract types:
 1. Cost plus incentive fee (CPIF)
 2. Cost plus award fee (CPAF)
 3. Firm fixed price (FFP)
4. Cost plus percentage of cost (CPPC)
 5. Cost sharing (CS)
6. Cost only (C)
 7. Firm fixed price with economic adjustment (FFE)
8. Fixed price incentive fee (FPIF)
9. Cost plus fixed fee (CPFF)

28. In Figure 2, label each of the nine triangles, which represent each contract type, as
    to how the risk is shared between the buyer and seller.

Procurement Options
There are four basic options available for procurement:
a. Procure all goods/services from a single source.
b. Procure all goods/services from multiple sources.
 c. Procure only a small portion of the goods/services.
d. Procure none of the goods/services.

Rent versus Lease
Your company has a need for some specialized equipment that can be leased or rented.
If you rent the equipment, the cost is $100 per day. If you prefer to lease the equipment,
which is usually for a longer period of time, the cost is $2,000 (nonrefundable payment)
plus $50 per day. What is the breakeven point where renting and leasing are the same?

  Let X = the breakeven number of days
  Renting = $100X
  Leasing = $2,000 + $50X
  Therefore, $100X = $2,000 + $50X

Solving for X, we find that X = 40 days. Therefore, if you plan on using the equipment
for less than 40 days, the cost-effective decision is to rent. For more than 40 days of
use, the correct decision is to lease.
44. Now it's your turn. A company needs some equipment for 120 days to meet
    contractual requirements. The rental cost is $200 per day and the leasing cost is
    $10,000 plus $75 per day. Should the company rent or lease?

Quality Management



Project Quality Management includes the processes that connect the organization's
quality policy with the planning, managing, and controlling of the activities and
project deliverables that have been defined to meet the project objectives and satisfy
the requirements of the stakeholders. The key to managing quality is to maintain a
continuous awareness that quality is defined by the customer. Quality management
is a process that should be continuously improving through the use of lessons
learned from previous projects, existing products and services, and customer inter-
actions. Lessons learned from quality management experiences can be a key factor
when planning for future products and services. They are also useful in develop-
ing strategies to retain existing customers, win back lost customers, and attract new
customers.
   The quality process includes planning for quality, organizing for quality, execut-
ing the work using quality guidelines, monitoring the work to identify variance,
solving problems by identifying causes of poor quality, replanning as necessary, and
establishing preventive measures to reduce defects and poor quality.
   There are several approaches and principles to achieving quality. These include:
   Determining the cost of quality; the cost of conformance and nonconformance
   Zero defect programs; Six Sigma
   Total quality management (TQM)
   Reliability engineering
   These approaches to achieving high-quality project and product outcomes and
others have been established by organizations worldwide and are being implemented
for the basic reason that quality is of strategic importance to a company and is a
major factor in delivering business value. Quality can be directly linked to profit-
ability and competitive positioning. It is an integral part of strategic planning, and it
requires an organization-wide commitment. Every employee in any organization is
responsible for quality.
   According to the sixth edition of the PMBOK(R) Guide, there are three major quality
management processes:

Grade A category assigned to products or services having the same functional use but
different technical characteristics. High grade generally refers to a greater number of
features and functionality. For example, a software application is considered high qual-
ity (no defects) but low grade (limited features and functions).
ISO 9000 A series of international standards that provides quality management guid-
ance and identifies quality system elements. ISO 9001 is a voluntary international stan-
dard for quality management systems. The ISO 9000 series are based on eight quality
management principles. The eight quality management principles are defined in ISO
9000:2005, Quality Management Systems--Fundamentals and Vocabulary, and in ISO
9004:2009. They are:

 1. Customer focus
 2. Leadership
 3. Involvement of people
4. Process approach
 5. System approach to management
6. Continual improvement
 7. Factual approach to decision making
8. Mutually beneficial supplier relationships

Kaizen Continuous incremental improvement of an activity to eliminate waste. From
the Japanese term for a process of continuous improvement using problem solving and
analysis techniques. A quality improvement process that involves all managers and
employees. From kai--change, and zen--make good.
Maintainability The ability of the product to be retained in or restored to a satisfac-
tory performance level when prescribed maintenance is performed.
Operability The degree to which a product can be operated safely.
Pareto diagram A chart used to graphically summarize and display the relative
importance of the differences between groups of data. A bar chart that displays fre-
quency of cause of failure from left to right--greatest frequency to least frequent.
Associated with the 80/20 rule--80% of outcomes can be attributed to 20% of all
causes for a given event.
Produce-ability The ability to produce the product with available technology and
workers and at an acceptable cost.
Quality An essential and distinguishing attribute of something or someone. A degree
or grade of excellence or worth. The totality of features and characteristics of a product
or service that bear on its ability to satisfy stated or implied needs.

1. The Shewhart chart, which was adapted by W. Edwards Deming as a basis for
   illustrating the quality management process, is associated with which of the
   following flows?
   a. Initiate, plan, execute, control, close
   b. Plan, do, check, act
   c. Prevention, inspection, internal failure, external failure
   d. Execute, analyze, respond, monitor
2. Deming postulated that 85% of all quality problems required:
   a. Employee action
   b. Statistical analysis
   c. Management initiative and action
   d. The use of control charts
3. Match the principles with the appropriate quality guru (Deming, Juran, Crosby,
   or Taguchi).
   Principle                                                       Guru
   a. Trilogy of quality improvement, quality planning,
      and quality control
   b. Design of experiments
   c. Pioneered statistics and sampling
   d. Fitness for use
   e. Achieving zero defects is possible.
   f. The legal implications of quality
   g. Workers can't do their best. They must be shown
      what constitutes acceptable quality.
   j. Conformance to specifications
   i. Quality is measured by the cost of nonconformance.
   j. Cost to correct problems rises the further the results
      are from target.
   k. Quality comes from prevention.

4. Which of the following are true about Taguchi's approach to quality?
   a. Quality should be designed into the product.
   b. Quality should be inspected into the product.
   c. Senior management must take a visible role in managing defects.
   d. The cost of quality is associated with nonconformance.
   e. Cost of quality is measured as a function of deviation from the standard.

 Study Note
Quality management is often about statistics and analysis. It is important to become
familiar with the terminology of statistical analysis.
   Population: The universe of environment that will be analyzed
   Variable sampling: A process in which products are evaluated on a continuous
   scale that allows for some deviation from the standard as long as it falls within set
   parameters
   Attribute sampling: A process that determines acceptance or rejection of a product.
   There is no flexibility and decisions are either pass/fail or conform/does not conform
   Producer's risk: Known as alpha risk. The risk to a producer that a good lot will be
   rejected
   Consumer's risk: Known as beta risk. The risk that a consumer may accept a bad lot
   Normal distribution: Associated with the bell-shaped curve, it represents a theoreti-
   cal frequency distribution of measurements. The normal distribution curve, accord-
   ing to statistics, indicates that there is a probability of 68.26% that the results will
   fall within one standard deviation from the mean, 95.46% within two standard devi-
   ations and 99.73% within three standard deviations from the mean. The normal dis-
   tribution curve provides a probability confidence factor.

Modern Developments in
Project Management



The basic principles of project management have been in existence for thousands of
years. The Great Wall of China and the pyramids in Egypt and in Mexico were con-
structed using some form of project management. Many of these principles remain in
use today, but over the centuries project management has evolved as new tools and
techniques were developed to gain efficiencies in planning, the use of resources, and
the management of time. In the past few decades, there has been an increased inter-
est in project management not only at the single project level but also at the program
and portfolio level. Organizations are now focusing on the business value of project
management and how it fits into the strategic planning process. In the recent past, the
triple constraints of time, scope, and cost were the main driving factors in determining
project success and in trade-off analysis. Today, project success is based on several ele-
ments most significantly, customer satisfaction and value attained. There is also inter-
est in how to further financial gains, increase productivity, and reduce costs through
organizational or enterprise-wide project management.
   What is known as "modern project management" began to emerge in the
1940s and was primarily associated with large defense and armed forces projects.
Techniques such as program evaluation and review technique (PERT), The work
breakdown structure, critical path method (CPM) and precedence diagramming
method (PDM) eventually migrated into the business environment and become com-
mon within a growing worldwide community of project managers. Project manage-
ment continues to evolve through the development of more sophisticated software,
enterprise resource planning systems, project management information systems, and
new techniques such as agile.
   In the early to mid-1990s, the project management office (PMO) became a focus
of attention as organizations saw value in standardizing their project management
processes. PMOs were introduced to ensure consistency across an organization
during project planning and execution. The capability maturity model (CMM) also
became an item of interest to many corporate executives. CMM introduced a model
to reach business and project management maturity by assessing processes and
procedures that were used and building on those processes to create best practices

     The Project Management Maturity Model (PMMM)--A
     Closer Look

The goal of PMMM is to assist an organization in achieving excellence in project man-
agement through a five-step process.

Level 1--Establish a common language. The first step is to ensure a basic knowledge
   of project management and an understanding of the accompanying terminology
   and language of project management.
Level 2--Common processes. Processes that are used repeatedly on projects that are
   successfully completed are defined and developed and then applied to other proj-
   ects to increase the probability of success. These processes are recognized as also
   contributing to or supporting other processes within an organization.
Level 3--Singular methodology. Recognition of the synergistic value of combining
   organizational processes into a singular methodology that improves the ability to
   control project outcomes and promote consistency within an organization.
Level 4--Benchmarking. Recognizing that process improvement is necessary to main-
   tain a competitive advantage. Comparison of project results to organizational goals
   and industry best practices is necessary and must be performed on a regular basis.
Level 5--Continuous improvement. The evaluation of information obtained through
   benchmarking and the actions taken to improve a process.

   Although depicted in the model as a series of steps, these levels and their associated
activities may overlap depending upon the capabilities of the organization.
   The project management maturity model can be expected to impact the culture of an
organization as processes are developed and longstanding procedures and positions of
authority are affected, and in many cases, change considerably as more formal project
management processes are introduced.

     Other Developments in Project Management

 Developing Procedural Documentation
Procedural documentation will increase efficiencies, establish more consistency in plan-
ning projects, and assist an organization in achieving project management maturity.
   Benefits of procedural documentation:
   Establishment of guidelines and greater uniformity
   Less but more useful documentation
   More effective and clear communication
   Standardized reports, forms, and data

expected to assume many roles including leader, planner, and manager. Competency
models will be used to determine the skill levels and ability of project managers,
which, in turn, will be used to identify where additional skills training and develop-
ment may be needed. Competency models will address and score abilities in such areas
as project management (planning, scope definition, WBS development), interpersonal
skills (conflict management, motivation, communication), business acumen (organiza-
tional processes, financial management), and leadership.

   Specific Project Manager Competencies
   Project management knowledge (process) competencies: What the PM knows about
   applying project management techniques to project activities
   Project management performance (technical/scientific) competencies: How the PM
   applies knowledge to meet project requirements
   PM personal (leadership) competencies: How a PM behaves/performs in the project
   environment
  PMI has introduced the Talent Triangle, which addresses leadership, technical
knowledge, and strategic and business management techniques

 Management of Multiple Projects
Today's project environment often requires a project manager to manage several projects
concurrently. These projects may range from very small projects with short durations to
more complex projects with longer durations. The span of control (number of projects
assigned) to a project manager is usually dependent on previous experience, track record,
and overall competency. Managing multiple projects presents new challenges to the proj-
ect manager and is a significant change from a single project mentality.

 End-of-Phase Review Meetings (Project Evaluations and
 Reviews)
Today, many organizations have established processes for reviewing projects through-
out the life cycle, not just at the end of the project. This is essential to ensure that the
organization continues to support projects that will yield the greatest benefits to
the organization. Establishing criteria for success by phase will increase the probabil-
ity of successful completion of the project and assist an organization in managing its
resources more effectively.

 Critical Chain or Theory of Constraints
This is a method of planning and managing projects that places more emphasis on the
resources required to execute project tasks. It was developed by Eliyahu M. Goldratt.
This method contrasts the more traditional Critical Path method, which emphasizes
task order and rigid scheduling. A Critical Chain project network will tend to keep

   Be open to changes instead of freezing the scope of the work.

 Kaizen
Kaizen is the Japanese word for improvement or change for the better. It is a pro-
cess for continuous improvement. The approach seeks to achieve small, incremental
changes in processes in order to improve efficiency and quality.

 Kanban
Kanban is a system that emphasizes a just in time approach to manage inventory and
focuses on customer actual needs rather than on management forecasts, The kanban
approach was popularized by Toyota by standardizing the flow of parts on the assem-
bly lines. The kanban process starts with the customer order and follows the order
through production. Kanban follows a process that ensures that items will only be
manufactured or ordered when they are actually needed.

 Value-Driven Project Management
To achieve project success, greater emphasis must be placed on factors well beyond
the familiar triple constraint. Value may defined differently by the stakeholder involved
in a project. Values are developed from exposure to business environments, social
environments, and family environments. Types of values include political, social, eco-
nomic, aesthetic, religious, and theoretical. Project value is determined not only at the
completion of the project in terms of performance against plans but also in the residual
value gained over many years.
   In the future, project value may become the only constraint or at least the most
important constraint. The definition of a project will become "a collection of sustain-
able values scheduled for realization. Project success will be measured on whether the
sustainable value was created. One of the criteria for evaluating potential projects as
part of the portfolio of projects will be the value that can be added for the customer and
the supplier and how the creation of that value can be shown to fully support the com-
pany's business objectives.

 Areas in Project Management Where Change Is Expected
Major breakthroughs and the introduction of truly new tools and techniques are not
very common with the practice of project management but there is a relatively steady
and continuous effort to improve how project work is managed. Changes and improve-
ments can be expected to continue in following areas:
   Project selection: Ensuring the right projects have been assigned. The use of busi-
   ness cases and assessment of value
   Prioritization of projects: Gaining maximum business value by applying and man-
   aging resources effectively

 3. It is associated with the Six Sigma approach to improving quality and reducing the
    number of defects.
 4. CPM focuses on sequence of activities and activity duration to produce a criti-
    cal path--the longest path through a project network. The Critical Chain method
    focuses on resource constraints and the use of project and activities buffers to
    relieve constraints.
 5. Documenting best practices will improve overall project and organizational per-
    formance by making useful information available to multiple project teams that
    may reduce cost, accelerate the project completion time frame, improve qual-
    ity, and reduce risk. Continuous improvement is the highest level of the Project
    Management Maturity Model and indicates that the organization has achieved a
    success-based culture through a practice of analyzing performance to generate a
    steadily position of superiority over competitors.
 6. The changes involved in establishing a methodology may have an effect on corpo-
    rate culture, there may be resistance to changes in process, and an unwillingness to
    accept changes in authority and the decision-making process.
 7. Job descriptions emphasize deliverables and specific expectations. Competency
    models emphasize skills required to achieve deliverables.
 8. Available resources, facilities, cash flow, existing technology.
 9. Core competency requirements will vary by organization but commonly include
    leadership, project management technical skills--planning, scope development,
    schedule development, change control--interpersonal skills, and communications.
10. Communication with parties is more important than standard procedures and tools.
       Focus on delivering a working application and focus less on providing thorough
       documentation.
       Collaborate more with clients.

PMP(R) and CAPM(R) Exam
Review



The Project Management Professional Exam, commonly known as the PMP(R) exam, is
intended to assess a project manager's competency when assigned to lead and direct
a project. According to the Project Management Institute (PMI), the PMP(R) certifica-
tion demonstrates to employers, clients, and colleagues that a project manager pos-
sesses project management knowledge, experience, and skills to bring projects to
successful completion. The exam is based on the principles and knowledge areas pro-
vided in the Guide to the Project Management Body of Knowledge, also known as the
PMBOK(R) Guide (Sixth Edition), and other sources of knowledge, including personal
experience. It is important to note that the PMBOK(R) Guide is not an all-inclusive
document. It provides information about the framework and general principles of
project management. It provides information about five major project management
processes and ten knowledge areas and describes techniques and tools that are con-
sidered to be "good" practices for managing projects. The PMBOK(R) Guide describes
the role of the project manager and provides a basis for establishing a project man-
agement methodology. The PMBOK(R) Guide is an essential part of the PMP(R) exam
study process and should be included in a comprehensive study plan or exam prepara-
tion process.
   The exam is based on five major project management processes:
   Initiating
   Planning
   Executing
   Monitoring and controlling
   Closing
   An additional area, or domain, of project management that had been highlighted sepa-
rately in the past, referred to as professional and social responsibility is now embedded
in the five major process groups. The exam candidate should become familiar with the

     General Information about the Exams

The PMP(R) exam has been developed for experienced project managers, project lead-
ers, and project directors who are in decision-making and leadership positions and
for those who influence project decisions. The CAPM(R) exam has been developed for
project managers who plan to continue their careers as project managers and have
not met the qualifications regarding education, experience, and credentials to apply
for the PMP(R) exam. The CAPM(R) is an excellent step toward the PMP(R) certifica-
tion. Preparation for the exam includes a comprehensive study process, a disciplined
approach to study, and a specific selection of study resources, including the PMBOK(R)
Guide. Time and effort for study will depend on the experience level of the candidate
and the level of formal education acquired.

   Ensure that you review and understand the flow charts that appear in each chapter.




                                                                                                   PMP(R) and CAPM(R) Exam Review


   These flow charts provide information about how knowledge areas and process
   groups are interrelated and illustrate the relationships and flows of the inputs, tools
   and techniques, and outputs of each process within a knowledge area.
   Refer to Table 1-4, Project Management Process Group and Knowledge Area
   Mapping, in the PMBOK(R) Guide. This table provides an overview of the five major
   processes and the linkages to the ten knowledge areas. It also shows the logically
   grouped subprocesses that support the five major process groups.
   Review very often the overview charts that are found in each knowledge area chap-
   ter and learn to recognize the inputs, tools and techniques, and outputs. Concentrate
   on why an input is important, how a tool or technique is applied, and how the result-
   ing output becomes an input to another process. It is not essential to memorize the
   PMBOK(R) Guide. The study goal is not memorization, but understanding rationale
   and application of the knowledge, tools and techniques
   As you progress through the PMBOK(R) Guide you will begin to see a repetition of
   many processes. The processes are interrelated and the outputs of one process will
   frequently become the inputs to another process. This repetition emphasizes the
   integrative nature of project management and indicates how many processes are
   linked and are interdependent.
   The chapter entitled "Project Integration Management" is an overview of how the
   five process groups and ten knowledge areas are utilized to manage a project life
   cycle. Information in this chapter refers to many of the processes that are associated
   with each of the other knowledge areas. Project integration management describes
   how all of the knowledge areas are combined and coordinated to develop a proj-
   ect management plan and eventually achieve project success. The details of the pro-
   cesses described in the integration management chapter are provided in each of the
   knowledge area chapters.
   When you have read and studied all chapters, review the glossary and then reread
   the chapter "Project Integration Management." A review of this chapter will help to
   further reinforce the knowledge obtained from reading the other chapters.
   Test yourself frequently with practice questions and try to relate the processes
   explained in the PMBOK(R) Guide with actual projects you have been or are currently
   assigned to. Not every process will be applicable to your projects but it will help
   with your study if you can relate the processes to your project assignments when-
   ever possible.


     Preparing for the PMP(R) Exam

The PMP(R) exam requires a considerable amount of study and practice, especially
for those who have not studied or taken an exam for some time. It is important to
note that the CAPM exam addresses much of the same information found in the
PMP exam. The major difference is that the CAPM focuses more on terminology,

     Improving Your Project Management Competency

This workbook has introduced you to several project management processes, tools, and
techniques. To further your knowledge and enhance your competency, consider the fol-
lowing recommendations:
 1. During the time you are actively managing a project, select a process, a tool or
    technique, or a specific concept from the workbook or a PMBOK(R) knowledge area
    and ask yourself, "How can I apply this concept, process, or technique to my cur-
    rent environment?" Example: Creating a WBS for a new project. Ask yourself,
    "Why is the WBS important? How would you obtain buy-in from team members
    to create and use a WBS? How would you start the process of developing the
    WBS? What preparatory work would you be required to perform? How will this
    process add value to your project?" Asking and answering these questions will also
    assist in the study process for the certification exam.
2. If you cannot apply the concept, ask yourself why. What is preventing the use of
   the concept? Where is there resistance? Why is there resistance? Why is the con-
   cept not applicable to your environment? It is important to note that the PMBOK(R)
   Guide provides a number of "good practices" that are used in most projects. It
   doesn't not imply that every process is used for every project.
3. If you feel that a process should be used in your organization, ask, "What changes
   must be introduced within the organization to gain acceptance of the process
   or technique? How will the process add business value? What benefits will be
   gained?" These questions will assist you in developing a more complete under-
   standing of the processes, tools and techniques described in the material and will
   prepare you more completely for the PMP(R) exam. This approach will also improve
   your competency and capability to manage your projects more effectively.

able that is actually the sum of or combination of many deliverables. During project plan-
ning, deliverables are generally defined in each project phase and reviewed for acceptance
prior to the start of the next phase. These are referred to as "interim deliverables."
Enterprise environmental factors Internal and external factors that influence proj-
ect planning, including organizational culture, structure, and governance. industry
standards, infrastructure, human resource capabilities and skills, risk tolerance, and
politics.
Interpersonal skills The successful project manager is expected to effectively manage
project teams through interpersonal skills, including relationship building, communica-
tion, influencing skills, leadership, motivation, negotiating skills, conflict management,
and problem solving. The PMI(R) Talent Triangle includes a reference to interpersonal
skills in the leadership component of the triangle.
Key management skills The key skills associated with general management and proj-
ect management include leadership, communications, organizing, team building, con-
flict resolution, planning, and administration.
Leadership and management It is important to differentiate leadership from
management.

Organizational process assets Processes, policies, and procedures for conducting
work. Examples: standardized guidelines, templates, project closure guidelines, change
control procedures, health and safety policies, and security procedures.
Organizational structures There are several types of organizational structure: The
most common structures are functional, matrix, and projectized. The matrix structure
can be further defined as one of three possible subtypes: weak matrix, where the proj-
ect manager has little to no authority; balanced matrix, where the project manager and
function manager have equal levels of authority; and strong matrix, where the proj-
ect manager has a greater level of authority than the functional manager. Consider the
advantages and disadvantages of each type of structure. Example: The project man-
ager authority in each type of organizational structure is different and may have an
impact on how the project manager influences the project. In the functional structure
the project manager has very little authority and acts as a coordinator or expeditor. In
the strong matrix, the project manager has greater influence and has the authority to
make financial decisions, direct resources, and delegate work assignments to functional
managers. Refer to Table 2-1, Influences of Organizational Structure, in the PMBOK(R)
Guide (Sixth Edition) for additional information and other types of structures.

organization: regulatory, legal, and social requirements, stakeholder needs, business
change and technology advances, and creating and improving products.
Project management The application of knowledge, skills, and tools to meet stated
requirements. This includes setting objectives, balancing competing demands of time,
cost, scope, quality, risk, resources, and other constraints or demands.
Project Management Institute Code of Ethics and Professional Conduct The obli-
gation of trust, fairness, honesty, and respect and a commitment to ethics, compliance
with laws, and observance of cultural diversity. PMI members have determined that
honesty, responsibility, respect, and fairness are the values that drive ethical conduct
for the project management profession.
Project management office An organizational body or entity established by an orga-
nization and assigned various responsibilities related to the centralized and coordinated
management of projects. Three are three major types of PMOs: supportive, controlling,
and directive. Refer to the PMBOK(R) Guide (Sixth Edition), section 2.4.4.3, for detailed
descriptions of each type.
Project management process groups The five major process groups: initiating, plan-
ning, executing, monitoring and controlling, and closing. It is important to note that
these are not phases. These processes are present in each phase of the project life cycle
and assist in providing a consistent approach to achieving objectives.
Project-based organizations This type of organization conducts the majority of its
business and work as projects and utilizes and enterprise-wide project management
methodology.
Rolling wave planning A form of progressive elaboration where near-term work
is planned in detail at a low level of the WBS and work scheduled for the future is
planned at a high level. As work is completed in one phase or period, the work of the
next phase or near term is planned in more detail.
Stakeholders People or organizations directly involved in or in some way impacted either
positively or negatively as a result of the project. Stakeholders can be considered positive
(support the project) or negative (impede the project). Project managers should consider
the risks and potential impact of the negative stakeholder (whether internal or external
to the organization). Key stakeholders include project manager, sponsor, customer, proj-
ect team, the PMO (project management office), the performing organization, operations
management, suppliers and business partners, the end user, and contractors.


                  Relationship of the 10 knowledge areas
Three key words describe how the knowledge areas are view and man-
aged: All knowledge areas are integrated, interrelated, and interdepen-
dent. All ten knowledge areas are part of an integrated system of project
management. Consider project management to be a system of compo-

Project risk will not be eliminated during the project progression through
the project life cycle, but the ability to manage risk more effectively is
improved as more project information is gathered and risk management
techniques are utilized.


 Responsibilities and Competencies of the Project Manager
The project manager generally assumes many roles and responsibilities during a proj-
ect assignment. Typical roles include:
   Managing teams and team members
   Defining and assigning project work responsibilities
   Proving leadership
   The project manager is also expected to possess a high level of competency as a
team leader
   Project management knowledge: The project manager should possess significant
   knowledge of project management. This relates to performance and what the project
   manager can accomplish by applying project management knowledge.
   Personal: Displaying the appropriate behavior, developing and enhancing core inter-
   personal skills, understanding the effect of personality characteristics and attitude,
   and demonstrating the ability to manage and lead a team.


                                     Remember
Each knowledge area in the PMBOK(R) Guide consists of several subpro-
cesses that support the five major process groups. These processes are
managed through:
 Inputs (items that that are necessary or should be considered for
 planning)
 Tools and techniques (the actions and steps taken to process the inputs)
 Outputs (the results of the processing of the inputs)
  There is a basic process flow in which inputs are identified, then pro-
cessed using tools and techniques to produce the outputs, which are, in
most cases the results or deliverables of the entire process. Each knowl-
edge area is part of the total project management system and all knowl-
edge areas are integrated within the system.
  Project integration management includes the processes, actions, and
activities that will bring together all project-related work. Integration man-
agement unifies, combines, and coordinates the specific activities of the
project management knowledge areas.
  The main process groups within project integration management are

the project with the business objectives of the organization and the target benefits
of the project. It also includes information about when benefits will be delivered and
the metrics to measure the benefits.
Project charter A document that formally recognizes the project and authorizes the
project manager to apply organizational resources. The charter establishes an ini-
tial high-level set of requirements and identifies key project stakeholders. During the
development of the project charter it is important to refer to the business case and the
rationale driving the project, the product to be produced, and relationship of the proj-
ect to the strategic objectives of the organization. If a formal contract or statement of
work is involved in project initiation, it is important to review the terms and condi-
tions agreed upon as the project charter is created. The charter generally establishes the
authority level of the project manager and provides clearly documented visible support
from senior level management.
Project Management Information System (PMIS) A system of systems and
includes all of the systems used to obtain project data, analyze data, and distribute
information to the project stakeholders. The project management information system
is any system or group of systems working together to gather, store, and distribute
information about your project. Examples: time reporting system, time management
system, enterprise resource planning (ERP), accounting system, and project software.
Project management plan The guide used by the project manager and team;
includes the actions required to integrate the many subsidiary plans such as cost man-
agement, change control, quality management, and scope management into the total
or integrated project plan. The project management plan is expected to change as the
project progresses and new details emerge. Typical outputs of many PMBOK(R) Guide
processes are document updates, and project plan updates.


                                  General Study Tip
Always consider the enterprise environmental factors and organizational
process assets that may affect the project planning process. Enterprise
environmental factors are inputs to many project management processes.


Project selection methods Prior to the development of the project charter, an orga-
nization will engage in a project selection process to consider and determine which
projects would be most beneficial for the organization. Business cases and benefit mea-
surement methods are used to select the projects that will be selected for implemen-
tation. A benefit cost analysis may be conducted to determine if the project is value
adding. This analysis answers the question "Should we do it?"
   A feasibility study will determine if the organization has the capability to perform
the project work and answers the question "Should we do it?"
   Many organizations consider a combination of tangible benefits such as profit and cost
savings, and the intangible benefits such as good will, morale, reputation, and customer sat-

 Additional Study Items
Trends and Emerging Practices in Project Integration Management
The PMBOK(R) Guide Sixth Edition includes references to internal and external factors that
may affect how a project is managed. These factors include use of automated tools, updat-
ing project management knowledge, expanding project boundaries, hybrid methodologies.

Closing the Project or Phase
Project plans should include a process for closing out the project or a phase of a proj-
ect. There are two major procedures for project closure: administrative closure (proj-
ect reviews, verifying project financials, analyzing project success or failure, lessons
learned), and contract closure (the actions required to close contractual agreements and
ensure that terms and conditions have been met). The closing process should include a
plan that will satisfy project completion requirements and define exit criteria.

Directing and Managing Project Work
Performing the work described in the project management plan such as creating deliv-
erables, obtaining project staff, generating project data and reports, and procuring
resources. The outputs of the direct and manage project work include project deliverables,
work performance data, issue log, change requests, project management plan updates,
project document updates, and organizational process asset updates. Direct and manage
project work also includes taking corrective action, preventive action, and defect repair.

Managing Project Knowledge
This involves using existing project knowledge and creating new knowledge to achieve
project objectives. Knowledge may include explicit informant such as words, pictures,
and numbers, or tacit information such as insights, experience, and "know-how."


Monitoring and Controlling Project Work
This includes tracking, reviewing, and managing project progress, comparing actual
performance to planned performance, identifying variance, reporting project status,
and managing change.

     Project Scope Management Processes


                                      Remember
Ensure that the project includes all work and only the work required to
complete the objectives of the project.


   The project manager and project team will become involved in the scope planning
process to define and control what is and what is not included in the project work.
This involves creating a project scope management plan that describes and documents
how the project scope will be defined, verified, and controlled. The scope management
plan is a subsidiary plan to the project management plan. There are two types of scope.
Product scope includes the features, functions, and physical characteristics of the prod-
uct service, or result of the project. Project scope is work that must be completed to
produce the product, service, or result.
   Project scope management includes the following major processes:
Plan scope management: Creating a scope management plan that will guide the
team in determining how the scope will be defined, validated, and controlled. The
major outputs are the scope management plan and the requirements management
plan. Key terms are:
   Project charter
   Enterprise environmental factors
   Organizational process assets
   Expert judgment, data analysis
Collect requirements: Defining and documenting the needs of the stakeholders.
Collect requirements provides the basis for defining the product and project scope.
Remember that stakeholders can be affected negatively or positively by the results of
the project. Key terms in the collect requirements process are:
   Assumption log
   Lessons learned register
   Stakeholder register
   Interviews
   Focus groups

the process of decomposition. The WBS is a hierarchal grouping of project compo-
nents, tasks, and activities. The WBS is defined to a level of detail that will enable the
project team to plan and manage the project effectively. The lowest-level deliverable
of a branch of the WBS is the work package, which includes the activities that must be
completed to produce higher-level deliverables.


   Key terms
   Decomposition (the process of breaking the WBS into smaller parts)
   WBS templates (may be created from previous projects and can accelerate the plan-
   ning process)
   WBS dictionary (provides detailed information about elements of the WBS)
   Scope baseline (the defined project work that must be completed)


   Major outputs
   Scope baseline (includes scope statement, WBS, work packages, planning packages,
   and WBS dictionary)


   Other breakdown structures
   OBS (organizational breakdown structure)
   BOM (bill of materials)
   RBS (risk breakdown structure)
Validate scope: The process of determining the correctness of the work completed
through inspections and reviews of project work results. This means making sure that
what was expected to be produced was actually produced. Validate scope leads to for-
mal acceptance. This is an important item to remember: connect scope verification
with the term "formal acceptance" of the project deliverables.


   Key terms
   Inspection
   Decision making
   Work performance information
   Acceptance
   Change requests
Control scope: Monitoring the project to ensure changes are managed through
an approval process. Use of change requests and a configuration control pro-
cess. Approved changes require updates to the plan and documentation of lessons
learned.

   Schedule performance measures such as earned value management
Define activities: The project manager works with the project team to identify the spe-
cific activities that must be performed to produce project deliverables. This process will
further define the WBS and create work packages. This process, known as decomposi-
tion, is an extension of the development of the WBS. Work packages include activities
that must be completed to produce the lower level deliverables that will ultimately be
aggregated to produce the total project deliverable. Inputs include schedule management
plan, scope baseline, enterprise environmental factors, organizational process assets.

   Decomposition (breaks the WBS down further into work packages and activities)
   Rolling wave planning (work to be performed in the near term is planned in detail,
   later work is planned at a higher level)
Sequence activities: This process is intended to define and document the logical rela-
tionships among project activities. There are four types of dependencies considered when
developing a project schedule: mandatory dependency (hard logic; a physiological depen-
dency), discretionary dependency (soft logic; use of best practices), external dependency
(factors outside the project and outside of the control of the project manager that may
affect the project), internal dependencies (items that can be controlled by the project team).
   The sequence activities process produces a network diagram that displays the prede-
cessor/successor relationships or logical relationships between activities and displays
the flow of the work from start to finish.
Precedence diagramming method (PDM): Also known as activity on the node, the
PDM is the prevalent form of network diagramming when sequencing activities.

   Types of dependencies: Mandatory, discretionary, and external
   leads (acceleration of time between activities to reduce path duration)
   Lags: Required delays between the finish of an activity and the start of a succeeding
   activity
   Relationships used in the PDM process: Finish to start, start to start, finish to finish,
   and start to finish

Develop schedule: The process of analyzing activity sequences, activity dura-

The schedule is submitted for review and approval by the key stakeholders. Schedule
development considers availability of resources, capability and skills of the resources,
number of resources available, the resource calendar (including international calendar
issues), vacation time, sick time, external issues (weather), and lead or lag require-
ments, and the logical relationships of the activities.

 Time Management Terms
Backward pass Determines late start and finish dates. Begins at the end milestone
and proceeds back through the network. At points of convergence the lower value will
determine the late start.
CPM Critical Path Method. Determines the early start and early finish and late start
and late finish of each project activity.
Crashing Reducing critical path duration by adding resources or using overtime to
compress the activity duration.
Fast-tracking Overlapping activities. Beginning an activity before its successor is
complete.
Float ownership The float is "owned" by the entire path, not the individual activity.
Path float is not determined by summing up the float of each activity on the path. Path
float is determined by how usage of float on one activity impacts the other activities on
the path.

Estimate costs: The process of developing an approximation of the monetary
resources required to complete project activities. Estimating project costs may involve
the use of analogous, parametric, and bottom-up estimating techniques, three-point
estimates, and risk analysis.

   Key terms
   Analogous estimating (use of similar projects to develop a top-down estimate)
   Parametric estimating (use of mathematical algorithms such as cost per square foot
   multiplied by the number of square feet)
   Bottom-up estimating (use of the WBS to aggregate costs from the work package
   level to the project level)
   Three-point estimating (using optimistic, most likely and pessimistic values and tri-
   angular or beta distribution )
   Cost of quality (costs associated with conformance to quality requirements such as
   training and inspections)
   Reserve analysis (analyzing the planned reserves)
   Level of precision (rounding data to a prescribed precision level)
   Units of measure (hours, weeks, lump sum, control thresholds, allowable variance
   from a plan)
   Rules of performance measurement (for example, the use of earned value analysis
   or determining the control points to be used on the WBS)
   Vendor bid analysis (review of bids to determine accuracy, fairness, consistency
   within the discipline)

   Project management plan (includes the cost management plan and cost baseline
   funding requirements)
   Work performance data
   Organizational process assets
   Refer to section 7.4.2.3 of the PMBOK(R) Guide (Sixth Edition), budget at comple-
tion (BAC), estimate at completion (EAC), S-curves, graphical depiction of project
status using a time line, cost measurements, and date of measurement.

 Cost Management Terms
Actual cost of work performed (ACWP) Also known as AC or actual cost, this is the
amount that was paid for the work that was performed at the time of measurement.
Budget at completion (BAC) This is the final planned and approved budget, the base-
line to compare against actual results.
Budgeted cost of work performed (BCWP) Also known as EV or earned value,
this is the estimated or planned cost of the work that has been completed at the time
of measurement; the amount that was planned to be paid for the work that has been
accomplished.
Budgeted cost of work scheduled (BCWS) Also known as PV or planned value, this
the planned cost of the work (or work packages) that should have been completed at
the time of measurement.
Breakeven The point at which cash outflow and inflow are equal. Breakeven analysis
is also used to make rent, buy, or lease decisions.
Direct costs Costs directly and clearly associated with the project. Labor, material,
equipment, and supplies are considered direct project costs.
Future value formula FV = PV (1 + r)n where FV= future value, PV = present value,
r = interest rate or cost of capital, and n = years
Indirect costs Costs that are not directly associated with the project but that can
impact the overall budget. Examples: overhead, building maintenance, benefits, organi-
zation operational costs such as rent, utility bills, etc.
Internal rate of return (IRR) This is an iterative process used to determine the actual
rate or return realized from an investment;. IRR is often referred to as ROI. The pro-
cess requires several iterations to determine the rate at which the NPV becomes zero.
The IRR generally must meet or exceed a predetermined "hurdle rate" established by
an organization as part of project selection criteria. This process will provide an orga-
nization with a reliable assessment of the return on investment of a project. IRR is
compared with other projects during the selection process.
Learning curves Used as a basis for predicting cost and quantity outputs of a process
over time. The basic rule of learning curves is: As units are produced, the time and
cost required to produce the unit decreases. Productivity improves through repetition.

                                      EV/PV = SPI

   A performance index (PI) that equals 1 means there is no variance and the proj-
ect or work package is performing as planned and at the expected level of efficiency.
A PI greater than 1 indicates superior performance (greater efficiency than planned).
Example: receiving $1.10 in value for every one dollar spent. A PI less than 1 indicates
a performance problem such as a schedule slippage or a cost overrun.
   Estimate at Complete (EAC) is the forecasted project competition cost based on cur-
rent performance data. There are three formulas highlighted in the PMBOK(R) Guide--
Sixth Edition:

   EAC = AC + (BAC - EV). This formula is used when a risk assessment indicates
   that all remaining work will be accomplished at the budgeted rate. This is a highly
   optimistic prediction.
   EAC = BAC / CPI. This formula is used when it is assumed that all future work (ETC,
   or estimate to complete) will be completed at the rate of actual performance to date.
   EAC = AC + (BAC - EV) / (CPI x SPI) Used. This formula is used when the project
   schedule is a significant factor impacting the remaining work (ETC). The formula
   considers the efficiency rate of cost and schedule performance.

   Earned Value Special Note: The PMP(R) exam is likely to use the acronyms EV
(earned value) instead of BCWP, PV (planned value) instead of BCWS, and AC (actual
cost) instead of ACWP.
   PV, EV, and AC are the acronyms associated with the PMBOK(R) Guide. Earned value
information is the common denominator when determining cost and schedule variance.


     Project Quality Management Processes

Project quality management includes the processes that connect an organization's qual-
ity policies to the project environment and provide guidance to determine the quality
policies, quality objectives, and responsibility for quality that will be used during proj-
ect planning and implementation.
   Project quality management emphasizes customer satisfaction through delivery
of agreed upon project deliverables and specified functionality, quality management
focuses on prevention of problems and defects over inspection, continuous improve-
ment, and ensuring that management responsibility is clearly defined and accepted.
   According to the PMBOK(R) Guide, the major process of project quality management are:
   Plan quality management
   Manage quality
   Control quality

   Organizational process asset updates
   You will notice that many inputs and tools and techniques are repeated several times
throughout the PMBOK(R) Guide. This is further emphasis that all project processes and
knowledge areas are interrelated and integrated.

 Project Quality Management Terms
Attribute sampling Process that focuses on assessing outputs to determine if each
output passes or fails an inspection: Either reject or accept the deliverable being
reviewed.
Benchmarking Comparing desired or best in class performance with existing perfor-
mance. Identifying areas for improvement or deficiencies in products and services and
developing corrective actions.
Benefit cost analysis Determining the appropriate level of quality to be designed
and included in a project deliverable or product to achieve an acceptable return on
the investment and to meet customer needs. Generally the benefits received should be
greater than the cost to produce the product or deliverable.
Control charts In statistical process control, control charts are tools used to determine
if a manufacturing or business process is in a state of control by analyzing data points
and their relationship to the mean or process average. The control chart analysis may
include what is referred to as the Rule of 7 and the Rule of 21. Rule of 7: 7 consec-
utive data points above or below the mean indicate a run, 7 data points indicating a
specific positive or negative direction indicates a trend. Generally, 21 data points are
required for a sample to be statistically valid. Control charts are used to identify special
or assignable causes and to determine if a process is in control or out of control. The
control chart displays the process average, mean or center line, upper and lower control
limits (UCL and LCL), and upper and lower specification limits.
Control quality Monitoring and analyzing project performance results to determine if
they are acceptable and are within approved standards. Taking action to correct unac-
ceptable variances.
Cost of conformance Part of the cost of quality. Includes two components: pre-
vention (examples: training, design reviews), and appraisal (examples: inspections,
testing).
Cost of nonconformance Part of the cost of quality. Includes two components:
internal failure (examples: defects, rework) and external failure (examples: customer
receives a defective product resulting in loss of business or liabilities).
Cost of quality There are two major components of the cost of quality: cost of con-
formance, which includes prevention and appraisal costs, and cost of nonconformance,
which includes internal failure (rework) and external failure (customer dissatisfaction).
Customer defines quality The project team analyzes the customer's implied needs
and develops approved and accepted stated needs (requirements) to meet the customer's

responsible for 85% of quality issues. This means that most quality issues require the
involvement of management to resolve them.
Pareto diagram A histogram that displays problems or issues by frequency of occur-
rence and is associated with the 80/20 rule as it applies to quality: 80% of problems are
associated with 20% of the causes. The Pareto diagram and process is associated with
the phrases "vital few and trivial many," "select the low-hanging fruit," and "biggest
bang for the buck."
Prevention Keeping errors out of the process and preventing errors from reaching
customer. Prevention may include training, documenting processes, using the appropri-
ate equipment, scheduling the appropriate time to perform work. Poke Yoka, a process
of error proofing, is an example of prevention.
Prevention over inspection Prevention is emphasized in most quality processes. It is
generally less costly to prevent errors than to inspect for, identify, and correct errors.
Quality The basic definition is "The conformance to specifications or requirements
and fitness for use."
Quality assurance Systematic activities implemented to ensure that the project will
satisfy quality standards. Quality assurance is associated with audits designed to deter-
mine if approved and required processes are followed and to identify where variations
from process and/or standards may be causing problems or issues with products and
deliverables.
Quality control Measuring performance to determine where variances exist and
taking actions to correct unacceptable variance. Includes inspection, control charts,
Pareto diagrams (80/20 rule), histograms, scatter diagrams.
Quality gurus People who have significantly influenced the implementation and
advancement of quality management processes and the connection of quality and busi-
ness results.
   W. Edwards Deming: Supported and emphasized the use of the Shewhart chart (the
cycle of plan, do, check, act), proclaimed that 85% of quality issues require manage-
ment involvement, emphasized statistical analysis and continuous improvement
   Joseph Juran: Emphasized fitness for use, advised to be aware of the legal issues
associated with poor quality
   Philip Crosby: Postulated that quality is free, the cost of quality is associated with
nonconformance; professed that zero defects is possible
   Taguchi: Developed the design of experiments approach, postulated that quality should
be engineered into a product not inspected into the product, emphasized that as results
move further from the target, the cost of correcting problems and variations will increase
   Ishikawa: Developed the cause-and-effect diagram also referred to as the Fishbone
diagram.
   Feigenbaum: Developed the concept of total quality management (everyone in
the organization is involved in quality-related activities and the quality improvement
processes).

     Project Resource Management Processes


                                   Remember
Human resources management includes the processes that are used
to organize and manage the project team. This includes selection of the
project team, the leader's responsibility to motivate and lead a team,
managing conflict, defining the difference between authority and power,
influencing people, managing interpersonal interfaces, delivering proj-
ect level and individual personal performance appraisals, managing with
professionalism, and ethical behavior. Organizational structure is generally
included as art of the knowledge area of resource management.
   Organizational structure depends on the preferences of executive man-
agement and the type of business. There are several types of organiza-
tional structures. Three types are very common: functional, matrix, and
projectized structures.

Key Concepts of Resource Management
Clearly defined roles and responsibilities are assigned to collectively
achieve project goals. The project manager is the team leader and
acquires, develops, motivates, and empowers the team. The project man-
agement must be aware of and manage cultural differences. The project
manager subscribes to ethical and professional behavior.
   Resource management includes the human resources, equipment,
materials, and supplies necessary to complete project work.
   Emotional intelligence (self-awareness and relationship management) is
a key factor in effective management and leadership of a team.
Diversity and geographical location are factors to be considered by the
project manager.


Plan resource management: The process of identifying resource requirements, esti-
mating the resources necessary, and acquiring, and managing the resources. Resource
management also includes identifying project roles, establishing reporting relation-
ships, and creating the staffing plan.

 Project Resource Management Terms
Conflict Management There are five general types of conflict handling: (1) withdraw-

problem-solving techniques).

sonable offers, and teaming agreements. Items that may require negotiation include:
obtaining resources, schedule development, activity duration estimates, funding
requirements, and resolving conflicts.
Organizational influences Remember the difference between a project-based and a
non-project-based organization. Project-based: the organization performs most work
as project work or manages projects for external customers. Non-project-based orga-
nizations do not have a formal project management methodology or do not normally
engage in project-type work.
Organizational structure There are several types of organizational structure--here
most common forms are the functional, matrix, and projectized structures. Each type
of structure has unique characteristics, advantages, and disadvantages. The authority
of the project manager is generally lowest in the functional structure, moderate in the
matrix structure, and nearly total in the projectized structure.
Power and authority The project manager should be aware of the five major types of
power or influence:

  Legitimate or formal power: Based on position and rank in the organization
  Expert power: Based on level of knowledge and experience
  Penalty power: Based on the ability and authority to penalize employees or threaten
  disciplinary action; also known as coercive power
  Reward power: Based on the ability and authority to offer items of perceived value
  to employees in exchange for work
  Referent power: Influencing people through the power and authority of another, use
  of charisma

Project stakeholders Any person or organization that is involved in or directly
impacted either positively or negatively as a result of the project.
Responsibility assignment matrix (RAM) The RAM is aligned with the WBS and
links project team member responsibility with WBS elements. The RAM is used to
clearly define responsibility for the completion of project tasks and major deliverables.
It is generally not a tool used for determining resource requirements.
Roles and responsibilities: Should be identified and assigned during the project kick-
off meeting. Identifying roles and responsibilities will help to minimize conflicts and
improve overall project communications.
Team building The project manager must remember the importance of team build-
ing and the phases of team development: forming, storming, norming, performing,
and adjourning. During the forming stage the team member will express concern and
approach the project in a guarded state of mind. Conflict is greatest during the storm-
ing phase where disagreements about responsibilities will peak. Conflict begins to
subside in the norming phase, and is minimized in the performing stage, where the
team has learned to trust each other and protect each other. The project manager is

   Project performance forecasts
   Earned value management
   Performance reporting and performance forecasts are associated with collecting,
reviewing, analyzing, and then disseminating the information to the appropriate stake-
holders. Performance reporting includes status reports (the current project condition),
progress reports (what has been accomplished to date), and forecasts (what is expected
or anticipated to occur in the future). The use of project information dashboards and
balanced scorecards are popular forms of status reporting.
   Earned value analysis is also associated with performance reporting (refer to the infor-
mation in project cost management). It utilizes three key values to assess project perfor-
mance: planned value, or PV (also known as BCWS or Budgeted Cost of Work Scheduled),
actual cost, or AC (also known as ACWP or actual cost of work performed), and earned
value, or EV (also known as BCWP or budgeted cost of work performed). These values are
used to calculate cost variance (EV - AC = CV), schedule variance (EV - PV = SV), cost
performance index CPI = EV/AC, and schedule performance index SPI EV/PV.

begin at the start of contract negotiations and continue through project charter develop-
ment, the project kickoff meeting and in all planning discussions. Risk is always pres-
ent and the project manager and team should continually assess project risk and revise
or update risk plans.
Plan risk management: The process of deciding on the approach to conducting risk
management and managing project risk; defining the activities that will effectively
manage risk through the project life cycle.

   Nonevent risks
   Variability risks (changes in productivity, errors, unseasonable weather)
   Ambiguity risks (deficit of knowledge and understanding
   Gaps that require investigation

   Key terms
   Risk appetite (degree of uncertainty an organization is willing to accept)
   Risk tolerance (volume and intensity of risk that an organization can withstand)
   Risk threshold (level of uncertainty or impact that a stakeholder is willing to manage)
   Risk categories (specific identified groupings of risk causes and events)
   Beta distribution
   Triangular distribution
   Risk breakdown structure (RBS)
   Probability and impact

   Major inputs
   Project management plan, project charter, stakeholder register, enterprise environ-
   mental factors, organizational process assets

   Tools and techniques
   Data analysis (analytical techniques such as stakeholder assessment, analyzing risk
   attitude, risk tolerances and risk appetite)
   Expert judgment
   Meetings
   The planning process will establish the methodologies, roles and responsibilities of
the key stakeholders involved, a budget process for managing risk, and the timing for
when risk management activities will occur.
   Study note: There are two primary components of risk: probability and impact.
Urgency is also a factor when planning for risk and determining responses.
Identify risk: The use of various techniques to determine which risks might affect the
project and documenting their characteristics.

Perform quantitative risk analysis: A numerically based and more robust approach
to risk analysis using mathematical models and simulations to determine the effect of
identified risk events. This approach is more scientific and data-based than qualitative
analysis and requires the use of specific software and specialized techniques.

   Key terms
   Sensitivity analysis (use of a tornado diagram to display sources of uncertainty
   determined by assessing impact to a specific value such as net present value)
   Expected monetary value (the result of the outcome of decision tree analysis)
    The outputs of quantitative analysis provide a detailed probabilistic view of the project
and will assist in determining the likelihood of achieving project objectives. The process
will also assist in prioritizing risks and repeated use of the processes will enable the iden-
tification of trends that will provide additional insight for risk planning purposes.

acceptance means a specific contingency will be planned.
Risk tolerance There are risk seekers, risk averse organizations, and risk neutral organi-
zations. Risk tolerance is an enterprise environmental factor and is affected by manage-
ment's view of risk, the willingness to take risks, and the nature of the business. The utility
factor is important. It is a measure of the tolerance for risk. Utility is defined as the will-
ingness to accept risk, work with it, and manage it. Utility, as it relates to the risk-averse
organization, rises at a decreasing rate as risk increases. Basically the greater the risk,
the less the risk averse person can accept it and manage it. Utility rises at a faster rate for
the risk seeker as risk intensity increases. Risk seekers thrive on risk opportunities.
Risk triggers Symptoms and indications that suggest a risk event could occur. It is
important to address risk triggers before a serious risk event occurs.
Secondary risk Risk generated by the response to a primary risk.
Sensitivity analysis A technique used to determine how different values of an inde-
pendent variable will impact a particular dependent variable under a given set of
assumptions. This technique is used within specific boundaries that will depend on one
or more input variables, such as the effect that changes in material costs will have on
net present value. Commonly displayed as a "tornado" diagram.
Threshold Amount of risk an organization or key stakeholders are willing to accept.
Types of risks Insurable risk: These risk events are associated with a chance for loss
only. Example: accidents, workman's compensation. Business risk: These risk events
are associated with a chance for profit or loss. Examples: competition, market condi-
tions, new product development.
Workaround A temporary response to an unplanned event.

     Procurement Management Processes

Project procurement includes the processes that will assist in determining the specific
goods or services that must be procured externally from an organization. Procurement
management addresses make-or-buy decisions, buyer and seller relationships, types of
contracts, and the risks associated with contract types. It also includes contract nego-
tiations, managing the seller, observing seller/contractor work performance, managing
contract terms and conditions, and closing contracts and procurement activities.
   Project procurement management is the process of determining what, when, and
how to purchase or acquire products or services. It includes three major processes:
 1. Plan procurement management: Preparing the approach to that will decide what to
    procure and how to manage the procurement process
 2. Conduct procurements: The processes associated with submitting proposals,
    selecting sellers, and awarding a contract
 3. Control procurements: Managing procurement relationships, managing changes,
    and documenting performance

   Approved change requests
   Work performance reports
   Work performance data
   The control procurements process is intended to provide direction to the seller,
establish the process to authorize when work can begin, manage the quality of the
work performed, manage changes, and ensure that risks are identified and managed
with the appropriate response.

 PMP(R) Exam Study Terms
Remember to review the different types of contracts and the advantages and disadvan-
tages of each type.
   As an example: When selecting the lump sum or firm fixed-price contract (FFP), the
risk is associated with the seller. Use of the cost-plus contracts generally shifts the risk
to the buyer.
Administrative changes Generally this type of change is for records only and does
not impact the work of the project. Example: changing the account that funds will be
drawn from, address changes.
Bidder conference A meeting scheduled by the buyer to provide information to all
potential bidders. The meeting provides a "level playing field" for potential contractors.
Close out Punch lists (list of unsatisfactory items prepared by the buyer) are prepared,
verification of contracted deliverables is conducted, formal acceptance is obtained,
post project reviews are scheduled and conducted, contract reviews are conducted, and
final payments are made. Project close out is often referred to as a project in itself. It
requires planning, coordination, and a specific set of objectives.
Constructive change An action or inaction by a party associated with the project that
impacts the actual work and requires a change to the planned work. There is usually a
cost associated with a constructive change.
Contract A legal document that includes an offer, acceptance, and consideration
(something of value).
   Definitive contract: The final, agreed upon contract
   Completion contract: The contractor/supplier/seller is required to produce a specific
end product or deliverable
   Term contract: A contract that is intended to deliver a specific level of effort in a
given time frame and may not include a specific tangible deliverable

impose obligations arising under it on any person or agent except the parties to it.
Privity is basically the legal relationship established between the parties through the
contract.
Project reviews At project completion the project manager and team conduct reviews
of the entire project and compare actual results with contractual agreements. Lesson
learned are identified and plans for process improvement are often developed. Project
reviews may be conducted several times during the project life cycle.
Project stakeholder management Identifying the people, organizations, external
groups, and other entities that have an interest in the project or are impacted either pos-
itively or negatively as a result of the project. There are four major processes included
in stakeholder management
   Identify stakeholders
   Plan stakeholder engagement
   Manage stakeholder engagement
   Monitor stakeholder engagement
Special terms and conditions Make sure to identify penalty clauses, liquidated dam-
ages clauses, force majeure clauses (natural disasters, events that cannot be controlled
by the contractor) and other contract terms and conditions that may have a significant
impact on the interests of the parties involved.
Statement of work A narrative description of work to be completed under contract.
This document provides details about the work to be done by the contractor and allows
to seller/contractor to determine if the work can be performed successfully.
Termination for convenience A provision in the contract that allows the project to
be terminated by the buyer for other than performance reasons. Example: The technol-
ogy is no longer needed, there are no additional funds to support the project, the buyer
organization has a change in strategic direction.
Termination due to default A breach in the agreement by the contractor, failure to
provide what was agreed upon in the contract results in termination of the contract.

   be included in the project.
   Stakeholder register: A list of stakeholders, their level of influence, and the strate-
   gies defined to deal with each stakeholder.

consider during project planning and implementation. PMP(R) candidates should include
in their study the issues and sensitivities of managing in an international project environ-
ment. Review the Code of Ethics and Professional Conduct developed by PMI and avail-
able at the PMI website, www.pmi.org.
   Professional responsibility includes the following subjects. Project managers are
expected to be aware of these items and manage appropriately through all project life
cycle phases and when managing each of the five major process groups:
   Ensuring individual integrity
       Responsibilities of employers (fairness and respect for employees), accom-
    modating employee needs, managing diversity in the workplace, complying with
    federal employment laws, dealing ethically with all project stakeholders, mak-
    ing ethical business decisions (honesty and integrity), and dealing ethically with
    employees, customers, and other businesses
   Promoting interaction among stakeholders
       Listening skills, understanding and adapting communication styles to manage
    team effectively (styles may be authoritative, facilitating, judicial, participative),
    effective negotiation and conflict resolution (balancing stakeholder needs, fair and
    reasonable offers, establishing partnerships), recognizing conflict and managing
    conflicts effectively to seek a win-win solution. Conflict management handling
    modes: collaboration, compromise, forcing, withdrawing, and smoothing
   Enhancing personal and professional competence
       Creating a personal development plan for self-improvement and continuous
    education, becoming a mentor and coach
   Contributing to the project management knowledge base
       Documenting and sharing lessons learned. Writing articles, books, and present-
    ing information at project management events.
   Study note: Review the current PMI Code of Ethics and Professional Conduct. The
code specifies four areas: honesty, responsibility, respect, and fairness that are the basic
essence of the responsibilities of the project manager.


     Project Management Formulas

The following are formulas that may be associated with PMP(R) exam questions:

   Communications channels X = [(N) x (N - 1)] / 2 where X is the number of channels
   of communication and N is the number of people on the team
   PERT Weighted average formula (Optimistic + 4 times the most likely value +
   Pessimistic) / 6 - Beta distribution

   Float is obtained during the forward and backward pass calculations in CPM. Float is
the difference between the late finish and early finish of an activity. In some situations,

    showed that the component would actually exceed the customer's expectations.
    You should:
    a. Show the results to the customer but do not discuss the fact that it came from
       the new test procedure
    b. Do not show the results of the new test procedure since the customer's specifi-
       cations call for use of the old test procedures
    c. Change the customer's specifications first and then show the customer the results
    d. Discuss the release of this information with your legal department and senior
       management before taking any action
15. Using the same scenario as in the previous question, assume that the new test pro-
    cedure that is expected to be more accurate than the old test procedure indicates
    that performance will not meet customer specifications, whereas the old test indi-
    cates that customer specifications will be barely met. You should:
    a. Present the old test results to the customer showing that specification require-
       ments will be met
    b. Show both sets of test results and explain that the new procedure is unproven
       technology
    c. Change the customer's specifications first and then show the customer the results
    d. Discuss the release of this information with your legal department and senior
       management before taking any action
16. Your customer has demanded to see the "raw data" test results from last week's
    testing. Usually the test results are not released to customers until after the com-
    pany reaches a conclusion on the meaning of the test results. Your customer has
    heard from the grapevine that the testing showed poor results. Management has
    left the entire decision up to you. You should:
    a. Show the results and explain that it is simply raw data and that your company's
       interpretation of the results will be forthcoming
    b. Withhold the information until after the results are verified
    c. Stall for time even if it means lying to the customer
    d. Explain to the customer your company's policy of not releasing raw data
17. One of your team members plays golf with your external customer's project man-
    ager. You discover that the employee has been feeding the customer company-
    sensitive information. You should:
    a. Inform the customer that project information from anyone other than the project
       manager is not official until released by the project manager
    b. Change the contractual terms and conditions and release the information
    c. Remove the employee from your project team
    d. Explain to the employee the ramifications of his actions and that he still repre-
       sents the company when not at work, then report this as a violation

22. You are managing a multinational project from your office in Chicago. Half of
    your project team are from a foreign country but are living in Chicago while work-
    ing on your project. These people inform you that two days during next week are
    national religious holidays in their country and they will be observing the holiday
    by not coming into work. You should:
    a. Respect their beliefs and say nothing
    b. Force them to work because they are in the United States where their holiday is
       not celebrated
    c. Tell them that they must work noncompensated overtime when they return to
       work in order to make up the lost time
    d. Remove them from the project team if possible
23. PMI informs you that one of your team members who took the PMP(R) exam last
    week and passed may have had the answers to the questions in advance provided
    to him by some of your other team members who are also PMP(R)s and were tutor-
    ing him. PMI is asking for your support in the investigation. You should:
    a. Assist PMI in the investigation of the violation
    b. Call in the employee for interrogation and counseling
    c. Call in the other team members for interrogation and counseling
    d. Tell PMI that it is their problem, not your problem
24. One of your team members has been with you for the past year since his grad-
    uation from college. The team member informs you that he is now a PMP(R) and
    shows you his certificate from PMI acknowledging this. You wonder how he was
    qualified to take the exam since he had no prior work experience prior to joining
    your company one year ago. You should:
    a. Report this to PMI as a possible violation
    b. Call in the employee for counseling
    c. Ask the employee to surrender his PMP(R) credentials
    d. Do nothing
25. Four companies have responded to your RFP. Each proposal has a different techni-
    cal solution to your problem and each proposal states that the information in the
    proposal is company-proprietary knowledge and not to be shared with anyone.
    After evaluation of the proposals, you discover that the best technical approach is
    from the highest bidder. You are unhappy about this. You decide to show the pro-
    posal from the highest bidder to the lowest bidder to see if the lowest bidder can
    provide the same technical solution but at a lower cost. This situation is:
    a. Acceptable since once the proposals are submitted to your company, you have
       unlimited access to the intellectual property in the proposals
    b. Acceptable since all companies do this
    c. Acceptable as long as you inform the high bidder that you are showing their
       proposal to the lowest bidder
    d. Unacceptable and is a violation of the Code of Professional Conduct

Questions and Exercises



Logic problems are a unique way of learning how to apply project management princi-
ples to project situations. They are enjoyable and entertaining. Include these problems
in your project management studies to enhance the learning experience.

     How to Solve Logic Problems

To solve logic problems, the wording in the clues must be read carefully. All of the
necessary information is provided in the clues, and trial-and-error solutions are not
necessary. The problems can be solved with simple logic. In some cases, grids are pro-
vided. Below is the technique for solving the grid problems.

 Sample Logic Problem
Three married couples live in three different cities and each couple has a different num-
ber of children. The husbands are Alfred, Dirk, and Mickey. The wives are Annette,
Barbara, and Cathy, but they are not necessarily married to the husbands according to
the order of the husbands' names. The three cities in which the couples live are Boston,
Chicago, and Denver, and the numbers of children are one, two, and three. In completing
the table below, we will use a "*" to signify "yes" and an "X" to signify "No."

  Clues
 1. Barbara and Mickey are a couple but do not live in Chicago.
 2. One of the couples, which does not include Annette, lives in Boston with their
    three children.
 3. Alfred and his wife live in Denver; they have more than one child.
 4. Cathy's husband's first name begins with an initial that appears later in the alpha-
    bet than Cathy's first name initial

and the corresponding cells will then have a "No" response. We can also elimi-
nate the one child cell from the Alfred row and the Denver column. The result is
shown below.




   Now notice that in the cells that relate husbands and cities, we know that Dirk must
reside in Chicago and Mickey must reside in Boston. Also, Mickey must live in Boston
with three children. The results are shown below.

   For other types of logic problems, the difficulty is in knowing which clue or clues to
start with. Since this may be more complex, hints are provided to assist you.

    Logic Problem #1: Types of Contracts

In the figure below are six different contract types for six different project managers.
From the clues under the figure, determine the contract type for each project manager
and their position in the figure. Knowledge of each type of contract is essential to solve
the problem.

  Project Manager: Jane, Richard, Paul, Frank, Tim, Alice
  Contract Type: Cost plus percentage of cost (CPPC), firm fixed price (FFP),
  cost plus incentive fee (CPIF), fixed price incentive fee (FPIF), cost plus fixed fee
  (CPFF), time and materials (T & M)




  Clues:
 1. The contract type that today is illegal in the government is located in position 4 in
    the diagram.
 2. Tim's project has a contract that contains a "ceiling" and "floor" on profits.
 3. Alice's contract is in an even-numbered position in the diagram.
4. The two incentive-type contracts are located in different rows in the figure and hor-
   izontally adjacent to only one other contract and both of the adjacent contracts are
   for projects managed by female project managers.

      Logic Problem #4: Another Mysterious Network Diagram

A project manager discovers that his team has neglected to complete the network dia-
gram for the project. The network diagram is shown below. However, the project man-
ager has some information available, specifically that each activity, labeled A-G, has
a different duration between one and seven weeks. Also, the slack time for each of the
activities is known as shown below.

    Duration (weeks): 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7
    Slack time (weeks): 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 3, 7

   The critical path is thirteen weeks. Activity F has an early finish time of eleven
weeks, but Activity F cannot be on the critical path because there is only one critical
path, and Activity E is on the critical path. Therefore, Activity G must have a duration
of one week. We now know ES, EF, LS, and LF for Activity E. Because Activity F has
an EF of eleven weeks, the durations of Activities C and F must be eleven weeks, and
therefore five and six weeks. Activity C must be five weeks to align with the ES of five
in Activity E. If Activity C were six weeks in duration, the length of the critical path
could not be thirteen weeks. Using clue 3, and knowing that LF of Activity D must
be twelve weeks, the duration of Activity D must be three weeks. Using clue 4, which
tells us that Activity A has only one week of slack, and knowing that the LF for activity
A is five weeks, the duration of Activity A must be four weeks.

   From the clues, Activities A, C, and E have slack. Activity F must also have slack since
Activity C is on a path with it. Therefore, the critical path must be B-D-G. Since Activity C
has eight weeks of slack, Activity F must also have eight weeks of slack, which means, by
elimination, that Activity A has six weeks of slack and the duration for Activity A must be
four weeks. From clue 1, the critical path, which must have three and only three activities
in it, must be the numbers five, six, and seven, and must be equal to eighteen weeks. From
clue 5, the duration for Activity F must be three weeks and Activity C must be one week.
Therefore, Activity E must be two weeks in duration. Now we can calculate ES, EF, LS,
and LF for Activities C and F. Since the length of the critical path is eighteen weeks, we
now know that the duration of Activity G must be six weeks. After calculating ES, EF, LS,
and LF for Activity E, we know that the duration of Activity B must be seven weeks.

    a. Refuse to accept the gift since it may violate company policy.
    b. Accept the gift but do not report the gift since it was given to your wife rather
       than you.
    c. Accept the gift and report it to your company even though you do not believe
       its value is over the $1000 limit.
    d. Explain the gift acceptance policy to you client and tell him that you cannot
       accept the gift until after discussions with your legal department.
9. Your external client has assigned an onsite representative to monitor the perfor-
   mance of the contract. All reports are provided to the onsite representative who
   reviews the reports for accuracy and then forwards the reports to his parent com-
   pany. After reviewing one of the reports, the onsite representative asks you to make
   changes to one of the reports by including some false statements. The false state-
   ments will make the onsite representative look good in the eyes of his boss.
    a. Make the changes as long as no damage is done to the project but do not leave
       an audit trail of what happened.
    b. Make the changes and prepare an audit trail in case questions arise in the future.
    c. Refuse to make the changes.
    d. Discuss this with your sponsor and possibly corporate legal before responding

    she will not have available all of the resources she would need for your project
    when you need the resources because of resource requirements for other projects.
    When the project was initially approved, she estimated that she would use eight
    people, and they would be available at the right time. Now, because some of the
    other projects are delayed, she has only five people available.
    a. Send her a memo demanding the eight people she promised you.
    b. Ask for a meeting with her to discuss options and contingency plans.
    c. Ask your sponsor to step in and get you the resources you need.
    d. Delay the start date of the project until you have firm commitments from all
       functional managers.

    Crashing the Schedule (Part 2)

1. Part 2 is a continuation of Part 1. Use the same data from Part 1. Let's assume that
   the client wants the project done in the shortest possible time. Crash all the activi-
   ties to their maximum compression time and identify the critical path.

2. Which activities had to be crashed the maximum amount to get to a 22-week
   schedule and which activities did not have to be crashed the maximum amount?
3. Determine the early start and finish times, as well as the critical path elements, for
   the cheapest maximum crash.

2. Activities A and D are on the new critical path and therefore had to be crashed to the
   maximum. Activities B, C, and E are not on the critical path and have some slack.
      For the activities that are not on the critical path, namely Activities B, C, and
   E, they may not need to be crashed. To determine whether or not they need to be
   crashed, at least from a financial point of view, you must be willing to allow multiple
   critical paths to exist. Therefore, by working backward, determine the cheapest way
   to allow the paths B-E and A-C-E to be 22 weeks in length. It is possible that an
   activity may not need to be crashed at all, thus saving money. There are algorithms
   for these calculations, but more often than not they are trial-and-error solutions.
      Out of the remaining activities, B, C, and E, Activity E is the most expensive
   to crash. Therefore you must look at ways to minimize the cost of crashing. Since
   Activity E has two weeks of slack according to the answer to Question 1 Activity E
   can be crashed from 11 weeks to 8 weeks only, thus saving $4000. If we do this,
   then Activity B does not have to be crashed at all.
      There are other types of problems where eliminating slack in Activities B and C
   may be the cheapest way to do a maximum compression. But this is not the case
   for this problem.
3. We now have two critical paths and Activity B did not need to be crashed at all.

2. There is no impact on the end date of the project.
3. Activity F can slip by four weeks.
4. Activity C must slip by more than four weeks.
 5. Activity I has 10 weeks of slack. A slippage of more than 10 weeks will extend the
    end date of the project.


    Earned Value Problems


                                    Remember
Earned value analysis provides the project manager and the key stakehold-
ers to assess the condition or "health" of a project by determining the level
of variance from the scheduled work and budgeted cost of project activi-
ties. The three main elements for determining the condition of the project
are: planned value (work that was scheduled to be accomplished), earned
value (the planned budget for the work that was accomplished), and actual
cost (the amount paid for the work that was accomplished). Typically earned
value analysis is reported in dollars or other currency but other methods of
measurement can be used. Review Chapter 15 in the workbook or in Project
Management: A Systems Approach to Planning, Scheduling, and Closing (12th
edition) for detailed information about earned value management.


   The following problems will provide you with practice in the use of earned value
analysis.
   A small contractor wins a contract to lay tiles on the floors of all 40 offices in a
small office complex. All 40 offices are the same dimensions. The contractor expects to
work five days per week and to complete one office per day. The duration of the proj-
ect is expected to be eight weeks. Labor is estimated at $1,000 per day. The raw mate-
rial costs were paid by the client and are not part of the contract.
   The customer has asked for an earned value report to be prepared at the end of the
sixth week of the project. At the end of the sixth week of the project 24 offices had
been completed at a cost of $27,000. This included a freak accident where the tiles for
two of the offices had to be removed and replaced. Answer the following questions
using the formulas for the end of week 6 report.
 1. SV($) = EV - PV
2. CV($) = EV - AC
3. EAC = (AC / EV) x BAC = BAC / CPI
4. VAC = BAC - EAC

 Earned Value Answers
 1. PV was estimated at 30 offices completed at the end of the sixth week for a labor
    cost of $30,000.
 2. EV is based upon only 24 offices being completed for a cost $24,000.
 3. AC is $27,000.
 4. BAC is 40 offices at $1000 each for a cost of $40,000.
 5. SV from Formula 1 = $24,000 - $30,000 = <$6000>.
6. CV from Formula 2 = $24,000 - $27,000 = <$3000>.
 7. EAC from Formula 3 = ($27,000/$24,000) x $40,000 = $45,000
8. ETC from Formula 5 = $45,000 - $27,000 = $18,000 to finish the work.
9. VAC from Formula 4 = $40,000 - $45,000 = <$5000>.
10. % complete from Formula 10 = ($24,000 / $40,000) x 100% = 60%. This is not
    good because you had planned to be 75% complete by this time.
11. % money spent from Formula 11 = ($27,000 / $40,000) x 100% = 67.5%. You
    have spent 67.5% of the money and completed 60% of the work.
12. CPI from Formula 8 = $24,000 / $27,000 = 0.88
13. SPI from Formula 9 = $24,000 / $30,000 = 0.80
14. Using Formula 12, New time = 8 weeks / 0.80 = 10 weeks. You will finish
    2 weeks late.
15. Using Formulas 6 and 7, SV(%) = <20%> and CV(%) = <12.5%>. This indicates
    that you are behind schedule by 20% and over budget by 12.5%. CV(%) is used fre-
    quently for status reporting, especially if your company's project management meth-
    odology requires that an exception report be prepared if you are above or below a
    certain financial envelop, but SV(%) has limitations. Although a negative SV(%)
    indicates that you are behind schedule, it may be the result of activities that are not
    on the critical path and the original end date may still be workable. If you prepared a
    schedule where activities that were not on the critical path were assumed to start as
    early as possible, you could be using up slack without altering the critical path.
16. Assuming you have 16 offices left to complete, EAC = $27,000 + $16,000, or $43,000.
    This is $2000 less than your answer to Question 7 and probably closer to the true EAC.
17. The main issue is in the determinate of EV for raw materials. EV can be calculated
    when the materials are ordered, when they are received, when they are placed in inven-
    tory, when they are used, or when they are paid for. The number of choices for calcu-
    lating EV makes it a little complicated for standard earned value calculations

    Estimating the Budget at Completion Questions

A company is undertaking a project internal to their organization. Only one functional
department will be involved and the functional manager has estimated that 10,000 hours
will be required to complete the work. The project is scheduled to begin in two weeks.

 5. The most accurate budgetary estimates are made from the actual salary of the
    workers to be assigned. If weighted averaging of salaries is used, then the project
    manager must be prepared to tell senior management that the budget they approved
    at the initiation stage of the project may have to be adjusted.



    Decision Trees



                                     Remember
To be an effective project manager, you must know how to solve prob-
lems and make decisions. Several factors influence decision making, such
as the number of alternatives, the favorable or unfavorable result of each
alternative, the probabilities assigned to each alternative, the risk associ-
ated with each alternative, and enterprise environmental factors that may
not be able to be quantified but identify possible opportunities and threats.
Most executives prefer a discussion regarding your decision explained to
them in financial terms. Fortunately, there are tools that can be used such
as expected monetary value (EMV) and decision tree analysis.


   Calculating the EMV for each possible decision path is a way to quantify each deci-
sion in monetary terms. EMV and decision trees can be used throughout the project's
life cycle but they are most frequently used as part of project risk management. As an
example, you conduct a SWOT analysis to determine whether an idea is worth pursuing.
Unfortunately, there may be a lack of sufficient data to reach a decision. Decision tree
analysis is a means by which you can quantify the data that exists, arrive at a decision,
and convince management that your decision is worth considering.
   Decision tree analysis is a four-step process usually accomplished in the following
order:
 1. Prepare a decision tree outlining all decisions that are required.
 2. Assign a probability of occurrence to the risk, impact or outcome of that decision.
 3. Assign a monetary value to the risk, impact or outcome of that decision should
    it occur.
4. Calculate the EMV for each decision that must be made.
   There are three standard symbols or nodes that are commonly used in decision tree
diagrams:
 1. Decision nodes commonly represented by a rectangle.
 2. Chance nodes commonly represented by a circle.
 3. Outcome nodes commonly represented by a triangle.

   be different than the probabilities for purchasing the product. For example, with a
   higher-quality product, the probabilities of a good market might be 80% or 90%.
   In the above example, if the probabilities of a good/poor market for manufactur-
   ing are 80% and 20%, and the probabilities of a good/poor market using procure-
   ment remain the same at 60% and 40%, then the EMV for manufacturing would be
   $240,000 and would be the better choice.
   The probabilities could be based upon the chances of a specific revenue stream
   occurring rather than the chances of the market being good or poor.
   In the example in Exhibit 1, the best decision was purchasing the product from a
   supplier. But if we consider the profitability over several years with the cost of the
   equipment and training spread over several years, purchasing the equipment now
   may be the better choice.
   Additional decision points can be included, such as whether to conduct a marketing
   survey on market demand should we decide to manufacture the product. There can
   be several decision points in one decision tree diagram.
   Exhibit 1 did not consider the cost of raw material procurement as an addition
   expense when manufacturing a product.
   The final decision is highly dependent upon the accuracies of the probabilities and
   impacts.
   In many situations the EMV calculation can indicate negative numbers.
   The more assumptions we make and the more scenarios that are added into the deci-
   sion tree, the more cautious we should be over the end result.

                                                                                                                      Easy to create, understand, and interpret

                                                                                                                      The decision tree identifies a possible decision that is based upon future rather

                                                                                                                      The more complex the decision tree becomes, and the more assumptions that

                                                                                                                      Outcomes and EMV calculations are based upon an "average" result, which

                                                                                                                      While decision trees have value for project managers, there are other tools
