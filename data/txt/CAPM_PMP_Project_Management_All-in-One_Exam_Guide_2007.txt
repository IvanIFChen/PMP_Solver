 More than once, I've said that I'm the luckiest guy in the room. I get to write and talk
 for a living--what could better than that? I'm so grateful for the opportunity to write
 and must thank the wonderful group of people at McGraw-Hill for their belief in me to
 write yet another book on project management. Thank you to Tim Green, my good
 friend and editor, for your guidance, patience, and confidence. Thank you to Jennifer
 Housh--the best friend a writer could ever have. Lisa McCoy, thank you for helping me
 to be a better writer. Julie Wiebell, the technical editor for this book, has been a good
 friend and persistent editor. Thanks, Julie, for all of your hard work. Thank you to Patty
 Mon for keeping me organized, on target, and consistent with my writing. And thank
 you to Sue Albert who took my scribbles and then created all the artwork in this book.
 Finally, thank you to Apollo Publishing Services who put the parts of this book to-
 gether and made it a reality.
     I would also like to thank the hundreds of people who have attended my PMP Boot
 Camps and project management courses over the past years. Your questions and con-
 versations have helped me create this book and will help thousands of others earn their
 PMI certifications. Finally, thank you to my friends--Dr. Elizabeth Lee, Rick Gordon,
 Yolanda Robles, Phil Stuck, and Dr. Lisa Brown; my brothers, Steve, Mark, Sam, and
 Ben; and my parents.

                                         INTRODUCTION

 This book is divided into two major sections. The first section, which consists of
 Chapters 1, 2, and 3, discusses the broad overview of project management and how
 it pertains to the Certified Associate in Project Management (CAPM) and the Project
 Management Professional (PMP) examinations. Part Two contains Chapters 4 through
 13, which detail each of the nine knowledge areas and the PMI Code of Professional
 Conduct.
     If you are just beginning your PMP or CAPM quest, you should read the first sec-
 tion immediately, as it'll help you build a strong foundation for your exam. If you
 find, however, that you already have a strong foundation in project management and
 need specific information on the knowledge areas, then move on to the second sec-
 tion. You'll find this section specific to the exam knowledge areas that'll help you--
 gulp--pass the PMI examination.
     The book is designed so that you can read the chapters in any order you like. How-
 ever, if you examine the Guide to the Project Management Body of Knowledge, you'll no-
 tice that the order of information presented is the same as the order of information in
 this book. In other words, you can read a chapter of the PMBOK and then read a more
 detailed explanation in this book. This book is a guide to the guide. You'll also notice,
 if you haven't peeked ahead already, that all of the major headings reference to the
 corresponding PMBOK sections. In addition, practically every question in this book
 references the PMBOK directly for additional information, so it's a good idea to have
 the PMBOK handy as you read.

                                                                                               1
    In this chapter, you will
       * Learn to qualify for the PMP and the CAPM certification
       * Learn PMP and CAPM exam details
       * Create a strategy to pass your project management certification exam
       * Learn all about the PMBOK
       * Understand details on projects, project management, and operations
       * Know how to be a successful project manager
       * Work with programs and project management offices
       * Qualify for your exam




 This is a book on how to pass the Project Management Professional (PMP) and the
 Certified Associate in Project Management (CAPM) exam.

     If you're looking for a book on how to do project management, look elsewhere. If
 you're looking for a book on how projects, good projects, should operate, this book
 isn't for you. If you're looking for a primer on project management, move along. There
 are plenty of excellent books available that can help you reach those goals.
     But, if you're looking for a book, a definitive book, on how to pass your project
 management certification examination, this is the book for you. This book will clearly,
 quickly, and fully explain how to pass your certification exam the first time. And then
 you can get back to your life. After all, the exams aren't fun, and I'm certain you've more
 important things to do than spend more time than what's necessary to pass an exam.

                VIDEO     Passing your project management certification exam.


      What this book will do for you:

       * Cover the PMP and CAPM exam objectives in detail
       * Allow you to watch me. On the CD, there are several videos of me teaching
         you exam objectives
       * Focus only on exam objectives
       * Tell you how to pass the PMP or CAPM exam--not just take the exam

                                                                                          3

                * Offer "roadmaps" for each chapter's content
                * Offer 610 total practice questions (Fun!)
                * Not be boring
                * This first chapter covers many things that will help you prepare for and pass
                  your project management certification exam.

               Not everyone can take the PMP or the CAPM exam--you have to qualify first. I
           think this is great. We, and soon you, don't need the market flooded with the "paper
           certifications" that other industries have experienced. This certification is special--it
           proves that the certified professional has documented project management experience,
           education, and has passed a tough, rigid exam. If it were easy, everyone would do it.

                         NOTE As this book covers the PMP and the CAPM examinations, there
                         will be some moments where I'll hop from details on one exam to the other.
                         Don't worry--these exams overlap so much that these awkward moments
                         will be few and far between. Besides, if the information I'm sharing doesn't
                         relate to you, yawn, stretch, and then move along to the information that does.
                         I won't hold it against you.

           All About the PMP Exam
           In order to become a PMP, you need the following (check out Figure 1-1; it's pretty):




           Figure 1-1 The PMP candidate must qualify to take the examination.
                                                               Chapter 1: Preparing for the Exam

                                                                                              5
* Bachelor's degree or global equivalent and 36 non-overlapping months of
  project management experience totaling 4,500 hours of project management




                                                                                                   PART I
  activities within the last eight years.
* Or a high school diploma, associate's degree, or the global equivalent and 60
  non-overlapping months of project management experience totaling 7,500
  hours of project management tasks within the last eight years.
* Regardless of your degree, you will need 35 contact hours of project management
  education. (Ahem--I teach project management classes for companies around
  the world, including an Exam Boot Camp that satisfies this requirement.
  E-mail me for details: pmpcapm@projectseminars.com.) Here are PMI-
  approved methods for accruing the project management education hours:
  * Courses offered by PMI-registered education providers.
  * University or college project management courses.
  * Courses offered by PMI component organizations.
  * Courses offered through your organization.
  * Yes, you can complete your hours through distance learning education
    companies if they offer an end-of-course assessment.
  * Courses offered by training companies.
  * No, PMI chapter meetings and self-study don't count. (Darn! Just reading
    this book won't satisfy your project management education hours.)
* Extended review period of each application. Every application will pass
  through a review period. If your application needs an audit, you'll be notified
  via e-mail.
* Audit! Not every application is audited, but if your application is selected for
  an audit, you'll have to provide documentation of your experience, education,
  and signatures from your supervisors for the projects you've worked on. It's
  fun, fun, fun. Oh, and PMI can even audit a person after they've "earned" their
  certification. (Yikes! Here's where honesty is the best policy.)
* Applicants must provide contact information for supervisors on all projects
  listed on their PMP exam application. In the past, applicants did not have to
  provide project contact information unless their application was audited. Now
  each applicant has to provide project contact information as part of the exam
  process.
* Once the application has been approved, candidates have one year to pass the
  exam. If you procrastinate taking the exam more than a year, you'll have to
  start the process over.
* Be good. You will also agree to abide by the PMP Code of Professional Conduct.
  You can get your very own copy through PMI's Web site: www.pmi.org. We'll
  cover this code in Chapter 13--something for you to look forward to (no
  peeking!).
CAPM/PMP Project Management Certification All-in-One Exam Guide

                * A score of 61 percent is required to pass the exam. The exam has 200 questions,
                  of which 25 questions don't actually count towards your passing score. These
                  25 questions are scattered throughout your exam and are used to collect stats
                  on candidates' responses to see if these questions should be incorporated into
                  future examinations. This means you'll actually have to answer 106 correct
                  questions out of 175 live questions.

                         CAUTION PMP candidates are limited to three exam attempts within one
                         year. If they fail three times within one year, they'll have to wait one year
                         before resubmitting their exam application again. Don't focus on this--focus
                         on passing your exam the first time.

               The PMP exam will test you on your experience and knowledge in six different ar-
           eas, as Table 1-1 shows. You'll have to provide specifics on tasks completed in each
           knowledge area on your PMP examination application. The following domain specifics
           and their related exam percentages are taken directly from PMI's Web site on the PMP
           examination.

Table 1-1   Test Objectives for the PMP Examination (continued)



All About the CAPM Exam
The CAPM exam also has requirements in order to qualify for it--and to pass it. Now
this part is just goofy. The Project Management Institute (PMI), the fine folks that gov-
ern these certifications, have not provided the same level of exam details as they have
for the PMP. Don't flip out; the requirements are lighter and the exam score is lower--
and this book will prepare you for CAPM success. Figure 1-2 demonstrates the follow-
ing CAPM examination details:

     * High school diploma, global equivalent, or better (basically, if you
       matriculated from high school you're on your way).
     * A whopping 1,500 hours or more as a project team member. You'll have
       to document what you did on your projects through PMI's Experience
       Verification Form--and that's one form per project. PMI is a stickler that your
       projects be projects, not operations. A project has a definite beginning and a
       definite ending--ongoing endeavors do not count.

                * Or complete 23 hours of project management education, which you'll
                  document on PMI's Project Management Education Form (PMI really loves
                  these formal documents, don't they?). Here's the cool thing: There's no time
                  limit on when you complete this project management education as long as you
                  can prove it. Note that the class has to be completed prior to completing the
                  CAPM application (finish your class and then finish the CAPM application).
                  (Ahem--I teach project management classes for companies around the world,
                  including an Exam Boot Camp that satisfies this requirement. E-mail me for
                  details: pmpcapm@projectseminars.com.) Here are PMI-approved methods
                  for accruing the project management education hours:
                   * Courses offered by PMI-registered education providers.
                   * University or college project management courses.

                   * No, PMI chapter meetings and self-study don't count. (Darn! Just reading
                     this book won't satisfy your project management education hours.)
                * Like the PMP candidates, your application could be audited. If your
                  application is selected for an audit, you'll have to provide documentation of
                  your experience, education, and signatures of your supervisors for the projects
                  you worked on. It's fun, fun, fun. Oh, and PMI can even audit a person after
                  they've "earned" their certification. (Yikes! Here's where honesty is the best
                  policy.)
                * Once your application has been approved, you have one year to pass the
                  exam. If you procrastinate taking the exam more than a year, you'll have to
                  start the process over.
                * CAPM candidates must also agree to abide by PMI's Code of Professional
                  Conduct. You can get your very own copy through PMI's Web site: www.pmi.
                  org. We'll cover this code in Chapter 13--something for you to look forward
                  to (no peeking!).


                         CAUTION Once you're a CAPM, you're a CAPM for up to five years. At
                         the end of the five years, you can move on to the PMP certification, take the
                         CAPM examination again, or choose not to renew your title. Ideally, you'll have
                         accrued enough project management experience to move on to the PMP title.

               The CAPM exam has 150 test questions, of which 15 questions are considered "pre-
           test" questions that don't count towards or against your passing score. Despite the term
           "pre-test," these questions are seeded throughout the exam to test their worthiness for
           future exam questions. They don't count against you, but you won't know if you're
                                                                        Chapter 1: Preparing for the Exam

answering a live question or pre-test question. Either way, you'll have up to three hours
to complete the CAPM exam.

    The CAPM exam objectives don't go into the same level of detail as the PMP certifi-
cation does. Our pals at PMI have painted the CAPM objectives with some very broad
strokes--which may be a good thing. Table 1-2 provides a breakdown on the CAPM
objectives as posted on PMI's Web site (of course, you'll want to double-check www
.pmi.org to confirm that these objectives are still valid).

Money and Your Exam
These exams aren't free, and you don't want to waste your hard-earned cash failing the
exam. Focus, with my help, on passing the exam on your first shot. But just in case
some of your colleagues ask, I've included the retake fees. You can, and should, confirm
the costs I've listed here with PMI through their Web site. They've changed fees in the
past, and you don't want your exam fees to dig into your beer and pizza cash:
     * Join PMI: $119 (you want to join PMI first, as it lowers your exam fee by a
       few bucks)
     * PMP exam for a PMI member: $405
     * PMP exam for a non-PMI member: $555
     * PMP re-exam for a PMI member: $275
     * PMP re-exam for a non-PMI member: $275
     * CAPM exam for a PMI member: $225
     * CAPM exam for a non-PMI member: $300
     * CAPM re-exam for a PMI member: $150
     * CAPM re-exam for a non-PMI member: $200

           Passing the Exam
           Let's face the facts: This isn't much fun. Learning is hard work. The PMBOK reads like
           the printed version of a sleeping pill. You don't want this process to last any longer than
           is necessary, and your goal should be--it better be--to pass your certification exam on
           your first attempt. So don't think of "taking the exam," but focus instead on "passing
           your exam." You will pass your exam, not just take it. You're scheduling a time to pass
           the exam, not take it. And so on. Pass the thing and get back to your real life.
               Just like your projects have plans, you need a plan on how to study, how to prepare,
           and then how to pass the exam. You can relax on this part--I've done most of the work
           for you.

           Creating Your Study Strategy
           I'll be your study buddy. You need a realistic timeline and a realistic expectation for
           studying to pass your exam. You can create whatever strategy you like, but here's my
           recommended approach to passing your exam. This book has 13 chapters and four ap-
           pendixes. Each chapter in my book corresponds directly with the PMBOK--except I'm
           goofy and the PMBOK is boring. Chapter 13, while it doesn't relate directly to the PM-
           BOK, deals with PMI's Code of Professional Conduct. Appendix A explains every proj-
           ect management document mentioned directly in the PMBOK. Appendix B is the sum-
           mary of all the stuff you absolutely must know to pass your exam. Appendix C is based
           on the PMP Code of Ethics. It's a bunch of fun. You'll need to be familiar with the Code
           of Ethics for your exam--and for the rest of your life. Appendix D is all about the CD-
           ROM, the exams you can find there, and all the great project management videos you
           can watch (get the popcorn ready). The glossary is a glossary--all the terms I use in this
           book (yeah, all of them).

                         VIDEO     How to use this book.



               At the beginning of each chapter, you'll see an icon that looks like this one. It means
           that you should hop out to the CD and watch a video of me discussing the key concepts
           for that chapter. Sometimes I'll include more than one video per chapter, depending on
           what the topic may be. I recommend that you watch the introductory video for each
           chapter before starting. The videos are usually short, and I'm providing some good
           stuff. And you can make fun of my face.
               At the end of each chapter, you'll find key terms. Get a stack of index cards and
           make flash cards of the key terms. You'll use these every day as you plow through this
           beast of a book--it'll help you keep the early chapters fresh in your mind as you hap-
           pily move towards the end of this fine piece of literature.
               At the end of each chapter, you'll find 20 practice exam questions. These questions
           are all from information within the chapter to test your comprehension. I've written
           these questions to be tougher than what you'll likely encounter on the live exam. My
                                                                            Chapter 1: Preparing for the Exam

                                                                                                          11
logic is that if you can answer my questions, you can answer PMI's questions, too. On
the CD, you'll find a Microsoft Excel spreadsheet titled "Exam Scores"--you can see it




                                                                                                                PART I
in Figure 1-3. Enter your chapter scores in the spreadsheet, and you can track which
chapters you need more work in and focus your studying time accordingly.
     Finally, the CD includes one 200-question practice exam and one 150-question
practice exam. Take one of these exams immediately after you finish this book. Keep
taking the exam over and over until you can answer every question correctly. (I'm as-
suming that you won't get 100 percent on the first attempt on this exam. My apologies
if you do.)
     Once you've mastered the first exam, you're ready to repeat the process with the
second. Boy, howdy! Doesn't this sound like fun? It's more fun than taking your live
examination twice, I promise.
     I've outlined quick references for how you should study and then pass your exam.
You may be slightly ahead of other readers in your exam preparations, so I've intention-
ally left dates and timelines at your discretion. I think a couple of chapters a week is
realistic--but I wouldn't do more than five chapters a week. Take some time and create
a schedule of when you'll study, and then take measures to make certain you can keep
the schedule you create.
     Table 1-3 provides a sample strategy that you can modify as you see fit. Your sched-
ule may take more or less time--this is just a sample strategy. I've included a document
titled "My Exam Strategy" on the CD so that you can create your own schedule and
strategy.

Table 1-3 A Sample Study Strategy (continued)


What Your Exam Is Based On
(PMBOK, Section 1.1)
Your project management exam is based on PMI's publication, A Guide to the Project
Management Body of Knowledge. This is commonly called the PMBOK (pronounced
PIM-BACH), and that's how I'll refer to it from now on. I'm not looking to pick fights
or be critical, but the PMBOK is drier than wheat toast. It's not an easy read, a fun read,
or, much of the time, a complete read.
    The PMBOK doesn't aim to define all of the avenues of project management in
great detail. Rather, it aims to provide a "general overview" of the good practices of
project management. The PMBOK defines the generally accepted consensus of the proj-
ect management practices that are most widely utilized.
    One of my favorite lines from the PMBOK comes from section 1.1: "Good practice
does not mean that the knowledge described should always be applied uniformly on all
projects; the project management team is responsible for determining what is appropri-
ate for any given project." I love this quote, because it's a fancy way of saying, "Calm
down. You don't have to do every freaking process, activity, and system within this book--
just determine the processes that are best for your project and then do them correctly."

             EXAM TIP Your exam, however, will quiz you on all of the processes, systems,
             and documents identified by the PMBOK, because all of these characteristics
             are appropriate for projects, but probably not on every project you'll manage.
CAPM/PMP Project Management Certification All-in-One Exam Guide

               When you join PMI, you'll get a CD-based copy of the PMBOK as part of your mem-
           bership, or you can plunk down a few bucks at your favorite bookstore and get a print-
           ed version of the book today. I recommended that you have a copy of the PMBOK for
           several reasons:
                * Your exam is based on the PMBOK. As much as I'd like for your exam to be
                  based on just my writings, it isn't. The PMBOK is what your exam is based on,
                  so you should always reference that book over the one you're reading now.
                * This book is based on the PMBOK. Okay, I gave myself an out in the above
                  paragraph, but truthfully, I've worked very hard for my book to be in synch
                  with the PMBOK. I'll reference the PMBOK as we move through the chapters
                  so you can double-check my facts, questions, and figures.
                * The PMBOK, as dry as it may be, is an excellent book to have in your project
                  management arsenal. It defines processes, systems, and documents that you'll
                  likely encounter in your project management endeavors.
                * Having a copy of the PMBOK on your desk strikes fear and awe into your
                  uncertified colleagues. Well, maybe just the ones from Carlisle, Pennsylvania.


           What Is a Project? (PMBOK, Section 1.2)
           You're a project manager, so you've probably got a good idea of what a project is al-
           ready. I'm hoping. The PMBOK defines a project as "a temporary endeavor to create a
           unique product, service, or result." Projects, like good stories, have a definite beginning
           and a definite end. A project is over when the product, service, or result is created. Or,
           in not so pleasant times, when it becomes evident that the project won't be able to cre-
           ate the product, service, or result for whatever reason (skills, cost, time, or any other
           reason that you can think of why a project might be stopped).

           Temping a Project
           Some project managers get hung up on the idea of a project being temporary. After all,
           some projects can last for years or decades--but they don't last forever. Projects are tem-
           porary in that they have a definite ending somewhere in the future. Projects--at least,
           most projects--create something that will last for some time, usually longer than the
           project team or even the time to complete the project itself. Consider a project to build a
           house, create a park, or develop a software application. These deliverables will be utilized
           for some duration of time. In other words, the project ends, but the benefits and deliver-
           ables of the project continue.
               Notice I said that project deliverables usually last longer than the project itself. There are
           some special projects where this isn't true--such as a project to host a trade show, an event,
           or a fantastic party. Once the party is over, the project is also over and all's done.
               "Temporary" can also refer to the market window status. Remember the Internet
           dot-com boom? It was definitely temporary. I'm sure in your business you can identify
           examples of market windows that were temporary. Project teams are also examples of
           temporary structures: The team comes together, does the work of the project, and then
           once the project is over, so is the project team.
                                                                       Chapter 1: Preparing for the Exam

                                                                                                     15
Defining a Project's Uniqueness




                                                                                                           PART I
Ready for a horrible joke? How do you catch a unique rabbit? Unique up on him. (As
in, "You sneak up on him." My son loved this joke when he was eight, not so much
anymore.) The point of the joke is that uniqueness means that it's different from the
rest of your organization's operations. Consider the creation of a new car. The design-
ing, drafting, modeling, and the creative process of creating a new car could be a proj-
ect. The manufacturing of the automobile, however, typically isn't a project--that's op-
erations. Unique things that a project can create include:
     * Products as an end result of a project, such as a piece of software
     * Products that are component pieces for other projects, such as the blueprints
       for a new warehouse
     * A new service that will be integrated into your organization's functions, such
       as a help desk or an Internet application
     * A result of your project could create something like a feasibility study, research
       and development outcomes, or trend analysis

Progressively Elaborating a Project
Progressive elaboration is a process that all projects move through. The project man-
ager and the project team start very broad--typically with a project's concepts--and
then the concept is refined with details, studies, and discussion until a project scope
statement is formed. The scope statement may pass through additional steps to con-
tinue to refine the project's objectives.
    Did you ever read any of the Sherlock Holmes stories? Holmes would create a very
broad theory of the mystery's solution and then, through a scientific approach and de-
ductive reasoning, narrow his theory over and over until he finally solved the case. He
started very broad and then narrowed his hypothesis. This is one example of progressive
elaboration, although Sir Arthur Conan Doyle never called it that. Basically, progressive
elaboration means that you start with a very broad concept and then, through steady
progressions, you gather more detail to clarify the concept your project centers on. Figure
1-4 is a simple example of progressive elaboration with a project to create a new home.

           Why Do Projects?
           Projects are typically work that doesn't fall into an organization's normal operations. Basi-
           cally, projects are chunks of work that need to be completed, but the work doesn't neces-
           sarily fall into any predefined function of an organization, such as accounting or sales.
                Projects can also be managed by organizations that complete projects all the time
           for other organizations. Consider an IT consulting company that swoops into company
           after company to install and configure new networks, servers, or computer software. Or
           consider an architectural firm that designs buildings for other companies. Or think of
           practically any service-based business, and you'll find a performing organization that
           completes projects for other entities.
                Organizations that treat practically every undertaking as a project are likely participat-
           ing in management by projects. This means that they operate by relying heavily on proj-
           ect management principles to complete their work. This isn't unusual in consulting
           agencies, construction firms, or IT shops--their existence is by management by projects.
                Projects are most likely undertaken for any of the following reasons:
                * Opportunity The market demand may call for a project to create a new
                  product, service, or solution.
                * Organizational needs I bet you can identify some needs within
                  your company that would make dandy projects: upgrading computers,
                  training your staff, changing the menu in the company cafeteria. Usually,
                  organizational needs focus on reducing costs or increasing revenue, and
                  sometimes both (bonus!).
                * Customers Your customers have things that they want you to create for
                  them. Sometimes, these requests develop into projects.
                * Technology Technology seems to change and advance daily, and this often
                  spurs new projects to keep up or ahead of competitors. Know any IT gurus out
                  there managing technical projects?
                * Legal requirements Laws and regulations can cause new projects. Publicly
                  traded companies have been required to secure their IT data in compliance
                  with the Sarbanes-Oxley Act. Health care organizations must adhere with
                  HIPAA requirements. And U.S. companies have been working with OSHA
                  requirements for years and years. Initial conformance to these requirements
                  often creates new projects.


           What Is Project Management?
           (PMBOK, Section 1.3)
           You know what projects are, so what's project management? I can hear you sighing and
           saying, "It's just the management of a project." And I'd concur, but your exam will likely
           need a bit more information than that. The PMBOK defines project management as "the
           application of knowledge, skills, tools, and techniques to meet project requirements."
               Managing a project centers on four things:
                * Identifying your project's requirements
                                                                        Chapter 1: Preparing for the Exam

                                                                                                      17
     * Establishing clearly defined project objectives




                                                                                                            PART I
     * Managing project stakeholders by adapting your plans and approaches to keep
       those folks happy and the project moving along
     * Keeping scope, schedule, costs, and quality all in balance

    This last point really defines the Iron Triangle of Project Management. Sometimes
this is also called the Triple Constraints of Project Management. Figure 1-5 demon-
strates the Iron Triangle's concept: All three sides must remain in balance or the proj-
ect's quality or other facets will suffer. It's not rocket science: If your scope is enormous
but your budget and/or schedule is puny, your project will likely suffer, or even fail.
Chapters 5, 6, and 7 in this book (and in the PMBOK) focus on these three constraints
of scope, time, and cost, so you'll see the Iron Triangle at least three more times.


Back to the PMBOK (PMBOK, Section 1.4)
I follow the PMBOK section by section throughout this whole book. Oh, boy. Of course,
I take the PMBOK and expound on it just a bit--I hope you like it. This section is a re-
flection of the PMBOK's navel-gazing. For some reason, the authors of the PMBOK in-
terject a logical discussion on project management with a pondering on how their book
is organized. Okay. You won't be tested on this specifically, but gosh-golly, it's helpful
to know as you organize your thoughts and study strategy. So here's the scoop:

     * Section 1: The Project Management Framework is made up of the first two
       PMBOK chapters:
        * Chapter 1: The Introduction sets the tone and paints the big picture of what
          the PMBOK can do for you. It's breezy and gets you moving into the book,
          kind of like this chapter.
        * Chapter 2: The Project Life Cycle and Organization discusses the environment
          where projects happen. The project life cycle describes the phases a project
          moves through to get from start to completion.
     * Section 2: The Standard for Project Management of a Project is a whopper of
       a section with one chapter: Chapter 3: Project Management Processes for a
       Project. It discusses the 44 project management processes and the five process

                   groups they live within. It's meaty, and we'll discuss it in depth in Chapter 3 of
                   this book.
                * Section 3: The Project Management Knowledge Areas has nine chapters,
                  and each knowledge area gets it own chapter in the PMBOK. Here's a brief
                  overview of each chapter:
                   * Chapter 4: Project Integration Management defines how each knowledge
                     area is affected by the control and outcome of the other knowledge areas.
                     It's the gears of project management.
                   * Chapter 5: Project Scope Management defines how a project manager
                     should create, monitor, control, and complete the project scope.
                   * Chapter 6: Project Time Management defines how the project manager
                     should estimate the project duration, create the schedule, do some fancy
                     math problems with time, and control and react to all aspects of managing
                     the project schedule.
                   * Chapter 7: Project Cost Management focuses on the project budget and
                     how it is estimated, spent, audited, and controlled through the project.
                     Cha-ching!
                   * Chapter 8: Project Quality Management centers on defining and adhering
                     to the quality expectations of the project stakeholders. We'll examine a
                     whole bunch of charts that measure quality within a project.
                   * Chapter 9: Project Human Resources Management delves into the methods
                     to organize, lead, and manage your project team. We'll also discuss some
                     philosophies and human resource theories.
                   * Chapter 10: Project Communications Management is all about how a
                     project manager should gather, create, and disperse project information.
                     The basic theme for this chapter is who needs what information, when do
                     they need it, and in what modality.
                   * Chapter 11: Project Risk Management describes how you, your project
                     team, and other experts will identify, analyze, and plan responses to risks
                     within your project. We'll cover risk matrixes, contingency reserves, and
                     ways to track risks within your project.
                   * Chapter 12: Project Procurement Management is all about buying the
                     products and services your project may need to be successful. Procurement
                     management includes obtaining acquisitions, selecting sellers, and creating
                     contracts. Get your wallet ready.
                   * Chapter 13, in this book, doesn't correspond directly to the PMBOK, but
                     correlates to PMI's Code of Conduct. I'll explain how you can answer these
                     questions directly and accurately for your exam. Keep in mind that the
                     Code of Conduct for both the PMP and the CAPM candidates are one-page
                     documents, but you'll have several exam questions on ethics and on adhering
                     to PMI's professional code. I'm certain you'll do fine.
                                                                            Chapter 1: Preparing for the Exam

                                                                                                          19
Being a Project Expert (PMBOK, Section 1.5)




                                                                                                                PART I
You can take a project management class and not be an expert in project management.
You can even be a PMP or a CAPM and not be a good project manager. Sorry, but it's true.
To be an expert in project management, you need to rely on more than just the tools and
techniques and other mechanics of project management. You'll need five things:

     * The Project Management Body of Knowledge
     * Expertise in your application area and an understanding of the relevant
       standards and regulations
     * An understanding of the environment in which your project takes place in
     * General management knowledge and skills
     * The ability to deal with people (your interpersonal skills)

    These five attributes and how they interact with one another are depicted in Figure
1-6. The goal of this book is to help you pass your certification exam, but I'm certain
the goal of passing the exam is to help you advance your career and become a better,
more valuable project manager. With that thought process, it's easy to see how these
skills are interdependent. Let's take a quick look at each of these project management
attributes.

           Using the Project Management Body of Knowledge
           Yep, back to the PMBOK. Technically, the Project Management Body of Knowledge is
           the wealth of information that is available to the project management community. As
           far as your exam is concerned, A Guide to the Project Management Body of Knowledge is
           what's important.

           Working with Your Application Area
           An application area is your area of expertise, whether it be construction, manufacturing,
           sales, technology, or something else. And an application can get even more specific if
           we break down an organization into more detail: functional departments, technical
           domains, management arenas, and even industry groups, like automotive, health care,
           and so on. An application area is simply the area of expertise with which the project
           interacts.
               Within most application areas, if not all of them, there are specific standards and
           regulations that the project management team must consider as they plan their work
           and implement their project plan. A standard is a generally accepted guideline for your
           industry, whereas a regulation is a rule that must be followed for your industry or there
           will be fines and penalties. I like to say that standards are optional and regulations are
           not. No one ever went to jail because they didn't follow a standard. Plenty of people
           have visited the big house for not following regulations.

                         EXAM TIP You probably won't see questions on specific application areas,
                         because the PMP and CAPM certification focus on project management, not
                         the arenas in which projects take place. Just know that application areas are
                         industries and technologies that can host projects.

           Understanding Your Project Environment
           Every project takes place in an environment--a location and culture where the project
           will operate. Specifically, the project will affect and be affected by the social, economic,
           and environmental variables of the project environment. It's paramount for the project
           manager and the project team to understand the project environment. Every project
           manager and the project team should consider the following.

           Cultural and Social Environment
           You and the project team must understand how your project affects people and how
           those people may affect you and your project. This means it'll behoove the project if
           you understand the economic, educational, ethical, religious, demographic, and even
           the ethic composition of the people your project affects. We'll discuss this more in
           Chapters 9 and 13.
               Your project may not have a wide impact on people outside of your organization,
           so you should still understand and consider the organizational culture of your proj-
           ect. Consider the cultural achievability of your project, the stakeholders within your
           organization and their political power, and the project manager's autonomy over the
           project.
                                                                      Chapter 1: Preparing for the Exam

                                                                                                    21
International and Political Environment




                                                                                                          PART I
If your project spans the globe, you and the project will need to consider the interna-
tional and local laws of where your project will operate and how the conditions of the
project may vary based on where the work is being completed. You'll also need to con-
sider fun things like languages, time zone differences, holidays, travel issues, non-col-
located teams, and the headaches with video and teleconferences.

Physical Environment
If your project will change the landscape or physical structure of a building, you'll need
to consider the ecology; geography; and environmental concerns, laws, and risks that
are associated with these changes. Consider a project to build a bridge over a wetland
area--there will definitely be ecological, geographical, and environmental concerns to
deal with (I'd worry about alligators, too).

Relying on General Management Skills
In order to be a project manager, you have to be a manager. This means you're focused
on one important thing: key results. And how do you get results? You'll rely on:
     * Accounting skills
     * Procurement
     * Sales and marketing
     * Contracting abilities
     * Manufacturing and distribution principles
     * Organization and logistics
     * Strategic, tactical, and operational planning
     * Leverage of the organizational structure and the organizational behavior
     * Administration of your project team, reasonable compensation, rewards and
       recognition, and career paths
     * Health and safety standards and regulations
     * Using IT to your advantage
   If you come from a business background, you'll have an edge on your project man-
agement exam. Much of project management is based on management skills, and you
can rely, to some extent, on your experience to help answer exam questions. A word of
caution, however: The exam is based first upon the PMBOK and then on your skills.
Answer your questions according to the PMBOK first.

Dealing with People
As a project manager, you have to interact with people--lots of people. You need inter-
personal skills to work with, motivate, lead, and manage other people. Specifically,
you'll need the following interpersonal skills:
     * The ability to effectively communicate Communications is the core of
       project management and will likely take up most of your time.
CAPM/PMP Project Management Certification All-in-One Exam Guide
22
                * A knack for influencing the organization This is simply the ability to get
                  things done. (Wink, wink--I, and the PMBOK, are hinting at politics, power,
                  negotiations, and tradeoffs.)
                * A penchant for leading Project managers are leaders, not followers. You
                  need to be able to lead the project team, stakeholders, and even vendors
                  towards the vision of the project.
                * Motivating people Can you energize and excite people about your project?
                  You need to.
                * Negotiating and managing conflicts A good project manager has the ability
                  to negotiate, lead negotiations, and resolve conflicts in the best interest of the
                  project.
                * Solving problems Projects are often full of problems that you'll need to figure
                  out. Want to know a secret? Your project management certification exam is just
                  one example of where you can apply problem-solving. The questions are tricky,
                  and you'll have to use some brain power to deduce the right choice.


           Examining the Project Management Context
           (PMBOK, Section 1.6)
           Projects typically fall under some other umbrella within an organization: project port-
           folio management, project offices, or programs. The project management context de-
           scribes all the different environments where a project may reside.
               Your real-live organization may have one, all, or even none of these descriptions--
           don't sweat it. For your exam, however, you'll need to be familiar with these different or-
           ganizational situations and how each one affects the project and the project manager.

           Working with Programs
           A program is a collection of related projects organized to gain benefits from the projects
           collectively that wouldn't be realized if the projects were managed independently. Con-
           sider a program of building a skyscraper. There could be lots of projects within the
           skyscraper program: structure, elevators, electrical, plumbing, and tons more.
               If each project were managed independently, a lot of work would have to be dupli-
           cated within the construction of the new skyscraper. But by creating a program, time
           and effort can be saved by managing projects collectively. For example, the electrician,
           the telephone installer, and the network engineer can pool their resources to pull the
           electrical cables, telephone cables, and network cables all at once.
               The point to take away from this discussion on programs is that projects are usually
           contributing one major deliverable and can work together to save time, effort, and dollars.

           Opening Your Portfolio
           Project portfolio management is the selection, management, and collection of projects
           within an organization. Unlike a program, the projects may not be directly related, but
           they contribute to the organization's overall strategic plan. For example, a construction
                                                                      Chapter 1: Preparing for the Exam

                                                                                                    23
company may have a collection of projects in which some are high-profile projects that
could change a city's skyline, and other projects are minor and might be just the con-




                                                                                                          PART I
struction of a small garage or home.
    The portfolio of projects defines the rules for selecting, maintaining, and even fund-
ing the projects within an organization. We all know that a company usually has only
so much money to invest in the project it selects. Project portfolio management defines
the projects that should be selected based on need, risk and reward, return on invest-
ment, and practically any other issues an organization identifies.
    Unfortunately, or fortunately depending on how you look at it, project managers
aren't usually directly involved in project portfolio management. This activity is gener-
ally reserved for senior management, as they decide which project best propels an orga-
nization's mission, purpose, and strategy. Project managers inherit upper management's
vision and then manage the projects they've been assigned.

Working with Subprojects
A subproject is just a project that's been lopped off from a larger project. For example,
a project to build a new house may create a subproject for all of the home automation,
home theater, and home network installation. The subproject is managed as its own
project but has constraints and requirements within the confines of the larger project
to create the new home. Other examples of subprojects include:

     * A single phase within a project life cycle could be a subproject. A good
       example is the phases of construction on a new home: permits, excavation,
       foundation, framing, and so on. Each phase could be a subproject.
     * Human resource skill sets are often identified as subprojects. Consider all of
       the work a plumber, electrician, carpenter, and other skilled workers can do.
       The related work of each professional could form a subproject.
     * Specialized technology, materials, or activities could be subprojects. The
       installation of a new type of siding for our home construction project could
       be considered a subproject, where we'd use a team of specialists to manage
       and complete the subproject.

Working with Project Management Offices
A project management office, often just called a PMO, oversees all of the projects within
an organization and supports all of the project managers within an organization. PMOs
can be organized to manage all projects within an organization, within departments, or
even by the nature of the project work, such as IT versus marketing. Sometimes, a project
management office might be called a project office or a program office.
    Most PMOs support the project manager and the project team through software,
training, templates, standardized policies, and procedures. PMOs often coordinate
communications across projects, offer mentoring to project managers, and help resolve
issues between project team members, project managers, and stakeholders. Project
managers working with a PMO typically report to a chief project officer or program of-
ficer, depending on the organizational structure.

           Chapter Summary
           You're done with Chapter 1. Congrats!
                In this chapter, we talked about the requirements of what it takes to be a project
           management professional and what it takes to be a certified associate in project man-
           agement. Which one are you geared for? Depending on which certification you're going
           to achieve, you'll create a strategy on how you'll use this book, your time, and the PM-
           BOK to pass the examination.
                The PMBOK describes the 44 management processes and how these processes map
           to the nine knowledge areas of project management. This book, like the PMBOK, dis-
           cusses in greater detail (and, ahem, clarity) these same processes and knowledge areas
           you'll need to be familiar with to pass your certification exam.
                We also discussed what a project is--and is not. You now know that a project is a
           short-term endeavor to create a unique product or service. Projects are created for any
           number of reasons, from marketplace demand to solving a problem within an organi-
           zation.
                Projects, regardless of why they were created, move through a progressive elabora-
           tion to provide complete descriptions and wholeness of their goals and objectives. Re-
           call that progressive elaboration typically starts with a broad synopsis of a project's
           goals, and through rounds of discussion, analysis, and brainstorming, the characteris-
           tics of a project become more detailed until, finally, the project vision is created.
                A project manager must understand the environment and circumstances that the
           project will operate in. The locale, culture, and conditions surrounding the project can
           affect the project's success as much as the project manager's ability to lead and manage
           the facets of the project and the project team. If a project management office exists, it
           can provide training and support for the project manager and the project team to ef-
           fectively lead and complete the project work.
                Your next step in your certification quest is to create flash cards on the key terms
           and then complete the 20-question exam. Keep moving!

Answers
   1. C. A project is a temporary endeavor to create a unique product, service, or
      result. Deadlines and cost constraints are tied to the project. A is incorrect
      because programs are a collection of projects working towards a common
      cause. B is incorrect because operations are ongoing activities of an
      organization. D, a subproject, describes a project that is part of and supports
      a larger project. For more information, see the PMBOK, Section 1.2.1.
   2. A. Providing electricity to a community is the best example of operations,
      as it is an ongoing activity. B, C, and D are all examples of projects, as they
      are temporary and create a unique product, service, or result. For more
      information, see the PMBOK, Section 1.2.2.
   3. B. According to the PMBOK, progressive elaboration means developing in
      steps and then continuing by increments. A describes the process of breaking
      down the project scope into the task list. C is not a valid choice for this
      question. D is part of stakeholder analysis, and is not the best answer for
      this question. For more information, see the PMBOK, Section 1.2.1.3.

                4. C. Projects can be created for a number of reasons, and this example supports
                   the market demand choice. A, an organizational need, is a project to satisfy an
                   internal need. B is incorrect because no specific customer asked for this new
                   product. D is incorrect because there is no legal requirement to create the new
                   product. For more information, see the PMBOK, Section 1.2.3.
                5. C best describes a program. A program is a collection of projects working
                   together to gain benefits by managing the projects as a group rather than
                   on an individual basis. A, B, and D are not attributes of programs. For more
                   information, see the PMBOK, Section 1.6.1.
                6. D. Programs are managed by program managers. A, B, and C are incorrect
                   choices. For more information, see the PMBOK, Section 1.6.1.
                7. C. Project portfolio management is the management, selection, and
                   assignment of projects that support an organization's business objectives.
                   A, B, and D are not valid answers. For more information, see the PMBOK,
                   Section 1.6.2.
                8. A. Quality, while important, is not part of the Iron Triangle of Project
                   Management. B, C, and D comprise the Iron Triangle. For more information,
                   see the PMBOK, Section 1.3.
                9. C. A project manager does not have to use all of the processes within the
                   PMBOK, only the most appropriate. A, B, and D are incorrect statements, as
                   the project manager does not use every process or tool and technique within
                   the PMBOK. For more information, see the PMBOK, Section 1.1.
               10. C. Most projects create a deliverable that will outlive the project itself. A, B,
                   and D are incorrect, as these attributes are temporary in nature. For more
                   information, see the PMBOK, Section 1.2.1.1.
               11. C. The PMBOK gives the concept of creating feasibility as a result. A, B, and
                   D describe products and services. For more information, see the PMBOK,
                   Section 1.2.1.2.
               12. A is the best choice, as standards are optional while regulations are not. B,
                   C, and D do not accurately describe the difference between standards and
                   regulations. For more information, see the PMBOK, Section 1.2.5.2.
               13. C. Believe it or not, you don't have to be a PMP or a CAPM to be a successful
                   project manager. A, B, and D are valid characteristics of a project manager. For
                   more information, see the PMBOK, Section 1.5.
               14. B. Time zone differences are not part of the cultural and social environment,
                   but are part of the international and political environment. A, C, and D are
                   part of the cultural and social environment. For more information, see the
                   PMBOK, Section 1.5.3.
               15. C. Customers are not part of the international and political environment. A,
                   B, and D are part of this environment. For more information, see the PMBOK,
                   Section 1.5.3.
                                                                  Chapter 1: Preparing for the Exam

16. A. Financial management and accounting is not an interpersonal skill. B, C,
    and D are examples of interpersonal skills, so these choices are invalid for this




                                                                                                      PART I
    question. For more information, see the PMBOK, Section 1.5.5.
17. A best describes a subproject, which is a project, sometimes smaller than the
    original, that supports a parent project. B, C, and D do not accurately describe
    a subproject. For more information, see the PMBOK, Section 1.6.3.
18. C. Project managers will most likely receive mentoring from the project
    management office. A is not a valid choice. B is not a valid choice because
    ASQ does not provide mentoring for project managers. D is not the best
    choice for the question because the PMBOK specifically identifies the PMO as
    a source for mentoring. For more information, see the PMBOK, Section 1.6.4.
19. C is the best example of operations, as the answer implies that this work is
    done every month. A, B, and D are all unique endeavors that may be done
    once or just occasionally, but are not part of ongoing operations. For more
    information, see the PMBOK, Section 1.2.2.
20. C. While the experience of the project manager is likely considered during

 You've got lots of work to do as a project manager: meetings, planning, coordination,
 leading the project team, and ensuring that the project work is done according to the
 project plan. You're with the project all the way, from the get-go to the final closure re-
 port. You work with project stakeholders to gather requirements, keep them posted on
 the progress, and manage their influence over the project as much as possible. It's an
 ongoing job that ends just after the project work does.

     While your job as the project manager centers on getting the project work done, we
 know that it's really more than just doing the project work. Logistics and problem-solv-
 ing cling to the project like socks to a wool skirt. That's what you'll learn in this chapter
 (no, not about socks).

 Identifying the Project Life Cycle
 (PMBOK, Section 2.1)
 Projects are born, they live, and then they die. Morbid, isn't it? But that simple analogy
 of being born, living, and dying is exactly what the Project Management Institute (PMI)
 calls the duration of a project: the project life cycle. A project life cycle is the project
 from start to finish. Every project in the world has its own life cycle. Consider any proj-
 ect you've ever worked on, whether it is in construction, manufacturing, or information
 technology. Every project was born (initiated), lived (planned, executed, monitored,
 and controlled), and then died (closing). That's the project life cycle.
      If we were to visit a technology guru and check out his projects, he'd have a different
 life cycle from what a construction company's projects may have. Every project life cycle
 is unique to the nature of the work being completed.
                                                                                           33

                         EXAM TIP Because every project has its own life cycle, regardless of the
                         application area, it's tough for PMI to ask specific questions on this subject.
                         You'll likely encounter questions about what a project life cycle is, but not
                         on the activities that would take place in a project's life cycle.


           Examining a Project Life Cycle
           A project is an uncertain business: the larger the project, the more uncertainty. It's for
           this reason, among others, that projects are broken down into smaller, more manage-
           able phases. A project phase allows a project manager to see the project as a whole and
           yet still focus on completing the project one phase at a time.
                A life cycle is almost always comprised of multiple phases. You can identify a proj-
           ect life cycle, most often, by the phases that may exist within the project. A construction
           project may, for example, move through these phases:

                * Research
                * Pre-construction
                * Site work
                * Foundation
                * Framing
                * Rough-in
                * Interior finishes
                * Exterior finishes
                * Landscaping

               The end result of a phase generally creates a project deliverable and allows the proj-
           ect to move toward its completion. Check out the preceding list. Just because a phase
           has been completed does not necessarily mean that the next phase can automatically
           begin. A phase-end review is needed to determine that the phase has met all of its ob-
           ligations and then to authorize the initiation of the subsequent phase. A phase-end
           review is also known as a phase exit, phase gate, or a kill point.


                         EXAM TIP      A kill point is an ideal opportunity to "kill" a project at the end
                         of a phase.


               Imagine a construction project to build a new sports complex for your city. The
           foundation of the entire sports complex may not need to be 100 percent complete for
           the framing of the building to begin. The framing could begin as long as the risk as-
           sociated with starting this phase of the project was acceptable. The practice of overlap-
           ping phases is called fast-tracking (we'll see this again in Chapter 6 in a discussion on
           project time management). While fast-tracking does save project time, it can increase
           project risk.
                                                                            Chapter 2: Managing a Project

                                                                                                      35
            EXAM TIP Fast-tracking is an example of schedule compression, but it




                                                                                                            PART I
            can increase project risk. Fast-tracking is not the same as lead time, which
            is negative time between project activities.
    In most organizations, regardless of the project manager's experience, management
wants to see proof of progress, evidence of work completed, and good news of how well
the project is moving. Phases are an ideal method of keeping management informed of
the project progression. The following illustration depicts a project moving from con-
ception to completion. At the end of each phase, there is some deliverable that the
project manager can show to management and customers.




Project Life Cycle Characteristics
Because every project in the world is unique, it's impossible to say what exactly must
happen in every phase of the project life cycle. There are, however, characteristics of
every project life cycle that are universal:
    * Phases are typically sequential and allow subsequent phases to begin.
    * Project costs and staffing requirements are generally low at the project's
      beginning phases, while costs and resources are highest in the project's
      intermediate phases. As the project moves towards completion, the cost
      and resource requirements generally wane.
    * The likelihood of the project's success is always lowest during the early phases
      of the project. As the project moves towards completion, the likelihood of the
      project success increases.
    * Stakeholders have the highest influences on the project's product during the
      initiating phases, as Figure 2-1 demonstrates.
   Every project moves through phases, and phases comprise the project life cycle.
Phases are logical approaches to segmenting the work, but they primarily allow man-
agement, an organization, or a project manager to have better control over the work
done in each phase. Each phase within a project determines:
    * The work that will happen in each phase
    * The deliverables that will be created as a result of each phase
    * How the phase deliverables will be reviewed, approved, and validated
    * The needed resources for each phase
    * How each phase will be approved to allow successor phases to launch

           Figure 2-1 Stakeholder influence wanes as the project moves towards completion. Cost due to
           changes increases as the project moves towards completion.

           Comparing Project Life Cycles and Product Life Cycles
           There must be some distinction between the project life cycle and the product life cycle.
           We've covered the project life cycle--the accumulation of phases from start to comple-
           tion within a project, but what is a product life cycle?
               A product life cycle is the whole life of the product the project has created. If your
           company had a brilliant idea to create a new piece of software, initiated and managed
           a project to create the software, and then implemented the software, that would be
           most of the product life cycle. The remainder of the product life cycle is the usage and
           support of the software until some day, sadly, the software is determined to be out-of-
           date and retired from your organization. The product life cycle is the whole gosh-darn
           span of time, from concept to project to usage to retirement.


           Meeting the Project Stakeholders
           (PMBOK, Section 2.2)
           Stakeholders are those fine folks and organizations who are actively involved in the
           project or who will be affected by its outcome--in other words, people, groups, busi-
                                                                         Chapter 2: Managing a Project

                                                                                                   37
nesses, customers, and communities that have a vested interest in the project. If you're
a project manager who is working with a senior project manager, or if you are assisting




                                                                                                         PART I
the project manager, you are a stakeholder as well.
     Stakeholders may like, love, or hate your project. Consider an organization that is
hosting a project to move all their workers to a common word-processing application.
Everyone within this organization must now use the same word-processing applica-
tion. Your job, as the project manager, is to see that it happens.
     Now, within your project, you've got stakeholders that like the project; they're in
favor of the project deliverable. Other stakeholders love the project--they cannot wait
for all of the organization to use the same application for word processing. These peo-
ple are considered positive stakeholders. And, sigh, there are those stakeholders who
hate your project and want to do everything they can to make your project fail. Yep,
these people are negative stakeholders.
     Stakeholders, especially negative stakeholders, may try to influence the project it-
self. This can be attempted in many ways:

     * Political capital leveraged to change the project deliverable
     * Change requests to alter the project deliverable
     * Scope addendums to add to the project deliverable
     * Sabotage, through physical acts or rumors, gossip, and negative influence


            EXAM TIP Any stakeholder that is opposed to, threatened by, or wants your
            project to just go away is a negative stakeholder.


    Your role as a project manager is to identify, align, and ascertain stakeholders and
their expectations of the project. You may lead the project or work with another project
manager to confirm the alignment of stakeholder priorities within the project. Stake-
holder identification is not always as clear-cut as in the preceding example. Because
stakeholders are identified as people who are affected by the outcome of your project,
external customers may be stakeholders in your project, too.
    Consider a company that is implementing a frequent customer discount project.
External customers will use a card that tracks their purchases and gives them discounts
on certain items they may buy. Is the customer in this instance a stakeholder? What if
the customer doesn't want to use the card? Is she still a stakeholder?
    Stakeholders can go by many different names: internal and external customers,
project owners, financiers, contractors, family members, government regulatory agen-
cies, communities, cities, citizens, and more. The classification of stakeholders into
categories is not as important as realizing and understanding stakeholders' concerns
and expectations. The identification and classification of stakeholders does allow, how-
ever, the project manager to deliver effective and timely communications to the appro-
priate stakeholders.

                         NOTE In high-profile projects, where stakeholders will be in conflict over
                         the project purpose, deliverables, cost, and schedule, the project manager
                         may want to use the Delphi technique to gain anonymous consensus among
                         stakeholders. The Delphi technique allows stakeholders to offer opinions and
                         input without fear of retribution from management.

           Key Project Stakeholders
           Beyond those stakeholders affected by the project deliverable, there are key stakehold-
           ers on every project. Let's meet them:

                * Project manager The project manager is the person--which could also
                  be you, the certified associate in project management (CAPM) or project
                  management professional (PMP)--who is accountable for managing the
                  project. He guides the team through the project phases to completion.
                * Customer/user The customer is the person or group that will use the project
                  deliverable. In some instances, a project may have many different customers.
                  Consider a book publisher for children. The bookstores distribute the children's
                  book; the adults pay for the book; the children read the book. There is also some
                  consideration given to the user versus the customer. The user uses the product;
                  the customer pays for it. A stakeholder can be both a user and a customer.
                * Performing organization On your project, you'll have a project team. Whom
                  do the team members work for? The performing organization is the entity
                  that employs the people responsible for completing the project work. In some
                  instances, the performing organization can be a vendor whose project team is
                  completing the project work for another entity: the customer.
                * Project team members The project team is the collection of individuals that
                  will, hopefully, work together to ensure the success of the project. The project
                  manager works with the project team to guide, schedule, and oversee the
                  project work. The project team completes the project work.
                * Project management team The people on your project team who are
                  involved with the project management activities. Recall the administrative
                  staff in a projectized structure? Those people are also stakeholders; anyone
                  who contributes to the project is a stakeholder.
                * Sponsor The sponsor authorizes the project. This person or group ensures that
                  the project manager has the necessary resources, including monies, to get the
                  work done. The project sponsor is someone within the performing organization
                  who has the power to authorize and sanction the project work, and who is
                  ultimately responsible for the project's success. Ideally, project sponsors shield
                  the project manager from attacks, scope changes, and authority challenges.
                * Influencers These are people who may not be directly affected by the
                  project's product, but their position within the organization can influence a
                  project. Consider the purchaser for your client. He or she may not be affected
                  by the outcome of your project, but can influence the purchasing decision of
                  the organization.
                                                                             Chapter 2: Managing a Project

                                                                                                       39
     * PMO The project management office (PMO) is considered a stakeholder
       of the project it oversees. If an organization does not have a PMO, then this




                                                                                                             PART I
       stakeholder, of course, isn't valid.

Managing Stakeholder Expectations
Have you ever had an experience that didn't live up to your expectations? Not much
fun, is it? With project management and the large number of stakeholders, it's easy to
see how some stakeholders' expectations won't be realistic due to cost, schedule, or
feasibility. A project manager must find solutions to create win-win scenarios between
stakeholders.

             EXAM TIP If you want to manage stakeholders' expectations, you have to
             know who they are first. Identify the stakeholders, and then you can identify
             their requirements. Once the expectations are identified, get them on paper!
             Nothing beats documentation.

Managing Expectations in Action
Consider a project to implement new Customer Relationship Management (CRM) soft-
ware. In this project, there are three primary stakeholders with differing expectations:
     * The sales director primarily wants a technical solution that will ensure fast
       output of order placements, proposals, and customer contact information--
       regardless of the cost.
     * The marketing director primarily wants a technical solution that can track call
       volume, customer sales history, and trends with the least cost to implement.
     * The IT director wants a technical solution that will fan into the existing
       network topology, have considerable ease of use, and be reliable--without
       costing more than 20 percent of his budget for ongoing support.
    In this scenario, the project manager will have to work with each of the stakeholders
to determine a winning solution that satisfies all of the project requirements while ap-
peasing the stakeholders' demands. The project manager assistant may interview these
stakeholders with the project manager to rank their priorities, along with required and
optional results for the project deliverables.
    Specifically, the solution for the conflict of stakeholders is to satisfy the needs of the
customer first. Customer needs, or the business need of why the project was initiated,
should guide the project through its life cycle. Once the project scope is aligned with
the customer's needs, the project manager may work to satisfy the differing expecta-
tions of the stakeholders.

Identifying the Organizational Influences
(PMBOK, Section 2.3)
Projects happen within organizations, and in most instances, the organization is larger
than the project. This means that your project has to answer to someone, some depart-
ment, or even a customer of the organization. As much as I'd like to call all of the shots
CAPM/PMP Project Management Certification All-in-One Exam Guide
40
           on all the projects I manage, and I'm sure you wish the same, we both know we have to
           answer to someone within our organization. The people who project managers answer
           to are the influencers within an organization.
               How a project is influenced is largely based on the type of organization that the
           project is occurring within. Project-centric organizations fall under two big umbrellas:

                * Organizations that exist primarily to perform projects for others. Think of
                  architects, IT consulting firms, engineering firms, consultants, and just about
                  any other agency that completes work for others under a contractual basis.
                  (This is what I do as a writer and corporate educator.)
                * Organizations that use management by projects to manage their business.
                  These organizations manage their work through their project management
                  system. An IT department, for example, may treat an upgrade of all their
                  network servers as a project. A manufacturer may treat a customer's job as a
                  project. In the traditional sense, these activities are part of their operations, but
                  because there's a definite beginning and ending to that specific work, they're
                  taking advantage of a project management system they've adapted or created.

               You also have to consider the maturity of the organization where the project is be-
           ing hosted. A large internal organization that's been established for years and years will
           likely have a more detailed project management system than a startup entrepreneurial
           company. The standards, regulations, culture, and procedures influence how the project
           should be managed, how the project manager will lead and discipline the project team,
           reporting relationships, and the flow of communications that will take place. Consider
           the cultural components within an organization:

                * Defined values, beliefs, and expectations of the project work
                * Policies and procedures, both within the organization and external to the
                  organization (consider the policies that govern the banking industry, for
                  example)
                * Defined authority for the project manager and over the project managers
                * Defined working hours and work ethics of the project team, project manager,
                  and management

           Completing Projects in Different
           Organizational Structures
           Organizations are structured into one of six models, the organizational structure of
           which will affect the project in some aspect. In particular, the organizational structure
           will set the level of authority, the level of autonomy, and the reporting structure that the
           project manager can expect to have within the project. Figure 2-2 shows the level of
           authority for the project manager and the functional manager in each of the organiza-
           tional structures. The organizational structures we'll discuss include:
                                                                           Chapter 2: Managing a Project

Functional organizations are entities that have clear divisions regarding business units
and their associated responsibilities. For example, a functional organization may have
an accounting department, manufacturing department, research and development de-
partment, marketing department, and so on. Each department works as a separate en-
tity within the organization, and each employee works in a department unique to their
area of expertise. In these classical organizations, there is a clear distinction between an
employee and a specific functional manager.
     Functional organizations do complete projects, but these projects are specific to the
function of the department that the project falls into. For example, the IT department
could implement new software for the finance department. The role of the IT depart-
ment is separate from the finance department, but the coordination between the two
would be evident. Communication between departments flows through functional

           managers down to the project team. Project managers in functional organizations have
           the following attributes:
                * Little power
                * Little autonomy
                * Report directly to a functional manager
                * The project manager may be known as a project coordinator or team leader
                * The project manager's role is part-time
                * The project team is part-time
                * The project manager may have little or no administrative staff to expedite the
                  project management activities

           Matrix Structures
           Matrix structures are organizations that have a blend of departmental duties and em-
           ployees together on a common project. These structures allow for project team members
           from multiple departments to work toward the project completion. In these instances,
           the project team members have more than one boss. Depending on the number of proj-
           ects a team member is participating in, she may have to report to multiple project man-
           agers as well as their functional managers.

           Weak Matrix
           Weak matrix structures map closely to functional structures. The project team may come
           from different departments, but the project manager reports directly to a specific functional
           manager. Project managers in weak matrix organizations have the following attributes:
                * Limited authority
                * Management of a part-time project team
                * Project role is part-time
                * May be known as a project coordinator or team leader
                * May have part-time administrative staff to help expedite the project

           Balanced Matrix
           A balanced matrix structure has many of the same attributes as a weak matrix, but the
           project manager has more time and power regarding the project. A balanced matrix still
           has time-accountability issues for all the project team members because their func-
           tional managers will want reports on their time within the project. Project managers in
           a balanced matrix have the following attributes:
                * Reasonable authority
                * Management of a part-time project team
                * Full-time role as a project manager
                * May have part-time administrative staff to help expedite the project
                                                                           Chapter 2: Managing a Project

                                                                                                     43
Strong Matrix




                                                                                                           PART I
A strong matrix equates to a strong project manager. In this type of organization, many
of the same attributes for the project team exist, but the project manager gains power
when it comes to project work. The project team may also have more time available for
the project, even though the members may come from multiple departments within
the organization. Project managers in a strong matrix have the following attributes:

     * A reasonable-to-high level of power
     * Management of a part-time to nearly full-time project team
     * Full-time role as a project manager
     * A full-time administrative staff to help expedite the project

Projectized Structure
The projectized structure is at the pinnacle of project management structures. This or-
ganizational type groups employees, collocated or not, by activities on a particular proj-
ect. The project manager in a projectized structure may have complete, or very close to
complete, power over the project team. Project managers in a projectized structure en-
joy a high level of autonomy over their projects, but also have a higher level of respon-
sibility regarding the project's success.
     Project managers in a projectized structure have the following attributes:

     * High-to-complete level of authority over the project team
     * Works full-time on the project with his team (though there may be some
       slight variation)
     * A full-time administrative staff to help expedite the project

Composite Organizations
On paper, all of these organizational structures look great. In reality, there are few com-
panies that map to only one of these structures all of the time. For example, a company
using the functional model may create a special project consisting of talent from many
different departments. Such project teams report directly to a project manager and will
work on a high-priority project for its duration. These entities are called composite or-
ganizations because they may be a blend of multiple organizational types.
    Table 2-1 summarizes the most common organizational structures and their attri-
butes.


Working with Your PMO
Recall that a PMO is a schmancy club where all the project managers get together for ci-
gars and martinis. Not really--I just wanted to see if you were paying attention. The PMO
coordinates the activities of all the project managers. Its primary goal is to create a uni-
form approach on how projects operate within the organization. PMOs can exist in any
structure, but are most common in matrix structures and in projectized environments.

           Table 2-1 Organizational Structures and Their Influence on Project Managers

               The role of the PMO is typically to support the project management in the form of
           templates, project management software, training, leadership, and even granting au-
           thority for the project's existence. Often, the PMO provides the administrative support
           a project manager can expect in a projectized environment.
               Here's the big caveat with PMOs: Project team members in a projectized environ-
           ment are traditionally on one project at a time. A PMO, however, may elect to share
           project team members between projects if it best serves the organization. So basically,
           there's no hard and fast rule for the assignment of project team members to an indi-
           vidual project if they are reporting to the PMO rather than directly to the project man-
           ager. For your CAPM or PMP exam, keep this in mind: The project managers report to
           the PMO, and the PMO may exercise its authority over the project managers' control of
           the project team.

           Defining a Project Management System
           A project management system is a collection of tools, resources, a project management
           methodology, and defined procedures a project manager uses to complete a project.
           Project management is typically defined for the organization, and the collection of
           tools and resources is considered the project management system--it's the approach to
           managing projects within an organization.
               Your project management plan defines how your project will work with and utilize
           the project management system on which your organization relies. Of course, you don't
           have to have a project management system, but most companies do. A project manage-
           ment system will vary based on the project's application area, organizational structure,
           and the project complexity.
               If an organization is using a PMO, the PMO will likely control and dictate the func-
           tions of the project management system. For your PMI exam, know that a project man-
           agement system defines the processes and procedures a project manager is to follow to
           complete a project.
                                                                            Chapter 2: Managing a Project

Chapter Summary




                                                                                                            PART I
Studying for your project management exam can be its own project. You have a sense
already where this project is going: to your certification. Sooner or later, your certifica-
tion project will end and you'll move on to other goals. Projects are the same way. They
have a life of their own, and it's called the project life cycle.
      Every project, regardless of the application area, follows its own logical path from
initiation to closure. Within the project life cycle, there are phases that allow the project
to move towards completion. At the end of a phase, the project should create some
deliverable or condition that allows the next phase to begin. Sometimes, depending on
the associated risk, phases are allowed to begin even when previous phases are not
completed; this is fast-tracking.
      A project has the most uncertainty of finishing successfully at the beginning because
it's a long, long way to completion. As a project moves closer to completion, the likelihood
of project success increases because the completion of phases moves the project closer to
completing the project objectives. Also, at the start of the project, stakeholders have the
highest influence on the project's deliverables. This means they can easily pick and choose
and change their minds over and over because nothing has been created yet. When the
project begins to create deliverables and move towards closure, it becomes increasingly
difficult for stakeholders to change their minds on what the project deliverable should be.
Stakeholders can still change their mind (and they often do), but it'll usually cost more
time and money the later they wait to announce changes to the project requirements.
      Speaking of stakeholders, the folks who have a vested interest in the outcome of a
project, it's up to the project management team to define all of the stakeholders within
a project. If the project team fails to identify a key stakeholder, trouble and risk can
ensue. Recall that stakeholders can also be positive or negative, depending on their
position on the project's purpose and the desired project deliverable.
      The organizational structure can help the project team identify the stakeholders,
but the organizational structure also identifies the project manager's authority. This
authority ranks from low to high in the following order of organizational structures:
functional, weak matrix, balanced matrix, strong matrix, projectized.
      Project management offices support the project manager by providing software,
templates, training, and often administrative staffing.
      For your exam, pay special attention to the attributes of a project life cycle and its
phases. You'll also want to zoom in on the organizational structures and their charac-
teristics. You'll likely encounter questions in which you, as the project manager, will
need to respond to a scenario. The response will be determined by the organizational
structure within which the project manager is operating.

Key Terms
Balanced matrix structure An organization where organizational resources are
pooled into one project team, but the functional managers and the project managers
share the project power.
Composite structure An organization that creates a blend of the functional, matrix,
and projectized structures.

           Customer/user The person(s) who will use the project's deliverables.
           Deliverable A verifiable, measurable product or service created by a phase and/or a
           project.
           Functional structure An organization is divided into functions, and each employee
           has one clear functional manager. Each department acts independently of the other
           departments. A project manager in this structure has little to no power and may be
           called a project coordinator.
           Influencers Persons who can positively or negatively influence a project's ongoing
           activities and/or the project's likelihood of success.
           Kill point The review of a phase to determine if it accomplished its requirements. A
           kill point signals an opportunity to kill the project if it should not continue.
           Negative stakeholder A stakeholder who does not want a project to succeed. He or
           she may try to negatively influence the project and help it fail.
           Performing organization The organization whose employees or members are most
           directly involved in the project work.
           Phase The logical division of a project based on the work or deliverable completed
           within that phase. Common examples include the phases within construction, software
           development, or manufacturing.
           Phase exit The review of a phase to determine if it accomplished its requirements.
           Phase gate The review of a phase to determine if it accomplished its requirements.
           Phase-end review The review of a phase to determine if it accomplished its require-
           ments. A phase-end review is also called a phase exit, a phase gate, and a kill point.
           Positive stakeholder A stakeholder who wants a project to exist and succeed. He or
           she may try to positively influence the project and help it succeed.
           Product life cycle The life cycle of the product a project creates. For example, a project
           can create a piece of software; the software then has its own life cycle until it becomes
           defunct.
           Project life cycle The collection of phases from the start of a project to its completion.
           Project management office (PMO) A business unit that centralizes the operations and
           procedures of all projects within the organization. The PMO supports the project man-
           ager through software, templates, and administrative support. A PMO can exist in any
           organizational structure, but it is most common in matrix and projectized structures.
           Project management system The defined set of rules, policies, and procedures that a
           project manager follows and utilizes to complete the project.
           Project stakeholder      Anyone who has a vested interest in a project's operation and/or
           its outcome.

Case Study
Managing Projects from Start to Completion
The Riverside Community Park Project was an endeavor to create a 140-acre commu-
nity recreation park alongside the White River. The project, led by Thomas Stanford and
assisted by Jan Steinberg, included many deliverables for the community, including:

    * A walkway along the river connecting restaurants and neighborhoods
    * Hiking trails
    * Baseball and soccer fields
    * Water access points
    * Picnic areas
    * Children's playgrounds
    * An indoor family swimming facility
    * Parking areas

Examining the Project Deliverables
The first phase the project moved through was in-depth planning and development.
The project scope was broken down into four major categories:

    * River-related deliverables, such as docks and fishing areas
    * Structural-related deliverables, such as the indoor swimming facility
    * Environment-related deliverables, such as the hiking trails
    * Common areas, such as the picnic and parking areas

    Each of these deliverables was broken down into components that could, in turn,
be broken down into exact deliverables for the project. For example, the indoor swim-
ming facility included the excavation of the grounds for the building, the construction
of the building, and the indoor swimming pool.
CAPM/PMP Project Management Certification All-in-One Exam Guide
48
                Each deliverable was broken down to ensure that all of the required components
           were included in the project plan. Each category of deliverables went through a similar
           process to ensure that all of the deliverables were accounted for and that the project
           plans were complete. Stanford and Steinberg worked with a large project team that
           specialized in different disciplines within the project work.
                For example, Holly Johnson of EQHN Engineering served as team lead for the river-
           related deliverables. Johnson has years of experience in construction projects dealing
           with lakes, rivers, and manufactured waterways. Her expert judgment contributed to the
           development of the plan and the breaking down of the work.
                Don Streeping of RHD Architecture and Construction helped Stanford develop the
           requirements, features, and components of the indoor swimming facility. RHD Archi-
           tects designed the building and swimming facilities for the project and helped map out
           the timeline for a feasible completion and successful opening day.
                Grey Jansen with the Department of Natural Resources and Marci Koening with the
           Department of Urban Planning worked with Stanford to create several different hiking
           trails and a pedway along the riverfront. The elaborate trail system offers challenging
           hikes to pleasant strolls. In addition, the pedway allows visitors to walk through more
           than 50 acres along the river and to visit restaurants, shopping centers, and other com-
           mercial ventures within the park. Without Jansen's and Koening's expertise, the project
           would not have been a success.
                Finally, John Anderson led the team responsible for the common areas. The children's
           playgrounds are top-notch, and there is ample parking and access to the park. In addition,
           Anderson's team created soccer fields and two baseball diamonds for Little League usage.

           Examining the Project Phases
           When the project was launched, the 140-acre tract was a marshy, brush-filled plot of
           land that was mostly inaccessible to the general public. In order for this undertaking to
           be successful, the project had to move through several phases. Many of the deliverables,
           such as the parking areas and maintenance roads, had to be created first in order to al-
           low the equipment and workers to access the sites throughout the park.

           Phase One
           The first phase of the project was in-depth planning. Stanford and Steinberg worked
           with each of the team leaders and other experts to coordinate the activities to create the
           deliverables in a timely fashion. In order to maximize the return on investment, the
           project's plan called for immediate deliverables for the public.
               The planning phase of the project resulted in:
                * The project plan and subsidiary plans, such as cost, risk, and scope
                  management plans
                * Design specifications for each of the major deliverables
                * A schedule that allows for the deliverables to work in tandem and for them to
                  support one another throughout the project plan
                * The creation of a work authorization system
                * Continued community buy-in for the project
                                                                           Chapter 2: Managing a Project

                                                                                                     49
Phase Two




                                                                                                           PART I
Once the project's plan and coordination between teams was realized, John Anderson's
crew went to work on Phase Two of the project: creating accessibility. This phase of the
project became known as the "Rough-In" phase because roads, parking, and prepara-
tion of the park were needed immediately. This phase resulted in:

     * Access roads throughout the park
     * Entry roads to the park at several points throughout the city
     * Junction roads that allowed easy access for construction equipment to be
       stored on-site for the project's duration

Phase Three
Phase Three of the project allowed each team to begin its work independently, with an
eye towards common delivery dates. For example, Johnson and Jansen had expertise in
separate deliverables: the water access points and the trails throughout the park. The proj-
ect plan called for trails along the river and through the woods, which would be built by
Johnson's crew. In tandem with the hiking trails, Johnson's team went to work on the
river pedway. At several points along the river pedway, trails from the woods would con-
nect to the paved surface. These two deliverables were timed so that both teams would
work together on connecting the nature trails with the river pedway. In addition, caution
had to be taken to preserve the environment in the woods and in the water.
    Streeping's primary responsibility was the creation of the indoor swimming facility.
This deliverable required excavation, the digging and creation of the indoor swimming
pool, and the construction of the facility to house the indoor swimming pool. Streep-
ing had to coordinate the construction with Anderson, as the swimming pool needed
the largest parking area in the compound. Stanford and Steinberg worked with each
team leader to facilitate a common schedule for each of the deliverables.
    This phase saw its first completed deliverable for the project: A children's play-
ground was opened near the park entrance that the public could begin using immedi-
ately. The playground can easily host up to 75 children at once and has parking for up
to 50 cars. In addition, a picnic shelter was opened adjacent to the playground. Because
of the proximity of the park and playground to nearby shops and restaurants, this de-
liverable was well-received from the community, and the public began enjoying the
facilities immediately.
    Other deliverables in the phase included:

     * Restroom facilities installed at several points throughout the park
     * Excavation of several water access points
     * Excavation for the swimming facility
     * Clearing and leveling for the soccer and baseball fields

Phase Four
Phase Four of the project focused on creating more usable deliverables for the general
public. The focus was on the hiking trails throughout the park and partial completion
of the river pedway. The hiking trails required brush to be removed, some trees to be
CAPM/PMP Project Management Certification All-in-One Exam Guide

           removed, and the land to be graded for passable hiking. The pedway was initially
           formed as a cement path that will be blacktopped once it is connected throughout the
           park. Like the hiking trails, the pedway required the removal of brush and trees while
           considering the environmental preservation of the river.
               Jansen's and Anderson's teams worked together to clear the pedway, remove the
           brush along the riverbank, and preserve the older trees to create a stunning walk along
           the river. To create maximum deliverables, the pedway was implemented at opposite
           ends of the 50-acre trail, with plans to be connected at acre 25. This allows the public
           to enjoy the deliverables in increments from either end of the park.
               This phase created these deliverables:
                * Seven of the ten hiking trails in the system were cleared and opened for public
                  usage.
                * A total of 30 acres of the river pedway were completed (15 acres on both ends
                  of the pedway).
                * The swimming pool was excavated and the cement body of the pool was installed.

           Phase Five
           Phase Five of the project was perhaps the most exciting, as it completed several deliv-
           erables:
                * The remaining three of the hiking trails were completed. These trails included
                  bridges over small creeks that feed into the White River.
                * The remaining 20 acres of the river pedway were excavated and completed
                  with the cement pour. Citizens can now walk or ride their bikes the entire
                  50-acre length alongside the river.
                * The soccer and baseball facilities were installed, which included restrooms,
                  concession stands, bleachers, fences, and dugouts. The fields were also seeded
                  and fertilized, and will be officially open for public use next spring when the
                  grass is healthy.

           Phase Six
           Phase Six of the project was the longest, but most satisfying. This phase focused on the
           completion of the indoor swimming facility. The structure includes two Olympic-sized
           swimming pools, diving boards, locker rooms, sauna and steam facilities, and a restau-
           rant. The building is situated on a hill that overlooks the river pedway--it is the crown
           jewel of the park. The facility was completed as planned and was opened to the public.
               This phase also included:
                * The completion of blacktopping the 50-acre pedway along the river
                * Closing and sodding of the temporary construction equipment corral
                * Installing the remaining playgrounds and picnic areas throughout the park
                * Opening the water access points, including a commercial dock for fishermen
                  and boaters
                * The official opening of the soccer and baseball fields
                                                                          Chapter 2: Managing a Project

Controlling Project Changes




                                                                                                          PART I
Throughout the project, the public had many requests for changes to the project scope.
The project scope was quite large, and the project budget had limited room for addi-
tional changes without requesting additional funds.
    When changes were proposed, such as the addition of tennis courts to the common
areas, they were considered for validity, cost, risk, and the impact on the project scope.
A Change Control Board, which Stanford initiated, considered the proposed changes
and then approved or declined the changes based on predetermined metrics, such as
time, cost, and overall change on the original project scope.
    When the project was initiated, a public meeting was held to gather input from the
community on the deliverables they would most like to see in the park. At this point of
the project, the stakeholders--the community at large--had a great opportunity to
voice their opinions on what the park should and should not include. Once a consen-
sus was created for the park deliverables and a scope was created, it became challenging
for anyone to add to it.
    Some changes, however, proved valuable and were added to project deliverables.
For example, the commercial fishing and boating dock within the park was a viable
opportunity for a local businessman to provide a service for boaters and the commu-
nity at no cost to the project. Koening and Johnson worked with the business to ensure
that it met the city codes, safety regulations, and fit within the scheme and overall ef-
fect of the project.
    Other changes, such as the tennis courts, were declined. While there very well may
be many tennis players in the community, this request was denied for several reasons:

     * The city already supports many tennis courts in the community.
     * A private tennis club is in the vicinity of the park, and they protested the
       addition of the tennis courts, as this would have an economical blow to their
       business.
     * No tennis players requested the courts at any of the public meetings discussing
       the creation of the park.

   Changes, especially in a project of this size, had to be tracked and documented. Any
changes that were approved or declined were cataloged for reference against future
change requests that may have entered the project.

Answers
   1. A. The project life cycle is comprised of phases. B is incorrect because
      milestones may exist within the project plan, but they do not comprise the
      project life cycle. C is wrong because estimates are not directly related to the
      project life cycle. D is incorrect because activities comprise the phases within
      the project life cycle, but not the project life cycle itself. For more information,
      see the PMBOK, Section 2.1.
   2. B. The completion of a project phase may also be known as a kill point.
      Lessons learned is a collection of information and knowledge gained through
      an experience, typically a phase, within the project, so A is wrong. Earned
      value management can happen at different times throughout the project,
      not just at the end of a project phase; therefore, C is wrong. D, conditional
      advancement, is a term that is used to describe the conditions that must be
      present for the work to continue on a project. Conditional advancement,
      however, does not have to happen only at the end of a project phase. For
      more information, see the PMBOK, Section 2.1.2.
   3. D. A deliverable is something that can be verified and measured. A defines
      the resources in order to create the deliverable. B is an inaccurate statement.
      C defines how the work and resources will be utilized in order to create the
      project deliverable, not the deliverable itself. For more information, see the
      PMBOK, Section 2.1.2.
   4. A. The project life cycle is comprised of all of the project phases within a
      project. B describes the life of many projects that create a unique product
      or service. C and D are incorrect because they do not accurately describe
      the project life cycle. For more information, see the PMBOK, Section 2.1.
   5. D. Projects typically have low costs and low demands for resources early in
      their life cycle. Choices A, B, and C are incorrect statements in regards to
      projects. For more information, see the PMBOK, Section 2.1.1.
CAPM/PMP Project Management Certification All-in-One Exam Guide
56
                6. C. As the project moves closer to completion, the likelihood of risk diminishes,
                   but should the project fail, its consequence is the highest because of the time,
                   monies, and effort invested in the project. A, B, and D are incorrect in regards to
                   risk assessment in a project. For more information, see the PMBOK, Section 2.1.1.
                7. D. Projectized structures often have project team members assigned to the project
                   on a full-time basis. A, B, and C are incorrect because these structures have part-
                   time project teams. For more information, see the PMBOK, Section 2.3.3.
                8. A. Organizations often divide projects into phases to make the management
                   and control of the project easier and more productive. B and C are incorrect
                   because these statements identify an attribute of a phase, not the reason to
                   create all phases. D is incorrect because this statement is not true for all projects;
                   in addition, cash flow forecasting is part of planning and is not universal to all
                   project phases. For more information, see the PMBOK, Section 2.1.
                9. D. The project life cycle does not define how much each phase of the project
                   will cost. The project life cycle does define the work to be done in each phase,
                   the deliverables each phase will create, and the resources needed in each
                   phase, so choices A, B, and C are incorrect. For more information, see the
                   PMBOK, Section 2.1.1.
               10. B. Projects are most likely to fail at the start of the project. As the project moves
                   closer to the project completion, its odds of finishing successfully increase. A
                   is not an accurate statement. C is incorrect because the project is more likely
                   to finish successfully at the end of the project. D is also incorrect because the
                   intermediate phases show progress towards project completion. The closer the
                   project moves away from its start and towards completion, the higher the odds
                   of success are. For more information, see the PMBOK, Section 2.1.1.
               11. B. The eager customer is an example of a positive stakeholder. A, the
                   comptroller, is usually an influencer and not a positive or negative
                   stakeholder for most projects. C, the environmental group that has claims
                   against your project, is an example of a negative stakeholder. D, the union, is
                   another example of a project influencer. In this example, the union is neutral,
                   but there are instances when a union could become either a positive or
                   negative stakeholder. For more information, see the PMBOK, Section 2.2.
               12. B. An influencer is the only key stakeholder the PMBOK specifically addresses
                   out of those listed within this question. A, the union, and C, the technical
                   interface, could be examples of influencers, but not in every project. D, an
                   inspector, is not a key stakeholder in every project, although an inspector
                   could be considered an influencer if one were involved with your project.
                   For more information, see the PMBOK, Section 2.2.
               13. A. Because you are working within a functional organization, you have little
                   to no power, and the functional manager has all of the power. You must obey
                   the functional manager and get to work. B, C, and D are all incorrect choices
                   for the project manager in a functional structure. For more information, see
                   the PMBOK, Section 2.3.3.3.
                                                                        Chapter 2: Managing a Project

    functional structure. D is not valid. For more information, see the PMBOK,
    Section 2.3.4.
15. B. It's easiest and least costly for stakeholders to ask for changes at the start of
    the project. A is incorrect, as changes can easily be requested after the charter
    is created but before the project work begins. C is not true, as changes may
    affect work that has already been completed. D is absolutely false, as these
    changes may have the highest cost on the project.
16. A. The end of a phase is also known as a kill point. B is inaccurate, as projects
    are most likely killed at the end of a project phase, not its start. C is incorrect,
    as the most likely answer is A. D is also incorrect, as technology may change,
    but the demand for the project deliverable may not. If technology has changed,
    the project may elect to upgrade the technology being used to the newer
    available technology. For more information, see the PMBOK, Section 2.1.2.
17. C. Nancy cannot simply ignore the negative stakeholders. Their influence on
    the project may cause the project to fail. Nancy must work with the negative
    stakeholders to squelch their protests, or consider their demands to ensure
    compliance or agreement with their issues. A, B, and D are all inaccurate
    outcomes of ignoring the stakeholders. For more information, see the
    PMBOK, Section 2.2.
18. D. The experience of the project management team is not a cultural attribute
    of an organization. A, B, and C--the policies and procedures, the work
    ethics, and the view of authority relationships--are all classic examples of an
    organization's culture. For more information, see the PMBOK, Section 2.3.2.
19. B. The project plan defines how the project management system will be used.
    A is incorrect; the project charter defines the project manager. C is incorrect
    because the staffing management plan (see Chapter 9) defines how the
    project team will be assembled and managed. D is incorrect because not every
    project will need to ship a deliverable to a customer. For more information,
    see the PMBOK, Section 2.3.5.
20. B. The functional manager has the power over the project funding, not the
    project manager. A, C, and D are all incorrect statements, as these do not
    define the authority of the project manager in a weak matrix structure. For
    more information, see the PMBOK, Section 2.3.3 and Figure 2-6 in the
    PMBOK.

 Projects are chockablock full of processes. A process is a set of actions and activities to
 achieve a product, result, or service. It's the work of project management to move the
 work of the project towards the deliverable the project aims to create. As you'll discover
 in this chapter, there are 44 project management processes that a project manager and
 the project team use to move a project along. The whole goal of these processes is to
 have a successful project, but a project's success is based on more than just leveraging
 these processes. A successful project depends on four things:

       * Using the appropriate processes at the appropriate times. A project manager
         must recognize situations within the project that call for different processes
         and then determine which process or combination of processes is most
         needed to meet the project objectives.
       * Following a defined project management approach to take the product
         specifications and meet the project objectives, and then fulfill customer
         expectations.
       * Conforming the project and the project management approach to the
         customer requirements and expectations.
       * Balancing the project's time, cost, scope, quality, resources, and risk while
         meeting the project objectives.

                Sure, sure all of this sounds so easy on paper, doesn't it? Project management is not
           an easy task, but the goal of a certified project manager is to recognize the situations,
           react to the problems or opportunities, and move the project work towards the customer's
           requirements. The 44 project management processes are the actions that help any proj-
           ect manager do just that.
                This chapter covers the entire project management life cycle. We'll follow the activi-
           ties that happen in each of the project management process groups and what the results
           of those actions are.

                         VIDEO     Moving through the project management processes.



           Loving the Project Management Processes
           (PMBOK, Section 3.1)
           Before we get too deep into this chapter, learn this: You do not have to do every single
           project management process on every single project. The project manager and the proj-
           ect team must determine which project management processes are most appropriate
           for each project. Once the needed processes have been identified, the project manager
           and project team must also determine to what extent the processes are needed. The
           processes are tailored to their project. As a heuristic, larger projects require more detail
           than smaller projects.
               The 44 project management processes have been recognized as good practices for
           most projects, but they are not a mandate for good practices on all projects. For your
           Project Management Institute (PMI) examination, however, you'll be tested on all of
           the project management processes in detail. Yep. Although you may not use all of the
           project management processes in the real world, the exam will test you on all of the
           processes as if you do. Why? Because there is, no doubt, more than one way to manage
           a project. PMI isn't stubborn enough to say it's our way or no way--that'd be unrea-
           sonable.
               The approach that PMI does take, however, is based somewhat on W. Edwards
           Deming's Plan-Do-Check-Act cycle, as Figure 3-1 demonstrates. In Deming's model,
           adapted by the American Society for Quality, the end of one process launches the start
           of another. For example, the end of the planning process allows the launch of the doing
           process. Once the work has been completed, you check it. Based on the results of your
           investigation, you'd move right into the acting process, which means you're responding
           to the results of your checking process.
               PMI's project management model, which we'll see throughout this chapter, is a bit
           more involved than the Plan-Do-Check-Act approach. Figure 3-2 demonstrates the big
           picture of project management. The components of the model are called the process
           groups. Process groups are collections of the processes you'll be doing in different situa-
           tions within your project. You've experienced, I'm sure, that projects are initiated, planned,
           executed, monitored and controlled, and then closed. There are distinct actions that fit
           nicely within each one of the process groups--that's the gist of this chapter.
                                                              Chapter 3: Examining the Project Process

is based on the Plan-
Do-Check-Act cycle.




Examining the Process Group Interactions
At first glance, the project management model seems simple. With more study, how-
ever, you'll see how complex the interactions between the groups can be. First, project
managers realize that there is more than one way to manage a project. Second, these
processes and their interactions are the generally accepted best approach to project
management. Having said that, there is no hard and fast rule as to the order in which a
process should occur once the project is in motion. The nature of the project, the sce-
nario, and the experienced conditions, along with the culture and maturity of the orga-
nization, will dictate which process is the best process at any given project moment.
    The general consensus on the order of the process groups is as follows:
     1. Initiating
     2. Planning
     3. Executing
     4. Monitoring and controlling
     5. Closing

Figure 3-2

through five process
groups to reach their
completion.

              The caveat is that a project manager can move between planning, executing, and the
           monitoring and controlling process groups on an as-needed basis. For example, during
           project execution, a new risk could be identified. The project manager and project team
           move back into the planning phase to determine how to respond to the new risk, and
           then they'll continue to monitor and control the project for additional risks.

                         EXAM TIP The generally accepted flow of the process groups is also for
                         more than just projects. A project manager can use the processes within these
                         groups for each phase of a project.

           Choosing the Appropriate Project Processes
           (PMBOK, Section 3.2)
           A moment of clarity: There's a bunch of processes in project management. Sure, we've
           already established that you won't need all of these processes for every project you
           manage, but you can be darned certain that you'll need all of the processes to pass your
           Certified Associate in Project Management (CAPM) or Project Management Profession-
           al (PMP) exam. Let's dive in and check out these process groups and all their kids--the
           44 project management processes.
                You've already learned the five process groups: initiating, planning, executing, mon-
           itoring and controlling, and closing. These groups are universal to all projects, from
           building the pyramids to rolling out the latest, greatest whiz-bang software over your IT
           network. It doesn't matter; project management is project management. Figure 3-3 cap-
           tures all of the processes in the most likely order in which they should happen--if
           they're going to happen (remember, you don't need all of the processes on every proj-
           ect, every single time).

           Working with Process Groups
           Project management is more than just getting the project work done. It's the manage-
           ment, leadership, and execution of the project team. (And by execution, I mean the
           project team executing the project plan, not you executing the team--although that can
           be tempting at times.) As you agree to manage a project, you'll move through some
           logical activities to get your project moving along. These are the process groups that are
           universal to project management. Let's take a more detailed look at these process groups
           and the type of work that will be happening in each:

                * Initiating Management and/or your customer is authorizing the project or a
                  project's phase to begin.
                * Planning You and the key stakeholders are defining and refining the
                  project's goals and objectives. Once the project's objectives have been defined,
                  you and the key stakeholders will plan on how to reach those objectives.
                                                                     Chapter 3: Examining the Project Process

                                                                                                          63

Figure 3-3 Process groups happen in the same order on every project; processes don't always.


     * Executing Now that you have a project plan, it's time to put the plan into
       action. You've heard the saying, "Plan your work and now work your plan?"
       This is the "working of the plan" part.
     * Monitoring and controlling Your project team is doing the work, but it's up
       to you to measure and monitor things to ensure that the project team is doing
       the work as it was planned. The results of your measurements--primarily in
       cost, time, scope, and quality--will show discrepancies between what was
       planned and what was experienced. These discrepancies are your project
       variances.
     * Closing Boy, howdy! There's nothing more fun, usually, than closing a project.
       This process group focuses on formal acceptance of the project's deliverable. The
       closing process group also focuses on bringing the project or project phase to a
       tidy ending.

    Now that you've got the big picture on these process groups, let's take that in-depth
look at each group and all the business that happens within each one. Hold your ex-
citement!

           Initiating Your Project (PMBOK, Section 3.2.1)
           The initiating process group starts all the project fun; it's the formal processes that start
           a project or a project phase. These initiating processes, which I'll delve into in one mo-
           ment, are often done outside of the project manager's domain of control. For example,
           a company's project portfolio management may not include any input from the project
           managers within their firm. The senior management could choose which projects
           should be initiated and funded long before the project managers get involved. In other
           organizations, the project manager may be involved from the project conception all the
           way through the project closure. As a general rule, the initiation of a project happens,
           to some extent, without the project manager, but the initiation process group is in-
           cluded as part of the project management life cycle.

                         EXAM TIP Projects are authorized, not the project manager.You do not have
                         a project until you have an approved charter.


               The project manager is assigned during initiation, and the inputs from the original
           project initiator and/or the project sponsor are considered throughout the initiation
           processes. One of the first activities of the project is to document the project assump-
           tions and constraints. Here's the difference between these two:

                * Assumptions are things believed to be true but not proven to be. For example,
                  construction projects plan to complete their work during the spring and
                  summer months because of cooperating weather. It's an assumption that the
                  weather will be agreeable for their work during these seasons as opposed to
                  the winter months, although this isn't always true.
                * Constraints are anything that restricts a project manager's options. For
                  example, a customer must have the project deliverable by a specific date.
                  Or the project must not exceed $2 million dollars. Or the software must
                  be compatible with an Oracle database. Usually, any project requirement
                  preceded by "must" is a good sign of a constraint.

               Assumptions and constraints are documented in the project charter. The project
           charter officially authorizes the project and is authorized outside of the project bound-
           aries. This means that the charter should come from some entity that is above the
           project manager and the functional managers involved in the project. Figure 3-4 illus-
           trates this concept. While the project management team may help write the charter,
           the funding and authorization come from higher up in the organization or by the
           project customer.
               At the start of each project phase, especially on larger projects, it's ideal to repeat the
           initiating processes to ensure that the project remains focused on the business needs
           the project is to solve. This includes the availability of the needed project resources
           (cash, people, materials, and equipment), and based on this discovery, the project
           should be allowed to continue on to the next phase, delayed, or (gulp!) cancelled. An-
                                                                     Chapter 3: Examining the Project Process

                                                                                                          65

Figure 3-4 Project charters come from outside of the project boundaries.

other benefit of moving through these initiating processes at the start of each phase is
that it allows the performing organization to determine if the original business need
that the project was created to solve is still valid; if not, the project can be killed. Yes,
killed; remember that the end of a phase is called a project kill point.
    When a project or phase is moving through the initiating phase, the project man-
ager needs to include the key stakeholders in the processes. This is a "PMI-ism," but it's
also some real-world advice: Including the stakeholders during the initiating phase ac-
complishes several things for the project:
     * It creates shared ownership of the project
     * It ensures deliverable acceptance at project or phase closure
     * It improves stakeholder satisfaction
     * It facilitates communication between the project manager and the
       stakeholders

Developing the Project Charter
The project charter is created during the initiation process group. Recall that the project
charter authorizes the project or, in a larger project, the charter initializes the project
phase. The charter documents the business need, defines the project deliverable, and
names the project manager. In order to create the project charter, you'll need the follow-
ing inputs:
     * Contract You won't always need a contract, but if an organization performs
       projects for other organizations, such as a consulting firm, the contract serves
       as a key input to creating the project charter.
CAPM/PMP Project Management Certification All-in-One Exam Guide
66
                * Project statement of work This document defines the product, service, or
                  result that the project will be creating.
                * Enterprise environmental factors Here's a new term that you'll be seeing lots
                  of throughout the remainder of this book. Enterprise environmental factors are
                  any external or internal organizational factors that can affect a project's success.
                  Enterprise environmental factors include the culture, organizational structure,
                  resources, commercial databases the project will use, market conditions, and
                  your project management software.
                * Organizational process assets This is another term that you'll see
                  throughout the Project Management Body of Knowledge (PMBOK) and
                  during our time together in this book. "Organizational process assets" is
                  a fancy way of describing how a company does business; it includes the
                  processes and procedures unique to an organization, plans, guidelines, and
                  knowledge bases, such as the lessons learned documentation from past
                  projects and any relevant historical information.

           Developing the Project Scope Statement
           Technically, really technically, the project scope is not finalized until the project moves
           into the project planning process group. However, here in the initiation process group,
           a high-level, broad project scope is developed. This first edition of the project scope
           defines the project, project deliverables, product requirements, project boundaries, ac-
           ceptance procedures, and scope control. If you're managing a project that includes mul-
           tiple phases, this high-level document would address each phase as it begins. In order
           to create this project scope statement, you'll need some familiar items:

                * Project charter
                * Project statement of work
                * Enterprise environmental factors
                * Organizational process assets

           Planning the Project (PMBOK, Section 3.2.2)
           Projects fail at the beginning and not the end. It's up to effective planning, or the proj-
           ect will be doomed. The whole point of the planning process group is to develop the
           project management plan. The good news is that the entire project doesn't have to hap-
           pen in one session; in fact, planning is an iterative process, and the project manager
           and the project team return to the planning phase as needed to allow the project to
           move forward.
               Ask any project manager if changes ever happen in their projects, and they'll give
           you a sad yes (unless they lie). Changes, often the nemesis of a project manager, require
           the project manager and the project team to revisit these planning processes to con-
           sider the impact of the changes on the entire project. This may include, unfortunately,
           revisiting the initiating processes and making changes to the project charter, although
           this is a drastic and infrequent event.
                                                                        Chapter 3: Examining the Project Process

                                                                                                             67
    One approach to project management that has gained fans in the past few years is
rolling wave planning. Rolling wave planning, seen in Figure 3-5, entails iterations of




                                                                                                                   PART I
planning throughout the project life cycle. Changes and conditions within the project
require the project manager and the project team to revisit the planning processes and
then move on to the project. Rolling wave planning can also be experienced in larger
projects, where a project team plans in detail for the immediate work and leaves the
future work less planned. As the project approaches each phase, detailed planning is
experienced, creating iterations, or waves, of planning.
    The project manager and the project team should create an environment where
stakeholders can participate and contribute to the project's planning processes. A proj-
ect manager wants to use the skills and knowledge of the stakeholders to help define
the project scope and the product scope, as well as to ensure that the project work will
deliver upon the stakeholders' expectations.
    A frequent question that I get from students of my project management classes cen-
ters on project management planning. I'm asked, "If planning is so important and it-
erative, how does a project manager know when the planning process group should
end?" Of course, planning cannot, thankfully, continue forever. There must be project
boundaries and considerations of the enterprise environmental factors that dictate the
amount of time a project team invests in the initial planning and the project work. As
a project moves into execution and, by default, monitoring and controlling, the project
team can revisit the planning processes as needed to allow the project to continue. For
example, if new risks are identified within the project, then additional planning is re-
quired to evaluate and respond to the risks.

                         EXAM TIP The planning process group has 21 processes. This section
                         contains a brief overview of each of these processes and their inputs and
                         outputs. Don't worry--you don't need to memorize these for your PMI
                         examination. I recommend that you become familiar with these to the point
                         that you'd recognize the type of work associated with each process, but don't
                         invest too much time memorizing the inputs and outputs of each process.

           Developing the Project Management Plan
           The project management plan is not one plan, but a collection of subsidiary plans that
           dictate how the project will operate within that knowledge area. It also defines how the
           project will operate within planning, executing, monitoring and controlling, and clos-
           ing phases. In order to create the project management plan, you'll need:

                * A preliminary project scope statement
                * Project management processes
                * Enterprise environmental factors
                * Organizational process assets

           Planning the Project Scope
           In Chapter 5 we'll discuss and dissect the project scope in detail. For now, know that the
           project scope is the work that must be done in order to create the product, service, or
           result the project aims to deliver. The project manager, the project team, and the stake-
           holders work together to define the project scope; their goal is to create the project
           scope management plan. The project scope management plan defines how the project
           scope will be defined, verified, controlled, and how the project's work breakdown struc-
           ture (WBS) will be created. The WBS, if you're not familiar with the term, is a break-
           down of the project scope, and is often called the scope baseline. In order to create the
           project scope management plan, you'll need:

                * Enterprise environmental factors
                * Organizational process assets
                * A project charter
                * A preliminary project scope statement (created during project initiation)
                * A project management plan

           Defining the Project Scope Statement
           Now that the project has a project scope management plan, the project manager, proj-
           ect team, and the key stakeholders can go about defining the actual project scope. The
           project scope statement serves as a basis for all future project decisions. As part of defin-
           ing the project scope, several inputs are needed:

                * Organizational process assets
                * Project charter
                                                                    Chapter 3: Examining the Project Process

                                                                                                         69
     * Preliminary project scope statement




                                                                                                               PART I
     * Approved change requests

    The last bulleted item, approved change requests, considers the iterative nature of
the planning process group and allows change requests to be considered and fleshed
into the project scope as needed and approved. This process group has many outputs
that are related to the project scope:

     * Project scope statement
     * Requested changes
     * Project scope management plan updates

Creating the Work Breakdown Structure
The WBS is created in the planning process group. This process takes the project scope and
breaks it down into smaller, more manageable components. In Chapter 5, we'll discuss the
WBS, its purpose, and its creation. In order to create a WBS, you'll need the following:

     * Organizational process assets
     * Project scope statement
     * Project scope management plan
     * Approved change requests

   As a result of creating the WBS, the project manager will get some extras, wanted or not:

     * WBS
     * Project scope statement updates
     * WBS dictionary (this defines all of the components within the WBS)
     * Scope baseline
     * Project scope management plan updates
     * Change requests

             EXAM TIP The WBS is a cornerstone to project management. If you're
             stumped on a question and one of the choices is WBS, go ahead and choose that.
             It may not always be the best choice, but I'd wager that it predominantly will be.

Defining the Project Activities
Once the WBS has been created, the project manager and project team can examine the
deliverables and then determine the actual work to create the things the WBS promises.
This is activity definition. To complete this process, you'll need:

     * Enterprise environmental factors
     * Organizational process assets
     * Project scope statement
CAPM/PMP Project Management Certification All-in-One Exam Guide
70
                * WBS
                * WBS dictionary
                * Project management plan

              As a result of defining the project activities, the project team will receive these
           outputs:

                * Activity list
                * Activity attributes
                * Milestone list
                * Requested changes

           Sequencing the Project Activities
           It's a logical progression from defining the project deliverables and the activities needed
           to create them to putting those activities in a particular order. In order to sequence the
           project activities, the project team will need:

                * Project scope statement
                * Activity list
                * Activity attributes
                * Milestone list
                * Approved change requests

               Like the majority of the processes in planning, the output of the processes often
           includes other project elements that may be needed for later purposes in project plan-
           ning. Activity sequencing is no different; the outputs of this process are:

                * Project schedule network diagrams (you'll learn more about these in Chapter 6)
                * Activity list updates
                * Activity attributes updates
                * Change requests

           Estimating the Resources
           The project manager needs to know what resources will be required for each of the
           project activities. In order to complete this process, you'll need the following inputs:

                * Enterprise environmental factors
                * Organizational process assets
                * Activity lists
                                                                   Chapter 3: Examining the Project Process

                                                                                                        71
     * Activity attributes




                                                                                                              PART I
     * Resource availability
     * Project management plan

    Once the project manager has completed estimating the resources, she'll receive
several outputs as a result of this process:

     * Activity resource requirements
     * Activity attributes updates
     * Resource breakdown structure (this shows the types of resources the project
       needs, such as professional engineers, structural engineers, or Computer Aided
       Design [CAD]/Computer Aided Manufacturing [CAM] operators)
     * Resource calendar updates (the resource calendar, which you'll see again in
       Chapter 9, defines when the project resources are available)
     * Change requests

Estimating the Activity Durations
Once the project manager knows what activities are required and in what order the
activities should happen, it's time to estimate how long each activity will take to
complete. In order to create the activity duration estimates, the project manager will
need:

     * Enterprise environmental factors.
     * Organizational process assets.
     * Activity list.
     * Activity attributes.
     * Activity resource requirements.
     * Resource calendar.
     * Project management plan.
     * Risk register. (This is a repository of the project's risks and their attributes.
       Chapter 11 discusses the risk register.)
     * Activity cost estimates.

    While this process primarily creates the duration of each of the project's activities,
the project manager may also have activity attribute updates.

Developing the Project Schedule
The project schedule is more than just the sum of how long each event will take. The
project schedule considers the availability of the project resources, the risks, the attri-
CAPM/PMP Project Management Certification All-in-One Exam Guide
72
           butes of the project activities, and more. Chapter 6 will focus on this process, but for
           now, here are the inputs required to create the project schedule:

                * Organizational process assets
                * Project scope statement
                * Activity list
                * Activity attributes
                * Project schedule network diagrams
                * Activity resource requirements
                * Resource calendars
                * Activity duration estimates
                * Project management plan
                * Risk register

               Based on these inputs to the schedule development, the project team will have sev-
           eral outputs:

                * Project schedule (this is the calendar that defines when the project will take
                  place, including the working hours, access to the job site, and any other time
                  constraints put on the project)
                * Schedule model data
                * Schedule baseline
                * Resource requirements updates
                * Activity attributes updates
                * Project calendar updates
                * Requested changes
                * Project management plan updates
                * Schedule management plan updates

           Cost Estimating
           Projects cost money, and every stakeholder with a checkbook wants to know how much
           the project will cost. This process focuses on estimating the costs for the project. The
           following serve as inputs to this process:

                * Enterprise environmental factors
                * Organizational process assets
                * Project scope statement
                                                                 Chapter 3: Examining the Project Process

                                                                                                      73
     * WBS




                                                                                                            PART I
     * WBS dictionary
     * Project management plan
     * Schedule management plan
     * Staffing management plan
     * Risk register

   These inputs will help the project manager create the following outputs of cost esti-
mating:
     * Activity cost estimates
     * Activity cost estimates supporting detail
     * Change requests
     * Cost management plan updates

Budgeting the Project Work
Once the project manager has created the cost estimate, he'll aggregate the individual
activities and their attributes, such as labor and materials, to create a cost baseline for
the project. This process requires several inputs:

     * Project scope statement
     * WBS
     * WBS dictionary
     * Activity cost estimates supporting detail
     * Project schedule
     * Resource calendars
     * Contract (if applicable)
     * Cost management plan

   The outputs of cost budgeting are:

     * Cost baseline
     * Project funding requirements
     * Cost management plan updates
     * Change requests

Planning for Quality
The project manager, the project team, and the key stakeholders will work together to
determine how the project will ascertain the expected levels of quality within the project.
CAPM/PMP Project Management Certification All-in-One Exam Guide
74
           Chapter 8 will discuss quality in detail, but for now, there are several inputs to this qual-
           ity planning:

                * Enterprise environmental factors
                * Organizational process assets
                * Project scope statement
                * Project management plan

               As a result of planning for the quality, the project management team will create the
           following outputs:
                * Quality management plan
                * Quality metrics
                * Quality checklists
                * Process improvement plan
                * Quality baseline
                * Project management plan updates

           Planning for Human Resources
           Of course, the project will need people to do the work--that's the project team! Chap-
           ter 9 discusses human resource planning in detail. This process specifically focuses on
           creating the staffing management plan, defining the project roles, defining reporting
           relationships, and defining responsibilities of the project team members. Here are the
           required inputs for human resources planning:

                * Enterprise environmental factors
                * Organizational process assets
                * Project management plan
                * Activity resource requirements
               Once all the planning is completed, the project manager will have these outputs:
                * Roles and responsibilities
                * Project organization chart
                * Staffing management plan

                         EXAM TIP Remember that the autonomy of the project manager must also be
                         considered when planning for human resources. The organizational structure will
                         indicate what level of autonomy the project manager has. Functional structures
                         concede very little power to the project manager, while granting most of the
                         authority to the functional managers. The matrix structures describe the power
                         of the project manager in relation to the functional manager: weak, balanced, or
                         strong. Project managers have the most authority in a projectized environment.

                                                                                                     75
Planning for Project Communications




                                                                                                           PART I
It's been said that 90 percent of a project manager's time is spent communicating. With
that factoid, it's no wonder that the project manager will want to plan to communicate
effectively. Here are the required inputs to get this process started:

     * Enterprise environmental factors
     * Organizational process assets
     * Project scope statement
     * Project management plan
     * Constraints
     * Assumptions

    The only output of this process is the communications management plan. Now
there's something to discuss. (I will in Chapter 10.)

Planning for Project Risks
The project manager, the project team, and the key stakeholders will plan how to man-
age risk and the associated risk management activities. We'll cover this process in Chap-
ter 11, but here are the inputs for this process for now:

     * Enterprise environmental factors
     * Organizational process assets
     * Project scope statement
     * Project management plan

   This process also has but one output: the risk management plan.

Identify the Project Risks
Once the risk management plan has been created, the project management team can go
about the process of identifying all the good and naughty risks within the project. In
order to get this fun started, they'll need these inputs:

     * Enterprise environmental factors
     * Organizational process assets
     * Project scope statement
     * Risk management plan
     * Project management plan

   This process will create the central repository of project risks: the risk register.
Chapter 11 explains the risk identification process and the risk register in greater
detail.
CAPM/PMP Project Management Certification All-in-One Exam Guide

           Completing Qualitative Risk Analysis
           Qualitative risk analysis is completed in the planning process group and "qualifies" the
           identified risks for additional study and analysis. Here are the inputs for this process:

                * Organizational process assets
                * Project scope statement
                * Risk management plan
                * Risk register

              The only outputs of this process are updates to the risk register. In particular, the
           identified risks' qualitative attributes should be updated in the risk register.

           Completing Quantitative Risk Analysis
           This process aims to quantify the risk exposure for the risks in the project. This process
           is covered in more detail in Chapter 11. Here are the inputs for this process:

                * Organizational process assets
                * Project scope statement
                * Risk management plan
                * Risk register
                * Project management plan
                * Project schedule management plan
                * Project cost management plan

               Like qualitative analysis, quantitative analysis has but one output: updates to the
           risk register.

           Planning the Risk Responses
           Okay, the project manager, the project team, and all the key stakeholders have had
           some serious fun identifying and performing analysis on the project risks. Now it's time
           to get down to the business of planning the responses to the identified risks. There are
           only two inputs to the risk response planning process:

                * Risk management plan
                * Risk register

               This process may take some time, and will create three outputs:

                * Risk register updates
                * Project management plan updates
                * Risk-related contractual agreements (think of errors-and-omissions insurance;
                  not every project will have a risk-related contract)
                                                               Chapter 3: Examining the Project Process

                                                                                                    77

                                                                                                          PART I
When a project manager needs to purchase something for the project, there are usually
rules and procedures she must follow within her organization. Buying services and
products for a project requires many inputs:

    * Enterprise environmental factors
    * Organizational process assets
    * Project scope statement
    * WBS
    * WBS dictionary
    * Project management plan
    * Risk register
    * Risk-related contractual agreements
    * Resource requirements
    * Project schedule
    * Activity cost estimates
    * Cost baseline

    All of these inputs allow the project manager and the project team to consider and
evaluate what needs to be purchased, determine what risks may need to be considered,
and then decide how the purchasing will commence. Chapter 12 centers on procure-
ment, but here are the outputs of this process:

    * Project management plan
    * Contract statement of work (this is what the vendor will do for the buyer)
    * Make-or-buy decisions
    * Change requests

Planning for Contracting
Once the project manager and the vendors have a deal, there needs to be a contract that
defines the offer and consideration of the deal. That's what this process is all about--
documenting the purchase requirements between the buyer and seller. Here are the
inputs for this process:

    * Project management plan
    * Contract statement of work
    * Make-or-buy decisions
    * Project management plan
    * Risk register
CAPM/PMP Project Management Certification All-in-One Exam Guide

                * Risk-related contractual agreements
                * Resource requirements
                * Project schedule
                * Activity cost estimate
                * Cost baseline

              All of these inputs help the project manager make the best purchasing decisions,
           and will create the following outputs:
                * Procurement documents (these are the purchase orders, statements of work,
                  proposals, bids, and other purchase documents you'll see in Chapter 12)
                * Evaluation criteria
                * Contract statement of work

           Executing Processes (PMBOK, Section 3.2.3)
           The executing processes allow the project work to be performed. It is the execution of
           the project plan, the execution of vendor management, and the management of the
           project implementation. The project manager works closely with the project team in
           this process to ensure that the work is being completed and that the work results are of
           quality. The project manager also works with vendors to ensure that their procured
           work is complete, of quality, and meets the obligations of the agreed contracts.
               Throughout the project, variances may happen. A variance is simply the difference
           between what was planned and what was experienced. For example, there are cost vari-
           ances, schedule variances, and even scope variances. When variances happen within a
           project, the project manager and the project team retreat to the planning process group,
           analyze the variance, and determine the best method to respond. The response may, in
           turn, cause the project management plan to be changed, which could, in turn, affect the
           activities of the execution process group.
               This process group is about getting the project work done. You can plan as much as
           you want, but it's in the doing that matters. This process group consumes the project
           budget more than any other group because the project team is doing the work, using
           the materials, and relying on the vendors to deliver upon their contracts. This process
           group has seven processes.

           Managing and Executing the Project Plan
           This is the heart of the project: getting the work done. This process guides, directs, and
           leads the project team to complete their assignments according to the project manage-
           ment plan. The project team's performance is measured, and that information will
           serve as input to performance reviews later in the project (team members be warned!).
           Here are the inputs for managing and executing the project plan:
                * Project management plan.
                                                              Chapter 3: Examining the Project Process

                                                                                                   79
    * Approved corrective actions. (A corrective action brings project work back into
      alignment with the project plan.)




                                                                                                         PART I
    * Approved preventive actions. (A preventive action is a risk-related action that
      avoids risk within the project; think of a workaround to a problem within
      your project.)
    * Approved change requests.
    * Approved defect repair. (A defect repair is an activity to repair a mistake
      within the project; think of a painter who painted a wall the wrong shade
      of green. Oops!)
    * Validated defect repair.
    * Administrative closure procedure.

   The outputs of project execution are:

    * Deliverables.
    * Change requests.
    * Implemented change requests.
    * Implemented corrective actions.
    * Implemented preventive actions.
    * Implemented defect repair. Work performance information. (This is the
      performance measurement of the project team and the project work as a whole.)

Performing Quality Assurance
Quality assurance (QA) is a management process that all projects adhere to within an
organization. QA will be discussed in more detail in Chapter 8. Here are the inputs to
performing quality assurance:

    * Quality management plan
    * Quality metrics
    * Process improvement plan
    * Work performance information
    * Approved change requests
    * Quality control measurements
    * Implemented change requests
    * Implemented corrective actions
    * Implemented defect repairs
    * Implemented preventive actions
CAPM/PMP Project Management Certification All-in-One Exam Guide

               All of these QA input processes will help the project management team create the
           following outputs:

                * Change requests
                * Recommended corrective actions
                * Organizational process assets
                * Updates
                * Project management plan updates

           Acquiring the Project Team
           The project team doesn't join the project until the execution process group. This is a
           great example of how the planning process group is an iterative process. The project
           manager is in planning and then shifts to execution to acquire the project team. Now the
           project team and the project manager return to planning to create the project manage-
           ment plan. In order to complete the team acquisition, the following inputs are needed:

                * Enterprise environmental factors
                * Organizational process assets
                * Roles and responsibilities
                * Project organization charts
                * Staffing management plan

               Using these inputs, the project manager creates the following outputs:

                * Project staff assignments
                * Resource availability determination
                * Staffing management plan updates

           Developing the Project Team
           Developing the project team is an execution process that seeks to determine and, if
           necessary, improve the skill sets of the project team members. This process, which I'll
           talk about in Chapter 9, also focuses on improving the interaction, communication,
           and trust of the project team members. You'll need the following inputs to facilitate
           project team development:

                * Project staff assignments
                * Staffing management plan
                * Resource availability

               This process only creates one little, but important, output: team performance as-
           sessment. Team performance assessment will help the project manager make decisions
           on how to better manage and lead the project team members--and perform future
           team development exercises.
                                                                Chapter 3: Examining the Project Process

                                                                                                     81

            development exercises, so think of white water rafting trips and team
            excursions away from the office with the entire project team.

Distributing Project Information
The project manager has to disperse information to keep the project stakeholders in-
formed of the project's health, status, and pending actions. In order to disperse infor-
mation, the project manager will rely on the communications management plan. As a
result of dispersing information, the project manager will keep stakeholders informed,
but will also have two direct outputs:
     * Organizational process assets updates
     * Change requests
   That was a tough one, yes?

Requesting Seller Responses
Remember all that fun earlier with procurement? Now the project manager is waiting
for those pesky vendors to respond to the procurement documents. In order to com-
plete this executing process, the project manager will need the following inputs:
     * Organizational process assets
     * Procurement management plan
     * Procurement documents
   As a result of this process, the project manager will receive three outputs:
     * Qualified sellers list. (This list may evolve within the performing organization
       or on a project-by-project basis. Either way, these are the vendors who the
       project manager is allowed to purchase from because they meet certain
       defined qualifications.)
     * Procurement document package. (This is all of the related procurement
       documents between the buyer and the seller.)
     * Proposals.

Choosing the Best Seller
Now that the sellers have provided their responses to the project manager's procure-
ment documents, it's time to choose which seller is best for the project. This process,
which Chapter 12 covers in detail, also deals with negotiating for the best deal with the
vendors. Here are the inputs to this process:
     * Organizational process assets
     * Procurement management plan
     * Evaluation criteria
     * Procurement document package
CAPM/PMP Project Management Certification All-in-One Exam Guide
82
                * Proposals
                * Qualified sellers lists
                * Project management plan
                * Risk register
                * Risk-related contractual agreements
               This process creates the following outputs:
                * Selected sellers
                * Contract
                * Contract management plan
                * Resource availability determination
                * Procurement management plan updates
                * Requested changes

           Examining the Monitoring and Controlling Process
           Groups (PMBOK, Section 3.2.4)
           Wouldn't the project management life be even greater if all of the projects went off
           without a hitch? If only the project team, the project work, the stakeholders, and the
           vendors would cooperate. Oh, but we know that projects have to be constantly moni-
           tored like a three-year-old in a china shop.
               This process group focuses on monitoring the project work for variances, changes,
           and discrepancies so that corrective action can be used to ensure that the project con-
           tinues to move towards its successful completion. This means lots of measuring, in-
           specting, and communicating with the project team to ensure that the project plan is
           followed, variances to the plan are reported, and responses can be expedited.
               This process group also is concerned with changes that may attack the Iron Triangle
           of Project Management: time, cost, and scope. As changes are allowed into the project,
           or changes sneak into a project through scope creep, they must be examined for their
           overall effect on the project's execution and, ultimately, on the project deliverable.
           Chapters 5, 6, and 7 will cover scope, time, and cost control, but project managers also
           have to be concerned with quality control. It doesn't do much good if a project is com-
           pleted on time and on budget, but the deliverable is fouled, full of errors, and of poor
           quality. Chapter 8 will examine control in detail. Let's take a quick look at each of the
           12 processes within this group.

                         EXAM TIP While there are 12 processes within the monitoring and controlling
                         process group, it doesn't mean that the project manager needs to use all 12 of
                         the processes for every project. In fact, according to the PMBOK, the project
                         team should determine which of these processes are needed for their project.
                                                                   Chapter 3: Examining the Project Process

Monitoring and Controlling the Project Work




                                                                                                              PART I
What'd you expect to be doing in the monitor and control process group? This process
is the heart of the process group, and includes the entire collection of project charac-
teristics, such as time, cost, and quality statistics. Based on the collected statistics, the
project manager can measure the project success, identify trends, make forecasts, cre-
ate project reports, and take actions to improve the project. Here are the inputs for this
process:

     * Project management plan
     * Work performance information
     * Rejected change requests

   The outputs of monitoring and controlling the project work will give the project
team five outputs:

     * Recommended corrective actions
     * Recommended preventive actions
     * Project forecasts
     * Recommended defect repairs
     * Change requests

Managing Integrated Change Control
Integrated change control is a process that examines how a change affects all parts of a
project. Consider a change to the project scope on a project you've worked on. The
change likely affected the project cost, the project schedule, and the expectations of the
project quality. The change may also have affected other regions of your project: risk
management, communications, human resources, and even procurement. Integrated
change control manages the approved changes within a project, how and when the
changes may occur, and determines if a change to the project may have already oc-
curred. This process, as fun as it is, happens from project initiation through project
closing. There are many inputs for this process:

     * Project management plan
     * Requested changes
     * Work performance information
     * Recommended preventive actions
     * Recommended corrective actions
     * Recommended defect repairs
     * Project deliverables
CAPM/PMP Project Management Certification All-in-One Exam Guide
84
               These inputs and this process will help the project manager and the project team
           create the following outputs:

                * Approved change requests
                * Rejected change requests
                * Project management plan updates
                * Project scope statement updates
                * Approved corrective actions
                * Approved preventive actions
                * Approved defect repairs
                * Validated defect repairs
                * Project deliverables

           Verifying the Project Scope
           If you were to hire an architectural firm to build your next mansion, you'd periodically
           visit the house under construction to ensure that the workers and the architects were
           building according to the plans you provided them. At the end of the project, you'd
           walk through the home and create a "punch list" of all the things that needed to be
           changed or repaired according to your agreement. The architectural firm would work
           with you to ensure that you're happy with the deliverable you asked for and the deliver-
           able they have created for you. This is scope verification: the formal acceptance by in-
           spection of the project deliverables. Here are the inputs the project manager needs to
           facilitate this process with the project customer:

                * Project scope statement
                * WBS dictionary
                * Project scope management plan
                * Deliverables

               The customer would inspect and then, hopefully, formally accept the project work
           or provide feedback on what needs to be corrected or changed. Here are the outputs of
           scope verification:

                * Formal acceptance of the project deliverables
                * Change requests
                * Recommended corrective actions

           Controlling the Project Scope
           Once the project scope statement has been created, it is paramount to guard the scope
           from unauthorized changes and to follow a scope change control system within the
           project to ensure that any approved changes reflect the changes through cost, time,
                                                                     Chapter 3: Examining the Project Process

                                                                                                          85
scope, quality, and the other knowledge areas within the project. Here are the inputs to
perform this process:




                                                                                                                PART I
     * Project scope statement
     * WBS
     * WBS dictionary
     * Project scope statement management plan
     * Performance reports
     * Approved change requests
     * Work performance information

    The outputs of this massive and not-so-enjoyable process are:

     * Project scope statement updates. (Makes sense, right? If changes are approved
       to the project scope, then the changes have to be reflected in the scope
       statement, the WBS, and the WBS dictionary.)
     * WBS updates.
     * WBS dictionary updates.
     * Scope baseline updates.
     * Change requests.
     * Recommended corrective actions.
     * Organizational process asset updates.
     * Project management plan updates.

Controlling the Project Schedule
This process isn't a mystery: It's simply keeping the project on schedule so that it finishes on
time as planned. When variances happen within the project, the project manager and the
project team have to plan how to respond to these schedule variances. I'll discuss schedul-
ing and schedule control in Chapter 6. For now, here are the inputs for this process:

     * Schedule management plan
     * Schedule baseline
     * Performance reports
     * Approved change requests

    This process creates several outputs:

     * Schedule model data updates
     * Schedule baseline updates
     * Performance measurements
CAPM/PMP Project Management Certification All-in-One Exam Guide
86
                * Change requests
                * Recommended corrective actions
                * Organizational process asset updates
                * Activity list updates
                * Activity attribute updates
                * Project management plan updates

           Controlling the Project Cost
           Have you ever noticed that it's usually easier to get more time than money for your
           projects? Management dreads hearing that a project will cost more due to errors and
           variances. This process aims to prevent cost overruns and control the expenses within a
           project. There are many inputs for this process:

                * Cost baseline
                * Project funding requirements
                * Performance reports
                * Work performance information
                * Approved change requests
                * Project management plan

              Chapter 7 is all about managing project costs, including creating cost estimates and
           budgets. Here are the outputs of cost control:

                * Cost estimate updates
                * Cost baseline updates
                * Performance measurements
                * Forecasted completion
                * Change requests
                * Recommended corrective actions
                * Organizational process asset updates
                * Project management plan updates

           Performing Quality Control
           Quality control (QC), which is covered in Chapter 8, is all about keeping the mistakes
           out of the project--and ultimately away from the customers--before the project is de-
           clared finished. QC is considered an inspection-driven process, because that's the pri-
           mary activity involved with it. Here are the inputs to perform this process:

                * Quality management plan
                * Quality metrics

    * Quality checklists




                                                                                                         PART I
    * Organizational process assets
    * Work performance information
    * Change requests
    * Deliverables

    QC creates many outputs that can help the project manager and the project team
improve the project performance and ensure that the project work is completed cor-
rectly for the customer. Here are the outputs of QC:

    * Quality control measurements
    * Validated defect repairs
    * Quality baseline updates
    * Recommended corrective actions
    * Recommended preventive actions
    * Requested changes
    * Recommended defect repairs
    * Organizational process asset updates
    * Validated deliverables
    * Project management plan updates

Managing the Project Team
This process centers on you, the project manager. It's how you will manage, track per-
formance, offer feedback, resolve issues, and manage your project team in the best in-
terest of the project. There are many inputs to this process:

    * Organizational process assets
    * Project staff assignments
    * Roles and responsibilities
    * Staffing management plan
    * Team performance assessment
    * Work performance information
    * Performance reports

    As you lead your project team through their project work--and to the project deliv-
erable--you'll be completing this process. There are several outputs of managing the
project team:

    * Change requests
    * Recommended corrective actions
CAPM/PMP Project Management Certification All-in-One Exam Guide
88
                * Recommended preventive actions
                * Organizational process asset updates
                * Project management plan updates

           Reporting Project Performance
           Management, your project team, key stakeholders, and the project customer will want
           the project manager to keep them abreast of the project performance. That's what this
           process is all about. There are seven inputs to performance reporting:

                * Work performance information
                * Performance measurements
                * Forecasted completion
                * Quality control measurements (if you don't measure, you can't improve)
                * Project management plan
                * Performance measurement baseline
                * Approved change requests
                * Deliverables

               As the project manager shares the project performance information, there will be
           five outputs:

                * Performance reports
                * Forecasts
                * Change requests
                * Recommended corrective actions
                * Organizational process asset updates

           Managing the Project Stakeholders
           Recall that a stakeholder is anyone who has a vested interest in the outcome of the
           project. Traditionally, the project stakeholders refer to the recipients of the project de-
           liverable, but there's more to being a stakeholder than just that. Stakeholders include
           the project team, vendors, customers, management, and even the project manager. The
           project manager has to manage more than just the project team. The stakeholders need
           some management, too. Often, the stakeholders need more attention than the project
           team, because they're worried, fretting, and just anxious about the deliverable you're
           creating for them. Much of stakeholder management is simply communicating with
           the stakeholders. There are two inputs:

                * Communications management plan. (This plan tells you who needs
                  what information, when they need it, and the expected modality of the
                  communication.)
                * Organizational process assets
                                                                   Chapter 3: Examining the Project Process

                                                                                                        89
    As you manage the project stakeholders, there will be several outputs:




                                                                                                              PART I
     * Resolved issues (it's a good feeling to have issues resolved)
     * Approved change requests
     * Approved corrective actions
     * Organizational process asset updates
     * Project management plan updates

Monitoring and Controlling Project Risks
A risk is an uncertain event or condition that can affect the project's outcome. Project
managers often think of risks as negative events, but that's not always the case. Many risks,
such as using a new material, a new vendor, or a new approach to the project work, aren't
negative, but have positive outcomes. Chapter 11 will discuss both positive and negative
risks in detail. There are five inputs to the risk monitoring and controlling process:

     * Risk management plan
     * Risk register
     * Approved change requests
     * Work performance information
     * Performance reports

   Risk monitoring and control happens throughout the project's life cycle, not just
once. As this process is completed, there will be six outputs:

     * Risk register updates
     * Change requests
     * Recommended corrective actions
     * Recommended preventive actions
     * Organizational process asset updates
     * Project management plan updates

Administering the Project Contracts
If a project manager has to complete the procurement management process, she will also
need to administer the project contracts. This process, which Chapter 12 explores, ensures
that the relationship between the buyer and the seller remains intact, reviews how the
seller is performing by the terms of the contract, and works with the seller to ensure they
continue to abide by the agreed contractual terms. This process has six inputs:

     * Contract. (You need a contract in order to manage one.)
     * Contract management plan.
     * Selected sellers.
     * Performance reports.
CAPM/PMP Project Management Certification All-in-One Exam Guide
90
                * Approved change requests. (Change requests can affect the product or service
                  the seller is providing.)
                * Work performance information. (This input is primarily concerned with the
                  performance of the work as completed by the seller.)

               Contract administration creates many outputs:

                * Contract documentation
                * Change requests
                * Recommended corrective actions
                * Organizational process asset updates
                * Project management plan updates
                * Procurement management plan
                * Contract management plan

           Closing the Project (PMBOK, Section 3.2.5)
           In project management, there are few things more rewarding than closing a project. It's
           extremely satisfying, and sometimes sad, to officially close a project and move along to
           other challenges. This final project management process group has but two processes,
           but it's no less important than the other process groups within a project. The goals of
           closing a project are to officially confirm that all of the needed processes have been
           completed, that the deliverables have been transferred to the user or organization, and
           that the project is done.
                Project closure is also concerned with the success of the project, and these processes
           can be used when a project may be cancelled before reaching the desired deliverables.
           If a project has multiple phases, the processes within this group can be used for each
           phase and at the end of the project.

           Closing the Project
           This is the goal: close the project and get back to your life. There are several inputs to
           project closure:
                * Project management plan
                * Contract documentation
                * Enterprise environmental factors
                * Organizational process assets
                * Work performance information
                * Deliverables
               When the project manager closes a project, several outputs are created and completed:
                * Administrative closure procedure
                * Contract closure procedure
                                                                Chapter 3: Examining the Project Process

     * Final product, service, or result

     * Organizational process asset updates

Closing the Project Contracts
If a project manager has worked with vendors on a project, then there are processes that
must be completed during project closure to ensure that all of the terms of the contract
have been met. This allows the project manager to confirm that the seller has met its
obligations and that the project manager's organization has also met the obligations of
the contract before the project is closed. Here are the inputs to this process:
     * Procurement management plan
     * Contract management plan
     * Contract documentation
     * Contract closure procedure

   As a result of performing these activities, there are two outputs of this process:

     * Closed contracts
     * Organizational process assets updates

Examining How the Processes Interact
(PMBOK, Section 3.3)
The five project management process groups are not unlike the Rubik's Cube toy; what
you do in one area affects all the other areas. In project management, the interactions
between the processes are somewhat chronological; but often, the processes are itera-
tive, transient, and allow the project management team to shift from process group to
process group. The process groups allow for plenty of overlap throughout the whole
project. For example, the extent of the monitoring and controlling processes is directly
affected by the planning process group.
    You've seen throughout this chapter that the output of one process is often an input
to another process group. The planning process group is the best example of this axi-
om; project plans are created and then executed for each knowledge area. As a project
moves through its life cycle, the activities of project management--that is, the 44 indi-
vidual processes--interact, overlap, and share commonalities that allow the project to
move forward. Figure 3-6 demonstrates the concept of how processes overlap within a
project. Note that in a multiphase project, these processes can be applied to each indi-
vidual phase and to the project as a whole.
    All of these processes are not needed on every single project--only the processes
that are relevant to the specific project are needed. For example, a low priority, simple
"Move-Add-Change" (MAC) project within an organization likely won't need to com-
plete all 44 processes in order for the project to be completed successfully. However, a
four-year project to build a skyscraper will likely use all 44 processes.
    Constraints within a project are often seen as process inputs. Consider any project
you've worked on where management has enforced a project deadline. The deadline is
CAPM/PMP Project Management Certification All-in-One Exam Guide
92




           Figure 3-6 Process groups naturally interact throughout the project.

           a constraint that may not allow the project team to determine the best completion
           through normal project planning, but rather by working backwards from the deadline.
           Constraints that serve as inputs to process groups can cause additional risks on sched-
           ule and quality, can increase project costs, and may even require the project scope to be
           reduced to hit the project's target preset end date. No fun for anyone!


           Chapter Summary
           Don't you feel great now that you've seen all of the project management processes, the
           process groups where they live, and how all these processes interact with one another?
           Your PMI examination is all about project management, and project management is, of
           course, all about the processes needed to complete the project. Projects move through
           a project management life cycle of initiating, planning, executing, monitoring and con-
           trolling, and, ultimately, closing.
               The project management processes span the entire project, which means that not
           only do the processes live inside of the process groups we've covered here, but also the
           activities of the processes can be lumped into one of the nine knowledge areas of proj-
           ect management. Part II of this book deals with the project management knowledge
           areas. With that in mind, it's only appropriate to see all of these in one schmancy chart
           in Table 3-1. I've also included a quick reference to each chapter where these processes
           and their corresponding knowledge areas intersect. Enjoy!
               Table 3-1 is a great reference for all of the project management processes, but it
           doesn't, and cannot, demonstrate how processes interact. Processes are allowed to in-
           teract based on the situations within the project. Not all of these processes will interact
           on every project, and not every process is needed on every single project. Your CAPM or
           PMP examination will likely test you on all of these processes, however, since it's pos-
           sible for a project to use all 44 project management processes.

           Key Terms
           Assumption A belief that may or may not be true within a project. Weather is an ex-
           ample of an assumption in construction projects.
           Change request A documented request to add to or remove from the project scope.
           Closing process group The project management process group that contains the ac-
           tivities to close out a project and project contracts.
           Constraint A condition, rule, or procedure that restricts a project manager's options.
           A project deadline is an example of a constraint.
           Corrective action      A corrective action brings project work back into alignment with
           the project plan.
           Cost baseline The aggregation of the project deliverables and their associated costs.
           The difference between the cost estimates and the actual cost of the project identifies
           the cost variance.
           Defect repair The activity to repair a defect within the project.
           Enterprise environmental factors Any external or internal organizational factors that
           can affect a project's success. Enterprise environmental factors include the culture, orga-
           nizational structure, resources, commercial databases the project will use, market con-
           ditions, and your project management software.
           Executing process group The project management process group that provides the
           activities to carry out the project management plan to complete the project work.
           Initiation process group The project management process group that allows a proj-
           ect to be chartered and authorized.
           Monitoring and controlling process group The project management process group
           oversees, measures, and tracks project performance.
           Organizational process assets The methodology an organization uses to perform its
           business, as well as the guidelines, procedures, and knowledge bases, such as the lessons
           learned documentation from past projects and any relevant historical information.
           Planning process group The project management process group that creates the
           project management plan to execute, monitor and control, and close the project.

      C. Organizational process asset
      D. Assumption

Answers
   1. C. A process, the focus of this chapter, is a set of interrelated activities that
      brings about a product, result, or service. A is incorrect because it does
      not fully describe a process, but more of a project. B is incorrect because
      progressive elaboration is not a description of a process, but rather a
      description of incremental refinements of a definition of a product, service,
      or result. D is also incorrect because this statement describes project phases.
      For more information, see the PMBOK, Chapter 3 introduction, and the
      glossary definition of a process.
   2. C. Communicating is a process, but it is not a process group. A, B, and D are
      all incorrect choices because they are project management process groups. For
      more information, see the PMBOK, Section 3.2.
   3. B. Projects logically move through initiating, planning, executing, monitoring
      and controlling, and closing. Choices A, C, and D are all incorrect because
      these are not in the logical order of the project management process groups.
      For more information, see the PMBOK, Section 3.2.
   4. B. Rolling wave planning is the progressive detailing of the project management
      plan. A is not a valid project management term. C is not an appropriate answer.
      D, phase gates, describes the end of a project phase. For more information, see
      the PMBOK, Section 3.2.2.
   5. D. Stakeholders should be involved in the planning processes because they
      have specific skills and knowledge that the project team can use to develop
      the project plan. A may be true, but it is not the best answer for this question.
      B is not valid because it is not the purpose of involving the stakeholders. In
      addition, the project manager may not be seen as the project authority in
CAPM/PMP Project Management Certification All-in-One Exam Guide
100
                   every project (consider public projects and functional organizations). C is
                   incorrect because this is not the purpose of involving the stakeholders. For
                   more information, see the PMBOK, Section 3.2.2.
                6. A. Stakeholders should participate in project initiation because it improves
                   shared ownership of the project, deliverable acceptance, and stakeholder
                   satisfaction. B, C, and D are all false statements about the involvement
                   of stakeholders in the initiation processes. For more information, see the
                   PMBOK, Section 3.2.1.
                7. D. The purpose of planning is to develop the project management plan. A
                   is incorrect; this is the purpose of the initiating process group. B and C are
                   incorrect because these may occur during planning, but these are not the
                   primary purpose of the planning process group. For more information, see
                   the PMBOK, Section 3.2.2.
                8. C. The project manager is selected during the initiation process group. A,
                   B, and D are all false because these answers do not define when the project
                   manager is selected. For more information, see the PMBOK, Section 3.2.1.
                9. B. Project management is the application of knowledge, skills, tools, and
                   techniques to project activities to meet project requirements. This is a
                   direct quote from the PMBOK. A, C, and D do not describe what project
                   management is. For more information, see the introduction to Chapter 3
                   in the PMBOK.
               10. B. The project team does not select which knowledge areas are needed for
                   the project to be successful, so this statement is false and is not a condition
                   required for project success. Chapters 4 through 12 in this book and the
                   PMBOK describe the nine knowledge areas that are applicable for every
                   project. A, C, and D are correct statements for a successful project. The
                   fourth condition of a successful project is that a defined approach to adapt
                   the product specifications and plans to meet the project requirements is used
                   within the project. For more information, see the introduction to Chapter 3
                   in the PMBOK.
               11. A. The project team tailors the project processes to their individual project.
                   B is incorrect, as this is good project management, not faulty project
                   management. C describes an organizational structure, not tailoring. D is
                   incorrect because rolling wave planning defines the iterations of project
                   planning. For more information, see the introduction to Chapter 3 in the
                   PMBOK.
               12. C. The project team is acquired in the executing process group. A, B, and D are
                   all incorrect because the team is not acquired during these groups. For more
                   information, see the PMBOK, Section 3.2.3.3.
                                                             Chapter 3: Examining the Project Process

                                                                                                101
13. C. The initial constraints and assumptions are documented in the project
    charter. A, B, and D are all incorrect choices because the initial constraints




                                                                                                        PART I
    and assumptions are documented in the project charter not in the project
    management plan, the project scope statement, or the risk management plan.
    For more information, see the PMBOK, section 3.2.1.
14. D. The project is not authorized until the charter is approved. A is incorrect
    because a charter can be written by the project management team and still
    not be approved. B is incorrect because a project is chartered, typically and
    technically, before being funded. C is incorrect because team acquisition
    happens during the execution process group--well after project initiation,
    which is where the charter comes from. For more information, see the
    PMBOK, Section 3.2.1.
15. B. When the project team completes the project work, the project's budget
    is expended. A, C, and D are all incorrect because the vast majority of the
    project's budget is not consumed during these process groups. For more
    information, see the PMBOK, Section 3.2.3.
16. C. A workaround is an example of a preventive action. A, corrective action, is
    an action to bring future project performance in alignment with the project
    plan. B, defect repair, is the repair of flawed work. D is not a valid answer.
    For more information, see the PMBOK, Section 3.2.4 and the definition of
    workaround in the PMBOK glossary.
17. C. The monitoring and controlling process group provides feedback between
    project phases. A, B, and D are all incorrect because these process groups do
    not provide feedback between project phases. For more information, see the
    PMBOK, Section 3.2.4.
18. C. Quality control aims to eliminate causes of unsatisfactory performance;
    this process is part of the monitoring and controlling process group. A,
    scope verification, aims for scope acceptance decisions. B is not a valid PMI
    term. D, cost control, is concerned with controlling project costs. For more
    information, see the PMBOK, Section 3.2.4.7.
19. C. When a project is cancelled, the closing processes must still happen. In this
    example, the only closing process mentioned was contract closure. A, B, and D
    are all invalid because these processes do not happen if a project is closed or
    cancelled. For more information, see the PMBOK, Section 3.2.5 and Section
    3.2.5.2.
20. A. A preset project deadline is an example of a project constraint. B is incorrect
    because enterprise environmental factors are not constraints. C, organizational
    process assets, are not constraints but resources for the project management
    team. D is incorrect, as assumptions are things believed to be true but not
    proven to be true. For more information, see the PMBOK, Section 3.3.

 What the heck is project integration management? This is the heart of project management
 and is made up of the day-to-day processes the project manager relies on to ensure that
 all parts of the project work together. Project integration management is about the proj-
 ect manager making the best decisions for work, resources, project issues, and all the
 logistics of the project so that it is completed as planned.

     Project integration management is also about making tradeoffs between competing
 objectives and alternatives. As a project manager, I'm certain you've worked with stake-
 holders when each wants something that would cancel out a characteristic another
 stakeholder wants: Bob says he wants the house painted green, and Nancy wants it
 painted red. Or your client wants your organization to design a reliable, fast network
 operating system for thousands of users as long as it doesn't cost more than a few dol-
 lars. Competing objectives require negotiations, balance, and lots and lots of aspirin.

                VIDEO     Working with project integration management.


     In the first part of this book, I discussed the project management life cycle and the 44
 project management processes. These processes are not isolated elements, but overlap,
 interact, and complement one another. Project integration management is the coordina-

           tion and support of these project management plans. It also considers the interrelation of
           the nine knowledge areas and how actions in one knowledge area affect all the others.


           Developing the Project Charter
           (PMBOK, Section 4.1)
           All projects officially start with a project charter--a formal document that authorizes
           the project. So what's so great about the charter? It's the document that gives you, the
           project manager, the authority to use resources to do the project work. It's a powerful
           document. The project manager is assigned to the project as early as possible, and ide-
           ally while the charter is still being developed. The project manager needs to be assigned,
           without a doubt, before the project moves into the project planning process group.
                In many organizations, the project manager is the person writing the charter, and
           that's fine--really!--but the charter cannot be signed by the project manager. The char-
           ter is backed by a project initiator, typically called the project sponsor, at a level within
           the organization where this person can allocate funding and resources for the project.
           In other words, the project manager can't sign the charter because he's not "powerful"
           enough within the organization to assign resources and funds to his own project.

                         EXAM TIP The project charter authorizes the project, but not necessarily
                         the project manager, and also defines the project manager's level of authority.

               Charters are typically created by an enterprise, government agency, a program man-
           ager, or a project steering committee (sometimes called the portfolio organization).
           Charters are written so that a project can answer or satisfy one of the following reasons:
                * Market demand
                * Business need
                * Customer request
                * Technological advance
                * Legal requirement
                * Social need
               Your organization might call these opportunities, problems, or business require-
           ments. Once you're a project manager, you'll just call `em your favorite project. (Your
           favorite project is always the one you're managing right now.) Why some projects get
           selected and others do not within an organization can be due to finances, the project
           owner, sponsor influence, legal requirements, or any number of reasons. The message
           to take away is that regardless of why a project gets selected you, the project manager,
           must have a charter for the project to be officially authorized. Charters should always
           include the following project information:
                * Requirements for satisfaction, project stakeholder needs, wants, and
                  expectations
                                                                Chapter 4: Managing Project Integration

                                                                                                  107
    * Business needs, a description of the project's product, or a mile-high view of
      the project's purpose
    * The reason why the project was chartered
    * The project manager and her level of autonomy
    * Summary milestone schedule
    * Stakeholder influences




                                                                                                          PART II
    * Functional organizations and how they'll be involved with the project
    * Project constraints and assumptions (environment, external, and
      organizational)
    * Business case for the project and the project's return on investment
    * Summary project budget

    Believe it or not, the project charter may be updated. For example, the summary
project budget may be based on a simple rough order of magnitude estimate. As the
project moves deeper into planning, the estimates become clearer and more precise.
The more accurate estimate may cause the budget to grow, requiring the project charter
to be modified to reflect the new information.

Preparing to Create the Project Charter
The project charter often comes from the project manager, so you'll need to know what
goes into it, how it gets created, and then what you can do with your charter--espe-
cially for the Certified Associate in Project Management (CAPM) or Project Manage-
ment Professional (PMP) examination. When preparing to create the project charter,
you'll need four things, described in the following sections.

Contract Okay, I confess--you won't always need a contract in order to create a
project charter, but it's the first input in the Project Management Body of Knowledge
(PMBOK), so work with me for a moment. If you're working in an organization that
performs projects for other entities, such as a consulting firm, architectural firm, or
even an events planning company, you'll need a contract to make the project official.
Chapter 12 explores contracting; but for now, know that you may need a contract if it's
appropriate for your project.

Project Statement of Work (SOW) This document defines all the products
and services that the project will provide. For a project completed internally, the SOW
comes from the project sponsor and defines the business need, products, and services
the project will create. If the project is to be completed for another organization, the
customer should provide the performing organization with the SOW as part of their
procurement package. For example, if your company were to receive a request for pro-
posal (RFP) to create a new warehouse, the customer would include the SOW with the
RFP so you could know what the proposal is to address. Every SOW should include:

    * Business need Why the project needs to exist.
CAPM/PMP Project Management Certification All-in-One Exam Guide
108
                * Product scope description This document describes the product or service the
                  project will create. Consider the RFP to create the new warehouse: the customer's
                  RFP would detail the square footage, requirements of the warehouse, and other
                  details that would allow your company to respond intelligently to their request.
                  As you may have experienced, especially in the world of information technology,
                  the product description is usually broad, vague, and dreamy in the early stages
                  of a project. As the project moves through the planning phases, the details of the
                  product scope become clearer.
                * Strategic plan The strategic plan defines how the project will mesh with the
                  organization's goals. This is a key input when an organization decides to do a
                  project or not. Basically, you won't find a car manufacturer hosting projects to
                  create chandeliers--it's just not within their strategic plan to undertake such a
                  project.

           Enterprise Environmental Factors The project charter also considers the or-
           ganization where the project will take place and its culture, standards, regulations, and
           environment. You'll see enterprise environmental factors throughout the remainder of
           this book, and it's new to the third edition of the PMBOK. Just so you've got these fun
           things once and for all, here are the enterprise environmental factors you'll need to be
           familiar with:
                * Organization's culture and structure.
                * Industry standards and regulations.
                * Organization's facilities and equipment (the general infrastructure of the
                  company).
                * Human resources and their talents and skills.
                * Human resources administration.
                * Work authorization system.
                * Marketplace conditions.
                * Stakeholders' tolerance for risk. (This is also known as the utility function.)
                * Commercial databases for the organization's industry. (Think of cost-
                  estimating databases for a builder or manufacturer.)
                * Project management information system (PMIS). Think of--yes, I'll say
                  it--Microsoft Project. Don't worry--you won't have to know any software
                  vendors or their goods for the PMI exam. All of your favorite, or least favorite,
                  project management software is just lumped into the generic term "project
                  management information system."
           Organizational Process Assets Anything that your organization has in its pos-
           session that can help your current project succeed is part of the organizational process
           assets. This also means that the policies, procedures, documentation of past projects,
           and plans are part of the organizational process assets. Project Management Institute
           (PMI) breaks down the organizational process assets into two big categories. Let's ex-
           plore them in detail:
                                                                      Chapter 4: Managing Project Integration

                                                                                                        109
     * Processes and procedures for project work:
        * Standard processes and procedures for getting project work done. Consider
          how purchase requests, team member acquisitions, the quality programs
          your projects subscribe to, checklists, and generally the way your company
          requires your projects to operate.
        * Guidelines, how your project team is to complete their work, proposal
          evaluations, and how you measure your project for performance.




                                                                                                                PART II
        * Templates for project management.
        * How the project manager is allowed to tailor the project management
          processes to fit any given project.
     * Communication requirements, archival, security requirements, and allowed
       modalities for communication:
        * How a project manager is to close a project.
        * Financial controls and procedures.
        * Issue and product defect management.
        * Change control procedures.
        * Risk management procedures.
        * Work authorization system processes.
        * Processes and procedures for contributing to and accessing a corporate
          knowledge base.
        * Process measurements.
        * Project files.
        * Historical information and lessons-learned documentation.
        * Issue and defect records of past projects and products.
        * Configuration management for versioning, baselines, company standards,
          procedures, and prior project documents. (Think of the versions of
          software, blueprints, and manuals.)
        * Financial databases.

Choosing a Project to Charter
Once the organization and the project manager are armed with these inputs, they're ready
to go about creating the project charter. Preparing to create the charter is often trickier than
actually writing it. However, before the project management team can actually create a
charter, there needs to be a project. This means the organization, the project steering com-
mittee, or the project portfolio management team needs to choose a project to initiate.
    Now, unless you work for an incredible organization and/or are extremely lucky,
you've probably discovered that not every good project is allowed to be authorized
through a charter. After all, most companies only have a limited amount of funds to
invest in new projects. There are two approaches an organization takes to choose new
projects--and no, they are not "heads or tails."
CAPM/PMP Project Management Certification All-in-One Exam Guide

              The first method is by using a mathematical model to determine the likelihood of
           success. These models include:
                   *   Linear programming
                   *   Nonlinear programming
                   *   Dynamic programming
                   *   Integer programming
                   * Multiobjective programming
              Sounds like fun, doesn't it? Don't worry. You do not need to know how to perform
           any of the above math tricks for your CAPM or PMP examination. Just be topically
           aware of these and know that they are examples of geeky mathematical models.

                           EXAM TIP Mathematical models are also known as constrained
                           optimization.

               The second method, however, you will want to be a bit more familiar with. This
           project selection uses a benefits-comparison model to determine a project's success.
           Let's look at these in more detail in the following sections.

           Murder Boards
           Murder boards are committees full of folks that ask every conceivable negative question
           about the proposed project. Their goals are to expose strengths and weakness of the
           project--and kill the project if it's deemed unworthy for the organization to commit to.
           Not a pleasant decision-making process. You might also know murder boards by a
           slightly friendlier name: project steering committees or project selection committees.

           Scoring Models
           Scoring models (sometimes called weighted scoring models) are models that use a com-
           mon set of values for all of the projects up for selection. For example, values can be prof-
           itability, complexity, customer demand, and so on. Each of these values has an assigned
           weight. Values of high importance have a high weight, while values of lesser importance
           have a lesser weight. The projects are measured against these values and assigned scores
           by how well they match the predefined values. The projects with higher scores take prior-
           ity over projects with lesser scores. Figure 4-1 demonstrates the scoring model.

                                                                                                        111
Benefit/Cost Ratios
Just like they sound, benefit/cost ratio (BCR) models examine the cost-to-benefit ratio.
A typical measure is the cost to complete the project and the cost of ongoing operations
of the project product compared against the expected benefits of the project. For ex-
ample, consider a project that will cost $575,000 to create a new product, market the
product, and provide ongoing support for the product for one year. The expected gross
return on the product, however, is $980,000 in year one. The benefit of completing the




                                                                                                                PART II
project is greater than the cost to create the product.

             EXAM NOTE BCR statements can be written as ratios. For example, a BCR of
             3:2 has three benefits to two costs--a good choice. A BCR of 1:3, however, is not
             a good choice. Pay special attention to which side of the ratio represents the cost;
             it should not be more than the benefit if you want the project to be selected.

Payback Period
How long does it take the project to "pay back" the associated costs? For example, the
AXZ Project will cost the organization $500,000 to create over five years. The expected
cash inflow (income) on the project deliverable, however, is $40,000 per quarter. From
here, it's simple math: 500,000 divided by $40,000 is 12.5 quarters, or a little over three
years to recoup the expenses.
    This selection method, while one of the simplest, is also the weakest. Why? The
cash inflows are not discounted against the time to begin creating the cash. This is the
time value of money. The $40,000 per quarter five years from now is worth less than
$40,000 in your pocket today. Remember when sodas were a nickel? It's the same
idea--the soda hasn't gotten better, the nickel is just worth less today than it was way
back then.

Considering the Discounted Cash Flow
Discounted cash flow accounts for the time value of money. If you were to borrow $100,000
for five years from your uncle, you'd be paying interest on the money, yes? (If not, you've
got a great uncle.) If the $100,000 were invested for five years and managed to earn a
whopping 6 percent interest per year, compounded annually, it'd be worth $133,822.60 at
the end of five years. This is the future value of the money in today's terms.
    The magic formula for future value is FV = PV (1 + I)n, where:

     * FV is future value
     * PV is present value
     * I is the interest rate
     * N is the number of time periods (years, quarters, and so on)

   Here's the formula with the $100,000 in action:

     1. FV = 100,000(1 + .06)5
     2. FV = 100,000(1.338226)
     3. FV = 133,822.60
CAPM/PMP Project Management Certification All-in-One Exam Guide
112
                The future value of the $100,000 five years from now is worth $133,822.60 today. So
           how does that help? Now we've got to calculate the discounted cash flow across all of the
           projects up for selection. The discounted cash flow is really just the inverse of the preced-
           ing formula. We're looking for the present value of future cash flows: PV = FV/(1 + I)n.
                In other words, if a project says it'll be earning the organization $160,000 per year
           in five years, that's great, but what's $160,000 five years from now really worth today?
           This puts the amount of the cash flow in perspective with what the projections are in
           today's money. Let's plug it into the formula and find out (assuming the interest rate is
           still six percent):
                1. PV = FV/(1 + I)n
                2. PV = 160,000/(1.338226)
                3. PV = $119,561
                So...$160,000 in five years is really only worth $119,561 today. If we had four dif-
           ferent projects of varying time to completion, cost, and project cash inflows at comple-
           tion, we'd calculate the present value and choose the project with the best present value,
           as it'll likely be the best investment for the organization.

                         EXAM TIP You should be able to look at the present value of two proposed
                         projects and make a decision as to which one should be green-lighted. The
                         project with the highest present value is the best choice if that's the only
                         factor you're presented with.

           Calculating the Net Present Value
           The net present value (NPV) is a somewhat complicated formula, but it allows you to pre-
           dict a project's value more precisely than the lump-sum approach found with the PV for-
           mula. NPV evaluates the monies returned on a project for each time period the project
           lasts. In other words, a project may last five years, but there may be a return on investment
           (ROI) in each of the five years the project is in existence, not just at the end of the project.
                For example, a retail company may be upgrading the facilities at each of their stores
           to make shopping and purchasing easier for their customers. The company has 1,000
           stores. As each store makes the conversion to the new facility design, the project deliv-
           erables will begin, hopefully, generating cash flow as a result of the project deliverables.
           (Uh, we specifically want cash inflow from the new stores, not cash outflow. That's
           some nerdy accounting humor.) The project can begin earning money when the first
           store is completed with the conversion to the new facilities. The faster the project can
           be completed, the sooner the organization will see a complete ROI.
                Here's how the NPV formula works:
                1. Calculate the project's cash flow for time unit (typically quarters or years).
                2. Calculate each time unit total into the present value.
                3. Sum the present value of each time unit.
                4. Subtract the investment for the project.
                5. Take two aspirins.
                                                                   Chapter 4: Managing Project Integration

                                                                                                     113
     6. Examine the NPV value. An NPV greater than one is good, and the project should
        be approved. An NPV less than one is bad, and the project should be rejected.
   When comparing two projects, the one with the greater NPV is typically better, al-
though projects with high returns (PVs) early in the project are better than those with
low returns early in the project. Table 4-1 provides an example of an NPV calculation.

              EXAM TIP You likely will not have to calculate NPV for your CAPM or




                                                                                                             PART II
              PMP exam. I've included the whole scenario here to provide an understanding
              of the formula. Basically, better than one is good; less than one means your
              project is losing money.

Considering the Internal Rate of Return
The last benefit measurement method is the internal rate of return (IRR). The IRR is a
complex formula to calculate when the present value of the cash inflow equals the
original investment. Don't get too lost in this formula--it's a tricky business, and you
won't need to know how to calculate the IRR for the exam. You will need to know,
however, that when comparing multiple projects' IRRs, projects with high IRRs are bet-
ter choices than projects with low IRRs. This makes sense. Would you like an invest-
ment with a high rate of return or a lower rate of return? As a general rule, an IRR
greater than 1 is good.

              EXAM TIP The formulas on the time value of money are important for
              project selection, but not so important to memorize for the exam.You'll need
              to be familiar with the formulas, what they do, and why organizations use them
              to select projects. Don't worry about memorizing them for the exam.You're
              more likely to experience these on the PMP exam than the CAPM exam.

Knowing the Project Management Methodology
Before the project management team can dive in and create the project charter, they
also need to understand how their organization approaches project management in
general. When I teach my project management seminars, I find that some companies

           have a formal, highly structured, rigid project management approach. Other companies
           are, well, loosey-goosey. Their approach can vary from project manager to project man-
           ager, and they don't mind.
               Whatever methodology an organization has adapted, the project management team
           must understand how this affects the level of detail they'll need to provide in their proj-
           ect charter. The great thing about this point, in light of your exam, is that every com-
           pany in the world can take a different project management methodology, so it's tough
           to ask questions about what's proper or not.

           Creating the Charter--Finally
           Now that the project management team is armed with all the inputs, has considered the
           project selection methodology, and understands the project management methodology
           in place in their organization, they're ready to create the project. There are two additional
           tools the project management team can use to create the charter and they're easy:
                * Project management information system Remember the computer software
                  that helps the project manager manage the project? That software can often
                  help the project management team create the project charter as well.
                * Expert judgment Experts within the organization or external experts, such
                  as consultants, agencies, firms, or subject matter experts (SMEs), can help the
                  project management team create all the needed elements for the charter.
               The project charter, as a final reminder for your exam, is endorsed by an entity outside
           of the project boundaries. This person or entity has the power to authorize the project
           and grant the project manager the power to assign resources to the project work.


           Developing the Preliminary Project Scope
           Statement (PMBOK, Section 4.2)
           All projects need a project scope statement. This document defines what the project
           needs to accomplish in order for the project to be deemed complete. The project, in its
           infancy, is defined in the preliminary project scope statement. Like its name implies,
           this document is preliminary to the project work and much of the project planning. The
           project scope statement should always include:
                * Project and product objectives
                * Service requirements and characteristics
                * Criteria for project acceptance
                * Project boundaries
                * Project requirements and deliverables
                * Constraints and assumptions
                * Initial project organization
                * Milestones
                * Initial work breakdown structure
                                                                     Chapter 4: Managing Project Integration

                                                                                                       115
      * Order-of-magnitude cost estimate (this is your ballpark estimate)
      * Configuration management requirements
      * Approval requirements
    This "baby scope statement" is based on the details the project sponsor provides the
project management team. As you might guess, this information can be broad, sketchy,
or even plain wrong. That's why this project scope statement is preliminary. Once the




                                                                                                               PART II
project team moves deeper into the planning process group, there'll be plenty of time
for refining the project scope statement.


Developing the Project Management Plan
(PMBOK, Section 4.3)
You wouldn't go about building a house, creating a new piece of software, or launching
any project without a project plan, right? The project management plan, however, is
more than how the work will be done: it's how the project will be done. That's right, the
project management plan defines how the project is executed, monitored and con-
trolled, and then closed. It's a plan on how to manage, coordinate, and integrate all the
different knowledge areas and processes within a project. It's multifaceted. Figure 4-2
shows the process necessary before the project management plan can be developed.
Think of all the things a project manager and the project team will decide within the
project plan that need to be documented:
      * Which project management processes and their level of implementation are
        appropriate for the project
      * What tools and techniques will be used with which processes
      * How the selected processes will be used to manage the project, including how
        the processes will interact as the project moves through its own phases
      * How the project work will be completed
      * How change control will happen

                * How configuration management will be performed
                * The integrity of the project's baselines and how the measurements will be used
                  to better manage the project
                * Communication demand and techniques with the project stakeholders
                * How the project phases will commence and proceed
                * When and how management will review the project's performance

           Creating the Project Management Plan
           As the project completes project planning activities, the outputs will be assimilated into
           a collection of subsidiary project plans. The collection of these subsidiary project plans
           will address all of the previous points and help the project manager and the project
           team know where the project is going and how they will get there. Let's take a moment
           and look at each of the project management subsidiary plans the project management
           plan will include:

                * Project scope management plan This defines how the project scope
                  will be planned, managed, and controlled. This plan is covered in detail
                  in Chapter 5.
                * Schedule management plan This defines how the project schedule will be
                  created and managed. The schedule management plan and its creation are
                  covered in Chapter 6.
                * Cost management plan This plan details how the project costs will be
                  planned for, estimated, budgeted, and then monitored and controlled. Cost
                  management is described in Chapter 7.
                * Quality management plan Quality is expected on every project. This plan
                  defines what quality means for the project, how the project will achieve quality,
                  and how the project will map to organizational procedures pertaining to
                  quality. Chapter 8 covers quality management in more detail.
                * Process improvement plan Who wants an extra helping of waste in their
                  project? This plan aims to eliminate non-value-added activity, eliminate waste,
                  and determine how the project work, execution, and management can be
                  made better. This plan is covered in Chapter 8.
                * Staffing management plan This plan defines how project team members
                  will be brought on to and released from the project team. It also defines team
                  training, safety issues, and how the project's reward and recognition system
                  will operate. Chapter 9 defines the staffing management plan in detail.
                * Communications management plan This plan defines who will get what
                  information, how will they receive it, and in what modality the communication
                  will take place. Chapter 10 explains communication in more detail.
                * Risk management plan Risk is an uncertain event or condition that may
                  affect the project's outcome. The risk management plan defines how the
                  project will manage risk. Chapter 11 includes a conversation on this plan.
                                                                  Chapter 4: Managing Project Integration

                                                                                                    117
     * Procurement management plan The procurement management plan,
       defined in Chapter 12, controls how the project will be allowed to contract
       goods and services.
    These subsidiary plans are directly related to the project management knowledge
areas. Each plan can be adapted from previous projects or templates within the com-
pany that the performing organization has created as part of its organizational process
assets. While the project management is, for the most part, a compilation of project




                                                                                                            PART II
plans, there are additional items included that you should know for your CAPM or
PMP certification:
     * Milestone list This list details the project's milestones and their attributes.
       It is used for several areas of project planning, but also helps determine how
       quickly the project may be ascertaining its objectives.
     * Resource calendar Resources are people and things like equipment, rooms,
       and other facilities. This calendar defines when the resources are available to
       contribute to the project.
     * Schedule baseline This is the planned start and finish of the project.
       The comparison of what was planned and was experienced is the schedule
       variance.
     * Cost baseline This is the aggregated costs of all of the work packages within
       the work breakdown structure (WBS).
     * Quality baseline This documents the quality objectives for the project,
       including the metrics for stakeholder acceptance of the project deliverable.
     * Risk register The risk register is a centralized database consisting of the
       outcome of all the other risk management processes. Consider the outcome
       of risk identification, qualitative analysis, and quantitative analysis.

            EXAM TIP You'll be seeing these documents throughout the remainder
            of this book. Basically, every knowledge area has one project management
            subsidiary plan, except for quality, which has two: the quality management
            plan and the process improvement plan.

Using the Project Management Information System
You already know that the PMIS is a software tool that helps the project management
team plan, execute, monitor and control, and then close the project. The PMIS, contrary
to what some managers want to believe, does not replace the project manager. Within
the PMIS there are two important systems that you will need to know for your CAPM
or PMP exam and the remainder of this book. Let's get these down now and be happy
for the next eight chapters.

Configuration Management System
We all know that changes are likely to happen to the project scope. How these change
requests are submitted, reviewed, their status tracked, and approved are part of the con-
figuration management system. This system, established early in the project, defines
CAPM/PMP Project Management Certification All-in-One Exam Guide
118
           how stakeholders are allowed to submit change requests, the conditions for approving
           a change request, and how approved change requests are validated in the project scope.
           Configuration management also is in charge of several activities:

                * Documenting the functional and physical characteristics of a product or
                  component
                * Controlling changes to any of a product's physical characteristics
                * Recording changes to the product's physical characteristics and the conditions
                  surrounding the changes
                * Contributing and supporting the audit of a product or component for quality

           Change Control System
           You'll be hearing an awful lot about change control throughout the remainder of this
           book. It's essential for a project to have an established change control system, or the proj-
           ect will be riddled with change requests. The change control system (CCS) communicates
           the process for controlling changes to the project deliverables. This system works with the
           configuration management system and seeks to control and document proposals to the
           project's product. Figure 4-3 demonstrates an example of a change control system.


                         NOTE I won't bash Microsoft Project--it's an excellent, excellent tool.
                         However, some managers believe that if you have Microsoft Project installed
                         on your PC, you should be able to manage a project without any flaws,
                         questions, or issues. Ha! That's like saying that just because you have Microsoft
                         Word installed you should be able to write a novel. Project management is
                         more than a piece of software.

Executing the Project Plan
(PMBOK, Section 4.4)
So you've got a project plan--great! Now the work of executing the project plan begins.
The project manager and the project team will go about completing the promises made
in the plan to deliver, document, measure, and complete the project work. The project
plan will communicate to the project team, the stakeholders, management, and even




                                                                                                          PART II
vendors what work happens next, how it begins, and how it will be measured for qual-
ity and performance.
     The product of the project is created during these execution processes. The largest
percentage of the project budget will be spent now. The project manager and the project
team must work together to orchestrate the timing and integration of all the project's
moving parts. A flaw in one area of the execution can have ramifications in cost and
additional risk, and can cause additional flaws in other areas of the project.
     As the project work is implemented, the project manager refers to the project plan
to ensure that the work is meeting the documented expectations, requirements, quality
demands, target dates, and more. The completion of the work is measured and then
compared against the cost, schedule, and scope baselines as documented in the project
plan. Should there be--gasp!--discrepancies between the project work and the base-
lines, prompt and accurate reactions are needed to adjust the slipping components of
the project. The execution of the project includes many activities:
    * Doing the work to reach the project objectives
    * Spending the project budget to reach the objectives (I can help!)
    * Building, training, and developing the project team
    * Getting quotes, bids, and proposals for project vendors
    * Selecting the project sellers
    * Purchasing, managing, and using the resources, materials, equipment, and
      facilities the project needs to reach its objectives
    * Implementing the organization's mandated methods and standards for the
      project
    * Managing and verifying the project deliverables
    * Completing risk assessment, monitoring, and response
    * Managing those pesky sellers
    * Dovetailing the approved changes into the project
    * Communicating with the project's stakeholders
    * Gathering project data on cost, schedule, quality, and status to forecast where
      the project will be in the future
    * Collecting and creating the lessons-learned documentation
   Directing and managing the project also requires the project management team to re-
spond to conditions within the project. Consider a new immediate risk that demands a
CAPM/PMP Project Management Certification All-in-One Exam Guide
120
           response. A new condition warrants that the project management team plan and then
           directly confront the problem. There are three activities that also fall into executing the
           project plan:
                * Apply corrective actions to bring future project performance back into
                  alignment with the project plan.
                * Apply preventive actions to avoid negative risks within the project.
                * Apply defect repairs to fix flaws and problems identified through quality control.

           Monitoring and Controlling the Project
           (PMBOK, Section 4.5)
           As soon as a project begins, the project management monitoring and controlling pro-
           cesses also begin. These processes monitor all the other processes within the project to
           ensure that they are being done according to plan, according to the performing organi-
           zation's practices, and to ensure that a limited amount of defects enters the project. The
           monitoring and controlling process group has several key activities:
                * Collecting project statistics
                * Measuring project performance
                * Distributing project information
                * Analyzing project trends and measurements to improve the project

           Monitoring the Project
           Monitoring and controlling the project is not a one-time or random event. It's impor-
           tant for the project management team to continue to monitor the project and not as-
           sume that all's well simply because the project work is being completed. A constant
           monitoring of the project confirms that the project work is being done properly and if
           the work is flawed that a response can be created. Monitoring and controlling is also
           concerned with its results. For example, a defect repair review follows a defect repair to
           ensure that it is accurate and that the project work may continue.
               Monitoring and controlling the project work has seven activities:
                * Comparing actual performance to what was promised in the project
                  management plan
                * Determining if corrective and preventive actions should be applied to the
                  project
                * Performing ongoing risk assessment, risk tracking, and analyzing the risk
                  responses and their effectiveness on the identified risks
                * Maintaining a project information base on the project's product throughout
                  the project's life cycle
                * Providing information for status updates, progress measurement, and project
                  forecasting
                * Forecasting cost and schedule information
                                                                 Chapter 4: Managing Project Integration

                                                                                                   121
    * Monitoring the approved change requests as they are implemented into
      the project and tracking the rejected change requests and their associated
      documentation

Managing Integrated Change Control
Project managers must protect the project scope from changes. Management, team
members, customers, and other stakeholders are going to want changes to the project




                                                                                                           PART II
deliverables. Changes to the product often stem from the customer. Changes may also
stem from suggestions of the stakeholders--such as small, innocent changes that bloom
into additional time and costs. Finally, changes may come from the project team. When
it comes to integrated change control, the project manager must provide for:
    * Identifying a change that is proposed or that has already occurred
    * Influencing the stakeholders so that only approved changes are incorporated
      into the project work
    * Reviewing and, when needed, approving change requests
    * Managing changes by regulating the flow of change requests
    * Reflecting the approved changes in the project's baselines: time, cost, scope,
      and quality
    * Reviewing and approving corrective and preventive actions
    * Considering the impact of a change request on the rest of the project, as well as
      considering all of the knowledge areas and the impact of a change on each one
    * Documenting the change request and the impact it may have on the project
    * Completing defect repair validation
    * Continuing quality control

            EXAM TIP Think of integrated change control as the domino effect. Any
            proposed changes to the project can have serious impacts on other areas of
            the project. Because of this, all of the project management knowledge areas
            have to be evaluated with each project change.

Reacting to Change
Every project needs a change control system to review, consider, track, and, if needed,
approve the change requests. Rejected change requests should also be tracked and doc-
umented. Often, projects rely on a change control board (CCB) to evaluate the worthi-
ness of a proposed change before it is approved. Whatever approach a project manage-
ment team elects, or is required, to take when dealing with changes, the approach
should be documented. The key stakeholders must all agree to abide by the rules of the
change control system before the project work begins.
   When changes are approved, the project manager must then update the project
baselines, as changes will likely affect a combination of scope, cost, and time. The up-
dated baselines allow the project to continue with the new changes fleshed in and
provide for an accurate measurement of the project's performance.
CAPM/PMP Project Management Certification All-in-One Exam Guide
122
               This is an important concept: update the project baselines. Consider a project to which
           work has been added but for which the schedule baseline has not been updated. The
           project's end date will be sooner than what is possible because the project baseline does
           not reflect the additional work that should extend that date. In addition, a failure to
           revise the project baseline could skew reporting, variances, future project decisions--
           and even future projects.

                         EXAM TIP Undocumented change requests should not be implemented into
                         the project.

               Consider a project manager who does not update the project baseline after a change.
           The completion of the project goes into the archives and can serve as historical infor-
           mation for future projects. The historical information is skewed, as it does not accu-
           rately account for the added work and the projected end date or budget.
               Remember our pal the configuration management system? It's a subcomponent of
           the PMIS and works with the change control system. It is within integrated change con-
           trol that the configuration management system plays three vital roles, as explained in
           the following sections.

           Configuration Identification
           The configuration of the project's product or service must be accurately and completely
           defined. This includes the labeling of the components, how changes are made to the
           product, and the accountability of the changes. Specifically, accountability refers to the
           ownership of the change, the cost of the change, the schedule impacts, and the influence
           the product change has over the remainder of the product features and components. For
           example, a change to add a basement to a new home construction project would affect
           the project's baselines, the configuration of the product, and, depending on the project
           status when the change was approved, possibly other components of the house.

           Configuration Status Accounting
           Configuration management also includes the documentation of the product informa-
           tion so that the project management team can quickly and effectively manage the prod-
           uct. This process means organization of the product materials, details, and prior docu-
           mentation. For example, a new home construction project would have blueprints, per-
           mits, field drawings, vendor and customer specifications, and more information that
           needs to be cataloged, managed, and quickly accessed throughout the project.

           Configuration Verification and Auditing
           Configuration management is concerned with the performance and functional attri-
           butes of the product. In the new home construction project, the role of configuration
           management is to ensure that the new home is built according to the configuration
           documentation. Variances between what was completed and what was planned would
           have to be reviewed and responded to via defect repair or corrective actions.
                                                                    Chapter 4: Managing Project Integration

                                                                                                      123
Closing the Project (PMBOK, Section 4.7)
Every project manager that I know loves to close a project. There's something rewarding
about completing a project and then transferring the deliverable to the customer or
project user. I've also learned from participant feedback in my PMP Boot Camp semi-
nars that this topic is the category where they missed the most questions on their way
to their PMP or CAPM certification. I believe it's because folks have a tendency to study
in order of the phases: initiation, planning, monitoring and controlling, and then (fi-




                                                                                                              PART II
nally) closing. I imagine they're winded by the time their studying efforts get to closing.
With that in mind, give yourself a stretch, another sip of coffee, and really hone in on
this closing discussion. I want you to pass your exam!
    The closing process group may be applied to the end of a project or to the end of
the project phase, in a multiphased project. Closing the project or phase means that the
project manager confirms that all of the needed activities within the other processes
groups have been completed and the project's deliverable may be handed over to the
customer. If a project is terminated for any reason, the project manager should still
close out the project to account for the work that has been performed on the project
and to learn why the project may have failed.

             NOTE Projects can be moving along swimmingly and still get terminated.
             Consider an organization's cash flow, the project's priority, or that the project
             deliverable may not be needed any longer. Just because a project was cancelled
             doesn't always mean the project was a failure.

Completing Administrative Closure
This is the guts of the closing process group. First, administrative closure documents
everyone who is involved in the project closure: team members, vendors, management,
the sponsor, and often the project customer. Part of this documentation defines each
person's role and related responsibility to close out the project. Consider a large con-
struction project. There are lots of people involved in the formal closing proceedings,
so documentation explaining who'll be needed, what they'll be doing, and when they'll
be doing it makes great sense for the project manager.
    The second part of administrative closure collects all of the project records, the les-
sons learned, and communications for the project archives. Yes, archives; all project
information should be archived--this becomes part of the organizational process as-
sets. Administrative closure includes the examination and analysis of the project re-
cords and determines the success or failure of the project, as well as why the project
succeeded or failed. This information helps future project managers.
    The goal of project closure is to get formal acceptance of the project deliverables.
Formal acceptance means that the project customer or sponsor agrees that the deliver-
able provided is in alignment with the project scope and that it is acceptable. A formal
documentation of project acceptance is needed to confirm that the project deliverable
has been transferred from the project manager to the recipient of the project.
CAPM/PMP Project Management Certification All-in-One Exam Guide

           Completing Contract Closure
           Vendors like to get paid, but the project manager must confirm that everything the ven-
           dor promised has been delivered according to the contract between the vendor and the
           project manager's organization. Contract closure documents the completed contract
           and its outputs. This information is also stored as part of the project archives.
                Above any other conversation, e-mail, or promises, the details of the project con-
           tract are paramount. The project manager consults the contract, not only to confirm
           that the vendor has lived by its obligations, but also to confirm that the project manag-
           er's organization has held up its part of the bargain. Sometimes, and they are not fun
           times, the vendor didn't live up to the agreement and the contract was cancelled. Con-
           tracts can be cancelled for any number of reasons: poor performance, schedule and/or
           cost overruns, quality issues, and more. Whatever the reason, the documentation sur-
           rounding the cancellation of the contract is included as part of the contract closure, and
           this information is also included in the project archives for future reference.


           Chapter Summary
           Project integration management is an ongoing process the project manager completes
           to ensure that the project moves from initiation to closure. It is the gears, guts, and
           grind of project management, the day-in, day-out business of completing the project
           work. Project integration management takes the project plans; coordinates the activi-
           ties, project resources, constraints, and assumptions; and massages them into a working
           model. Once the model exists, it's up to the project management team to monitor and
           control the project from initiation to closure and assure that everything goes according
           to plan. And if not? Fix it.
                Of course, project integration management isn't an automatic process; it requires
           you, the project manager, to negotiate, finesse, and adapt to project circumstances. It
           relies on general business skills (such as leadership), organizational skills, and com-
           munication to get all the parts of the project working together. Project integration man-
           agement has seven events:
                * Developing the project charter The project charter authorizes the project.
                  It names the project manager and allows the project to commence. Projects
                  are chartered for varying reasons: market demand, customer requests, to solve
                  a problem, or even to address a social need. While the charter authorizes
                  the project, it also defines the requirements for stakeholder satisfaction, the
                  project purpose, and the project assumptions and constraints.
                * Developing the preliminary project scope statement The preliminary
                  project scope statement defines many things, chief among them: project
                  objectives, deliverables, acceptance criteria, schedule milestones, the initial
                  WBS, and the initial defined risks.
                * Developing the project plan Project plan development is an iterative
                  process that requires input from the project manager, the project team, the
                  project customers, and other key stakeholders. It details how the project work
                  will accomplish the project goals. The project is comprised of nine subsidiary
                  plans and several other documents.
                                                                   Chapter 4: Managing Project Integration

                                                                                                     125
     * Directing and managing the project execution Once the project management
       plan has been created, the project manager and the project team can implement
       the plan. Directing and managing the project plan creates the project deliverables
       for the project or phase. Corrective actions, preventive actions, and defect repair
       all happen through directing and managing the project execution.
     * Monitoring and controlling the project This process group starts with
       the project's conception and finishes with the project completion. Its goal is




                                                                                                             PART II
       to make certain that the project stays on track and finishes according to the
       project plan. Measurements for project performance, time, cost, and quality
       are implemented. If there are variances, responses to these will happen
       through preventive, corrective, or defect repair actions.
     * Managing integrated change control Changes can kill a project. Change
       requests must be documented and sent through a formal change control system
       to determine their worthiness for implementation. Integrated change control
       manages changes across the entire project. Change requests are evaluated and
       considered for impacts on risk, costs, schedule, and scope. Not all change
       requests are approved--but all change requests must be documented.
     * Closing the project Projects and phases are closed. Administrative closure
       confirms that all of the needed processes for each process group have been
       completed. Administrative closure also gathers all project records for
       archival purposes, including documentation of the project's success or failure.
       Contracts, when used, must also be closed after inspection of the contract
       deliverables. Contracts are always closed according to the agreed-upon terms.

Answers
   1. A. Change requests should first be documented in the project's change control
      system. B is incorrect because the new law will require changes to the project.
      C is incorrect because it may be inappropriate to consult with the project
CAPM/PMP Project Management Certification All-in-One Exam Guide
132
                   stakeholders, especially on a large project. D is incorrect because we do not
                   know the impact of the change and it may not justify halting the project work.
                   For more information, see the PMBOK, Section 4.6.
                2. A. A predetermined budget set by management is an example of a project
                   constraint. B and C are examples of organizational process assets that the
                   project manager will use as inputs to project management planning. D,
                   interviews with subject matter experts, is an example of expert judgment, and
                   is a tool and technique used in project management plan development. For
                   more information, see the PMBOK, Sections 4.3, 4.3.1, and 4.3.2.3.
                3. D. The primary purpose of the project management plan is to define
                   how the project will proceed. A and B are incorrect choices, as these
                   address only the project work. C is incorrect, as this answer only addresses
                   the project's change control system. For more information, see the PMBOK,
                   Section 4.3.
                4. B. The selected project management processes need to be identified as
                   part of the planning process. The project management processes are the
                   44 processes described in Chapter 3 and throughout the remainder of
                   this book. A, C, and D are incorrect choices, as these are not inputs to the
                   project plan development processes. For more information, see the PMBOK,
                   Section 4.3.1.
                5. D. Defect repair review is a review of the defect repair. A is an example of a
                   preventive action. B is an example of a corrective action. C is an example of
                   defect repair. For more information, see the PMBOK, Section 4.5.3.

                7. D. The project management plan provides baselines for time, cost, and scope.
                   Control is a project activity and part of the monitoring and controlling process
                   group. For more information, see the PMBOK, Sections 4.3, 4.5, and 4.6.
                8. D. Change requests need to be researched, and their complete impact needs
                   to be documented. Part of this documentation includes the risk assessment
                   of the new change. A, B, and C are not requirements for change requests. For
                   more information, see the PMBOK, Section 4.6.
                9. A. The project management plan defines how changes will be monitored
                   and controlled. B describes the risk management plan. C defines the project
                   charter and project scope. D is an incorrect statement. For more information,

    product. B, C, and D are not correct answers. For more information, see the
    PMBOK, Section 4.3.2.2.
11. A. The project manager and the project management team direct the
    performance of the project activities. The project team, sponsor, and the roles
    do not direct performance. For more information, see the PMBOK, Section 4.4.
12. B. Lessons learned documentation serves as part of organizational process
    assets for future projects. A, the proof of concept, is not a PMI theme.




                                                                                                        PART II
    C, project progress, is reported through status reports and performance
    measurements. D, team member performance, is built by performance, not
    lessons learned. For more information, see the PMBOK, Section 4.7.3.4.
13. C. The earned value technique, commonly called earned value management
    (EVM), measures project performance on several factors, including cost and
    schedule. A, the WBS, is a breakdown of the project scope. B, the project
    plan, defines how the project will be controlled, executed, and closed. D,
    the work authorization, allows work to progress within a project. For more
    information, see the PMBOK, Section 4.5.2.3.
14. C. Change requests should not be automatically approved. All documented
    change requests should flow through the change control system, be evaluated,
    and then a decision should be made. Choices A, B, and D are all part of
    configuration management. For more information, see the PMBOK, Section 4.6.
15. D. Risk responses are not addressed in the project charter. The project
    manager, the summary budget, and the requirements to satisfy the project
    customer are defined. For more information, see the PMBOK, Section 4.1.
16. B. Linear programming is an example of a mathematical model. Recall that
    mathematical models are also known as constrained optimization. Future
    value, present value, and a benefits-cost ratio are all examples of the benefits
    comparison model. For more information, see the PMBOK, Section 4.1.2.
17. D. The initial WBS is part of the preliminary project scope statement.
    Risk responses are part of the risk management plan, so A is incorrect.
    Organizational process assets are not included in the project scope statement,
    so B is incorrect, too. C, the project statement of work, is also not part of the
    project scope statement. For more information, see the PMBOK, Section 4.2.
18. D. The project management plan communicates how the project will be
    executed, monitored and controlled, and then closed. A and B both describe
    components of the project charter. C does not answer the question as
    completely as D. For more information, see the PMBOK, Section 4.3.
19. B. $139,000 is the present value of Mary's project. This is found through
    the following formula: future value divided by one plus the interest rate to
    the power of the time periods the project will last. This question would read

134
                   ($175,000)/(1.26), as the interest rate provided was 6 percent. Choices A, C,
                   and D are all incorrect calculations. For more information, see the PMBOK,
                   Section 4.1.2.
               20. C. Completing the contract closure procedure is part of closing the project, but
                   it is not part of administrative closure. A, B, and D are incorrect choices, because
                   these activities are part of administrative closure. For more information, see the
                   PMBOK, Sections 4.7.3.1 and 4.7.3.2.

    In this chapter, you will
       * Plan the project scope
       * Create the project scope statement
       * Create the work breakdown structure
       * Verify the project scope
       * Control the project scope




 You're the project manager of a large, complex project. Everyone is in agreement that
 the project must be completed within one year, the budget is tight, and there's little
 room for error. One of your project team members, Tony, has taken it upon himself to
 incorporate "extras" into the project deliverable to make it snappier, better, and easier
 for the product customer to use. While his project additions are clever, they aren't in the
 project scope.

     Tony argues how his creative additions don't cost the project anything extra and the
 customer will love what he's come up with. The trouble, for you, the customer, and
 Tony, is that the time he's spent changing the scope should be spent doing the things
 that are in the scope. In addition, the extras aren't in the scope, aren't managed and
 reviewed as change requests, and will likely be a surprise to the project customer. Not
 to mention the added risks, potential for defect, and the contempt for an established
 change control system.

                VIDEO     Managing the project scope.


     Managing the project scope, according to the Project Management Body of Knowl-
 edge (PMBOK), is the project manager's job and ensures that all of the required work--
 and only the required work--is done to complete the project successfully. Project scope
 management doesn't permit Tony's, or anyone else's, additions. Scope management is
 agreeing on what's in the scope and then defending that agreement.

           Building a skyscraper has to be one of the largest projects a project manager could man-
           age. Think of all the different facets of the project: the art and design of the building,
           the structural requirements, the building codes, and the concern and interest of all the
           stakeholders within the project. The skyscraper would require months, if not years, of
           serious planning, tight change control, and incredible organization to complete. The
           scope of the skyscraper would be massive, and any change within the scope could have
           ramifications further down the blueprinted line.
               Now imagine a project to build a barn. There would still be considerable planning,
           and the stakeholders of the barn might be concerned with its planning and construc-
           tion, but probably not to the same depth as the skyscraper project. The priority and
           impact of each project is important to the key stakeholders of each, but no doubt the
           skyscraper has a much broader impact than a barn. My point? Larger projects require
           more detail when it comes to scope creation and planning. Lots more.
               Let's define scope, er, scopes, before moving forward.
               Project scope and product scope are different entities. Project scope deals with the
           required work to create the project deliverables. For instance, our projects to create a new
           barn and the new skyscraper would focus only on the work required to complete the
           projects, with the specific attributes, features, and characteristics called for by the project
           plan. The scope of the project is specific to the work required to complete the project
           objectives. The project scope focuses on what must be done to create the deliverable.
               Product scope, on the other hand, refers to the attributes and characteristics of the
           deliverables the project is creating. As in the preceding barn and skyscraper projects, the
           product scope would define the features and attributes of the barn and skyscraper. In this
           instance, the project to create a barn would not include creating a flower garden, a wading
           pool, and the installation of a fence, just as the skyscraper project likely wouldn't include
           a neighboring park. There would be specific requirements regarding the features and
           characteristics of each project: the materials to be used, the dimensions of the space, the
           function of each building, and all the related details that make a skyscraper a skyscraper
           and a barn a barn. The product scope is what the customer of the project envisions.




               The project scope and the product scope are bound to each other. The product
           scope constitutes the characteristics and features of the product that the project creates.
           The end result of the project is measured against the requirements for that product. The
           project scope is the work required to deliver the product. Throughout the project execu-
           tion, the work is measured against the project plan to verify that the project is on track
                                                                    Chapter 5: Managing the Project Scope

                                                                                                    137
to fulfill the product scope. The product scope is measured against requirements, while
the project scope is measured against the project plan.


             EXAM TIP When it comes to project scope management, as is covered in
             the bulk of this chapter, focus on the work required to complete the project
             according to the project plan. The product scope, meanwhile, is specific to the
             deliverable of the project. Just remember, the exam will focus on project scope




                                                                                                            PART II
             management. If you're stumped on a question, consider a huge project scope,
             like the skyscraper project.


Creating the Project Scope Management Plan
Once the project moves from the initiating processes into planning, one of the first plans
to be created is the project scope management plan. This plan defines several things:

     * How the project scope will be defined
     * How the detailed project scope statement will be created
     * How the work breakdown structure will be created
     * How scope verification will happen at the end of each phase and at the end of
       the project
     * How the project scope will be controlled

     The project scope management plan is based first on the details of the project char-
ter. Recall that the project charter authorizes the project within an organization and
defines the general project boundaries and goals. Combined with the project scope
statement, the project management team will also consider the preliminary project
scope statement from our pals in the initiating process group. When the project man-
agement team is ready to begin creating the project scope management plan, they'll
actually rely on five things as inputs to this project management process:

     * Enterprise environmental factors.
     * Organizational process assets.
     * Project charter.
     * Preliminary project scope statement.
     * Project management plan. (This seems redundant, but because the scope
       management plan can be updated, this is an input of the plan that already exists.)

    The project management team can use expert judgment to help them analyze these
five inputs to create the best project scope management plan. Don't get too hyped over
expert judgment; you'll see this term throughout the PMBOK and this book. Expert
judgment is just an approach to use experts, people, and consultants (assuming they're
truly experts--wink, wink) that have exceptional knowledge about the product the
project will be creating. For example, in the skyscraper project, expert judgment could
be world-renowned architects, city planners, union representatives, and more.

               The project management team can also use templates, forms, and standards as part
           of the process to create the project scope management plan. If an organization is com-
           pleting the same type of project over and over, there's no real benefit to starting from
           scratch each time. Instead, they'll logically use previous projects' plans, forms, work
           breakdown structures, and more as part of the current planning.
               You now know that the project scope management plan will be used to define,
           verify, manage, and control the project scope. There are four more juicy facts you need
           to know about this hefty plan:

                * The project scope management plan defines how the official project scope
                  statement will be defined based on the preliminary project scope statement.
                * The project scope management plan defines how the work breakdown structure
                  (WBS) will be created, controlled, and approved. We'll talk about the WBS in
                  more detail later in this chapter.
                * The plan documents the process for scope verification. To clarify, scope
                  verification is the inspection of the project's deliverables by the project
                  customer. The goal of scope verification is to verify that the deliverables
                  are in alignment with the project's goals and then formally accepted.
                * The project scope management plan documents and defines how changes
                  to the project scope will be managed and controlled. This is linked to our
                  conversation in Chapter 4 on integrated change control. As a refresher,
                  integrated change control acknowledges that a change in one knowledge
                  area can affect all of the other knowledge areas.

               The project scope management plan is a subsidiary of the project plan. This plan
           sets the tone for the remainder of the project. As you may have already guessed, the
           larger the project, the more important this plan is. As a general rule, larger projects re-
           quire more detail.


           Defining the Project Scope (PMBOK, Section 5.2)
           A project manager and the project team can't plan how to complete the project until
           they know what it is and exactly what they are trying to complete. That's where the
           project scope statement is needed. Before the project management team can get to the
           good stuff of deciding how the project work will be done, they first must create the
           project scope statement.
               When a project is first initiated, the focus is on what the project will deliver: the prod-
           uct scope. It's all dreamy and blue sky. Now that the project has moved into planning,
           things are tightened through the project scope statement. The project scope statement is
           built on the foundations defined in the project's initiation: major deliverables, prelimi-
           nary project scope statement, constraints, and assumptions. In planning, more informa-
           tion about the exactness of the project's deliverables comes to light through planning,
           research, stakeholder analysis, and product analysis. The wants and needs of the stake-
           holders are considered, and eventually they evolve into the project requirements.
                                                                        Chapter 5: Managing the Project Scope

                                                                                                        139
    The project manager, the project team, and the key stakeholders need to work to-
gether to examine the project for additional constraints and assumptions so that the
project can be planned completely. The key stakeholders are needed, because their in-
sight into the project's deliverables can help the project manager and the project team
define all that the project is to deliver. The key stakeholders help create the scope and
agree on what's out of the project scope. For example, a project to build a Web site may
include the layout, design, and database functionality--all within scope--but the pho-




                                                                                                                PART II
tography needed for the Web site is out of scope. The photography activity may be in an
entirely different project, so it's not relevant to the current scope definition.
    In order to create the project scope, there are five inputs, as Figure 5-1 shows.

     * Organizational process assets.
     * Project charter.
     * Preliminary project scope statement.
     * Project scope management plan.
     * Approved change requests. (Because scope definition takes place during the
       planning process, this is another example of how the iterations of planning
       can cause the scope to change. The first time through the creation of the
       detailed project scope statement, changes to the scope won't exist. Later in
       the project, change requests will likely cause the project management team
       to redefine and update the project scope statement.)

               These five inputs help the project management team work together to define all of
           the project requirements. This isn't a quick or necessarily easy process, but it's vital to
           prepare an accurate and complete project scope statement, or the project will be haunt-
           ed with errors and omissions.

                         EXAM TIP Projects fail in the beginning, not the end. A rushed scope
                         definition will likely cause problems later on in the project. This is the
                         stakeholders' opportunity to define all that they want in the scope. Changes
                         to the scope are easy early in the project, but are much more difficult later in
                         the project because of the work, time, and monies invested.

           Using Product Analysis
           If you were the project manager for a company that wanted to create a new camera, you
           might choose several of your competitors' cameras to study, experiment with, and im-
           prove upon. You'd compare the features and functions of the other cameras in light of
           the requirements and goals of your current project. Product analysis is the study of how
           a thing was made and how it works.
                This approach to create the project scope statement is product analysis. Product analy-
           sis, however, is more than just analyzing a product. It focuses on how it works, the function
           of the product, and what's the most profitable approach to creating the project. There are
           seven flavors of product analysis. Don't be consumed with memorizing these approaches
           for your Certified Associate in Project Management (CAPM) or Project Management Profes-
           sional (PMP) examination; just be topically aware of these product analysis methods.

           Product Breakdown
           This approach breaks down a product much like the project management team breaks
           down the project scope into a WBS. For example, a computer could be broken down into
           the physical components, such as the hard drive, processor, memory, network card, and so
           on. A product breakdown structure illustrates the hierarchical structure of the product.

           Systems Analysis
           This approach studies and analyzes a system, its components, and the relationship of the
           components within the system. For example, a manufacturing company's system for plac-
           ing an order from a customer through delivery may have several steps, from sale to comple-
           tion and interaction between departments on that journey. Systems analysis would study
           the relationship between each component and how the process could be improved, time
           reduced, or practically any variable within the system documented for additional study.

           System Engineering
           This project scope statement creation process studies how a system should work, de-
           signs and creates a system model, and then enacts the working system based on the
           project's goals and the customer's expectations. Systems engineering aims to balance
           the time and cost of the project in relation to the project's scope. A successfully de-
           signed system can be profitable, productive, and create quality that is acceptable with
           the project sponsor and the project customer.
                                                                      Chapter 5: Managing the Project Scope

                                                                                                      141
Value Engineering
This project scope statement creation approach attempts to find the correct level of
quality in relation to a reasonable budget for the project deliverable while still achiev-
ing an acceptable level of performance of the product. Basically, this approach wants
the biggest bang for the project's buck--as long as the bang and the buck create a deliv-
erable that performs as expected. Consider a home remodeling project: the home own-
er could choose silk drapes and gold doorknobs or wool drapes and brass doorknobs




                                                                                                              PART II
and get the same function. Their demand for a quality, grade, and function is in relation
to how much capital they'd like to invest in their home project.

Value Analysis
Like value engineering, this approach examines the functions of the project's product in
relation to the cost of the features and functions. This is where, to some extent, the
grade of the product is in relationship to the cost of the product. Consider Microsoft
Word's features and cost in relation to the features and cost of your computer's Notepad
application. While the price range is broadly different, the functions associated with
Word are far more powerful than those of Notepad.

Functional Analysis
This is the study of the functions within a system, project, or--what's more likely in the
project scope statement--the product the project will be creating. Functional analysis
studies the goals of the product, how the product will be used, and the expectations the
customer has of the product once it leaves the project and moves into operations. Func-
tional analysis may also consider the cost of the product in operations, which is known
as life cycle costing.

Using Alternative Identification
Your customer wants you to install an e-mail system for their organization. They don't
care which solution you and your project team come up with, as long as it's reliable,
easy to manage, and provides a central calendaring system. If you're from the IT world,
I imagine you immediately thought of several different approaches to solving this proj-
ect for your customer. That's alternative identification at its root.
     Alternative identification is more than just differing products that can solve the
customer's problem. It's also examining what solution makes the most economical
sense for the project and for the customer's ongoing support of the product once it's
been created. In the e-mail system, the project manager, project team, and experts would
need to examine how the customer will use all of the different aspects of the e-mail
system, their long-term goals for the system, and what their budget for the project and
any ongoing maintenance of the system would be.
     To do alternative identification, the project management team will do research, brain-
storming, and lateral thinking. Their focus is to identify all of the feasible alternatives to
the project's deliverable or even components within the project. Alternative identification
also broaches a quality topic: grade. Grade is the ranking of materials or service, such as
first class versus coach or plywood versus oak wood. We'll see this again in Chapter 8.
CAPM/PMP Project Management Certification All-in-One Exam Guide

           Using Stakeholder Analysis
           Stakeholder analysis is almost always involved when it comes to creating the project
           scope statement. It's all about the customer's demands, wishes, and goals for the proj-
           ect. The project management team interviews the stakeholders and categories, priori-
           tizes, and documents what the customer wants and needs. This is fundamental to proj-
           ect management: You and the key stakeholders must be in agreement on what the
           project will create, or the project scope statement cannot be created and approved.
           Without an agreement of what the requirements for acceptance are, the project is mov-
           ing towards inevitable failure.
               Here's another gotcha with stakeholder analysis: If you can't quantify it, if you can't
           measure it, you can't create it. For example, a fast office network isn't quantified. Cus-
           tomer satisfaction isn't quantified. And happy, warm-fuzzy, and good aren't quantified.
           The project scope statement needs to define in exact terms the acceptable ranges for all
           of the project deliverables. Any project requirements must be quantifiable. Here's a
           general rule: if you can measure it, you can quantify it.

                         EXAM TIP A failure to quantify the project objectives is a risk that the
                         project won't achieve the customer's expectations. After all, what's fast and
                         good to you may mean something entirely different to the project customer.

           Examining the Project Scope Statement
           The project scope statement identifies all of the project's deliverables and defines the
           work required to create the deliverables. This document creates a common lexicon and
           understanding of what the project will deliver for all of the project stakeholders. The
           project scope statement clearly states the project's objectives and communicates the
           goals of the project so that all of the project team members, the project sponsor, and
           the key stakeholders are in agreement as to what the project will accomplish.
               The project scope statement also guides the remainder of the project planning pro-
           cesses. Should changes be proposed to the project, the project scope statement helps
           determine if the proposed changes are within or are outside of the project's boundaries.
           A well-written scope can ward off change requests, while a loose, poorly written scope
           is often an invitation for change requests and additional work by the project team.
               So what goes into a project scope statement? Glad you asked! There are a bunch of
           things, which the following sections explain.

           Project Objectives
           These are the measurable goals that determine a project's acceptability by the project
           customer and the overall success of the project. Objectives often include the cost, sched-
           ule, technical, and quality demands. The project objectives can have qualifiers, such as
           United States dollars, less than $4 million, or within 10 percent of the stated budget.

           Product Scope Description
           This is a narrative on what the project is creating as deliverables for the project cus-
           tomer. Early in the project, the product scope may be somewhat vague, but as the proj-
           ect scope is progressively elaborated, the product scope description may be updated to
           reflect its evolution and clarifications.
                                                                    Chapter 5: Managing the Project Scope

                                                                                                    143
             EXAM TIP Progressive elaboration is a Project Management Institute (PMI)
             term to describe an incremental process of redefining and clarifying any facet
             of a project. For example, a house project may start broad, as a three-bedroom,
             two-car garage home and then, through progressive elaboration, all of the
             details down to the kitchen sink and doorknobs are defined.

Project Requirements




                                                                                                            PART II
These are the demands set by the customer, regulations, or the performing organization
that must exist for the project deliverables to be acceptable. Requirements are often
prioritized in a number of ways, from must have, should have, and would like to have.
Basically, a project requirement is what determines the acceptance of the project com-
pletion. We've seen this already with scope verification.

Project Boundaries
A project boundary clearly states what is included with the project and what's excluded
from it. This helps to eliminate assumptions between the project management team
and the project customer. For example, a software programmer may create a new ap-
plication for a customer as part of the project, but the distribution of the software to the
customer's 10,000 computer workstations is defined as out of scope.

Project Deliverables
These are all the things that the project will create. Consider that the project deliver-
ables are more than just the product, but also ancillary deliverables, such as project re-
ports, communications, and lessons learned that the organization may use for future
projects. The documentation and experience within the current project become part of
the organizational process assets for future projects.

Product Acceptance Criteria
The project scope statement components work with the project requirements, but focus
specifically on the product and what the conditions and processes are for formal ac-
ceptance of the product.

Project Constraints
A constraint is anything that limits the project manager's options. Consider a predeter-
mined budget, deadline, resources, or materials the project manager must use within
the project. If you're a project manager for an organization that does work for other
organizations, your contract will likely have contractual constraints. While the project
charter does list constraints, the constraints defined within the scope are generally more
detailed, and often there are more constraints defined in the scope than in the charter.

Project Assumptions
A project assumption is anything that is held to be true but not proven to be true.
Within the scope, the assumptions are defined, as is their impact on the project if an
assumption proves to be false. For example, in construction, there are assumptions that
the warmer seasons will be cooperative for outdoor work. No one can necessarily prove
this, but it's believed to be true based on history. Should, however, the weather not co-

           Initial Project Organization
           The project scope statement identifies the project team and the key stakeholders. In
           some organizations, especially on larger projects, the team organization and structure
           is documented as well.

           Identified Risks
           The project scope statement lists the risks within the project, both positive and nega-
           tive. We'll talk all about risks in Chapter 11.

           Scheduled Milestones
           The project customer may have specific dates when phases of the project should be
           completed. These scheduled milestones are often treated as project constraints.

           Fund Limitation
           Unless you work for an amazing organization with loads of cash to spare, most projects
           have a determined budget in relation to the project scope. There may be a qualifier on
           this budget, such as plus or minus 10 percent, based on the type of cost estimate cre-
           ated. We'll talk about cost estimating in Chapter 7 (hold on to your wallet).

           Cost Estimate
           Got your wallet ready? Cost estimates, like the project scope statement, can evolve as
           more detail becomes available. Early in the project, you're usually forced to offer a
           rough order-of-magnitude estimate of the project's cost. Later, usually after the WBS has
           been created, you offer a tighter estimate, known as a definitive estimate. We'll cover
           estimating, as promised, in Chapter 7.

           Project Configuration Management Requirements
           This part of the project scope statement defines how configuration management and
           change control will perform within the project.

           Project Specifications
           This references the "spec" documents by which the project will abide. The easiest ex-
           ample of this is blueprints for a construction project.

           Approval Requirements
           This documents how the project will be approved. Items such as the project objectives,
           deliverables, and work are all considered.


           Creating the Work Breakdown Structure
           (PMBOK, Section 5.3)
           The WBS is all about the project deliverables. It's a breakdown of the project scope into
           hierarchical deliverables. The WBS takes the project scope and breaks it down into
           smaller, manageable chunks of deliverables. Each layer of the WBS breaks down the
           layer above it into smaller deliverables, until it arrives at the smallest item in the WBS,
           the work package.
                                                                  Chapter 5: Managing the Project Scope

                                                                                                  145
    Figure 5-2 is an example of a simple WBS. The house project has five major catego-
ries of deliverables: project management, paperwork, construction, interior design, and
landscaping. Each of these first-tier deliverables can be broken down again. In Figure
5-2, the construction deliverable has been broken down to a second level consisting of
the basement, first floor, and second floor. Each of these deliverables could be broken
down again to another level, and so on. The smallest item in the WBS is called a work
package, and these elements can be effective estimates for cost and time, monitored and




                                                                                                          PART II
controlled within the project.
    So how deep must the project scope be broken down? There's no right answer,
other than to the level of detail that's appropriate for the project priority, scope, and
objectives. A guideline for WBS breakdown is the "8/80 Rule." This rule recommends
that each work package equate to no more than 80 hours of labor and no less than
eight hours of labor to create the deliverable. Of course, that's just a guideline, not a
regulation. Some projects may call for work packages, such as a quality control result,
that may take far less than eight hours. For your CAPM or PMP exam, know that the
smallest element in the WBS is a work package and that it can be scheduled, estimated
for costs, and then monitored and controlled.

                         EXAM TIP The WBS is primarily about things, not activities. The work
                         package is just a label for the smallest deliverable within the WBS. PMI has
                         lightened their stance on allowing appropriate activities, such as testing, into
                         the WBS. For the most part, activities are in the activity list and are an output
                         of the WBS and activity definition, not items within the WBS.

           Using a WBS Template
           If an organization is doing the same type of project work over and over, they likely
           wouldn't start a WBS from scratch every time. Instead, they'd use a previous, similar
           project as a template for the current one. This is ideal, as most projects within an orga-
           nization have similar life cycles, deliverables, and milestones. A previous project's WBS
           makes an ideal template for the current project, provided they are similar enough. The
           project management team may still need to edit the template, but it's a huge timesaver
           in the long run.
               Other organizations may use a template in the more traditional sense. Just like you
           may have a template for a newsletter, a report, or a memo, an organization could create
           a WBS template of pre-populated WBS deliverables. In Figure 5-2, I included the project
           management deliverables as part of the WBS. Project management deliverables could
           be a common component of every WBS an organization creates, so it'd be ideal to in-
           clude these items in a standard WBS template for all project managers to use.

           Breaking Down the Deliverables
           Horrible joke warning: What's Beethoven doing now? Decomposing.
               All right, so it's not the best joke in the world, but it's relevant. Like Beethoven, the
           project management team will first compose and then decompose. In project manage-
           ment, the project scope statement is first composed and then the scope is broken down
           (or decomposed) into the individual items that the project will create.
               Some items in the WBS may not be available for decomposition because they're far
           off in the future. In these instances, the project management team will break down
           those items as more information regarding the deliverables becomes available. This is
           an example of rolling wave planning. Some projects may elect to create their WBS based
           on the phases within the project, rather than on the total deliverables of the project.
           Either approach is fine, but the following activities are required to break down the proj-
           ect scope into a WBS:

                * Identify the project deliverables and related work.
                * Form the WBS structure.
                * Decompose the upper-tier deliverables into lower-tier deliverables.
                * Create and assign WBS identification codes to the WBS packages. (This is
                  called the code of accounts, and is a numbering system to identify each
                  element within the WBS.)
                * Confirm that the decomposition is appropriate for the type of project.
                                                                   Chapter 5: Managing the Project Scope

                                                                                                   147
Creating the WBS Dictionary
Along with the WBS, there is a WBS dictionary that defines all of the characteristics of
each element within the WBS. The primary documentation of the WBS dictionary is on
the work package, the smallest item in the WBS, but upper-tier deliverables can also be
documented. Each work package in the WBS is cross-referenced in this companion
document and includes the following details where appropriate:




                                                                                                           PART II
     * Code of account identifier and charge number
     * Work package description
     * Statement of work
     * Work package owner or responsible role
     * Schedule milestones
     * Contract information
     * Quality requirements
     * Technical references
     * Associated activities and work packages
     * Schedule
     * Resources
     * Cost

              EXAM TIP Right from the PMBOK: "The approved detailed project scope
              statement and its associated WBS and WBS dictionary are the scope baseline
              for the project." You'll probably see that on an exam in your future.

Verifying the Project Scope (PMBOK, Section 5.4)
Imagine a project to create a full-color, slick catalog for an electronics manufacturer.
The project manager has completed the initiation processes, moved through planning,
and is now executing the project work. The only trouble is that the project manager and
the experts on the project team aren't sharing the work progress with the customer. The
work they are completing is not in alignment with the product description or the cus-
tomer requirements.
     The project team has created a trendy 1950s style catalog with funky green and or-
ange colors, lots of beehive hairdo models, horn-rimmed glasses, and tongue-in-cheek
jokes about "the future" of electronics. The manufacturer wants to demonstrate a pro-
fessional, accessible, current look for its publications. What do you think will happen
if the project manager presents the catalog with his spin rather than following the re-
quest of the customer?
     Scope verification is the process of the project customer accepting the project deliv-
erables. It happens either at the end of each project phase or as major deliverables are
created. Scope verification ensures that the deliverables the project creates are in align-
ment with the project scope. It is concerned with the acceptance of the work. A related
CAPM/PMP Project Management Certification All-in-One Exam Guide
148
           activity, quality control (QC), is concerned with the correctness of the work. Scope
           verification and QC happen in tandem, as the quality of the work contributes to scope
           verification. Poor quality will typically result in scope verification failure.
               Should a project get cancelled before it has completed the scope, scope verification
           is measured against the deliverables to the point of the project cancellation. In other
           words, scope verification measures the completeness of the work up to the cancellation,
           not the work that was to be completed after project termination.
               To complete scope verification, the work must be inspected. Inspection may require
           measuring, examining, and testing the product to prove that it meets the customer's
           requirements. Inspection usually requires the project manager and the customer to in-
           spect the project work for verification, which, in turn, results in acceptance. Depending
           on the industry, inspections may also be known as:

                * Reviews
                * Product reviews
                * Audits
                * Walkthroughs

               Assuming the scope has been verified, the customer accepts the deliverable. This is
           a formal process that requires signed documentation of the acceptance by the sponsor
           or customer. Scope verification can also happen at the end of each project phase or
           when major deliverables within the project are achieved. In these instances, scope veri-
           fication may be conditional, based on the work results. When the scope is not verified,
           the project may undergo one of several actions. It may be cancelled and deemed a fail-
           ure, sent through corrective actions, or put on hold while a decision is made based on
           the project or phase results.

                         EXAM TIP If a project scope has been completed, the project is complete.
                         Resist the urge to do additional work once the project scope has been fulfilled.
                         Also, be cautious of instances where the scope is fulfilled and the product
                         description is exact but the customer is not happy with the product. Technically,
                         for the exam, the project is complete even if the customer is not happy.


           Controlling the Project Scope
           (PMBOK, Section 5.5)
           Scope control is about protecting the project scope from change and, when change
           does happen, managing those changes. Ideally, all requested changes follow the scope
           change control system, which means that change requests must be documented. Those
           changes that sneak their way into the project scope are lumped into that project poison
           category of scope creep. Scope creep is, of course, bad, bad news.
               Corrective actions--those steps taken to move the project back into alignment with
           the project scope--don't require formal change requests, because the project manager
           isn't changing the scope, but rather the work that's outside of the project scope. Correc-
                                                                 Chapter 5: Managing the Project Scope

                                                                                                 149
tive actions are a part of scope control because you're nudging, and sometimes shoving,
work back into alignment with the project scope. The trouble with scope creep and cor-
rective actions is that the project team is doing or fixing work that should never have
entered the scope in the first place--and that means wasted time and dollars. That's one
sure way for a project to be late and over budget.
    Controlling the project scope is also concerned with "influencing the factors that
create project scope changes." That's the PMBOK way of saying that the project man-




                                                                                                         PART II
ager must control the project team and the project stakeholders from doing anything,
absolutely anything, that's outside of the project scope. It also means that the project
management team should capture the customer's vision in planning before much of
the project work begins. For example, it's always easier to make changes on a blueprint
than in construction. Gathering all requirements and creating an accurate project scope
statement can ward off changes during execution.

Using a Change Control System
While it's dreamy and ideal for requirements to be gathered completely before the work
begins, change requests to the project work are still likely. Every project demands a
change control system that defines and controls how changes to the project and to the
product can be approved. The scope management plan defines the change control sys-
tem, its procedure, and how the change decisions can be made--often with a fee just to
entertain the change request. The change control system should be reviewed during the
project kickoff meeting so that all of the stakeholders are aware of the process.
    Change control is part of the project management information system to help con-
trol changes to the project scope. This helps automate the procedure, but doesn't neces-
sarily make approving or denying change requests any easier. The change control system
also considers integrated change control. Integrated change control examines the pro-
posed change and how it affects all of the project's knowledge areas. For example:
    * How does this change affect the project scope?
    * What is the cost of the change?
    * How does this change affect the project schedule?
    * How does this change affect quality?
    * What resources are needed or affected by the change?
    * How does this change affect communications?
    * What risks does this change present?
    * Will procurement be affected by this change?
   The change control system should do several things for the project management team:
    * Document all change requests
    * Track each change request
    * Document approval levels required for a scope change
    * Provide the status of each change request
CAPM/PMP Project Management Certification All-in-One Exam Guide

           Planning for Project Scope Changes
           When a change is presented, part of considering the change involves additional plan-
           ning. The project manager and the project team must reconvene to examine the change
           and how it may affect the project work and the knowledge areas discussed earlier.
           Changes are sometimes unapproved, such as when a project team member takes the
           initiative for a change and does not follow the change control procedures. In these in-
           stances, the project management team must consider the change and examine the vari-
           ance to determine the response.
               Consider a team member who moves the light fixtures in a kitchen construction proj-
           ect by two feet. The team member believes the kitchen would be better lit with the lights
           moved to their new position, but he didn't follow the change control process to make the
           change. Now there is a variance in the scope--a difference between what the specification
           documents called for and what the team member did. The project management team has
           to consider how to manage the variance. Should they redo the work or accept the change
           as the team member has done? If they redo the work, they may lose time and money, but
           they'll be in scope. If they leave the change as is, then they're out of scope.
               Another consideration for all changes is the configuration management system.
           Configuration management documents all of the features and functions of the project's
           product. When a change is requested, the impact on the features and functions of the
           product is documented with the change request before the change is allowed to move
           through the integrated change control process. For example, a change to add French
           doors to a home construction project would need all of the features and functions of
           those French doors so that the true impact on the project's knowledge areas could be
           examined fully. Failure to accurately document the change can lead to assumptions
           proving false, new risks, schedule slippage, and financial costs within the project.

                         EXAM TIP Undocumented change requests should not be considered at
                         all. Change requests must be documented according to the project scope
                         management plan.

           Approving a Change
           It's a safe bet that changes to the project scope will happen during a project. Why do
           change requests happen? And which ones are most likely to be approved? Most change
           requests are a result of:
                * Value-added changes These are changes that will reduce costs. (This is often due
                  to technological advances made since the time the project scope was created.)
                * External events These could be such things as new laws or industry
                  requirements.
                * Errors or omissions Ever hear this one: "Oops! We forgot to include this
                  feature in the product description and WBS!" Errors and omissions can
                  happen to both the project scope, which is the work to complete the project,
                  and the product scope, which is the features and functions of the deliverable,
                  and typically constitute an overlooked feature or requirement.
                                                                  Chapter 5: Managing the Project Scope

                                                                                                  151
     * Risk response A risk has been identified and changes to scope are needed to
       mitigate the risk.

    When change requests are approved, the affects of that change should be docu-
mented throughout the project. The Iron Triangle of Project Management is a good
example: If the project scope increases, then the project schedule and the project costs
will likely need to be changed to reflect these changes. Here are all of the project com-
ponents that will need to be updated to reflect any approved changes to the project:




                                                                                                          PART II
     * Project scope statement
     * Work breakdown structure
     * WBS dictionary
     * Scope baseline
     * Additional requested changes
     * Organizational process assets
     * Project management plan

    Change requests must always follow the change control system, or they are consid-
ered out of scope. As the project manager and the project team discover and report
changes that are out of scope, the project management team must deal with the chang-
es to remove them through corrective actions or incorporate them through the change
control process. Those changes that are incorporated into the project must still be doc-
umented and then reflected in the above project components. No changes sneak by!


Chapter Summary
Project scope management is the ability to complete all of the project's required work--
and only the required work. This means no extras, no favors, and no cutting corners.
The project scope is the focus of the project; it is the necessary work to complete the
project. Project scope management is a tool the project manager uses to determine
what work is in the project and what work is extraneous.
    The project scope management plan will help the project management team deter-
mine how the project scope will be defined, how the WBS will be created, how the scope
will be controlled throughout the remainder of the project, and how the scope will be
verified by the project customer, both at the end of the project and at the end of each
project phase. The project scope management plan makes the project team consider all
of the knowledge areas and how they may be affected by changes to the project scope.
    In order to determine what the project scope actually is, there's plenty of scope
planning. The project manager and the project team must have a clear vision of the
project, the business need for the project, the requirements, and the stakeholder expec-
tations for the project. The end result of the scope planning processes is the project
scope statement. The scope statement says, in no uncertain terms, what is within the
project and what is not. This is a more detailed project scope statement than what's cre-
ated during project initiation.
CAPM/PMP Project Management Certification All-in-One Exam Guide

               For your CAPM or PMP exam, focus on protecting the project scope. This includes
           finding the real purpose of the project so that the scope is in alignment with the identified
           need. Once the scope has been created, the project team, stakeholders, the project sponsor,
           and even the project manager should not change it, unless there is overwhelming evidence
           of why the scope needs to be changed. All changes should be documented and must fol-
           low the change control system as defined in the project scope management plan.

           Key Terms
           8/80 Rule A planning heuristic for creating the WBS. This rule states the work package
           in a WBS must take no more than 80 hours of labor to create and no less than eight
           hours of labor to create.
           Alternative identification A scope definition process of finding alternative solutions
           for the project customer while considering the customer's satisfaction, the cost of the
           solution, and how the customer may use the product in operations.
           Change control system Documented in the scope management plan, this system de-
           fines how changes to the project scope may be allowed.
           Code of accounts A hierarchical numbering system for each item in the WBS. The
           PMBOK is a good example of a code of accounts, as each chapter and its subheadings
           follow a logical numbering scheme. For example, PMBOK 5.3.3.2 identifies an exact
           paragraph in the PMBOK.
           Functional analysis This is the study of the functions within a system, project, or,
           what's more likely in the project scope statement, the product the project will be creat-
           ing. Functional analysis studies the goals of the product, how the product will be used,
           and the expectations the customer has of the product once it leaves the project and
           moves into operations. Functional analysis may also consider the cost of the product in
           operations, which is known as life cycle costing.
           Fund limitation Most projects have a determined budget in relation to the project
           scope. There may be a qualifier on this budget, such as plus or minus 10 percent based
           on the type of cost estimate created.
           Initial project organization The project scope statement identifies the project team
           and the key stakeholders. In some organizations, especially on larger projects, the team
           organization and structure is also documented.
           Product acceptance criteria This project scope statement component works with the
           project requirements, but focuses specifically on the product and what the conditions
           and processes are for formal acceptance of the product.
           Product breakdown A scope definition technique that breaks down a product into a
           hierarchical structure, much like a WBS breaks down a project scope.
           Product scope Defines the product or service that will come about as a result of com-
           pleting the project.
           Product scope description This is a narrative on what the project is creating as a de-
           liverable for the project customer.
                                                                   Chapter 5: Managing the Project Scope

                                                                                                   153
Project assumptions A project assumption is anything that is held to be true but not
proven to be true.
Project boundaries A project boundary clearly states what is included with the proj-
ect and what's excluded from the project. This helps to eliminate assumptions between
the project management team and the project customer.
Project constraints A constraint is anything that limits the project manager's options.




                                                                                                           PART II
Consider a predetermined budget, deadline, resources, or materials the project man-
ager must use within the project--these are all examples of project constraints.
Project objectives These are the measurable goals that determine a project's accept-
ability by the project customer and the overall success of the project. Objectives often
include the cost, schedule, technical requirements, and quality demands.
Project requirements These are the demands set by the customer, regulations, or the
performing organization that must exist for the project deliverables to be acceptable.
Requirements are often prioritized in a number of ways, from must have, should have,
and would like to have.
Project scope This defines all of the work, and only the required work, to complete
the project objectives.
Project scope management plan This project management subsidiary plan controls
how the scope will be defined, how the project scope statement will be created, how the
WBS will be created, how scope verification will proceed, and how the project scope
will be controlled throughout the project.
Schedule milestones The project customer may have specific dates when phases of
the project should be completed. These milestones are often treated as project con-
straints.
Scope creep Undocumented, unapproved changes to the project scope.
Scope verification The formal inspection of the project deliverables, which leads to
project acceptance.
Stakeholder analysis A scope definition process where the project management team
interviews the stakeholders and categorizes, prioritizes, and documents what the project
customer wants and needs. Stakeholder analysis demands quantification of stakeholder
objectives; goals such as "good," "satisfaction," and "speedy" aren't quantifiable.
Systems engineering This project scope statement creation process studies how a sys-
tem should work, designs and creates a system model, and then enacts the working sys-
tem based on the project's goals and the customer's expectations. Systems engineering
aims to balance the time and cost of the project in relation to the scope of the project.
Systems analysis A scope definition approach that studies and analyzes a system, its
components, and the relationship of the components within the system.
Value analysis Like value engineering, this approach examines the functions of the
project's product in relation to the cost of the features and functions. This is where, to
some extent, the grade of the product is in relationship to the cost of the product.

           Value engineering This project scope statement creation approach attempts to find
           the correct level of quality in relation to a reasonable budget for the project deliverable
           while still achieving an acceptable level of performance of the product.
           WBS dictionary A WBS companion document that defines all of the characteristics of
           each element within the WBS.
           WBS template A pre-populated WBS for repetitive projects. Previous projects' WBSs
           are often used as templates for current similar projects.
           Work breakdown structure (WBS) A deliverables-orientated breakdown of the proj-
           ect scope.
           Work package The smallest item in the WBS.

               12. A change has been approved in Marcy's project. All of the following must be
                   updated to reflect the change, except for which one?
                    A. Project scope statement
                    B. WBS

                    D. Defect repair review
               13. A project team member has, on his own initiative, added extra vents to
                   an attic to increase air circulation. The project plan did not call for these
                   extra vents, but the team member decided they were needed based on the
                   geographical location of the house. The project team's experts concur with
                   this decision. This is an example of:
                    A. Cost control
                    B. Ineffective change control
                    C. Self-led teams

               15. You are the project manager for the JHG Project. Your project is to create a new
                   product for your industry. You have recently learned that your competitor is
                   also working on a similar project, but their offering will include a computer-
                   aided program and Web-based tools, which your project does not offer. You
                   have implemented a change request to update your project accordingly. This
                   is an example of which of the following?
                    A. A change due to an error and omission in the initiation phase
                    B. A change due to an external event
                    C. A change due to an error or omission in the planning phase
                    D. A change due to a legal issue
               16. You are the project manager of a large project. Your project sponsor
                   and management have approved you to outsource portions of the
                                                            Chapter 5: Managing the Project Scope

           Answers
                1. D. The project scope management plan defines the creation of the detailed
                   project scope statement. A, the charter, does include the preliminary project
                   scope statement, but not the detailed one the project scope management
                   plan defines. B, the project management plan, is a parent of the project scope
                   management plan. C is not a valid plan, so this answer is incorrect. For more
                   information, see the PMBOK, Section 5.1.3.1.
                2. C. You won't need, or likely have at this point, the risk management plan to
                   define the project scope. A, B, and D are incorrect statements, as you'll need
                   the project charter, organizational process assets, and the preliminary project
                   scope statement to define the project scope. For more information, see the
                   PMBOK, Section 5.2.1
                3. A. This is an example of a project constraint. B is incorrect, as this is a
                   requirement, not an assumption. C is incorrect, as project boundaries
                   define things that are within and without the project scope. D is incorrect,
                   as product acceptance criteria is an example of functions and features the
                   product must have to be acceptable to the customer. For more information,
                   see the PMBOK, Section 5.2.3.1.
                4. B. The smallest item in the WBS is called the work package. A, deliverable,
                   may be true to a degree, but B is a more precise answer. C is incorrect, as
                   activities are found in the activity list. D is an invalid WBS term. For more
                   information, see the PMBOK, Section 5.3.2.2.
                5. D. This is a clear example of rolling wave planning. A is incorrect, as
                   decomposition describes the breakdown process of the project scope. B is
                   incorrect, as the 8/80 rule defines the guideline for the amount of labor that
                   should be related to each work package in the WBS. C, Parkinson's Law, is
                   not relevant to this question. Parkinson's Law states that work will expand
                   to fulfill the amount of time allotted to it. For more information, see the
                   PMBOK, Section 5.3.2.2.
                6. A. The WBS numbering scheme is called the code of accounts. B, chart of
                   accounts, is a project management accounting system. C, a WBS template,
                   can be a pre-populated WBS or a WBS from a previous project used to define
                   the current project's WBS. D is incorrect, as the WBS dictionary defines the
                   attributes of each WBS element. For more information, see the PMBOK,
                   Section 5.3.3.
                7. C. The WBS and the WBS dictionary are two of three components of the scope
                   baseline. The approved detailed project scope statement is the third portion
                   of the scope baseline. Choices A, B, and D are all incorrect, as they accurately
                   define the scope baseline. For more information, see the PMBOK, Section
                   5.3.3.4.

 8. B. Scope verification leads to one thing: formal acceptance of the complete
    project scope. A, C, and D are incorrect choices, as defect repair, rework, and
    inspection are not outputs of scope verification. For more information, see the
    PMBOK, Section 5.4.
 9. A. Inspection is the only tool and technique used during scope verification.
    B, quality control, is tempting, but this is not a correct choice for scope
    verification. C and D are incorrect as well, as these two choices are not used




                                                                                                       PART II
    during the scope verification process. For more information, see the PMBOK,
    Section 5.4.2.1.
10. C. Undocumented changes are examples of scope creep. A, gold plating,
    is when the project team adds changes to consume the project budget. B
    and D, scope control defect and improvised scope composition, are not
    valid change management terms. For more information, see the PMBOK,
    Section 5.5.
11. A. The only system that defines how project and product scope can be
    changed is the project scope change control system. B, the project integrated
    management system, is not a valid term. C, the project management
    information system, is the parent system of the project scope change control
    system. D, change control, is a process not a system. For more information,
    see the PMBOK, Section 5.5.
12. D. Defect repair and its review do not require a change request, so this choice
    is correct. Choices A, B, and C, the project scope statement, the WBS, and the
    WBS dictionary, do require updates when change requests are approved. For
    more information, see the PMBOK, Section 5.5.3.
13. B. Even though the change is agreed upon, this is an example of ineffective
    change control. The team member should follow the change control process
    as defined in the project scope management plan. Choices A, C, and D are
    incorrect choices. For more information, see the PMBOK, Section 5.5.2.
14. B. While corrective actions do not require change requests, they are an output
    of scope control. This is because the project team may be doing work outside
    of the project scope. Corrective action would stop the extraneous work and
    bring the project team member's actions back into the work within the project
    scope. A, C, and D are not outputs of scope control. For more information,
    see the PMBOK, Section 5.5.3.6.
15. B. This is a change due to an external event, the event being the product your
    competitor has in their project. This is not an example of an error or omission
    in the initiation phase, so A is incorrect. C is incorrect, as this is not an error
    or omission in the planning phase, but a response to a competitor. D is
    incorrect, as this is not a legal issue. For more information, see the PMBOK,
    Section 5.5.1.6 and Section 4.4.1.4.

               16. B. If a change to the project scope affects the procured work, the project
                   manager must consider the contract. This is because the change may affect the
                   existing contract the project manager and the vendor have entered into. While
                   the project sponsor and the vendor are likely to be involved with the change,
                   the contractual agreements override all other internal systems. D, the cause of
                   the change request, is not as relevant as the contract. For more information,
                   see the PMBOK, Section 5.5.2.1.
               17. D. The project scope statement defines the project deliverables and the
                   associated work to create those deliverables. A is incorrect, as the project
                   scope statement, the WBS, and the WBS template are considered to be project
                   scope baseline. B is incorrect; the project scope statement does define the
                   requirements for every project, but is project-specific. C is incorrect; the
                   project scope statement does not define the roles and responsibilities of
                   the project. For more information, see the PMBOK, Section 5.2.3.1.
               18. C. The project scope statement can help the project management team
                   determine if a proposed change is within or without the project boundaries.
                   A, B, and D are correct statements, but they do not answer the question in
                   regards to the importance of the project scope statement. For more information,
                   see the PMBOK, Section 5.2.3.
               19. A. Blueprints are an example of the project specifications. B is incorrect, as this
                   is not an example of approval requirements. C is incorrect, as this is not an
                   example of a constraint. D is also incorrect, as the blueprints are not examples
                   of initially defined risks. For more information, see the PMBOK, Section 5.2.3.1.
               20. A. Project scope management is primarily concerned with defining and
                   controlling what is and is not included in the project. Choices B, C, and D
                   are all incorrect statements. For more information, see the PMBOK, Chapter 5

    Managing Project Time
                                                                                CHAPTER


                                                                                               6
    In this chapter, you will
       * Define the project activities
       * Sequence the project activities
       * Estimate the resources for the defined activities
       * Estimate how long the activities will take to complete
       * Develop the project schedule
       * Control the project schedule




 Time has a funny way of slipping up on you--and then easing on by. As a project man-
 ager, you've got stakeholders, project team members, and management all worried
 about your project deliverables, how the project is moving forward, and when, oh
 when, the project will be done. You've also got vacations, sick days, demands from
 other project managers, and delays from vendors to deal with.

     Management frets over how much a project will cost. Project customers fret over the
 deliverables the project will create. Everyone, as it turns out, frets over how long the
 project will take. Of course I'm talking about the triple constraints of project manage-
 ment: cost, scope, and time. If any one of these constraints is out of balance with the
 other angles, the project is likely not going to succeed. Time, as it happens, is often the
 toughest of the three angles to manage, because interruptions come from all sides of
 the project.
     Your Project Management Institute (PMI) exam and this chapter will focus on six
 key project management activities within the confines of project time management.
 The activities within project time, like much of project management, are interdepen-
 dent on one another and on other processes in the project management life cycle.
     Of course, there's no time like the present, so let's get into project time management
 right now!

           Defining the Project Activities
           (PMBOK, Section 6.1)
           When a project is first initiated, project managers often drift immediately to the labor
           and activities that will be required to complete the project work. The trouble with mov-
           ing right to the work that needs to be done to create the project scope is that the focus
           is on the labor and not on the scope first. In Chapter 5, I discussed the project scope
           and the work breakdown structure (WBS)--these are predecessors to defining the proj-
           ect activities. For your PMI examination, here's the sequence of events that the project
           manager should have in place to get to the work the project team will complete:

                * Project scope statement                         * Work packages
                * Work breakdown structure                        * Schedule activities
                * WBS dictionary

                The work package, the smallest item in the WBS, is broken down into schedule ac-
           tivities, which include the labor to create the things defined in the WBS. The WBS, of
           course, reflects the project scope statement. While the preceding list is the logical se-
           quence of how the project management team will work together to create the activity
           list, there are actually six inputs to activity definition:

                * Enterprise environmental factors                * Work breakdown structure
                * Organizational process assets                   * WBS dictionary
                * Project scope statement                         * Project management plan

               These six inputs and the order of precedence mentioned earlier will help the project
           management define the activities needed to complete the project scope. We're still in
           the planning process group, so this process is iterative. Any changes to the project scope
           will likely cause the project management team to revisit these processes throughout the
           project.

           Defining the Project Activities
           You and your project team are armed with the six inputs I've listed previously and are
           ready to start defining the activities in order to create the project scope. Sounds like fun,
           huh? This process and its complexity will be in proportion to the size of the project
           scope. In other words, larger projects require more detail and more planning time, while
           smaller projects, like changing all the keyboards in your company, won't be all that spe-
           cial or too time-consuming to plan. My advice to you--the Certified Associate in Project
           Management (CAPM) or Project Management Professional (PMP) candidate--on your
           exam is to think of the largest project you can imaging, such as creating a skyscraper, and
           then you'll see the reason to use all or most of these project processes.
                Let's take a look at the methods used to define the project activities, which the fol-
           lowing sections explain in detail.
                                                                        Chapter 6: Managing Project Time

                                                                                                   163
Decomposing the Work Packages
Yep, more decomposition. You know that the project scope is decomposed into deliv-
erables and then those deliverables are continued to be decomposed into work pack-
ages. Work packages, of course, are the smallest item in the WBS. Now that you and
your project team are focused on defining the project activities, you'll be breaking down
the work packages into the labor needed to create each work package.
    Some project managers follow a sequential pattern to this process. First, they'll de-




                                                                                                           PART II
compose the project scope into first-tier deliverables, then decompose those project
deliverables into second-tier deliverables, and so on, until they've created the work
packages. Armed with the work packages, they'll decompose those into the schedule
activities we're discussing here. Other project managers will decompose the project
scope, then the work packages, and then create the schedule activities in one swoop.
    Either approach, in fact, is just fine--even with our pals at PMI. Complete decom-
position of the project scope down to the schedule activities is needed--how you get
there doesn't matter. It only matters that all of the work packages are decomposed and
that the project management team follows the internal policies and procedures (if they
exist) to create the schedule activities.

             EXAM TIP Use a logical approach to defining the activities: project scope
             statement, WBS, work packages, and then schedule activities.

Relying on Templates
Who wants to start a project from scratch when you've got an older, similar project just
waiting to be manipulated? That older, similar project is a template. Sometimes, in the
project management world, we think of a template as an empty shell with pre-popu-
lated fields and deliverables. In PMI's world, a template is an older, similar project that
can be used and updated for the current project.
    A project manager can use a standard activity list if the project work is similar to
past projects. There's no real advantage to starting from scratch. Templates can include
more than just the activity list, but also the resource skills, estimated hours of effort,
risks, deliverables, and any relevant project work information.

             EXAM TIP Think of templates as past project files that can be manipulated
             and used for the current project.

Using Rolling Wave Planning
Have you ever done "the wave" at a football game? You can see the wave moving to-
wards you from across the stadium, and then you're in it, and then it surges past. Roll-
ing wave in project management planning is iterations of planning the work and then
doing the project work. Progressive elaboration, which you use to create the WBS and
the WBS dictionary, is an example of rolling wave planning.
     Rolling wave planning considers the big picture of what the project scope will cre-
ate, but focuses on the short-term activities to move the project along. Figure 6-1 shows
how a project to create a piece of software considers all of the project requirements for
CAPM/PMP Project Management Certification All-in-One Exam Guide
164
           the deliverable, but focuses on the immediate activities necessary to complete a portion
           of the deliverable. Once that work is done, the project management team convenes and
           plans how to create the next portion of the project. The team plans, does the work, and
           then reconvenes for more planning.

                         EXAM TIP Rolling wave planning focuses on the immediate while considering
                         the big picture of the project. Which is easier to plan and accomplish: what you
                         must do this week or what you must do during a week a year from now?

           Using Expert Judgment
           Let's face facts. As a project manager, you aren't always the person who knows the most
           about the work that the project centers on. Using expert judgment is working smart, not
           hard. The project manager relies on the project team, subject matter experts, and con-
           sultants to help determine the work that needs to be completed to create the project
           scope. You'll see expert judgment throughout this book and the Project Management
           Body of Knowledge (PMBOK). It's simply leveraging other people's brainpower so that
           the project manager can make the best decisions with regard to the project.

           Creating Planning Components
           Sometimes, there just isn't enough information available in the WBS to determine what
           activities are needed in the activity list. For example, let's say you're building a new
           home for your customer. Your customer knows the dimensions of the kitchen, but
           doesn't know what type of appliances, cabinets, or even the tile that they want to put
           into their deluxe kitchen. This isn't a problem at the beginning of the project, as your
           construction team can get to work building the home, but there will come a date when
           the homeowners must make a decision on the materials and components they'll want
           in their schmancy kitchen.




           Figure 6-1 Rolling wave planning details the imminent work and keeps future work at the high level.
                                                                           Chapter 6: Managing Project Time

                                                                                                      165
    A project manager can use a control account to signal that the kitchen, in this in-
stance, has not yet been fully defined. This management control point signifies that
there are elements within this deliverable of the WBS that have not been planned. The
kitchen may have a budget, but how the budget will be consumed isn't yet known, be-
cause the homeowners haven't decided where in the kitchen they'll spend their monies.
The effort to create the deliverables in the kitchen may also fluctuate based on the type
of materials and deliverables the homeowners elect to include in their kitchen.




                                                                                                              PART II
    Another planning component the project manager can use is a planning package
within the WBS. A planning package comes below the control account in the WBS, but
above the work packages. In our home construction project example, a control account
could capture the kitchen, while planning packages could capture the cabinets; another
could capture the appliances; and the third could capture the planning associated with
the kitchen floor. We know these three things are needed in the kitchen (cabinets, ap-
pliances, and floor), but we don't know exactly what schedule activities are needed
because not enough information is yet known.

Examining the Activity List
The primary output of decomposing the work is the activity list, which is a collection of
all the work elements required to complete the project. The activity list is actually an
extension of the WBS, and will serve as a fundamental tool in creating the project
schedule. The activity list is needed to ensure that all the deliverables of the WBS are
accounted for and that the necessary work is mapped to each work package.
     The activity list also ensures that there is no extra work included in the project. Extra
work costs time and money--and defeats the project scope. The WBS is comprised of
all of the components the project will create, while the activities list is made up of all
the work required to create the components within the WBS. In addition, the work on
the activity list includes attributes of each identified activity. This ensures three things:

     * That the team members are in agreement on what the work package accomplishes
     * That the work supports and creates the WBS deliverables
     * That the work is within the project scope

Documenting the Activity Attributes
Every activity in the activity list has attributes that must be documented. The documenta-
tion of the activities' characteristics will help with additional planning, risk identification,
resource need, and more. Of course, the activities and depth of the attributes will vary by
project discipline. For your PMI exam, here are some attributes you should consider:

     * Activity identifier
     * Activity codes
     * Activity description
     * Predecessor and successor activities
     * Logical relationships
     * Leads and lags
CAPM/PMP Project Management Certification All-in-One Exam Guide
166
                * Resource requirements
                * Imposed dates
                * Constraints and assumptions
                * Responsibility of the project team member(s) completing the work
                * Location of the work
                * Type and amount of effort needed to complete the work

           Updating the Work Breakdown Structure
           When creating the activity list, the project team and the project manager may discover
           discrepancies or inadequacies in the existing WBS. Updates to the WBS allow the proj-
           ect manager to ensure that all the needed project deliverables are included in the WBS
           and then map the discovered deliverables to the identified work in the activity list.
               In addition, the elements within the WBS may not be defined fully or correctly.
           During the decomposition of the work, elements of the WBS may need to be updated
           to reflect the proper description of the WBS elements. The descriptions should be com-
           plete and full and leave no room for ambiguity or misinterpretation. Finally, updates to
           the WBS may also include cost estimates to the discovered deliverables.

                         EXAM TIP Updates to the WBS are called refinements. As the project moves
                         towards completion, refinements ensure that all of the deliverables are accounted
                         for within the WBS. They may also call for, indirectly, updates to the activity list.


           Sequencing the Project Work
           (PMBOK, Section 6.2)
           Now that the activity list has been created, the activities must be arranged in a logical
           sequence. This process calls on the project manager and the project team to identify the
           logical relationships between activities, as well as the preferred relationship between
           those activities. This can be accomplished in a few different ways:

                * Computer-driven There are many different scheduling and project management
                  software packages available. These programs can help the project manager and
                  the project team determine which actions need to happen in what order and with
                  what level of discretion.
                * Manual process In smaller projects, and on larger projects in the early
                  phases, manual sequencing may be preferred. An advantage of manual
                  sequencing is that it's easier to move around dependencies and activities
                  than in some programs.
                * Blended approach A combination of manual and computer-driven
                  scheduling methods is fine. It's important to determine the finality of the
                  activity sequence, however. Sometimes, a blended approach can be more
                  complex than relying on just one or the other.
                                                                       Chapter 6: Managing Project Time

                                                                                                  167
Considering the Inputs to Activity Sequencing
Figure 6-2 shows the complete process of activity sequencing. There are many ap-
proaches to completing activity sequencing. Perhaps the best approach, however, is
activity sequencing that involves the entire project team and is not just a solo activity.
    The project manager must rely on the project team and the inputs to activity se-
quencing:




                                                                                                          PART II
     * The activity list As just mentioned, this is the list of actions needed to
       complete the project deliverables.
     * The project scope statement The scope statement is needed, since it may
       influence the sequence of events. For example, in construction, technology, or
       community planning (among other project types), the scope statement may
       include requirements, constraints, and assumptions that will logically affect
       the planning of activity sequencing.
     * Milestones Milestones must be considered and evaluated when sequencing
       events to ensure that all of the work needed to complete the milestones is
       included.
     * Activity attributes Each scheduled activity has attributes that need to be
       documented. For example, the successor and predecessor of each activity,
       the lead and lag information, and the person responsible for completing the
       activity should all be documented. This information is important when it
       comes to schedule development and project control.

Creating Network Diagrams
Network diagrams visualize the project work. A network diagram shows the relation-
ship of the work activities and how they will progress from start to completion. Net-
work diagrams can be extremely complex or easy to create and configure. Most network
diagrams in today's project management environment use an approach called "activity-
on-node" to illustrate the activities and the relationship between those activities. Older
network diagramming methods used "activity-on-arrows" to represent the activities
and their relationships.

           Using the Precedence Diagramming Method
           The precedence diagramming method (PDM) is the most common method of arrang-
           ing the project work visually. The PDM puts the activities in boxes, called nodes, and
           connects the boxes with arrows. The arrows represent the relationship and the depen-
           dencies of the work packages. The following illustration shows a simple network dia-
           gram using PDM.

                                                                          D

                                                              F       H

                                                              G




                         EXAM TIP PDM is also known as AON--activity-on-node. It's the most
                         common approach to network diagramming, since it's used by most project
                         management information systems, but can also be done manually.

              Relationships between activities in a PDM constitute one of four different types (as
           shown in Figure 6-3):

                * Finish-to-start (FS) This relationship means that Task A must be completed
                  before Task B can begin. This is the most common relationship. For example,
                  the foundation must be set before the framing can begin.
                * Start-to-start (SS) This relationship means that Task A must start before Task
                  B can start. This relationship allows both activities to happen in tandem. For
                  example, a crew of painters is painting a house. Task A is to scrape the flecking
                  paint off the house, and Task B is to prime the house. The workers scraping the
                  house must start before the other workers can begin priming the house. All of
                  the scraping doesn't have to be completed before the priming can start, just
                  some of it.
                * Finish-to-finish (FF) This relationship means that Task A must be
                  completed before Task B is completed. Ideally, the two tasks should finish
                  at exactly the same time, but this is not always the case. For example, two
                  teams of electricians may be working together to install new telephone cables
                  throughout a building by Monday morning. Team A is pulling the cable to
                  each office. Team B, meanwhile, is connecting the cables to wall jacks and
                  connecting the telephones. Team A must pull the cable to the office so that
                  Team B can complete their activity. The activities need to be complete at nearly
                  the same time, by Monday morning, so that the new phones are functional.
                                                                       Chapter 6: Managing Project Time

                                                                                                  169
     * Start-to-finish (SF) This relationship is unusual and is rarely used. It requires
       that Task A start so that Task B may finish. Such relationships may be encountered
       in construction and manufacturing. It is also known as just-in-time (JIT)
       scheduling. An example is a construction of a shoe store. The end of the
       construction is soon, but an exact date is not known. The owner of the shoe
       store doesn't want to order the shoe inventory until the completion of the
       construction is nearly complete. The start of the construction tasks dictates




                                                                                                          PART II
       when the inventory of the shoes is ordered.

Using the Arrow Diagramming Method
The arrow diagramming method (ADM) approach to activity sequencing uses arrows to
represent the activities. The arrows are "connected" on nodes. ADM only uses finish-to-
start relationships. In some instances, dummy activities are required to express the
logical relationship between two activities. A dummy activity is illustrated with a dashed
arrow between the nodes. The following illustration is a simple example of an ADM
network diagram.




   ADM is an example of "activity-on-arrow" (AOA) networks. This approach is not as
popular as PDM, but may still be prevalent in some industries. ADM can be created
manually or through a project management information system (PMIS).

Utilizing Network Templates
Just as a project manager can rely on WBS templates, there may be network templates
available to streamline the planning process or to conform to a predetermined stan-
dard. Network templates can represent an entire project, if appropriate, although por-
tions of a network template, such as the required project management activities, are
common.

           Figure 6-3
           Task relationships
           can vary, but finish-
           to-start is the most
           common.




               The portions of a network template are also known as subnets or fragnets. Subnets
           are often associated with repetitive actions within a network diagram. For example,
           each floor in a high-rise apartment building may undergo the same or similar actions
           during construction. Rather than complete the network diagram for each floor, a subnet
           can be implemented.

           Determining the Activity Dependencies
           The progression of the project is built on the sequence of activities. In other words,
           predecessor activities must be complete before successor activities can begin. The fol-
           lowing are the dependencies you should know for your CAPM or PMP exam:
                 * Mandatory dependencies These dependencies are the natural order of
                   activities. For example, you can't begin building your house until your
                   foundation is in place. These relationships are called hard logic.
                 * Discretionary dependencies These dependencies are the preferred order of
                   activities. Project managers should use these relationships at their discretion
                   and document the logic behind the decision. Discretionary dependencies allow
                   activities to happen in a preferred order because of best practices, conditions
                   unique to the project work, or external events. For example, a painting project
                   typically allows the primer and the paint to be applied within hours of each
                   other. Due to the expected high humidity during the project, however, all of
                   the building will be completely primed before the paint can be applied. These
                   relationships are also known as soft logic, preferred logic, or preferential logic.
                 * External dependencies As the name implies, these are dependencies outside
                   of the project's control. Examples include the delivery of equipment from a
                                                                         Chapter 6: Managing Project Time

                                                                                                    171
        vendor; the deliverable of another project; or the decision of a committee,
        lawsuit, or expected new law.

Considering Leads and Lags
Leads and lags are values added to work packages to slightly alter the relationship be-
tween two or more work packages. For example, a finish-to-start relationship may exist
between applying primer to a warehouse and applying the paint. The project manager




                                                                                                            PART II
in this scenario has decided to add one day of lead time to the work package painting
the warehouse. Now the painting can begin one day before the priming is scheduled to
end. Lead time is considered a negative value, because time is subtracted from the
downstream activity to bring it closer to the start of the project.
    Lag time is waiting time. Imagine a project to install wood floors in an office build-
ing. Currently, there is a finish-to-start relationship between staining the floors and
adding a layer of shellac to seal them. The project manager has elected, because of the
humidity in the building, to add two days of lag time to the downstream activity of
sealing the floors. Now the shellac cannot be applied immediately after the stain, but
must wait two additional days. Lag time is considered a positive value, since time is
added to the project schedule.
    The following illustration shows the difference be-
tween lead and lag times. Leads and lags must be con-
sidered in the project schedule, since an abundance of
lag time can increase the project's duration. An abun-
dance of lead time, while decreasing duration, may
increase risks.

             EXAM TIP Lead time is always "hurry-up time" and is negative time because
             the work is moving closer to the project start date. Lag time is always waiting
             time and is considered positive time because the project manager is adding
             time to the project schedule.


Estimating the Project Resources
(PMBOK, Section 6.3)
Resources include materials, equipment, and people. After the project manager and the
project team have worked together to determine the sequence of the activities, they now
have to determine which resources are needed for each activities, as well as how much of
each resource. As you can guess, resource estimating goes hand-in-hand with cost esti-
mating (which we'll discuss in Chapter 7). After all, if you need a metric ton of pea gravel,
that's a resource estimate, but someone's got to pay for that metric ton of pea gravel.
    In order to estimate the demand for the project resources, you'll need several inputs:

     * Enterprise environmental factors.
     * Organizational process assets.
     * Activity list.
CAPM/PMP Project Management Certification All-in-One Exam Guide
172
                * The attributes of each activity.
                * The availability of the resources you'll need in the form of two calendars:
                   * Resource calendars let you know when individual resources are available.
                     This calendar tells you when Bob has scheduled a vacation, when a piece
                     of equipment that your project needs is already scheduled for use, and even
                     when facilities like meeting rooms are available.
                   * Project calendars communicate when the project work may take place. For
                     example, your project may allow work to happen between 6 a.m. and 6 p.m.,
                     Monday through Friday. Your project calendar will also identify any holidays
                     when the project work won't happen.
                * Project management plan.

           Using Expert Judgment
           The project manager and the project team have worked together to create the WBS, the
           activity list, and the sequence of activities, so it makes sense that they'll continue to
           work together to create the resource estimates. And they do. According to the PMBOK,
           the project management team may work with experts to help make the best decisions.
           This is using the old standby, "expert judgment," when the project manager relies on
           someone smarter to help make the best decision.

           Identifying Alternatives
           As the project management team determines what resources are needed, there will be
           plenty of opportunities to determine which solution is the best solution for the project.
           Whenever more than one solution is presented, this is called alternative identification.
           Alternative identification comes in many different flavors:
                * Resources: employees or consultants, junior or senior engineers
                * Tools and equipment: power tools or handheld tools, newer versus older
                  machinery
                * Types of materials: oak versus plywood
                * Make or buy decisions: build our own software or buy a solution from a vendor

                         EXAM TIP Alternative identification is used throughout the PMBOK, so
                         you'll likely see this term on the PMP exam. Whenever you have two feasible
                         choices for a component in your project, you're working with alternative
                         identification.

           Relying on Published Estimating Data
           If you are a project manager in construction, the cost of the labor you use, the materials
           you routinely work with, and seasonal factors you consider for each project typically
           vary, depending on what part of the country, or even the world, your project is operat-
           ing within. Many companies provide estimating data on the resources your project can
           purchase based on the geographical locales the project takes place in, supply and de-
                                                                           Chapter 6: Managing Project Time

                                                                                                      173
mand, and the season of your purchases. Published estimating data helps the project
management team determine an exact cost of the resources the project will utilize.

Using Bottom-Up Estimating
Every time I mention bottom-up estimating in one of my seminars, someone snickers
and pantomimes drinking a shot of booze. Ha-ha.
    Bottom-up estimating is the most accurate time and cost estimating approach a




                                                                                                              PART II
project manager can use. This estimating approach starts at "the bottom" of the project
and considers every activity, its predecessor and successor activities, and the exact
amount of resources needed to complete each activity. Bottom-up estimating accounts
for all of the resources needed to complete all of the project work. While it is the most
accurate estimating approach, it is also the most time-consuming.

            EXAM TIP You'll see bottom-up estimating again in Chapter 7, which examines
            cost estimating. In order to complete bottom-up estimating, especially for costs, a
            WBS must be present. Bottom-up estimating for costs is also known as creating
            the definitive estimate.

Examining the Activity Resource Estimates
So what do you get when the project manager, the project team, and all your experts
complete the activity resource process? You get the requirements for all the project re-
sources. Not a trick question! The process allows the project manager, the project team,
management, and your key stakeholders to see the needed resources to complete each
work package in the WBS. Specifically, at the end of this process you'll have:
     * Resource requirements for each activity You'll know what resources are
       needed, the assumption your project management team used to create the
       requirements, and the basis for each estimate.
     * Updates to the activity attributes You may have errors and omissions,
       change requests, and discoveries about and around the activities that you're
       estimating. If the activities or their attributes change, you'll have to update
       your original activity list to reflect these changes.
     * Resource breakdown structure This is a hierarchical breakdown of the
       project resources by category and resource type. For example, you could have
       a category of equipment, a category of human resources, and a category of
       materials. Within each category, you could identify the types of equipment
       your project will use, the types of human resources, and the types of materials.
     * Resource calendar updates You know that the resource calendar identifies
       when the resources are working or idle. Updates to the calendar are based on
       the creation of the activity resource requirements. If change requests enter the
       project, the resource availability and demand may shift, which could affect the
       resource calendar.
     * Change requests Resource estimating can cause change requests. All change
       requests must be documented and follow the integrated change control process
       (discussed in Chapter 4).

           Estimating Activity Durations
           (PMBOK, Section 6.4)
           How many times have you heard management ask, "Now how long will all of this
           take?" All the time, right? And maybe right after that: "How much will all of this cost?"
           We'll talk about cost estimates in Chapter 7. For now, let's talk about time.
               The answer to the question "How long will it take?" depends on the accuracy of the
           estimates, the consistency of the work, and other variables within the project. The best a
           project manager can do is create honest estimates based on the information he's been
           provided. Until the schedule is finalized, no one will know the duration of the project.
               The tasks are first identified, the sequencing of the activities takes place, resources are
           defined, and then durations are estimated. These activities are required to complete the
           project schedule and the estimated project duration. These four activities are iterated as
           more information comes available. If the proposed schedule is acceptable, the project
           can move forward. If the proposed schedule takes too long, the scheduler can use a few
           strategies to compress the project. We'll discuss the art of scheduling in a few moments.
               Activity duration estimates, like the activity list and the WBS, don't come from the
           project manager--they come from the people completing the work. They may also un-
           dergo progressive elaboration. In this section, we'll examine the approach to completing
           activity duration estimates, the basis of estimates, and allow for activity list updates.

           Considering the Activity Duration Estimating Inputs
           The importance of accurate estimates is paramount. The activity estimates will be used
           to create the project schedule and predict when the project should end. Inaccurate esti-
           mates could cost the performing organization thousands of dollars in fines, missed
           opportunities, lost customers, or worse. To create accurate estimates, the project man-
           ager and the project team will rely on several inputs:
                * Activity lists You know this, right? Activity lists are the work elements
                  necessary to create the deliverables.
                * The project scope statement Identification of the project constraints and
                  assumptions is needed, since they may influence the estimates. The project
                  scope statement provides this information.
                * Activity resource requirements Activity resource requirements define the
                  resources that are needed to complete a particular activity. For example, a
                  project to build a home will require lots of different resources: plumbers,
                  electricians, architects, framers, and landscapers. The project manager would
                  not, however, assign all of the different resources to every task, but only to the
                  tasks that the resource was qualified to complete. Remember that resources
                  also include equipment and materials, so those are identified as part of the
                  activity resource requirements as well.
                * Activity attributes Effort is the amount of labor applied to a task. Duration, on
                  the other hand, is how long the task is expected to take with the given amount of
                  labor. For example, a task to unload a freight truck may take eight hours with two
                  people assigned to the task. If the effort is increased by adding more labor to the
                                                                         Chapter 6: Managing Project Time

                                                                                                    175
        task (in this instance, more people), then the duration of the task is decreased.
        Some activities, however, have a fixed duration and are not affected by the
        amount of labor assigned to the task. For example, installing a piece of software
        on a computer will take the same amount of time if one computer administrator
        is completing the work or if two computer administrators are doing it.
     * Resource capabilities The abilities of the project team members must be
       taken into account. Consider a task in an architectural firm. Reason says that




                                                                                                            PART II
       if a senior architect is assigned to the task, he will be able to complete it faster
       than if a junior architect were assigned to the same job. Material resources
       can also influence activity time. Consider predrilled cabinets versus cabinets
       that require the carpenter to drill each cabinet as it's installed. The predrilled
       cabinets allow the job to be completed faster.
     * Organizational process assets Okay, the big one here is historical information.
       Historical information is always an excellent source of information on activity
       duration estimates. It can come from several sources, such as the following:
        * Historical information can come from project files on other projects within
          the organization.
        * Commercial duration estimating databases can offer information on how
          long industry-specific activities should take. These databases should take
          into consideration the materials, the experience of the resources, and define
          the assumptions the predicted work duration is based upon.
        * Project team members may recollect information regarding the expected
          duration of activities. While these inputs are valuable, they are generally
          less valuable than documented sources, such as other project files or the
          commercial databases.
     * The project management plan Specifically, the project manager and the
       project team must evaluate the risk register. We'll discuss risk in detail in
       Chapter 11. Risks, good or bad, can influence the estimated duration of
       activities. The risks on each activity should be identified, analyzed, and then
       predicted as to their probability and impact. If risk mitigation tasks are added
       to the schedule, the mitigation activities will need their duration estimated
       and then sequenced into the schedule in the proper order. The project activity
       cost estimates, if they exist yet, should also be referenced during activity
       duration estimates to determine the most cost-effective amount of labor or
       resources to apply to any given activity.

Using Analogous Estimating
Analogous estimating relies on historical information to predict what current activity
durations should be. Analogous estimating is also known as top-down estimating and
is a form of expert judgment. To use analogous estimating, activities from the historical
project that are similar in nature are used to predict what similar activities in the current
project will take place.
     A project manager must consider if the work has ever been done before and, if so,
what help the historical information provides. The project manager must consider the
CAPM/PMP Project Management Certification All-in-One Exam Guide
176
           resources, project team members, and equipment that completed the activities in the
           previous project compared to the resources available for the current project. Ideally, the
           activities should be more than similar; they should be identical. And the resources that
           completed the work in the past should be the same resources used in completing the
           current work. When the only source of activity duration estimates is the project team
           members, instead of expert judgment and historical information, your estimates will be
           uncertain and inherently risky.

                         EXAM TIP Analogous estimating uses historical information and is more
                         reliable than predictions from the project team members.

           Applying Parametric Estimates
           Quantitatively based durations use mathematical formulas to predict how long an ac-
           tivity will take based on the "quantities" of work to be completed. For example, a com-
           mercial printer needs to print 100,000 brochures. The workers include two pressmen
           and two bindery experts to fold and package the brochures. Notice how the duration is
           how long the activity will take to complete, while the effort is the total number of hours
           (labor) invested because of the resources involved. The decomposed work, with quan-
           titative factors, is shown in Table 6-1.

                         EXAM TIP Duration is how long an activity takes, while effort is the
                         billable time for the labor to complete the activity. Consider an activity that
                         is scheduled to last 40 hours. The project manager must consider the cost
                         of the person's time assigned to complete the project work--for example,
                         a senior full-time engineer versus a part-time person--at a lower cost. The
                         senior engineer may be able to complete the activity in 40 consecutive work
                         hours, but the cost of this employee's time may be more than the value of
                         the activity. The part-time employee may be able to complete the task in two
                         segments of 20 hours, but her time is billed at a substantially lower rate.

           Creating a Three-Point Estimate
           How confident can a project manager be when it comes to estimating? If the project
           work has been done before in past projects, then the level of confidence in the duration
           estimate is probably high. But if the work has never been done before, there are lots of
           unknowns--and with that comes risk. To mitigate the risk, the project manager can use
           a three-point estimate. A three-point estimate requires that for each activity, optimistic,
           most likely, and pessimistic estimates be created. Based on these three estimates, an
           average can be created to predict how long the activity should take (see Figure 6-4).

                EXAM TIP If you're thinking this sounds familiar to the Program Evaluation
                and Review Technique (PERT), you're correct. The PMBOK Guide,Third Edition
                dropped PERT and replaced it with this nomenclature.You should also note
                that PERT is rarely used in today's project management practices.

Factoring in Reserve Time
Parkinson's Law states: "Work expands so as to fill the time available for its comple-
tion." This little nugget of wisdom is oh-so-true. Consider a project team member who
knows an activity should last 24 hours. The team member decides, in his own wisdom,
to say that the activity will last 32 hours. These extra eight hours, he figures, will allow
plenty of time for the work to be completed should any unforeseen incidents pop up.
The trouble is, however, that the task will magically expand to require the complete 32
hours. Why does this happen? Consider the following:
      * Hidden time Hidden time, the time factored in by the project team member,
        is secret. No one, especially the project manager, knows why the extra time has
        been factored into the activity. The team member can then "enjoy" the extra
        time to complete the task at his leisure.
      * Procrastination Most people put off starting a task until the last possible minute.
        The trouble with bloated, hidden time is that people may wait through the
        additional time they've secretly factored into the activity. Unfortunately, if something
        does go awry in completing the activity, the work result is later than predicted.
      * Demands Project team members may be assigned to multiple projects with
        multiple demands. The requirement to move from project to project can shift
        focus, result in a loss of concentration, and require additional ramp-up time
        as workers shift from activity to activity. The demand for multitasking allows
        project team members to take advantage of hidden time.
CAPM/PMP Project Management Certification All-in-One Exam Guide

                * On schedule Activities are typically completed on schedule or later, but
                  rarely early. Users that have bloated the activity duration estimates may finish
                  their task ahead of when they promised, but they have a tendency to hold
                  on to those results until the activity's due date. This is because workers aren't
                  usually rewarded for completing work early. In addition, workers don't want
                  to reveal the inaccuracies in their time estimates. Workers may believe future
                  estimates may be based on actual work durations rather than estimates, so
                  they'll "sandbag" the results to protect themselves--and finish "on schedule."
               So what's a project manager to do? First off, the project manager should strive to
           incorporate historical information and expert judgment to predicate accurate estimates.
           Second, the project manager should stress a genuine need for accurate duration esti-
           mates. Finally, the project manager can incorporate a reserve time.
               A reserve time is a percentage of the project duration or a preset number of work peri-
           ods, and is usually added to the end of the project schedule. Reserve time may also be
           added to individual activity durations based on risk or uncertainty in the activity duration.
           When activities are completed late, the additional time for the activity is subtracted from
           the reserve time. As the project moves forward, the reserve time can be reduced or elimi-
           nated as the project manager sees fit. Reserve time decisions should be documented.

           Evaluating the Estimates
           The end result of estimating activities provides three things:
                * Activity duration estimates Activity duration estimates reflect how long
                  each work package will take to complete. Duration estimates should include
                  an acknowledgement of the range of variance. For example, an activity whose
                  duration is expected to be one week may have a range of variance of one week
                  plus or minus three days. This means that the work can take up to eight days
                  or as little as two days, assuming a week is five days.
                * Basis of estimates Any assumptions made during the activity estimating
                  process should be identified. In addition, any historical information, subject
                  matter experts, or commercial estimating databases that were used should also
                  be documented for future reference.
                * Activity list updates During the estimating process, there may be discoveries
                  of missing activities within the activity list. The project manager should confirm
                  that the new work packages are reflected in the activity list for the project.


           Developing the Project Schedule
           (PMBOK, Section 6.5)
           The project manager, the project team, and possibly even the key stakeholders, will
           examine the inputs previously discussed and apply the techniques discussed in this sec-
           tion to create a feasible schedule for the project. The point of the project schedule is to
           complete the project scope in the shortest amount of time possible without incurring
           exceptional costs, risks, or a loss of quality.
                                                                         Chapter 6: Managing Project Time

                                                                                                    179
    Creating the project schedule is part of the planning process group. It is calendar-
based and relies on both the project network diagram and the accuracy of time esti-
mates. When the project manager creates the project schedule, she'll also reference the
risk register. The identified risks and their associated responses can affect the sequence
of the project work and when the project work can take place. In addition, if a risk
comes into fruition, the risk event may affect the scheduling of the resources and the
project completion date.




                                                                                                            PART II
Applying Mathematical Analysis
Mathematical analysis is the process of factoring theoretical early and late start dates
and theoretical early and late finish dates for each activity within the project network
diagram (PND). The early and late dates are not the expected schedule, but rather a
potential schedule based on the project constraints, the likelihood of success, the avail-
ability of resources, and other constraints.
     The most common approach to calculating when a project may finish is by using
the critical path method. It uses a "forward" and "backward" pass to reveal which ac-
tivities are considered critical. Activities on the critical path may not be delayed; other-
wise, the project end date will be delayed. The critical path is the path with the longest
duration to completion. Activities not on the critical path have some float (also called
slack) that allows some amount of delay without delaying the project end date.

             EXAM TIP The critical path is used to determine which activities have no
             float.You can also use the critical path to determine the earliest date for when
             the project may be completed. There can be more than one critical path in a
             project, and it's possible for the critical path to change.

Calculating Float in a PND
Float, or slack, is the amount of time a delayed task can postpone the project's comple-
tion. Technically, there are three different types of float:
     * Free float This is the total time a single activity can be delayed without
       affecting the early start of any successor activities.
     * Total float This is the total time an activity can be delayed without affecting
       project completion.
     * Project float This is the total time the project can be delayed without
       passing the customer-expected completion date.
    Most project management software will automatically calculate float. On the CAPM
or PMP exam, however, candidates will be expected to calculate float manually. Don't
worry--it's not too tough. The following describes the process.
    Examine the PND and find the critical path. The critical path is typically the path
with the longest duration and will always have zero float. The critical path is techni-
cally found once you complete the forward and backward passes. Start with the forward
pass. After the backward pass, you can identify the critical and near-critical paths, as
well as float.

                         VIDEO     How to calculate float.


                1. The early start (ES) and early finish (EF) dates are calculated first by completing
                   the forward pass. The ES of the first task is one. The EF for the first task is its
                   ES, plus the task duration, minus one. Don't let the "minus one value" throw
                   you. If Task A is scheduled to last three days, it would only take three days to
                   complete the work, right? The ES is one, the duration is three, and the EF is
                   three, because the activity would finish within three days, not four days. The
                   following illustration shows the start of the forward pass.




                2. The ES of the next task(s) will be the EF for the previous activity, plus one. In
                   other words, if Task A finishes on day eight, Task B will begin on day nine.
                3. The EF for the next task(s) equals its ES plus the task duration, minus one.
                   Sound familiar?
                4. Now each task moves forward with the forward pass. Use caution when there
                   are predecessor activities; the EF with the largest value is carried forward. The
                   following illustration shows the completed forward pass.




                5. After the forward pass is completed, the backward pass starts at the end of the
                   PND. The backward pass is concerned with the late finish (LF) and the late
                   start (LS) of each activity. The LF for the last activity in the PND equals its EF
                   value. The LS is calculated by subtracting the duration of the activity from
                   its LF and then adding one. The one is added to accommodate the full day's
                   work; it's just the opposite of subtracting the one day in the forward pass.
                   Here's a tip: The last activity is on the critical path, so its LS will equal its ES.
                                                                 Chapter 6: Managing Project Time

6. The next predecessor activity's LF equals the LS of the successor activity, minus
   one. In other words, if Task Z has an LS of 107, Task Y will have an LF of 106.
   The following illustration shows the process of the backward pass.




                                                                                                    PART II
7. The LS is again calculated by subtracting the task's duration from the task's LF
   and then adding one. The following shows the completed backward pass.




8. To officially calculate float, the LS is subtracted from the ES and the LF is
   subtracted from the EF. Recall the total float is the amount of time a task can
   be delayed without affecting the project completion date. The next illustration
   shows the completed PND with the float exposed.

           Encountering Scheduling on the CAPM or PMP Exam
           Out here in the real world, where you and I work every day, we likely aren't calculating
           float manually. On your PMI exam, however, you'll need to be able to calculate float.
           Why? You're proving that you understand the theory and application of managing project
           time. On your regular gig, you'll use your project management software to do this magic
           for you. You'll encounter float, scheduling, and critical path activities on the exam. You
           should count these questions as "gimmies" if you remember a few important rules:

                * Always draw out the network diagram presented on your scratch paper. It may
                  be used in several questions.
                * Know how to calculate float. (The complete process was shown earlier in the
                  "Calculating Float in a PND" section.)
                * You may encounter questions that ask on what day of the week a project will
                  end if no weekends or holidays are worked. No problem. Add up the critical
                  path, divide by 5 (Monday through Friday), and then figure out which day of
                  the week the activity will end on.
                * You may see something like Figure 6-5 when it comes to scheduling. When
                  three numbers are presented, think three-point estimate. Optimistic is the
                  smallest number and pessimistic is the largest, so most likely, it's somewhere
                  between the two. When a number is positioned directly over the tasks, it is the
                  task duration. When a number is positioned to the upper-right of a task, this
                  represents the EF date.

           Applying Duration Compression
           Duration compression is also a mathematical approach to scheduling. The trick with
           duration compression, as its name implies, is calculating ways the project can get done
           sooner than expected. Consider a construction project. The project may be slated to last
           eight months, but due to the expected cold and nasty weather typical of month seven,
           the project manager needs to rearrange activities, where possible, to end the project as
           soon as possible.

     In some instances, the relationship between activities cannot be changed due to
hard or soft logic. The relationships must remain as scheduled. Now consider the same
construction company that is promised a bonus if they can complete the work by the
end of month seven. Now there's incentive to complete the work, but there's also the
fixed relationship between activities.
     To apply duration compression, the performing organization can rely on two different
methods. These methods can be used independently or together, and are applied to ac-




                                                                                                            PART II
tivities or to the entire project based on need, risk, and cost. The methods are as follows:
     * Crashing This approach adds more resources to activities on the critical path
       to complete the project earlier. When crashing a project, costs are added as
       the labor expenses increase. Crashing doesn't always work. Consider activities
       that have a fixed duration and won't finish faster with additional resources.
       The project manager must also consider the expenses in relation to the gains
       of completing on time. For example, a construction company may have been
       promised a bonus to complete the work by a preset date, but the cost incurred
       to hit the targeted date is more than what the bonus offers.
     * Fast tracking This method changes the relationship of activities. With fast
       tracking, activities that would normally be done in sequence are allowed to
       be done in parallel or with some overlap. Fast tracking can be accomplished
       by changing the relation of activities from FS to SS or by adding lead time to
       downstream activities. For example, a construction company could change the
       relationship between painting the rooms and installing the carpet by adding
       lead time to the carpet installation task. Before the change, all of the rooms
       had to be painted before the carpet installers could begin. With the added
       lead time, the carpet can be installed hours after a room is painted. However,
       fast tracking can increase risk and may cause rework in the project. Can't you
       just imagine those workers getting fresh paint on the new carpet?

             EXAM TIP It's easy to remember the difference between these two actions.
             Crashing and cost both begin with C--we're adding resources, and too many
             people will "crash" into each other. Fast tracking is about speeding things up.
             However, haste makes waste, which can be risky.

Using a Project Simulation
Project simulations allow a project manager to examine the feasibility of the project
schedule under different conditions, variables, and events. For example, the project
manager can see what would happen to a project if activities were delayed, vendors
missed shipment dates, or external events affected the project.
     Simulations are often completed with the Monte Carlo analysis. The Monte Carlo
analysis, named after the world-famous gambling city, predicts how scenarios may
work out, given any number of variables. The process doesn't actually churn out a spe-
cific answer, but a range of possible answers. When Monte Carlo is applied to a sched-
ule, it can examine, for example, the optimistic completion date, the pessimistic
completion date, and the most likely completion date for each activity in the project.

                As you can imagine in a typical network diagram, there are likely thousands, if not mil-
           lions, of combinations of tasks that complete early, late, or as expected. Monte Carlo analy-
           sis shuffles these combinations, usually through computer software, and offers a range of
           possible end dates coupled with an expected probability for achieving each end date.
                In other words, Monte Carlo analysis is an odds-maker. The project manager chooses,
           or is at least influenced by, the end date with the highest odds of completion in ratio to the
           demands for completion by an expected time. The project manager can then predict with
           some certainty that the project has an 85 percent chance of completion by a specific date.

                         EXAM TIP Monte Carlo analysis can be applied to more than just scheduling.
                         It can also be applied to cost, project variables, and, most often, risk analysis.

               Simulations also provide time to factor in "what-if" questions, worst-case scenarios,
           and potential disasters. The end result of simulations is to create responses to the fea-
           sible situations. Then, should the situations come into play, the project team is ready
           with a planned response.

           Using Resource-Leveling Heuristics
           First off, a heuristic is a fancy way of saying "rule of thumb." A resource-leveling heuris-
           tic is a method to flatten the schedule when resources are over-allocated. Resource lev-
           eling can be applied using different methods to accomplish different goals. One of the
           most common methods is to ensure that workers are not overextended on activities.
                For example, Sarah is assigned to Task C and Task H, which are planned to happen
           concurrently. Sarah cannot be in two places at once, so resource leveling changes the
           timing of the activities so that Sarah can complete Task C and then move on to Task H.
           As expected, however, resource leveling often extends the project end date.
                Another method for resource leveling is to take resources off of noncritical path
           activities and apply them to critical path activities to ensure that the project end date is
           met. This method takes advantage of available slack and balances the expected duration
           of the noncritical path with the expected duration of the critical path.
                Resource leveling also provides for changing the project schedule to allow for long
           work hours to complete the project work, such as weekends, evenings, or even adding
           a second or third shift to bring the project back in alignment. Another approach, also
           part of resource leveling, is to change the resources, tools, or equipment used to com-
           plete the project work faster. For example, a project manager could request the printer
           to use a different, faster printing press to complete the printing activity than what was
           originally planned for. Of course, these approaches often increase cost.
                Finally, some resources may be scarce to the project. Consider a highly skilled tech-
           nician or consultant who is only available on a particular date to contribute to the
           project. These resources are scheduled from the project end date, rather than the start
           date. This is known as reverse resource allocation scheduling.

           Using the Critical Chain Method
           The critical chain method (CCM) aims to eliminate Parkinson's Law by eliminating
           bottlenecks that hold up project progression. In the critical chain method, deadlines
                                                                          Chapter 6: Managing Project Time

                                                                                                     185
associated with individual tasks are removed and the only date that matters is the
promised due date of the project deliverable. CCM works to modify the project sched-
ule based on the availability of project resources rather than the pure sequence of
events, as in the critical path method.
    CCM first requires the discovery of the critical path, but then applies available re-
sources to determine the true resource-limited schedule. Based on the availability of
resources to complete the project work, the critical path is often different than what it




                                                                                                             PART II
would have been using the pure critical path method.
    CCM scheduling evaluates each activity's latest possible start and finish dates. This
allows project managers to manage the buffer activity duration--that is, the activities
that are not on the critical path--but their completion contributes to the start of critical
path activities. In other words, the focus is on completing each activity in order to com-
plete the entire project by the promised end date.

Using Project Management Software
When it comes to project management software, take your pick: The market is full of them.
Project management applications are tools, not replacements, for the project management
processes. Many of the software titles today automate the processes of scheduling, activity
sequencing, work authorization, and other activities. The performing organization must
weigh the cost of the PMIS against the benefits the project managers will actually see.

Relying on a Project Coding Structure
The coding structure identifies the work packages within the WBS and is then applied
to the PND. This allows the project manager, the project team, experts, and even key
stakeholders, to extract areas of the project to examine, evaluate, and inspect. For ex-
ample, a project to create a catalog for a parts distributor may follow multiple paths to
completion. Each path to completion has its own "family" of numbers that relate to
each activity on the path, as outlined in Table 6-2.

           Considering the Outputs
           of Schedule Development
           After all the challenges of examining, sequencing, and calculating the project activities,
           a working schedule is created. Schedule development, like most of project management's
           planning processes, moves through progressive elaboration. As the project moves for-
           ward, discoveries, risk events, or other conditions may require the project schedule to be
           adjusted. In this section, we'll discuss the project schedule and how it is managed.

           Examining the Project Schedule
           The project schedule includes, at a minimum, a date for when the project begins and a
           date when the project is expected to end. The project schedule is considered proposed
           until the resources needed to complete the project work are ascertained. In addition to
           the schedule, the project manager should include all of the supporting details. Project
           schedules can be presented in many different formats, such as:

                * Project network diagram This illustrates the flow of work, the relationship
                  between activities, the critical path, and the expected project end date. PNDs,
                  when used as the project schedule, should have dates associated with each
                  project activity to show when the activity is expected to start and end.
                * Bar charts These show the start and end dates for the project and the activity
                  duration against a calendar. They are easy to read. Scheduling bar charts are
                  also called Gantt charts.
                * Milestone charts These plot out the high-level deliverables and external
                  interfaces, such as a customer walkthrough, against a calendar. Milestone
                  charts are similar to a Gantt chart, but with less detail regarding individual
                  activities. The following is an example of a milestone chart.
                                                                      Chapter 6: Managing Project Time

                                                                                                 187




                                                                                                         PART II
Utilizing the Schedule Management Plan
The schedule management plan is a subsidiary plan of the overall project plan. It is
used to control changes to the schedule. A formal schedule management plan has pro-
cedures that control how changes to the project plan can be proposed, accounted for,
and then implemented. An informal schedule management plan may consider changes
on an instance-by-instance basis.


Updating the Resource Requirements
Due to resource leveling, additional resources may need to be added to the project. For
example, a proposed leveling may extend the project beyond an acceptable completion
date. To reach the project end date, the project manager elects to add additional re-
sources to the critical path activities. The resources the project manager adds should be
documented, the associated costs accounted for, and everything approved.

           Controlling the Project Schedule
           (PMBOK, Section 6.6)
           Schedule control is part of integrated change management, as discussed in Chapter 4.
           Throughout a typical project, events will happen that may require updates to the proj-
           ect schedule. Schedule control is concerned with three processes:
                * The project manager works with the factors that can cause changes in the
                  schedule in an effort to confirm that the changes are agreed upon. Factors can
                  include project team members, stakeholders, management, customers, and
                  project conditions.
                * The project manager examines the work results and conditions to determine
                  whether the schedule has changed.
                * The project manager manages the actual change in the schedule.

           Managing the Inputs to Schedule Control
           Schedule control, the process of managing changes to the project schedule, is based on
           several inputs:
                * The schedule management plan
                * The schedule baseline
                * Performance reports
                * Change requests

           Applying a Schedule Control System
           A schedule control system is a formal approach to managing changes to the project
           schedule. It considers the conditions, reasons, requests, costs, and risks of making
           changes. It includes methods of tracking changes, approval levels based on thresholds,
           and the documentation of approved or declined changes. The schedule control system
           process is part of integrated change management.

           Measuring Project Performance
           Poor performance may result in schedule changes. Consider a project team that is com-
           pleting a work on time, but all of the work results are unacceptable. The project team
           may be rushing through their assignments to meet their deadline. To compensate for
           this, the project may be changed to allow for additional quality inspections and more
           time for activity completion. Project performance is often based on earned value man-
           agement, which we'll discuss in Chapter 10.

           Examining the Schedule Variance
           The project manager must actively monitor the variances between when activities are
           scheduled to end and when they actually end. An accumulation of differences between
           scheduled and actual dates may result in a schedule variance.
                                                                        Chapter 6: Managing Project Time

                                                                                                   189
    The project manager must also pay attention to the completion of activities on
paths with float, not just the critical path. Consider a project that has eight different
paths to completion. The project manager should first identify the critical path, but
should also identify the float on each path. The paths should be arranged and moni-
tored in a hierarchy from the path with smallest float to the path with the largest float.
As activities are completed, the float of each path should be monitored to identify any
paths that may be slipping from the scheduled end dates.




                                                                                                           PART II
Updating the Project Schedule
So what happens when a schedule change occurs? The project manager must ensure
that the project schedule is updated to reflect the change, document the change, and
follow the guidelines within the schedule management plan. Any formal processes,
such as notifying stakeholders or management, should be followed.
    Revisions are a special type of project schedule change that cause the project start
date and, more likely, the project end date to be changed. They typically stem from
project scope changes. Because of the additional work the new scope requires, addi-
tional time is needed to complete the project.
    Schedule delays, for whatever reason, may be so drastic that the entire project has
to be rebaselined. Rebaselining is a worst-case scenario and should only be used when
adjusting for drastic, long delays. When rebaselining happens, all of the historical infor-
mation up to the point of the rebaseline is eliminated. Schedule revision is the pre-
ferred, and most common, approach to changing the project end date.

             EXAM TIP     You only want to rebaseline in extreme, drastic scenarios.


Applying Corrective Action
Corrective action is any method applied to bring the project schedule back into align-
ment with the original dates and goals for the project end date. Corrective actions are
efforts to ensure that future performance meets the expected performance levels. It in-
cludes the following:

     * Extraordinary measures to ensure that work packages complete as scheduled
     * Extraordinary measures to ensure that work packages complete with as little
       delay as possible
     * Root-cause analysis of schedule variances
     * Implementing measures to recover from schedule delays


Chapter Summary
All projects take time--time to plan the project, do the work, control the work, and con-
firm that the work has been done according to plan. Of course, there are all those other
things that eat into a project's schedule: change request reviews, corrective and preven-
tive actions, defect repair, defect repair review, and scope verification. When a project

           manager first looks at planning the project work, she'll consider, along with her project
           team, all of the activities that will need to be completed based on the project's WBS.
                Once all the project work has been identified and the activity list has been gener-
           ated, it's time to put the activities into the order necessary to reach the project comple-
           tion. This means the activity attributes are considered. Those activities that must happen
           in a particular order are using hard logic, while those activities that don't have to hap-
           pen sequentially can use soft logic. The sequencing of the project activities happens
           with the project management team.
                Putting the activities in the order in which they'll happen leads to the creation of a
           project network diagram. It's pretty. The PND most likely will be using the precedence
           diagramming method--that's where you can clearly identify the predecessors and suc-
           cessors within the project. The relationships between the activities signal the conditions
           that must be true to allow the work to progress.
                Once the work has been organized and visualized, it's time to staff it. This is project
           resource estimating, which also contributes to the cost of the project. Resource utiliza-
           tion considers more than just the people that your project will need, but also the mate-
           rials and equipment. This activity considers the quantity of resources the project
           demands and when the resources are available. This is tricky business in large projects,
           so rolling wave planning may be incorporated into the project.
                Of course, management and the project's stakeholders will want to know how long
           the project work will take to complete. Now that the network diagram has been created
           and the resources have been identified, the project management team can have a more
           accurate estimate of the project's duration. The project manager can use the identified
           labor, which is common, or the project manager can rely on analogous estimating,
           which isn't as accurate as bottom-up estimating. In some instances, the project man-
           ager can also use parametric estimating to predict the project's duration.
                As the project manager examines the network diagram, he'll want to find opportu-
           nities to shift resources and determine where delays will affect the project end date. Of
           course, I'm talking about the critical path--the path with no float and whose activities
           cannot, better not, be delayed, or the project end's date will go beyond what's been
           scheduled. Activities not on the critical path have float and can often be delayed if
           needed. You'll have a few questions on float, and I encourage you to watch the videos
           on the CD to nail down the float process.
                A project manager must control the project schedule. Sometimes, this means com-
           pressing the project schedule. Recall that crashing adds people to the project work, but
           crashing adds cost. The project manager can only crash the project work if the activities
           are effort-driven. Activities that are of fixed duration, such as printing a million book-
           lets, won't get down faster just because the project manager adds labor to the activities.
           Other activities can benefit from fast tracking; this approach allows phases to overlap,
           but increases the project risk.

                                                                                                   191
Analogous estimating A somewhat unreliable estimating approach that relies on his-
torical information to predict what current activity durations should be. Analogous
estimating is more reliable, however, than team member recollections. Analogous esti-
mating is also known as top-down estimating, and is a form of expert judgment.
Bottom-up estimating The most accurate time and cost estimating approach a proj-
ect manager can use. This estimating approach starts at "the bottom" of the project and
considers every activity, its predecessor and successor activities, and the exact amount




                                                                                                           PART II
of resources needed to complete each activity.
Control account A WBS entry that considers the time, cost, and scope measurements for
that deliverable within the WBS. The estimated performance is compared against the ac-
tual performance to measure overall performance for the deliverables within that control
account. The specifics of a control account are documented in a control account plan.
Crashing A schedule compression approach that adds more resources to activities on
the critical path to complete the project earlier. When crashing a project, costs are add-
ed, as the associated labor expenses increase.
Critical chain method A network analysis approach where the deadlines associated
with individual tasks are removed and the only date that matters is the promised due
date of the project deliverable. CCM works to modify the project schedule based on the
availability of project resources rather than on the pure sequence of events, as in the
critical path method.
Critical path The path in the project network diagram that cannot be delayed, or the
project completion date will be late. There can be more than one critical path. Activities
in the critical path have no float.
Discretionary dependencies These dependencies are the preferred order of activities.
Project managers should use these relationships at their discretion and document the logic
behind the decision. Discretionary dependencies allow activities to happen in a preferred
order because of best practices, conditions unique to the project work, or external events.
Early finish The earliest a project activity can finish. Used in the forward pass proce-
dure to discover the critical path and the project float.
Early start The earliest a project activity can begin. Used in the forward pass proce-
dure to discover the critical path and the project float.
External dependencies As the name implies, these are dependencies outside of the
project's control. Examples include the delivery of equipment from a vendor; the deliv-
erable of another project; or the decision of a committee, lawsuit, or expected new law.
Fast tracking A schedule compression method that changes the relationship of ac-
tivities. With fast tracking, activities that would normally be done in sequence are al-
lowed to be done in parallel or with some overlap. Fast tracking can be accomplished
by changing the relation of activities from FS to SS or by adding lead time to down-
stream activities. However, fast tracking does add risk to the project.
Finish-to-finish An activity relationship type that requires the current activity be fin-
ished before its successor can finish.

           Finish-to-start An activity relationship type that requires the current activity be fin-
           ished before its successor can start.
           Fragnet A representation of a project network diagram that is often used for out-
           sourced portions of a project, repetitive work within a project, or a subproject. Also
           called a subnet.
           Free float This is the total time a single activity can be delayed without affecting the
           early start of any successor activities.
           Hard logic Logic that describes activities that must happen in a particular order. For
           example, the dirt must be excavated before the foundation can be built. The foundation
           must be in place before the framing can begin.
           Lag time Positive time that moves two or more activities farther apart.
           Late finish The latest a project activity can finish. Used in the backward pass proce-
           dure to discover the critical path and the project float.
           Late start The latest a project activity can begin. Used in the backward pass procedure
           to discover the critical path and the project float.
           Lead time Negative time that brings two or more activities closer together.
           Management reserve A percentage of the project duration to combat Parkinson's
           Law. When project activities become late, their lateness is subtracted from the manage-
           ment reserve.
           Mandatory dependencies These dependencies are the natural order of activities. For
           example, you can't begin building your house until your foundation is in place. These
           relationships are called hard logic.
           Monte Carlo analysis A project simulation approach named after the world-famous
           gambling city. This predicts how scenarios may work out, given any number of vari-
           ables. The process doesn't actually churn out a specific answer, but a range of possible
           answers. When Monte Carlo analysis is applied to a schedule, it can examine, for ex-
           ample, the optimistic completion date, the pessimistic completion date, and the most
           likely completion date for each activity in the project and then predict a mean for the
           project schedule.
           Parametric estimate A quantitatively based duration estimate that uses mathematical
           formulas to predict how long an activity will take based on the quantities of work to be
           completed.
           Parkinson's Law A theory that states: "Work expands so as to fill the time available
           for its completion." It is considered with time estimating, because bloated or padded
           activity estimates will fill the amount of time allotted to the activity.
           Planning package A WBS entry located below a control account and above the work
           packages. A planning package signifies that there is more planning that needs to be
           completed for this specific deliverable.
                                                                           Chapter 6: Managing Project Time

Precedence diagramming method A network diagram that shows activities in nodes
and the relationship between each activity. Predecessors come before the current activ-
ity and successors come after the current activity.
Project calendars Calendars that identify when the project work will occur.
Project float This is the total time the project can be delayed without passing the
customer-expected completion date.




                                                                                                              PART II
Project network diagram A diagram that visualizes the flow of the project activities
and their relationships to other project activities.
Refinement An update to the work breakdown structure.
Resource breakdown structure This is a hierarchical breakdown of the project re-
sources by category and resource type. For example, you could have a category of equip-
ment, a category of human resources, and a category of materials. Within each category,
you could identify the types of equipment your project will use, the types of human
resources, and the types of materials.
Resource calendars Calendars that identify when project resources are available for
the project work.
Resource-leveling heuristic A method to flatten the schedule when resources are
over-allocated. Resource leveling can be applied using different methods to accomplish
different goals. One of the most common methods is to ensure that workers are not
overextended on activities.
Rolling wave planning The imminent work is planned in detail, while the work in
the future is planned at a high level. This is a form of progressive elaboration.
Soft logic The order of the activities doesn't necessarily have to happen in a specific
order. For example, you could install the light fixtures first, then the carpet, and then
paint the room. The project manager could use soft logic to change the order of the
activities if he so desired.
Start-to-finish An activity relationship that requires an activity to start so that its suc-
cessor can finish. This is the most unusual of all the activity relationship types.
Start-to-start An activity relationship type that requires the current activity to start
before its successor can start.
Subnet A representation of a project network diagram that is often used for outsourced
portions of projects, repetitive work within a project, or a subproject. Also called a fragnet.
Template A previous project that can be adapted for the current project.
Three-point estimate An estimating technique for each activity that requires optimis-
tic, most likely, and pessimistic estimates to be created. Based on these three estimates,
an average can be created to predict how long the activity should take.
Total float This is the total time an activity can be delayed without delaying project
completion.
Work package The smallest item in the work breakdown structure.

           Answers
                1. C. This is an example of using the previous project as a template. A, rolling
                   wave planning, is incorrect, as rolling wave planning describes the detailed
                   planning of the imminent project work, and the high-level planning of work
                   is farther away in the project schedule. B is incorrect; analogous estimating
                   describes the method of using a similar project to estimate the current
                   project's time and/or cost estimate. D is incorrect, as expert judgment is using
                   an expert to provide needed information for the current project. For more
                   information, see the PMBOK, Section 6.1.2.2.
                2. D. Rolling wave planning is the planning of the immediate portions of the
                   project in detail and the future work at a higher level. A is incorrect, as expert
                   judgment is using an expert to help the project manager make informed
                   decisions within the project. B describes using a template for the current
                   project. C is the process of creating the WBS by breaking down the project
                   scope. For more information, see the PMBOK, Section 6.1.2.3.
                3. B. The work packages are broken down into schedule activities. A, the project
                   scope, is incorrect, as this is the root of the WBS. C, planning packages, is
                   incorrect because the planning packages represent portions of the WBS where
                   known work content does not have schedule activities. D is incorrect, as the
                   product scope describes the thing or service the project will create. For more
                   information, see the PMBOK, Section 6.1.2.1.
                4. A. The activity list must not include any activities that are not part of the
                   project scope. B, C, and D are all incorrect choices, as these activities and
                   terms are included in the activity list. For more information, see the PMBOK,
                   Section 6.1.3.1.
                5. A. Scope verification leads to acceptance decisions with the project customer,
                   but it is not part of the activity attributes. Choices B, C, and D are all part of
                   the activity attributes that Mary may include. For more information, see the
                   PMBOK, Section 6.1.3.1.
                6. A. The operating system must be installed before the application, so this
                   is an example of hard logic. B is incorrect, as soft logic describes a scenario
                   in which the order of the activities can happen in any order. C and D are
                   incorrect, as these activities cannot start at the same time nor may they finish
                   at the same time. For more information, see the PMBOK, Section 6.2.2.4.
                7. C. The painting activity must finish first and then the carpet installation
                   activity can begin. A, lag, is incorrect, as this describes the waiting time
                   between project activities. B, lead, is also incorrect, as this describes a schedule
                   compression technique to move project activities closer together. D, start-
                   to-finish, is a relationship between activities, typically used in just-in-time
                   scheduling, but that is not what is described in this example. For more
                   information, see the PMBOK, Section 6.2.2.1.
                                                                   Chapter 6: Managing Project Time

 8. A. The project will last 15 days. The path ACFG is the critical path that will
    take 15 days to complete. B and C are both representative of paths that are less
    than the critical path, so these answers are incorrect. D, 41 days, is the sum of
    the amount of days of labor in the entire project, but it is not representative of
    the total amount of days to complete the project. For more information, see
    the PMBOK, Section 6.5.2.2.
 9. B. If activity B is delayed by two days, the total duration of the project changes

    are all incorrect calculations for this project. For more information, see the
    PMBOK, Section 6.5.2.2.
10. C. ADEHJL is the critical path, as this one takes the longest to complete. A,
    B, and D are examples of paths that have float, so they are not on the critical
    path. For more information, see the PMBOK, Section 6.5.2.2.
11. B. The project will complete on a Tuesday. This can be quickly determined
    by counting each set of Monday through Friday as five days. Three weeks
    allows the project to end on day 17, a Tuesday. Choices A, C, and D are
    incorrect. For more information, see the PMBOK, Section 6.5.2.2 and
    Section 6.4.3.1.
12. C. Crashing is when a project manager elects to add resources to the project
    work in an attempt to compress the project schedule. Crashing adds costs
    to the project. A would cause the project duration to increase. B, adding
    lead time, is an example of fast tracking. D is not a valid choice. For more
    information, see the PMBOK, Section 6.5.2.3.
13. A. Analogous estimating uses an analogy between similar projects to
    determine the current project's duration. B, parametric estimating, uses a
    parameter--such as 10 hours per unit installed--to predict the project's
    duration. C is not a valid answer. D, bottom-up estimating, accounts for every
    work package in the WBS and the total amount of time for each deliverable.
    It is the most reliable time-estimating technique, but also takes the longest to
    create. For more information, see the PMBOK, Section 6.4.2.2.
14. D. A three-point estimate takes the sum of the optimistic, pessimistic,
    and most likely estimates and divides by three. A is not a reflection of the
    estimated duration. B and C do not reflect the result of a three-point estimate.
    For more information, see the PMBOK, Section 6.4.2.4.
15. B. The framing activity cannot begin immediately after the concrete activity;
    there is waiting time, which is commonly known as lag time. A, hard logic,
    describes the order in which activities must happen; it does not describe
    the time between activities. C, lead time, would actually allow activities to
    overlap. D, finish-to-start, does describe the relationship between the concrete
    and the framing activities, but it does not answer the question. For more
    information, see the PMBOK, Section 6.2.2.5.

               16. B. The critical path reveals the earliest that a project may finish. A is incorrect,
                   because the project may have more than one critical path. C is incorrect, as
                   the critical path may have fewer activities than other paths in the project but
                   still take longer to complete. D is also incorrect, because the critical path does
                   not reflect the importance of the path's activities, just their duration. For more
                   information, see the PMBOK, Section 6.5.2.2.
               17. D. Schedule control is part of the integrated change control process. A, B, and
                   C are incorrect choices, as these do not completely answer the question. For
                   more information, see the PMBOK, Section 6.6.1.4.
               18. B. The only system that deals directly with schedule is in choice B, the
                   schedule change control system. A is not a valid choice. C, integrated change
                   control, actually describes a project process. D is a group of individuals that
                   may determine scope changes and their affect on the project constraints. For
                   more information, see the PMBOK, Section 6.6.1.4 and Section 6.6.2.2.
               19. A. The critical path method only considers when the work may take place
                   and not the availability of the resources. B, the critical chain method, does
                   consider when the resources are available. C and D are not valid choices for
                   this question. For more information, see the PMBOK, Section 6.6.1.4 and
                   Section 6.5.2.2.
               20. C. Crashing adds cost to the project because labor costs money. A and B are
                   incorrect, because crashing a project does not necessarily ensure that the
                   project will end early or on time. D is also incorrect, as there's no evidence
                   that the team morale will decrease if the project manager elects to crash the
                   project. For more information, see the PMBOK, Section 6.6.1.4 and Section
                   6.5.2.3.
    Managing Project Costs

                                                                                                 7
    In this chapter, you will
       * Estimate the project costs
       * Administer the project budget
       * Manage project cost control
       * Work with earned value management




 Money. Cash. Greenbacks. Dead presidents. It's all the same thing when you get down
 to it: Projects require finances to get from start to completion, and it's often the project
 manager's job to estimate, control, and account for the finances a project demands.
 Projects consume the project budget during execution, when all of those project man-
 agement plans we've discussed are put into action, and the project budget is monitored
 and controlled during, well, the monitoring and controlling processes.
     What's that you say? You don't have any control over the monies your project re-
 quires? Management gives you a pre-determined budget, and it's up to you to make it
 all work out? Yikes! While this book centers on your Certified Associate in Project Man-
 agement (CAPM) and Project Management Professional (PMP) examinations, that's
 always one of the scariest things I hear. Or is it? If management's decision is based on
 previous projects, business analysts' research, or should-cost estimates from experts,
 then it's not so scary. I'll give you this much: A pre-determined project budget is always
 a constraint and it's rarely fun for the project manager.
     And what about those projects that don't have any monies assigned to the project work?
 You know...the projects where the project scope is just completed by the project team's
 time and there really aren't any materials or items to purchase. That's okay--there are still
 costs associated with the project, because someone, somewhere, is paying for the project
 team's time. Salaries can also be considered a project cost. After all, time is money.

                VIDEO     Using earned value management.


     Finally--and here's the big whammy--it doesn't really matter where your project
 monies come from, whether you actually control them, and the processes your organiza-
 tion uses to spend them. Your Project Management Institute (PMI) exam makes you un-
 derstand all of the appropriate processes and procedures of how projects are estimated,
 budgeted, and then financially controlled. And that's what we'll discuss in this chapter.
                                                                                          201

               You know by now, I'm assuming, that there are 44 project management processes.
           Guess how many of them center on cost? Three: cost estimating, cost budgeting, and
           cost controlling. Isn't that reassuring? Your PMI exam will, no doubt, have questions on
           costs, but so much of the content of this chapter refers to your enterprise environmen-
           tal factors. (Remember that term? It's how your company does business.) Your cost
           management plan defines and outlines your organization's and project's procedures for
           cost management and control. I'll not pass the buck anymore. Let's go through this
           chapter like a wad of cash at an all-night flea market.


           Determining the Project Costs (PMBOK 7.1)
           One of the first questions a project manager is likely to be asked when a project is
           launched is, "How much to finish?" That question can only be answered through pro-
           gressive elaboration. In order to answer the question, the project manager, or the proj-
           ect estimator as the case may be, first needs to examine the costs of the resources need-
           ed to complete each activity in the project. Resources, of course, are people, but also
           things: equipment, material, training, even pizza if the project demands it.
               On top of the cost of the resources, there's also all the variances that must be con-
           sidered: project risks, fluctuations in the cost of materials, the appropriate human re-
           sources for each activity, and oddball elements, like shipping, insurance, inflation, and
           monies for testing and evaluations.
               Estimates, as Figure 7-1 depicts, usually come in one of three flavors through a se-
           ries of refinements. As more details are acquired as the project progresses, the estimates
           are refined. Industry guidelines and organizational policies may define how the esti-
           mates are refined.

                * Rough order of magnitude This estimate is "rough" and is used during the
                  initiating processes and in top-down estimates. The range of variance for the
                  estimate can be from -25 percent to +75 percent.
                * Budget estimate This estimate is also somewhat broad, and is used early in
                  the planning processes and also in top-down estimates. The range of variance
                  for the estimate can be from -10 percent to +25 percent.
                * Definitive estimate This estimate type is one of the most accurate. It's used
                  late in the planning processes, and is associated with bottom-up estimating.
                  You need the work breakdown structure (WBS) in order to create the definitive
                  estimate. The range of variance for the estimate can be from -5 percent to +10
                  percent.


           Figure 7-1
           There are three
           generally accepted
           types of cost
           estimates.

                                                                                                    203
    While project managers typically think of project estimates as some unit of mea-
sure, such as dollars, euros, yen, or others, it's possible, and often feasible, to estimate
project costs based on labor. Consider the amount of hours the project team must work
on creating a new piece of software. You could even estimate based on the number of
full-time employees assigned to the project for a given duration.

             EXAM TIP If your organization doesn't use a cost estimator, the project




                                                                                                            PART II
             manager and the project team work together to estimate the project costs.

Estimating the Project Costs
Assuming that the project manager and the project team are working together to create
the cost estimates, there are many inputs to the cost estimating process. For your PMI
exam, it'd behoove you to be familiar with these inputs, as these are often the support-
ing details for the cost estimate the project management team creates. Let's have a look,
shall we?

Relying on Enterprise Environmental Factors
Every time I have to say or write "enterprise environmental factors," I cringe. It's just a
fancypants way of saying how your organization runs shop. Within any organization,
there are "factors" that affect the cost-estimating process. Surprise, surprise. There are
two for your exam:

     * Marketplace conditions When you have to buy materials and other
       resources, the marketplace dictates the price, what's available, and from
       whom will you purchase. We'll talk all about procurement in Chapter 12,
       but for now, there are three conditions that can affect the price of anything
       your project needs to purchase:
        * Sole source There's only one vendor that can provide what your project
          needs to purchase. Examples include a specific consultant, specialized
          service, or unique type of material.
        * Single source There are many vendors that can provide what your project
          needs to purchase, but you prefer to work with a specific vendor. They are
          your favorite.
        * Oligopoly This is a market condition in which the market is so tight, the
          actions of one vendor affect the actions of all the others. Can you think
          of any? How about the airline industry, the oil industry, or even training
          centers and consultants?
     * Commercial databases One of my first consulting gigs was for a large
       commercial printer. We used a database based on the type of materials the
       job was to be printed on, the number of inks and varnish we wanted to use,
       and the printing press we'd use to predict how much the job would cost.
       That's a commercial database. Another accessible example is any price list
       your vendors may provide so that you can estimate accurately.
CAPM/PMP Project Management Certification All-in-One Exam Guide

                         EXAM TIP Here's a goofy way to remember all the market conditions for
                         your PMI exam. For a sole source, think of James Brown, the Godfather of
                         Soul. There's only one James Brown, just as there's only one vendor. For a
                         single source, think of all the single people in the world and how you only
                         want to date your sweetie instead of all the others. With a single source, you
                         consider all the different available vendors, but you have your favorite. And
                         for oligopoly? It looks like "oil" which we know is a classic example of an
                         oligopoly market. Hey! I warned you these were goofy.

           Using Organizational Process Assets
           Here's another term that makes my teeth hurt. Organizational process assets are just
           things your organization has learned, created, or purchased that can help the project
           management team manage a project better. When it comes to cost estimating, there are
           many assets an organization can use:
                * Cost estimating policies An organization can, and often will, create a policy
                  on how the project manager or the cost estimator is to create the project cost
                  estimate. It's just their rule; got any of those where you work?
                * Cost estimating templates In case you've not picked up on this yet, PMI
                  and the Project Management Body of Knowledge (PMBOK) love templates.
                  Templates in project management don't usually mean a shell like Microsoft
                  Word thinks of templates. We're talking about using past similar projects to
                  serve as a template for the current project.
                * Historical information Beyond the specific costs of previous projects, historical
                  information is just about anything that came before this project that can help the
                  project manager and the project team create an accurate cost estimate.
                * Project files Project archives and files from past projects can help with the
                  cost estimate process. Specifically, the project manager is after the performance
                  of past similar projects in areas of cost control, the cost of risks, and quality
                  issues that could affect costs.
                * Project team knowledge Your project team usually consists of the experts
                  closest to the project work, and can be a valuable input to the project cost
                  estimating process. Be forewarned--for the real world and your PMI exam, project
                  team recollections are great, but aren't the most reliable input. In other words,
                  Marty's war stories about how Project XYZ was a $14 billion over budget don't
                  compare with historical information that says Project XYZ was $14 over budget.
                * Lessons learned It's always good to rely on lessons learned as an input
                  during planning. After all, it's better to learn from someone else's mistakes.

                         EXAM TIP Sometimes, an organization has two projects, or opportunities, and
                         they can only choose one of the projects to complete. For example, Project A
                         is worth $75,000 and Project B is worth $250,000. The organization will likely
                         choose Project B because it is worth more and let Project A go because it is
                         worth considerably less. Opportunity costs is a term to describe the total amount
                         of the project that was let go in lieu of the project that was selected. In this
                         instance, the opportunity cost is $75,000, the worth of Project A.
                                                                         Chapter 7: Managing Project Costs

                                                                                                     205
Relying on the Project Scope Statement
The project scope statement is also an input to the cost estimating process. What a sur-
prise! The project scope statement is needed because it defines the business case for the
project, the project justifications, and the project requirements--all things that'll cost
cash in order to achieve. The project scope statement can help the project manager and
the stakeholders negotiate the funding for the project based on what's already been
agreed upon. In other words, the size of the budget has to be in proportion to the de-




                                                                                                             PART II
mands of the project scope statement.
    While the project scope statement defines constraints, it also defines assumptions.
In Chapter 11, which discusses risk management, we'll discuss how assumptions can
become risks. Basically, if the assumptions in the project scope statement prove false,
the project manager needs to assess what the financial impact may be.
    Consider all of the elements in the project scope statement that can contribute to
the project cost estimate:

     * Contractual agreements
     * Insurance
     * Safety and health issues
     * Environment expenses
     * Security concerns
     * Cost of intellectual rights
     * Licenses and permits

    Lastly, and this is perhaps one of the more important elements in the project scope
statement, is the requirement for acceptance. The cost estimate must reflect the monies
needed to ascertain the project customer's expectations. If the monies are not available to
create all of the elements within the project scope, then the project scope must be trimmed
to match the monies that are available or more cash needs to be dumped into the project.

Examining Other Cost Estimating Inputs
All right...I've covered the major inputs for cost estimating, but there are still some
smaller, common sense inputs that the project manager or the cost estimator will need
to rely upon to complete the cost estimating process. Don't worry--it's nothing you've
not seen before, and it's all pretty straightforward:

     * Work breakdown structure The WBS is needed to create a cost estimate,
       especially the definitive estimate, because it clearly defines all of the deliverables
       the project will create. Each of the work packages in the WBS will cost something
       in the way of materials, time, or often both. You'll see the WBS as a common
       theme in this chapter, because the monies you spend on a project are for the
       things you've promised in the WBS.
     * WBS dictionary The WBS's pal, the WBS dictionary is needed because it
       includes all of the details and the associated work for each deliverable in
       the WBS. As a general rule, whenever you have the WBS involved, the WBS
       dictionary tags along.
CAPM/PMP Project Management Certification All-in-One Exam Guide
206
                * Project management plan The project management plan defines how the
                  project will be executed and simultaneously monitored and controlled. Recall
                  that the project management plan includes all of the subsidiary plans for the
                  project--that's at least one for each project management knowledge area and
                  quality process improvement plan. Because project management is integrative
                  in nature, expenses from each knowledge area are considered inputs to the
                  cost estimate. Specific contents of the project management plan to consider
                  for the PMI examination include the following:
                   * Schedule management plan The availability of resources, when the
                     resources are to do the work, when capital expenses are to happen, and so on.
                     The schedule management plan can also consider contracts with collective
                     bargaining agreements (unions) and their timelines, seasonal cost of labor
                     and materials, and any other timings that may affect the overall cost estimate.
                   * Staffing management plan We've already determined that time is money,
                     because the project pays for the labor to create the items promised in the
                     project scope statement. The staffing management plan determines when
                     project resources, specifically the people, are needed on the project team
                     and the expenses to have those folks involved. Chapter 9 discusses the
                     staffing management plan in more detail.
                   * Risk register A risk is an uncertain event that may cost the project time,
                     money, or both. The risk register is a central repository of the project's risks
                     and the associated status of each risk event. Some risks the project team
                     can buy their way out of, while other risks will cost the project if they come
                     true. We'll discuss risks in detail in Chapter 11, but for now, know that the
                     risk register is needed because the cost of the risk exposure helps the project
                     management team create an accurate cost estimate.

                         EXAM TIP Risks may not always cost monies directly, but could affect the
                         project schedule. Keep in mind, however, that this could, in turn, cause a rise
                         in project costs because of vendor commitment, penalties for lateness, and
                         added expenses with additional labor.

           Estimating Project Costs
           All of the cost inputs are needed so that the project cost estimator, likely the project
           management team, can create a reliable cost estimate. The estimates you'll want to
           know for the CAPM and PMP exam, and for your career, are reflective of the accuracy of
           the information the estimate is based upon. The more accurate the information, the
           better the cost estimate will be. Basically, all cost estimates move through progressive
           elaboration: As more details become available, the more accurate the cost estimate is
           likely to be. Let's examine the most common approaches to determining how much a
           project is likely to cost.

           Using Analogous Estimating
           Analogous estimating relies on historical information to predict the cost of the current
           project. It is also known as top-down estimating, and is the least reliable of all the cost
           estimating approaches. The process of analogous estimating uses the actual cost of a
                                                                         Chapter 7: Managing Project Costs

                                                                                                     207
historical project as a basis for the current project. The cost of the historical project is
applied to the cost of the current project, taking into account the scope and size of the
current project, as well as other known variables.
    Analogous estimating is considered a form of expert judgment. This estimating ap-
proach takes less time to complete than other estimating models, but is also less accu-
rate. This top-down approach is good for fast estimates to get a general idea of what the
project may cost. The trouble, or risk, with using an analogous estimate, however, is




                                                                                                             PART II
that the historical information that estimate is based upon must be accurate. For ex-
ample, if I were to create a cost estimate for Project NBG based on a similar project
Nancy did two years ago, I'd be assuming that Nancy kept accurate records and that her
historical information is accurate. If it isn't, well, then my project costs are not going to
be accurate and I'm going to be really mad at Nancy.

Determining the Cost of Resources
One of the project management plans needed for cost estimating was the staffing man-
agement plan, which defines all of the attributes of the project staff, including the per-
sonnel rates. Armed with this plan and a determination of what resources are needed
to complete the project, the project manager can extrapolate what the cost of the hu-
man resource element of the project will likely be.
    Resources include more than just the people doing the project work. The cost esti-
mate must also reflect all of the equipment and materials that will be utilized to com-
plete the work. In addition, the project manager must identify the quantity of the
needed resources and when the resources are needed for the project. The identification
of the resources, the needed quantity, and the schedule of the resources are directly
linked to the expected cost of the project work.
    There are four variations on project expenses to consider:
     * Direct costs These costs are attributed directly to the project work and cannot be
       shared among projects (airfare, hotels, long distance phone charges, and so on).
     * Indirect costs These costs are representative of more than one project
       (utilities for the performing organization, access to a training room, project
       management software license, and so on).
     * Variable costs These costs vary, depending on the conditions applied in
       the project (the number of meeting participants, the supply and demand of
       materials, and so on).
     * Fixed costs These costs remain constant throughout the life cycle of the
       project (the cost of a piece of rented equipment for the project, the cost of a
       consultant brought onto the project, and so on).
    And yes, you can mix and match these terms. For example, you could have a variable
cost based on shipping expenses that is also a direct cost for your project. Don't get too
hung up on these cost types--just be topically familiar with them for your PMI exam.

Using Bottom-Up Estimating
Bottom-up estimating starts from zero, accounts for each component of the WBS, and
arrives at a sum for the project. It is completed with the project team, and can be one of
the most time-consuming methods used to predict project costs. While this method is
CAPM/PMP Project Management Certification All-in-One Exam Guide
208
           more expensive, because of the time invested to create the estimate, it is also one of the
           most accurate. A fringe benefit of completing a bottom-up estimate is that the project
           team may buy into the project work since they see the cost and value of each cost
           within the project.

           Using Parametric Estimating
           That'll be $465 per metric ton.
               You can buy our software for $765 per license.
               How about $125 per network drop?
               These are all examples of parameters that can be integrated into a parametric esti-
           mate. Parametric estimating uses a mathematical model based on known parameters to
           predict the cost of a project. The parameters in the model can vary based on the type of
           work being completed and can be measured by cost per cubic yard, cost per unit, and
           so on. A complex parameter can be cost per unit, with adjustment factors based on the
           conditions of the project. The adjustment factors may have several modifying factors,
           depending on additional conditions.
               There are two types of parametric estimating:
                * Regression analysis This is a statistical approach that predicts what
                  future values may be based on historical values. Regression analysis creates
                  quantitative predictions based on variables within one value to predict
                  variables in another. This form of estimating relies solely on pure statistical
                  math to reveal relationships between variables and to predict future values.
                * Learning curve This approach is simple: The cost per unit decreases the
                  more units workers complete, because workers learn as they complete the
                  required work (see Figure 7-2). The more an individual completes an activity,
                  the easier it is to complete. The estimate is considered parametric, since
                  the formula is based on repetitive activities, such as wiring telephone jacks,
                  painting hotel rooms, or other activities that are completed over and over
                  within a project.

                         EXAM TIP Don't worry too much about regression analysis for the exam.
                         Learning curve is the topic you're more likely to have questions on.

           Using Good Old Project Management Software
           Who's creating estimates with their abacus? Most organizations rely on software to help
           the project management team create an accurate cost estimate. While the CAPM and
           PMP examinations are vendor-neutral, a general knowledge of how computer software
           can assist the project manager is needed. Several different computer programs are avail-
           able that can streamline project work estimates and increase their accuracy. These tools
           can include project management software, spreadsheet programs, and simulations.

           Examining the Vendor Bids
           Sometimes, it's just more cost-effective (and easier) to hire someone else to do the
           work. Other times, the project manager has no choice because the needed skill set
           doesn't exist within the organization. In either condition, the vendors' bids need to be
                                                                         Chapter 7: Managing Project Costs

analyzed to determine which vendor should be selected based on their ability to satisfy
the project scope, the expected quality, and the cost of their services. We'll talk all about
procurement in Chapter 12.

Creating a Reserve Analysis
Do you think it'll snow next December in Michigan? I do, too. But do we know on what
exact date? That's a quick and easy example of a "known unknown." You know that
something is likely to occur, but you just don't when or to what degree. Projects are full
of known unknowns, and the most common deals with costs. Based on experience, the
nature of the work, or fear, you suspect that some activities in your project will cost
more than expected--that's a known unknown.
    Rather than combating known unknowns by padding costs with extra monies, the
PMBOK suggests that we create "contingency allowances" to account for these overruns
in costs. The contingency allowances are used at the project manager's discretion to
counteract cost overruns for schedule activities.
    In Chapter 6, we discussed the concept of management reserve for time overruns.
This is a related concept when it comes to the cost reserve for projects. This reserve is
sometimes called contingency reserve, and is traditionally set aside for cost overruns
due to risks that have affected the project's cost baseline. Contingency reserves can be
managed in a number of different ways. The most common is to set aside an allotment
of funds for the identified risks within the project. Another approach is to create a slush
fund for the entire project for identified risks and known unknowns. The final ap-
proach is an allotment of funds for categories of components based on the WBS and
the project schedule.

           Considering the Cost of Quality
           The cost of quality, which we'll discuss in Chapter 8, is a term that defines the monies
           the project must spend in order to reach the expected level of quality within a project.
           For example, if your project will use a new material that no one on the project team has
           ever worked with before, the project team will likely need training so that they can use
           it during the project execution. The training, as you can guess, costs something. That's
           an example of the cost of quality.
               On the other side of the coin (cost pun intended, thank you), there's the cost of
           poor quality, sometimes called the cost of nonconformance to quality. These are the
           costs your project will pay if you don't adhere to quality the first time. In our example
           with the project team and the new materials, a failure to train the team on the new
           materials will mean that the team will likely not install the materials properly, take
           longer to use the materials, and may even waste materials. All of these negative condi-
           tions cost the project in time, money, team frustration, and even loss of sales.

           Examining the Cost Estimate
           Once all of the inputs have been evaluated and the estimate creation process is com-
           pleted, you get, of course, the cost estimate. The estimate is the likely cost of the proj-
           ect--it's not a guarantee, so there is usually a modifier--sometimes called an acceptable
           range of variance. That's the plus/minus qualifier on the estimate, for example $450,000
           +25,000 to -$13,000, based on whatever conditions are attached to the estimate. The
           cost estimate should, at the minimum, include the likely costs for all of the following:

                * Labor
                * Materials
                * Equipment
                * Services
                * Facilities
                * Information technology
                * Special categories, such as inflation and contingency reserve

                It's possible for a project to have other cost categories, such as consultants, out-
           sourced solutions, and others, but the preceding list is the most common. Consider this
           list when studying to pass your exam.
                Along with the cost estimate, the project management team includes the basis of
           the estimate. These are all the supporting details of how the estimate was created and
           why the confidence in the estimate exists at the level it does. Supporting details typi-
           cally include all of the following:
                * Description of the work to be completed in consideration of the cost estimate
                * Explanation of how the estimate was created
                * What assumptions were used during the estimate creation
                * The constraints that the project management team had to consider when
                  creating the cost estimate
                                                                       Chapter 7: Managing Project Costs

                                                                                                   211
    A project's cost estimate may lead to some unpleasant news in the shape of change
requests. I say "unpleasant," because changes are rarely enjoyable. Changes can affect
the scope in two primary ways when it comes to cost:
     * We don't have enough funds to match the cost estimate, so we'll need to trim
       the scope.
     * We have more than enough funds to match the cost estimate, so let's add
       some stuff into the scope.




                                                                                                           PART II
    All change requests must be documented and fed through the integrated change
control system, as discussed in Chapter 4. What the project manager wants to be leery of
is gold plating. Gold plating is when the project manager, the project sponsor, or even a
stakeholder adds in project extras to consume the entire project budget. It's essentially
adding unneeded features to the product in order to use up all the funds allocated to the
project. While this often happens in the final stages of a project, it can begin right here
during the project cost estimating. Gold plating delivers more than what's needed and
can create new risks, work, and contribute to a decline in team morale.
    If changes are approved, then integrated change control is enacted and the project
scope is updated and the WBS and WBS dictionary are updated, and so on, through all of
the project management plans as needed. The cost management plan needs to be updated
as well to reflect the costs of the changes and their impact on the project cost estimate.

Budgeting the Project (PMBOK, Section 7.2)
Now that the project estimate has been created, it's time to create the official cost bud-
get. Cost budgeting is really cost aggregation, which means the project manager will be
assigning specific dollar amounts for each of the scheduled activities or, more likely, for
each of the work packages in the WBS. The aggregation of the work package cost equates
to the summary budget for the entire project. This process creates the cost baseline, as
Figure 7-3 shows.
    Cost budgeting and cost estimates may go hand-in-hand, but estimating is com-
pleted before a budget is created--or assigned. Cost budgeting applies the cost esti-
mates over time. This results in a time-phased estimate for cost, which allows an
organization to predict cash flow, project return on investment, and forecasting. The
difference between cost estimates and cost budgeting is that cost estimates show costs
by category, whereas a cost budget shows costs across time.

Creating the Project Budget
Good news! Many of the tools and techniques used to create the project cost estimates
are also used to create the project budget. The following is a quick listing of the tools
you can expect to see on the CAPM and PMP exams:
     * Cost aggregation Costs are parallel to each WBS work package. The costs
       of each work package are aggregated to their corresponding control accounts.
       Each control account is then aggregated to the sum of the project costs.
     * Reserve analysis Cost reserves are for unknown unknowns within a project.
       The contingency reserve is not part of the project's cost baseline, but is
       included as part of the project budget.

           Figure 7-3 The cost baseline is how much the project will cost demonstrated on an S-curve.


                * Parametric estimating This approach uses a parametric model to extrapolate
                  what costs will be for a project (for example, cost per hour and cost per unit).
                  It can include variables and points based on conditions.
                * Funding limit reconciliation Organizations only have so much cash to allot
                  to projects--and no, you can't have all the monies right now. Funding limit
                  reconciliation is an organization's approach to managing cash flow against the
                  project deliverables based on a schedule, milestone accomplishment, or data
                  constraints. This helps an organization plan when monies will be devoted to a
                  project rather than using all of the funds available at the start of a project. In other
                  words, the monies for a project budget will become available based on dates and/
                  or deliverables. If the project doesn't hit predetermined dates and products that
                  were set as milestones, the additional funding becomes questionable.

           Examining the Project Budget
           Like most parts of the PMBOK, you don't get just one output after completing a pro-
           cess; you get several. Creating the project budget is no different, as there are four out-
           puts to know for the PMI examination. The following sections look at these in detail.

           Working with the Cost Baseline
           The cost baseline, as shown in Figure 7-3, is actually a time-lapse exposure of when the
           project's monies are to be spent in relation to cumulative values of the work completed
           in the project. Most baselines are shown as an S-curve, where the project begins in the
           left and works its way to the upper-right corner. When the project begins, it's not worth
           much and usually not much has been spent. As the project moves towards completion,
           the monies for labor, materials, and other resources are consumed in relation to the
                                                                         Chapter 7: Managing Project Costs

                                                                                                     213
work. In other words, the monies spent on the project over time will equate to the work
the project is completing.
    Some projects, especially projects that are of high priority or large, may have mul-
tiple cost baselines to track cost of labor, cost of materials, even the cost of internal re-
sources compared to external resources. This is all fine and dandy, as long as the values
in each of the baselines are maintained and consistent. It wouldn't do a project man-
ager much good if the cost baseline for materials was updated regularly and the cost




                                                                                                             PART II
baseline for labor was politely ignored.

             EXAM TIP Monies that have already been spent on a project are considered
             sunk into the project. These funds are called sunk costs--they're gone.

Determining the Project Funding Requirements
Projects demand a budget, but when the monies in the project are made available is
dependent on the organization, the size of the project, and just plain old common
sense. For example, if you were building a skyscraper that costs $850 million, you
wouldn't need all of the funds on the first day of the project, but you would forecast
when those monies would be needed. That's cash flow forecasting.
    The funding of the project, based on the cost baseline and the expected project
schedule, may happen incrementally or based on conditions within the project. Typi-
cally, the funding requirements have been incorporated into the cost baseline. The re-
lease of funds is treated like a step function, which is what it is. Each step of the project
funding allows the project to move on to the next milestone, deliverable, or whatever
"step" of the project the project manager and the stakeholders have agreed to.
    The project funding requirements also account for the management contingency
reserve amounts. This is a pool of funds for cost overruns. Typically, the management
contingency reserve is allotted to the project in each step, though some organizations
may elect to only disperse contingency funds on an as-needed basis--that's just part of
organizational process assets.
    To be crystal clear, the cost baseline is what the project should cost in an ideal perfect
world. The management contingency reserve is the "filler" between the cost baseline and
the maximum funding. In most cases, the management contingency reserve bridges the
gap between the project cost baseline and the maximum funding to complete the project.
Figure 7-4 demonstrates the management contingency reserve at a project's completion.

The Usual Suspects
There are two more outputs of the cost budgeting process. Care to guess which two?
Here are the usual outputs:

     * Change requests Did you guess this one? Just about any process in a project
       can generate a change request, and cost budgeting is no different. Of course,
       the change request must be documented and flow through the integrated
       change control system. There are no free rides, especially in cost management.
     * Cost management plan updates If there's been a change request that is
       approved, you'll likely have to update the cost management plan. Fascinating.

           Controlling Project Costs (PMBOK, Section 7.3)
           Once a project has been funded, it's up to the project manager and the project team to work
           effectively and efficiently to control costs. This means doing the work right the first time.. It
           also means, and this is tricky, avoiding scope creep and undocumented changes, as well as
           getting rid of any non-value-added activities. Basically, if the project team is adding compo-
           nents or features that aren't called for in the project, they're wasting time and money.
               Cost control focuses on controlling the ability of costs to change and on how the proj-
           ect management team may allow or prevent cost changes from happening. When a change
           does occur, the project manager must document the change and the reason why it occurred
           and, if necessary, create a variance report. Cost control is concerned with understanding
           why the cost variances, both good and bad, have occurred. The "why" behind the variances
           allows the project manager to make appropriate decisions on future project actions.

                         EXAM TIP      Variance reports are sometimes called exception reports.


               Ignoring the project cost variances may cause the project to suffer from budget
           shortages, additional risks, or scheduling problems. When cost variances happen, they
           must be examined, recorded, and investigated. Cost control allows the project manager
           to confront the problem, find a solution, and then act accordingly. Specifically, cost
           control focuses on:

                * Controlling causes of change to ensure that the changes are actually needed
                * Controlling and documenting changes to the cost baseline as they happen
                * Controlling changes in the project and their influence on cost
                                                                        Chapter 7: Managing Project Costs

     * Performing cost monitoring to recognize and understand cost variances
     * Recording appropriate cost changes in the cost baseline
     * Preventing unauthorized changes to the cost baseline
     * Communicating the cost changes to the proper stakeholders
     * Working to bring and maintain costs within an acceptable range




                                                                                                            PART II
Managing the Project Costs
Controlling the project costs is more than a philosophy--it's the project manager working
with the project team, the stakeholders, and often management to ensure that costs don't
creep into the project and then managing the cost increases as they happen. To implement
cost control, the project manager must rely on several documents and processes:
     * Cost baseline You know this one already. The cost baseline is the expected
       cost the project will incur and when those expenses will happen. This time-
       phased budget reflects the amount that will be spent throughout the project.
       Recall that the cost baseline is a tool used to measure project performance.
     * Project funding requirements The funds for a project are not allotted all
       at once, but stair-stepped in alignment with project deliverables. Thus, as the
       project moves towards completion, additional funding is allotted. This allows
       for cash-flow forecasting. In other words, an organization doesn't have to have
       the project's entire budget allotted at the start of the project, but it can predict,
       based on expected income, that the budget will be available in incremental steps.
     * Performance reports These reports focus on project cost performance, project
       scope, and planned performance versus actual performance. The reports may
       vary according to stakeholder needs. We'll discuss performance reporting in
       detail in Chapter 10 and everyone's favorite, earned value management, in just
       one moment.
     * Change requests When changes to the project scope are requested, an analysis
       of the associated costs to complete the proposed change is required. In some
       instances, such as when removing a portion of the project deliverable, a change
       request may reduce the project cost. (I know, that's wishful thinking; but in
       PMI's world, it's possible.)
     * Cost management plan The cost management plan dictates how cost variances
       will be managed. A variance is a difference between what was expected and was
       experienced. In some instances, the management contingency reserve allowance
       can "cover" the cost overruns. In other instances, depending on the reason why
       the overrun occurred, the funding may have to come from the project customer.
       Consider a customer who wanted the walls painted green and after the work was
       completed, changed his mind and wanted the walls orange. This cost overrun is
       due only to a change request and not a defect.

Creating a Cost Change Control System
Way, way back in Chapter 5, I discussed the scope change control system. Whenever
some joker wants to add something to the project scope, or even take something out of
CAPM/PMP Project Management Certification All-in-One Exam Guide
216
           our project scope, the scope change control system is engaged. Similarly, the cost change
           control system examines any changes associated with scope changes, the costs of mate-
           rials, and the cost of any other resources you can imagine.
                When a cost change enters the system, there is appropriate paperwork, a tracking
           system, and procedures the project manager must follow to obtain approval on the
           proposed change. Figure 7-5 demonstrates a typical workflow for cost change approval.
           If a change gets approved, the cost baseline is updated to reflect the approved changes.
           If a request gets denied, the denial must be documented for future potential reference.
           You don't want a stakeholder wondering why his or her change wasn't incorporated
           into the project scope at the end of the project without some documenting as to why.

                         EXAM TIP There are four specific change control systems in project
                         management: scope change control system, schedule change control system,
                         cost change control system, and the contract change control system.


           Using Earned Value Management
           (PMBOK, Section 7.3.2)
           When I teach a PMP Boot Camp, attendees snap to attention when it comes to earned
           value management and their exam. This topic is foreign to many folks, and they under-
           standably want an in-depth explanation of this suite of mysterious formulas. Maybe
           you find yourself in that same position, so here's some good news: it's not that big of a
           deal. Relax--you can memorize these formulas, answer the exam questions correctly,
           and worry about tougher exam topics. I'll show you how.

           cost changes.

                                                                                                  217
    First, earned value management (EVM) is the process of measuring the performance
of project work against what was planned to identify variances, opportunities to improve
the project, or just to check the project's health. EVM can help predict future variances
and the final costs at completion. It is a system of mathematical formulas that compares
work performed against work planned and measures the actual cost of the work your
project has performed. EVM is an important part of cost control, since it allows a project
manager to predict future variances from the expenses to date within the project.




                                                                                                          PART II
Learning the Fundamentals
EVM, in regards to cost management, is concerned with the relationships between three
formulas that reflect project performance. Figure 7-6 demonstrates the connection be-
tween the following EVM values:
     * Planned value (PV) Planned value is the work scheduled and the budget
       authorized to accomplish that work. For example, if a project has a budget of
       $500,000 and month six represents 50 percent of the project work, the PV for
       that month is $250,000.
     * Earned value (EV) Earned value is the physical work completed to date and
       the authorized budget for that work. For example, if your project has a budget
       of $500,000 and the work completed to date represents 45 percent of the entire
       project work, its earned value is $225,000. You can find EV by multiplying the
       percent complete times the project's budget at completion (BAC).
     * Actual cost (AC) Actual cost is the actual amount of monies the project has
       required to date. In your project, your BAC, for example, is $500,000 and your
       earned value is $225,000. As it turns out, your project team had some waste,
       and you actually spent $232,000 in actual monies to reach the 25-percent-
       complete milestone. Your actual cost is $232,000.
    That's the fundamentals of earned value management. All of our remaining formu-
las center on these simple formulas. Just remember that earned value is always the




Figure 7-6 Earned value management shows project performance.
CAPM/PMP Project Management Certification All-in-One Exam Guide
218
           percent of work complete times the given budget at completion. On your PMI exam,
           you'll always be provided with the actual costs, which are the monies that have already
           been spent on the project. You'll have to do some math to find the planned value; it's
           the value where your project should be by a given time. The formula for planned value
           is the percentage of project completion based on where the project should be at a given
           time. For example, let's say you're supposed to be 80 percent complete by December 15.
           If your budget is $100,000, in this instance, your planned value is $80,000.

           Finding the Project Variances
           Out in the real world, I'm sure your projects are never late and never over budget (ha-
           ha--pretty funny, right?). For your exam you'll need to be able to find the cost and
           schedule variances for your project. I'll stay with the same $500,000 budget I've been
           working with in the previous examples and as demonstrated in Figure 7-7. Finding the
           variances helps the project manager and management determine a project's health, set
           goals for project improvement, and benchmark projects against each other based on
           the identified variances.

           Finding the Cost Variance
           Let's say your project has a BAC of $500,000 and you're 40 percent complete. You have
           spent, however, $234,000 in real monies. To find the cost variance, we'll find the earned
           value, which is 40 percent of the $500,000 budget. As Figure 7-7 shows, this is $200,000. In
           this example, you spent $234,000 in actual costs. The formula for finding the cost variance
           is earned value minus actual costs. In this instance, the cost variance is negative $34,000.
                This means you've spent $34,000 dollars more than what the work you've done is
           worth. Of course, the $34,000 is in relation to the size of the project. On this project,
           that's a sizeable flaw, but on a billion-dollar project, $34,000 may not mean too much.
           On either project, a $34,000 cost variance would likely spur a cost variance report
           (sometimes called an exceptions report).

           Finding the Schedule Variance
           Can you guess how the schedule variance works? It's basically the same as cost variance,
           only this time, we're concerned with planned value instead of actual costs. Let's say your
           project with the $500,000 budget is supposed to be 45 percent complete by today, but




           Figure 7-7 Cost variance is the difference between earned value and actual costs.
                                                                             Chapter 7: Managing Project Costs

                                                                                                         219
we know that you're only 40 percent complete. We've already found the earned value as
$200,000 now for the planned value.
    Recall that planned value, where you're supposed to be and what you're supposed
to be worth, is planned completion times the BAC. In this example, it's 45 percent of
the $500,000 BAC, which is $225,000. Uh-oh! You're behind schedule. The schedule
variance formula, as Figure 7-8 demonstrates, is earned value minus the planned value.
In this example, the schedule variance is $25,000.




                                                                                                                 PART II
Finding the Indexes
In mathematical terms, an index is an expression showing a ratio--and that's what
we're doing with these indexes. Basically, an index in earned value management shows
the health of the project's time and cost. The index, or ratio, is measured against one:
The closer to one the index, the better the project is performing. As a rule, you defi-
nitely don't want to be less than one, as that's a poorly performing project. And, believe
it or not, you don't want to be too far above one in your index, as this shows estimates
that were bloated or way, way too pessimistic. Really.

Finding the Cost Performance Index
The cost performance index (CPI) measures the project based on its financial perfor-
mance. It's an easy formula: earned value divided by actual costs, as Figure 7-9 demon-
strates. Your project, in this example, has a budget of $500,000 and you're 40 percent
complete with the project work. This is an earned value of how much? Yep. It's 40 per-
cent of the $500,000, for an earned value of $200,000.
    Your actual costs for this project to date (the cumulative costs) totals $234,000.
Your PMI exam will always tell you your actual costs for each exam question. Let's finish
the formula. To find the CPI, we divide the earned value by the actual costs, or $200,000
divided by $234,000. The CPI for this project is .85, which means that we're 85 percent
on track financially, not too healthy for any project, regardless of its budget.
    Another fun way to look at the .85 value is that you're actually losing 15 cents on
every dollar you spend on the project. Yikes! That means for every dollar you spend for
labor, you actually only get 85 cents worth. Not a good deal for the project manager. As
you can guess, the closer to one, the better the project is performing.

           Figure 7-9 The CPI is found by dividing earned value by the actual costs.



           Finding the Schedule Performance Index
           The schedule performance index (SPI) measures the project schedule's overall health.
           The formula, as Figure 7-10 demonstrates, is earned value divided by planned value. In
           other words, you're trying to determine how closely your project work is being com-
           pleted in relation to the project schedule you created. Let's try this formula out.
               Your project with the $500,000 budget is 40 percent complete, for an earned value
           of $200,000, but you're supposed to be 45 percent complete by today. That's a planned
           value of $225,000. The SPI for this project at this point in time is determined by divid-
           ing the earned value of $200,000 by the planned value of $225,000, for an SPI of .88.
           This tells me that this project is 88 percent on schedule, or, if you're a pessimist, the
           project is 12 percent off track.

           Predicting the Project's Future
           Notice in the preceding paragraph I said, "at this point in time." That's because the
           project will, hopefully, continue to make progress and the planned value and earned
           value numbers will change. Naturally, as the project moves towards completion, the
           earned value amounts will increase and so will the planned value numbers. Typically,
           these indexes, both schedule and costs, are measured at milestones, and they allow the
           project management team to do some prognosticating as to where the project will like-
           ly end up by its completion. That's right--we can do some forecasting.




           Figure 7-10 The SPI is found by dividing the earned value by the planned value.
                                                                          Chapter 7: Managing Project Costs

                                                                                                      221
             EXAM TIP The forecasting formulas are swift and easy to calculate, but they're
             not really all that accurate. After all, you never really know how much a project
             will cost until you've completed all of the project work.

Finding the Estimate to Complete
So your project is in a pickle and management wants to know how much more this
project is going to cost. They're after the estimate to complete (ETC) equation. There are




                                                                                                              PART II
three flavors of this formula, based on conditions within your project.
ETC Based on a New Estimate Sometimes you just have to accept the fact that
all of the estimates up to this point are flawed and you need a new estimate. Imagine a
project where the project manager and the project team estimate that the work will cost
$150,000 in labor, but once they get into the project, they realize it'll actually cost
$275,000 in labor because the work is much harder than they anticipated. That's a rea-
son for the ETC on a new estimate.
ETC Based on Atypical Variances This formula, shown in Figure 7-11, is used
when the project has experienced some wacky fluctuation in costs and the project man-
ager doesn't believe the anomalies will continue within the project. For example, the
cost of wood was estimated at $18 per sheet. Due to a hurricane in another part of the
country, however, the cost of wood has changed to $25 per sheet. This fluctuation in the
cost of materials has changed, but the project manager doesn't believe the cost change
will affect the cost to deliver the other work packages in the WBS. Here's the formula for
atypical variances: ETC=BAC-EV.
    Let's say that this project has a BAC of $500,000 and is 40 percent complete. The
earned value is $200,000, so our ETC formula would be ETC = $500,000-$200,000, for
an ETC of $300,000. Obviously, this formula is shallow and won't be the best forecast-
ing formula for every scenario. If the cost of the materials has changed drastically, a
whole new estimate would be more appropriate.
ETC Based on Typical Variances Sometimes in a project, a variance appears
and the project management team realizes that this is going to continue through the
rest of the project. Figure 7-12 demonstrates the formula: ETC = (BAC-EV)/CPI. For
example, consider a project to install 10,000 light fixtures throughout a university cam-
pus. You and the project team have estimated it'll take 12,000 hours of labor to install
all of the lights, and your cost estimate is $54 per hour, which equates to $648,000 to
complete all of the installations.




Figure 7-11 The estimate to complete can consider atypical variances.
CAPM/PMP Project Management Certification All-in-One Exam Guide
222




           Figure 7-12 ETC may consider expected variances within a project.

               As the project team begins work on the install, however, the time to install the light
           fixtures actually takes slightly longer than anticipated for each fixture. You realize that
           your duration estimate is flawed and will likely take the project team 16,000 hours of
           labor to install all of the lights.
               The ETC in this formula requires that the project manager know the earned value
           and the cost performance index. Let's say that this project is 20 percent complete, so the
           EV is $129,600. As the work is taking longer to complete, the actual costs to reach the
           20 percent mark turns out to be $172,000. The CPI is found by dividing the earned
           value, $129,600, by the actual costs of $172,000. The CPI for this project is .75.
               Now let's try out ETC formula: (BAC-EV)/CPI, or ($648,000-$129,600)/.75, which
           equates to $691,200. That's $691,200 more than this project will need in its budget to
           complete the remainder of the project work. Yikes!

           Finding the Estimate at Completion
           One of the most fundamental forecasting formulas is the estimate at completion (EAC).
           This formula accounts for all those pennies you're losing on every dollar if your CPI is
           less than one. It's an opportunity for the project manager to say, "Hey! Based on our
           current project's health, this is where we're likely to end up at the end of the project. I'd
           better work on my resume." Let's take a look at these formulas.
           EAC Using a New Estimate Just like the estimate to complete formulas, some-
           times it's best just to create a whole new estimate. This approach with the EAC is pretty
           straightforward--it's the actual costs plus the estimate to complete. Let's say your proj-
           ect has a budget of $500,000 and you've already spent $187,000 of it. For whatever
           reason, you've determined that your estimate is no longer valid and your ETC for the
           project is actually going to be $420,000--that's how much you're going to need to fin-
           ish the project work. The EAC, in this instance, is the actual costs of $187,000 plus your
           ETC of $420,000, or $607,000.
           EAC with Atypical Variances Sometimes, there are anomalies within a project
           that can skew the project's estimate at completion. The formula for this scenario, as
           Figure 7-13 demonstrates, is the actual costs plus the budget at completion minus the
           earned value. Let's try it out. Your project has a BAC of $500,000 and the earned value
           is $100,000. However, you've spent $127,000 in actual costs. The EAC would be
           $127,000+$500,000-$100,000, or $527,000. That's your new estimate at completion
           for this project.

Figure 7-13 The EAC can also account for anomalies in a project's expenses.

EAC Using the CPI If a project has a CPI of .97, you could say the project is losing
three pennies on every dollar. Those three pennies are going to add up over time. This
approach is most often used when the project manager realizes that the cost variances
are likely going to continue through the remainder of the project. This formula, as Fig-
ure 7-14 demonstrates, is EAC = AC+((BAC-EV)/CPI). Don't you just love nested for-
mulas? Let's try this one out.
    Your project has a BAC of $500,000 and your earned value is $150,000. Your actual
costs for this project are $162,000. Your CPI is calculated as .93. The EAC would be
$162,000+(($500,000-$150,000)/.93), or $538,344. Wasn't that fun?

             EXAM TIP There won't be as many questions on these EVM formulas
             as you'd hope, but knowing these formulas can help you nail down the few
             questions you'll likely have.

Finding Big Variances
Two variances relate to the entire project, and they're both easy to learn. The first vari-
ance you don't really know until the project is 100 percent complete. This is the project
variance, and it's simply BAC-AC. If your project had a budget of $500,000 and you
spent $734,000 to get it all done, then the project variance is $500,000-$734,000,
which equates, of course, to -$234,000.
    The second variance is part of our forecasting model, and it predicts what the proj-
ect variance will likely be. It's called the variance at completion (VAC), and the formula

           is VAC=BAC-EAC. Let's say your project has a BAC of $500,000 and your EAC is pre-
           dicted to be $538,344. The VAC is $500,000-$538,344, for a predicted variance of
           $38,344. Of course, this formula assumes that the rest of the project will run smoothly.
           In reality, where you and I hang out, the project's VAC could swing in either direction
           based on the project's overall performance.

           Using Earned Value Management Variations
           Like most things in project management, there's usually more than one way to do the
           same work. I'm happy to report that earned value management works the same way.
           The formulas I provided previously are accurate, somewhat reliable, and straight out of
           the PMBOK. However, there are some alternative formulas that you could use to save
           some of the headaches in memorizing these complex formulas, especially with the ETC
           and the EAC formulas.
               Table 7-1 provides a quick reference for all of these nifty formulas and a mnemonic
           for memorizing the most common earned value formulas.


           Chapter Summary
           Projects require resources and time, both of which cost money. Projects are estimated,
           or predicted, on how much the project work will likely cost to complete. There are mul-
           tiple flavors and approaches to project estimating. Project managers can use analogous
           estimating, parametric estimating, or, the most reliable, bottom-up estimating. What-
           ever estimating approach the project manager elects to use, the basis of the estimate
           should be documented should the estimate ever be called into question.
                                                                      Chapter 7: Managing Project Costs

                                                                                                  225
    When a project manager creates the project estimate, he should also factor in a con-
tingency reserve for project risks and cost overruns. Based on the enterprise environ-
mental factors of an organization, and often the project priority, the process to create
and receive the contingency reserve may fluctuate. The contingency reserve is not an
allowance to be spent at the project manager's discretion, but more of a safety net
should the project go awry. Variances covered by the contingency reserve can't be swept
under the rug, but must be accounted for and hopefully learned from.




                                                                                                          PART II
    Cost budgeting is the aggregation of the costs to create the work packages in the
WBS. Sometimes, cost budgeting refers to the cost aggregation as the "roll-up" of the
costs associated with each work package. Cost budgeting effectively applies the cost
estimates over time. Most project managers don't receive the entire project funding in
one swoop, but rather in step functions over the life of the project.
    Once the project moves from planning into execution, it also moves into monitor-
ing and control. The project manager and the project team work together to control the
project costs and monitor the performance of the project work. The most accessible
method to monitor the project cost is through earned value management. Earned value
management demonstrates the performance of the project and allows the project man-
ager to forecast where the project is likely going to end up financially.

Key Terms
Actual cost (AC) The actual amount of monies the project has spent to date.
Analogous estimating An approach that relies on historical information to predict
the cost of the current project. It is also known as top-down estimating, and is the least
reliable of all the cost estimating approaches.
Bottom-up estimating An estimating approach that starts from zero, accounts for
each component of the WBS, and arrives at a sum for the project. It is completed with
the project team, and can be one of the most time-consuming and most reliable meth-
ods to predict project costs.
Budget estimate This estimate is also somewhat broad, and is used early in the plan-
ning processes and also in top-down estimates. The range of variance for the estimate
can be from -10 percent to +25 percent.
Commercial database A cost estimating approach that uses a database, typically soft-
ware-driven, to create the cost estimate for a project.
Contingency reserve This is a contingency allowance to account for overruns in costs.
The contingency allowances are used at the project manager's discretion and with man-
agement's approval to counteract cost overruns for schedule activities.
Cost aggregation Costs are parallel to each WBS work package. The costs of each
work package are aggregated to their corresponding control accounts. Each control ac-
count then is aggregated to the sum of the project costs.
Cost baseline A time-lapse exposure of when the project's monies are to be spent in
relation to cumulative values of the work completed in the project.
CAPM/PMP Project Management Certification All-in-One Exam Guide
226
           Cost budgeting The cost aggregation achieved by assigning specific dollar amounts
           for each of the scheduled activities or, more likely, for each of the work packages in the
           WBS. Cost budgeting applies the cost estimates over time.
           Cost change control system A system that examines any changes associated with
           scope changes, the costs of materials, and the cost of any other resources and the associ-
           ated impact on the overall project cost.
           Cost management plan The cost management plan dictates how cost variances will
           be managed.
           Cost of poor quality The monies spent to recover from not adhering to the expected
           level of quality. Examples may include rework, defect repair, loss of life or limb because
           safety precautions were not taken, loss of sales, and loss of customers.
           Cost of quality The monies spent to ascertain the expected level of quality within a
           project. Examples include training, testing, and safety precautions.
           Cost performance index (CPI) Measures the project based on its financial perfor-
           mance. The formula is CPI = EV/AC.
           Cost variance (CV) The difference of the earned value amount and the cumulative
           actual costs of the project. The formula is CV = EV-AC.
           Definitive estimate This estimate type is one of the most accurate. It's used late in the
           planning processes and is associated with bottom-up estimating. You need the WBS in
           order to create the definitive estimate. The range of variance for the estimate can be
           from -5 percent to +10 percent.
           Direct costs Costs are attributed directly to the project work and cannot be shared
           among projects (for example, airfare, hotels, long distance phone charges, and so on).
           Earned value (EV) Earned value is the physical work completed to date and the au-
           thorized budget for that work. It is the percentage of the BAC that represents the actual
           work completed in the project.
           Estimate at completion (EAC) These forecasting formulas predict the likely com-
           pleted costs of the project based on current scenarios within the project.
           Estimate to complete (ETC) An earned value management formula that predicts how
           much funding the project will require to be completed. There are three variations of
           this formula, based on conditions the project may be experiencing.
           Fixed costs Costs that remain constant throughout the life of the project (the cost of
           a piece of rented equipment for the project, the cost of a consultant brought on to the
           project, and so on).
           Funding limit reconciliation An organization's approach to managing cash flow
           against the project deliverables based on a schedule, milestone accomplishment, or
           data constraints.
           Indirect costs These are costs that are representative of more than one project (for
           example, utilities for the performing organization, access to a training room, project
           management software license, and so on).
                                                                       Chapter 7: Managing Project Costs

Known unknown An event that will likely happen within the project, but when it
will happen and to what degree is unknown. These events, such as delays, are usually
risk-related.
Learning curve An approach that assumes the cost per unit decreases the more units
workers complete because workers learn as they complete the required work.
Oligopoly A market condition where the market is so tight that the actions of one




                                                                                                           PART II
vendor affect the actions of all the others.
Opportunity cost The total cost of the opportunity that is refused to realize an op-
posing opportunity.
Parametric estimating An approach using a parametric model to extrapolate what
costs will be for a project (for example, cost per hour and cost per unit). It can include
variables and points based on conditions.
Parametric estimating Uses a mathematical model based on known parameters to
predict the cost of a project.
Planned value (PV) Planned value is the work scheduled and the budget authorized
to accomplish that work. It is the percentage of the BAC that reflects where the project
should be at this point in time.
Project variance The final variance, which is discovered only at the project's comple-
tion. The formula is VAR = BAC-AC.
Regression analysis This is a statistical approach to predicting what future values
may be, based on historical values. Regression analysis creates quantitative predictions
based on variables within one value to predict variables in another. This form of esti-
mating relies solely on pure statistical math to reveal relationships between variables
and to predict future values.
Reserve analysis Cost reserves are for unknown unknowns within a project. The con-
tingency reserve is not part of the project's cost baseline, but is included as part of the
project budget.
Rough order of magnitude This rough estimate is used during the initiating pro-
cesses and in top-down estimates. The range of variance for the estimate can be from
-25 percent to +75 percent.
Schedule performance index (SPI) Measures the project based on its schedule per-
formance. The formula is SPI = EV/PV.
Schedule variance (SV) The difference between the earned value and the planned
value. The formulas is SV = EV-PV.
Single source Many vendors can provide what your project needs to purchase, but
you prefer to work with a specific vendor.
Sole source Only one vendor can provide what your project needs to purchase. Ex-
amples include a specific consultant, specialized service, or unique type of material.
Sunk costs Monies that have already been invested in a project.

           Variable costs Costs that change based on the conditions applied in the project (the
           number of meeting participants, the supply and demand of materials, and so on).
           Variance A variance is the difference between what was expected and what was expe-
           rienced.
           Variance at completion (VAC) A forecasting formula that predicts how much of a
           variance the project will likely have based on current conditions within the project. The
           formula is VAC = BAC-EAC.

16. Linda is the project manager of a construction project. The budget for her
    project is $275,000. The project team made a mistake early in the project that
    cost $34,000 in added materials. Linda does not believe the mistakes will
    likely happen again because the team is 30 percent complete with the project
    and things are once again going smoothly. Her sponsor wants to know how
    much more funding Linda will likely need on the project. What should Linda
    tell the sponsor?
    A. $192,500
    B. $241,000
    C. $309,000
    D. $275,000
17. A project had a budget of $750,000 and was completed on time. The project
    expenses, however, were 15 percent more than what the project called for.
    What is the earned value of this project?
    A. It is impossible to know, as not enough information has been given.
    B. $112,500
    C. $637,500
    D. $750,000

               19. Marty's project has a cost variance of $44,000. He needs to complete what
                   type of report?
                    A. Status report
                    B. Exceptions report
                    C. Forecast report
                    D. Lessons learned
               20. You are a construction manager for a construction project. The project will
                   be using a new material that the project team has never worked with before.
                   You allot $10,000 to train the project team on the new materials so that the
                   project will operate smoothly. The $10,000 for training is known as what?
                    A. Cost of quality
                    B. Cost of poor quality
                    C. Sunk costs
                    D. Contingency allowance

           Answers
                1. C. Analogous estimating is based on historical information, which is part of
                   organizational process assets. A, regression analysis, is incorrect, as this choice
                   describes the study of a project regressing so that it may move forward. B is
                   incorrect, as this is the most reliable cost estimating technique and is based on
                   the current project's WBS. D, enterprise environmental factors, is a term that
                   describes the internal policies and procedures a project manager must follow
                   within the project. For more information, see the PMBOK, Section 7.1.2.1.
                2. C. Bottom-up estimating takes the longest to complete of all the estimating
                   approaches, but it is also the most reliable approach. A, top-down estimating,
                   is also known as analogous estimating, and it is not reliable. B, top-down
                   budgeting, is not a valid term for this question. D, parametric estimating, is an
                   approach that predicts the project costs based on a parameter, such as cost per
                   hour, cost per unit, or cost per usage. For more information, see the PMBOK,
                   Section 7.1.2.3.
                3. A. The cost change control system defines how changes to the cost baseline
                   may be approved. Choices B, C, and D are all invalid choices. For more
                   information, see the PMBOK, Section 7.3.2.1.
                4. B. Earned value is found by multiplying the percentage of the project that is
                   completed by the project's budget at completion. In this instance, it's $75,000.
                   Choices A, C, and D are all incorrect. For more information, see the PMBOK,
                   Section 7.3.2.2.
                5. D. Bottom-up estimating is typically more expensive to do than other
                   estimating approaches, because of the time required to create this type of
                   estimate. A, B, and C are all accurate attributes of a bottom-up estimate. For
                   more information, see the PMBOK, Section 7.1.2.3.
                                                                   Chapter 7: Managing Project Costs

 6. B. The opportunity cost is the amount of the project that the organization
    cannot do. A is incorrect, as the $12,000 represents the difference between the
    two projects. C, $229,000, is incorrect, as this is the amount of the LB project.
    D is incorrect because this is not an accurate statement. For more information,
    see the Exam Tip earlier in this chapter.
 7. C. This is an example of a variable cost, since the cost of the training will
    fluctuate, based on the number of participants that choose to come to the




                                                                                                       PART II
    project session. A is incorrect, as fixed costs do not vary. B is incorrect, as
    parametric costs can be identified as cost per unit. D is incorrect, as indirect
    costs are a way to describe costs that may be shared between projects. For
    more information, see the section "Determining the Cost of Resources" in
    this chapter.
 8. A. This is an example of a fixed cost. The cost of the equipment will remain
    uniform, or fixed, throughout the duration of the project. B is incorrect, as
    parametric costs can be identified as cost per unit. C is incorrect, as the cost of
    the equipment does not fluctuate. D is incorrect, as indirect costs are a way to
    describe costs that may be shared between projects. For more information, see
    the section "Determining the Cost of Resources" earlier in this chapter.
 9. C. The CPI is found by dividing the earned value by the actual costs. A is
    incorrect, as the project is not performing at 100 percent. B is incorrect, as
    "89" is not the same value of C. D is an incorrect calculation of the CPI. For
    more information, see the PMBOK, Section 7.3.2.2.
10. B. The WBS is needed in order to create a definitive cost estimate. This is the
    most accurate estimate type, but it also takes the longest to complete. Choices
    A, C, and D are all incorrect, as these items are not required to complete a
    definitive estimate. For more information, see the PMBOK, Section 7.1.2.
11. C. Sole source is the best choice, as it describes the marketplace condition
    in which only one vendor can provide the goods or services your project
    requires. A, constraint, is not a valid market condition. B, single source,
    describes the marketplace condition in which there are multiple vendors
    that can provide the goods or services your project demands, but you prefer
    to work with just one in particular. D, an oligopoly, is a market condition in
    which the actions of one vendor affect the actions of the other vendors. For
    more information, see the PMBOK, Section 7.1.1.1.
12. A. Team member recollections are the least reliable input to cost estimating.
    Choices B, C, and D are all valid inputs to the cost estimating process. For
    more information, see the PMBOK, Section 7.1.1.2.
13. A. The cost of the pea gravel is a parametric estimate. B, analogous, is not
    a correct choice, as no other project cost estimate is being referenced. C,
    bottom-up, is not described in this instance, as the WBS and each work
    package is not being estimated for cost. D, top-down estimating, is another
    name for A, analogous estimating, so this choice is invalid. For more
    information, see the PMBOK, Section 7.1.2.4.

               14. C. Commercial databases often provide resource cost rates for project
                   estimating, so this is the correct answer for this question. A, B, and D do
                   not include resource cost rates, so these choices are all incorrect. For more
                   information, see the PMBOK, Section 7.1.2.2.
               15. D. The team members that the project manager will utilize are not included in
                   the cost estimate. The project manager will include the project scope of work,
                   the assumptions made, and the constraints considered when creating a cost
                   estimate, so choices A, B, and C are incorrect answers. For more information,
                   see the PMBOK, Section 7.1.3.2.
               16. A. The formula for this instance, because the conditions experienced were
                   atypical, is ETC = BAC-EV. The formula for Linda's project would be ETC =
                   $275,000-$82,500. B, C, and D are all incorrect calculations of the estimate to
                   complete the formula. For more information, see the PMBOK, Section 7.3.2.3.
               17. D. The earned value is simply the percent complete times the BAC. In this
                   instance, the project's budget was $750,000, and since the project is 100
                   percent complete, the answer is D. Choices A, B, and C are all incorrect.
                   For more information, see the PMBOK, Section 7.3.2.
               18. B. The formula for this problem is variance at completion minus the
                   actual costs for the project. A, C, and D are all incorrect choices. For more
                   information, see the PMBOK, Section 7.3.2.3.
               19. B. Because Marty has a variance, he needs to complete a variance report. A
                   variance report is also known as an exceptions report, so B is the best answer.
                   A, status reports, are used to communicate the status of the project, not
                   the variances. C is not a valid report type. D, lessons learned, is an ongoing
                   project document, not a report type. For more information, see the PMBOK,
                   Section 7.3.3.
               20. A. Training for the project team is known as the cost of quality. B, the cost of
                   poor quality, is incorrect because this would be the costs the project would
                   incur if it did not ascertain the expected level of quality. Sunk costs describe
                   the monies that have been spent on a project already, so C is not correct. D,
                   contingency allowance, is an amount of fund allotted to cover cost overruns
                   in a project. For more information, see the PMBOK, Section 7.1.2.8.

    In this chapter, you will

       * Work with quality assurance programs
       * Perform quality control
       * Recognize the quality control charts




 What good does it do anyone if a project is launched and the monies and time are con-
 sumed by the project execution, but the quality of the project's deliverable is unaccept-
 able? Imagine a project to build a new house, and at the project's completion, the house is
 tilting to one side, the windows all have cracks and holes in them, and the roof has obvi-
 ous gaps for the rain and birds. This is not, I'm sure, what the homeowners had in mind.
     Fortunately, in project management--in good project management--there are
 mechanisms in place to plan and implement quality throughout the project and not just
 as an afterthought. Project quality management is all about the project manager, the
 project team, and the performing organization working together to ensure that the proj-
 ect performs as the project plan calls for so that the project deliverable is in alignment
 with the project scope statement. Quality in a project is really all about creating a deliv-
 erable that satisfies the project requirements and is usable. It's about getting the project
 done and creating a deliverable that can actually be used by the project customer.
     According to the American Society for Quality (ASQ), which the Project Manage-
 ment Body of Knowledge (PMBOK) quotes, "Quality is the degree to which a set of
 inherent characteristics fulfill requirements." Well, isn't that interesting? Let's go back
 in time. A project is launched and a project charter is issued to the project manager.
 Then the project manager and the project team create what document? The project
 scope statement. The project scope statement defines all of the requirements for the
 project, including what's in and what's out of scope. Quality is, therefore, satisfying
 everything that the project scope statement requires.
     The PMBOK says that "stated and implied needs are the needs to developing project
 requirements." In the project scope statement, we define what the project will create, its
 requirements for acceptance, and the metrics to measure the project's success. In project
 quality management, we plan quality into the project, inspect the project and deliver-
 ables for the existence of quality, and then move towards the scope verification process,
 which confirms that you've created what your customer expected. Quality is about de-
 livering on promises.
                                                                                         235

               No discussion on quality is complete without a nod to our pal W. Edwards Deming.
           You likely won't need to know much about Deming for the exam, other than his famed
           Plan-Do-Check-Act cycle. (I highly recommend Mary B. Walton's book The Deming
           Management Method for the complete story of Deming--maybe after you pass your
           Project Management Institute [PMI] examination.) For your PMP and CAPM exams,
           know that Deming's philosophy on quality management considers customer satisfac-
           tion, prevention over inspection, a call for management responsibility, and a desire to
           do the work correctly the first time to be paramount.

                         VIDEO     Examining quality control.


               This chapter, I believe, is core to PMI's idea of project integration management. If
           quality suffers, then all of the knowledge areas are affected by the absence of quality.
           You can also see the effect on integration management if any of the other knowledge
           areas suffers in performance. Quality is directly affected by all of the other areas of proj-
           ect management, and there is equal impact on all the other knowledge areas if quality
           is missing. It's a busy, two-way street.

           Planning for Quality (PMBOK, Section 8.1)
           Quality planning is the process of first determining which quality standards are rele-
           vant to your project and then finding out the best methods of adhering to those quality
           standards. This is a great example of project integration management, which was re-
           ferred to earlier. Quality planning is core to the planning process group, as each knowl-
           edge area has relevant standards that affect quality, and quality planning is integrated
           into each planning process.
                In other words, if a project manager rushes through planning for each of the knowl-
           edge areas, then quality is likely to suffer. When change requests are proposed, the im-
           pact of each change request is considered on each of the knowledge areas. You already
           know that a change request could have a financial impact, a schedule impact, and
           more. Quality management asks: What impact does quality have on this proposed
           change, and what impact does this change have on the overall quality of the project?
                Throughout the project planning, the focus is on reaching the project completion
           by satisfying the project requirements. Quality is fleshed into all of the project plan-
           ning. The foundation of quality planning states that quality is planned into the project,
           not inspected in. In other words, by planning how to achieve the expected level of qual-
           ity and then executing the project plan, it's easier, more cost effective, and less stressful
           for everyone involved than catching and fixing mistakes as the project moves towards
           completion. Like my dad used to say, "Do it right the first time."
                There are just four inputs when planning for quality in a project, and you've seen
           them all before:
                * Enterprise environmental factors You know that enterprise environmental
                  factors are the policies and procedures your organization must adhere to. In
                  particular, the enterprise environmental factors I'm discussing here are those
                  mandates that affect the application area your project is dealing with. In other
                                                                       Chapter 8: Managing Project Quality

                                                                                                     237
       words, construction projects are going to have different codes and regulations
       to adhere to than a project to bake a million cookies.
     * Organizational process assets These are the methods of operation
       your organization follows and the guidelines that are specific to your
       organization. Historical information, lessons learned, and guidelines within
       your organization are there for the project managers to rely on. Within the
       organization, a quality policy may have been issued by senior management




                                                                                                             PART II
       for all projects to adhere to--this is part of organizational process assets. And
       what if a quality policy doesn't exist? It's up to the project management team
       to create one for their project.
     * Project scope statement The project scope statement is needed because it
       defines all of the project requirements and the expectations of the project
       customer. By satisfying the requirements in the project scope statement,
       nothing less or more, quality can be achieved. The goal of project quality
       management is to satisfy the acceptance criteria for the project as defined in
       the project scope statement.
     * Project management plan This shouldn't be a surprise. All of the subsidiary
       plans in the project plan are needed to see quality's impact on each knowledge
       area and vice versa.

Using Quality Planning Tools
There are several tools the project manager and the project team can use to plan for
quality in the project. The goal of all of these tools is to plan quality into the project
rather than attempt to inspect quality into the project. In other words, do the work right
the first time. Let's take a look at these tools and how the project manager and the proj-
ect team can use them to their benefit.

Using a Cost-Benefit Analysis
Ever go shopping and compare prices? For example, you might consider the cost of two cars
in relation to features both cars provide. Or you might consider hiring a more experienced
worker because he or she has some competencies that make the extra dollars worth the
costs. Part of planning for quality is moving through this process of cost-benefits analysis.
    Using a cost-benefits analysis is more than just considering how much for features
and materials used in the project deliverable, although that is part of the process. Cost-
benefits analysis also considers the cost of completing the project work and the best
approach to achieving quality in the project in relation to the monies to complete the
work. For example, you could always use senior engineers to complete even the most
menial tasks, but that wouldn't be a good use of their time or of the monies to pay for
the senior engineers' time. Figure 8-1 is an example of using a cost-benefits analysis.
    Cost-benefits analysis is simply the study of the quality received in proportion to
the cost to reach those quality expectations. The project management team must under-
stand how much monies are appropriate to spend to reach satisfaction from the project
customer. If the project spends too much to reach a level of quality that is far beyond
what the customer expects, or wants, then that's waste. The same is true if the project
team does less than the level of quality the customer expects and rework is needed.

           Figure 8-1 Quality should meet, not exceed, customer's expectations.

           Benchmarking Performance
           Benchmarking is simply comparing two similar things to measure which one performs
           best. For example, you could benchmark the same activities on two different computers,
           test-drive several different cars, or even benchmark an organization before and after a
           project. Benchmarking, in regards to quality planning, examines project practices against
           other projects to measure performance, and then selects the best practices for perfor-
           mance in the current project.

           Using Design of Experiments
           The design of experiments approach relies on statistical what-if scenarios to determine
           what variables within a project will result in the best outcome. This type of approach is
           most often used on the product of the project rather than the project itself. For example,
           a project team creating a new bicycle may experiment with the width of the tires, the
           weight of the frame, and the position of the handlebars in relation to the bike seat to
           determine the most comfortable ride at an acceptable cost to the consumer.
               Although design of experiments is most often associated with product design, it can be
           applied to project management activities. For example, a project manager may evaluate the
           activities within a project and determine the time and cost of activities, depending on
           which employees are assigned to complete the work. A more experienced worker may cost
           the project more money on an hourly basis, but this individual is expected to complete the
           work in a third of the time that a less experienced worker would. This is design of experi-
           ments: experimenting with different variables to find the best solution at the best cost.
               Design of experiments is also used as a method to identify which variables within a
           project or product are causing failures or unacceptable results. The goal of design of
           experiments is to isolate the root cause of an effect and then make adjustments to that
           cause to eliminate the unacceptable results.
                                                                       Chapter 8: Managing Project Quality

                                                                                                     239
Considering the Cost of Quality
The cost of quality (COQ) is a consideration of how much must be spent to achieve the
expected level of quality within the project. There are two types of costs directly tied to
quality:

     * Cost of quality This is the cost associated with the monies spent to ascertain
       the expected level of quality. For example, training, safety issues, and purchasing




                                                                                                             PART II
       the right equipment and materials all contribute to the expected levels of quality.
       This is sometimes called the cost of conformance to quality.
     * Cost of poor quality This is the cost associated with not satisfying the cost
       expectations. For example, if the project manager does not train the project team,
       or if the correct materials are not used in the project implementation, quality
       will suffer and additional costs will be incurred to do the work over. Cost of poor
       quality can also result in rejected deliverables, loss of sales and customers, and, if
       safety concerns are not kept, there could be loss of life or limb.

Using Other Quality Planning Tools
There are lots of other tools and approaches the project manager can use to plan for
quality within the project. The PMBOK just lumps these into one section (Section
8.1.2.5), so I recommend that you be aware of these tools, but don't invest too much
time learning the ins and outs of each of these:

     * Brainstorming                               * Matrix diagrams
     * Affinity diagrams                           * Flowcharts
     * Force field analysis                        * Prioritization matrices
     * Nominal group techniques


Creating the Quality Management Plan
The end result of the quality planning phase is to find a method to implement the qual-
ity policy. Because planning is iterative, the quality planning sessions often require
several revisits to the quality planning processes. On longer projects, there may be
scheduled quality planning sessions to compare the performance of the project in rela-
tion to the quality that was planned.
    One of the major outputs of quality planning is the quality management plan. This
document describes how the project manager and the project team will fulfill the qual-
ity policy. In an ISO 9000 environment, the quality management plan is referred to as
the "project quality system." The quality management plan addresses the following
three things about the project and the project work:

     * Quality control Work results are monitored to see if they meet relevant quality
       standards. If the results do not meet the quality standards, the project manager
       applies root cause analysis to determine the cause of the poor performance and
       then eliminates the cause. Quality control is inspection-oriented.
CAPM/PMP Project Management Certification All-in-One Exam Guide
240
                * Quality assurance The overall performance is evaluated to ensure that the
                  project meets the relevant quality standards. Quality assurance maps to an
                  organization's quality policy and is typically a managerial process. Quality
                  assurance is generally considered the work of applying the quality plan.
                * Quality improvement The project performance is measured and evaluated,
                  and corrective actions are applied to improve the product and the project.
                  The improvements can be large or small, depending on the condition and the
                  quality philosophy of the performing organization.

           Establishing Quality Metrics
           You need some quality metrics. If you don't measure, then your project cannot im-
           prove. Specifically, I'm talking about the quantifiable terms and values to measure a
           process, activity, or work result. An example of a quality metrics is an expected value for
           the required torque to tighten a bolt on a piece of equipment. By testing and measuring
           the torque, the operational definition would prove or disprove the quality of the prod-
           uct. Other examples can include hours of labor to complete a work package, required
           safety measures, cost per unit, and so on.
                Operational definitions are clear, concise measurements. Designating that 95 per-
           cent of all customer service calls should be answered by a live person within 30 seconds
           is a metric. A statement that all calls should be answered in a timely manner is not.

           Applying Checklists
           Checklists are simple approaches to ensure that work is completed according to the
           quality policy. It's usually a list of activities that workers will check off as each task is
           completed. Checklists can be quick instructions of what needs to be done to clean a
           piece of equipment or questions that remind the employee to complete a task: "Did
           you turn off the printer before opening the cover?"

           Creating the Process Improvement Plan
           One of the goals of quality project management is continuous process improvement.
           The process improvement plan looks to improve the project, not just the end result of
           the project. Its aim is to identify and eliminate waste and non-value-added activity.
           Specifically, this plan aims to accomplish the following:
                * Increase customer value by eliminating waste within the project
                * Establish process boundaries
                * Determine process configuration through a flowchart for evaluation and
                  analysis in order to improve the project as a whole
                * Process metrics within the project
                * Establish targets for performance improvement

           Updating the Baseline and the Project Management Plan
           Just as there is a baseline for costs, schedule, and scope, there is also a baseline for quality.
           The quality baseline records and compares the quality objectives for the project. It's the
                                                                    Chapter 8: Managing Project Quality

                                                                                                  241
measurement of the project performance and the quality of the project objectives. The
variances show the project management team where the project should be improving.
    The project management plan includes two plans that are outputs of quality plan-
ning: the quality management plan and the process improvement plan. Based on the
outputs of quality management planning, the project plan can be updated to reflect
how the expected level of quality will be achieved. As usual, changes to the project
scope that change the project plan will also need to be examined for their impact on




                                                                                                          PART II
quality or the processes of the project. In addition, the project team's work to complete
the changes may affect the quality of the deliverable.


Performing Quality Assurance
(PMBOK, Section 8.2)
Quality assurance (QA) is the sum of the planning and the implementations of the
plans the project manager, the project team, and management do to ensure that the
project meets the demands of quality. QA is not something that is done only at the end
of the project, but before and during the project as well.
    In some organizations, the quality assurance department or another entity will
complete the QA activities. QA is interested in finding any defects and then fixing the
problems. There are many different approaches to QA, depending on the quality sys-
tem the organization or project team has adapted. There are two types of QA:
     * Internal QA Assurance provided to management and the project team
     * External QA Assurance provided to the external customers of the project

Preparing for Quality Assurance
There are several inputs the project manager and the project team will need to prepare
for QA:
     * The quality management plan This plan defines how the project team will
       implement and fulfill the quality policy of the performing organization.
     * Quality metrics Quality control tests will provide these measurements.
       The values must be quantifiable so that results may be measured, compared,
       and analyzed. In other words, "pretty close to on track" is not adequate; "95
       percent pass rate" is more acceptable.
     * The process improvement plan        This plan aims to improve the project, not
       just the project's product.
     * Work performance information This contains the results of the project
       work as needed, including technical performance measures, project status,
       information on what the project has created to date, corrective actions, and
       performance reports.
     * Approved change requests Change requests that have been approved and
       fleshed into the project are needed, because their existence may bear on the
       content of the quality management plan, the quality of the project processes,
       and the project deliverable. All changes should be formally documented.
CAPM/PMP Project Management Certification All-in-One Exam Guide
242
                * Results of quality control The measures taken by the project manager and
                  the project team to inspect the project deliverables' quality are fed back into
                  the QA process.
                * Implemented actions Any change requests, defect repairs, corrective
                  actions, or preventive actions that have been taken in the project should
                  be documented and submitted to the QA process.

           Applying Quality Assurance
           The QA department, management, or, in some instances, even the project manager can
           complete the requirements for QA. QA can be accomplished using the following tools,
           the same tools used during quality planning:

                * Cost-benefit analysis
                * Benchmarking
                * Flowcharting
                * Design of experiments
                * Cost of quality

           Completing a Quality Audit
           Quality audits are about learning. The idea of a quality audit is to identify the lessons
           learned on the current project to determine how to make things better for this proj-
           ect--as well as for other projects within the organization. The idea is that Susan the
           project manager can learn from the implementations of Bob the project manager and
           vice versa.
               Quality audits are formal reviews of what's been completed within a project, what
           worked, and what didn't work. The end result of the audit is improved performance for
           the current project, other projects, or the entire organization.
               Quality audits can be scheduled at key intervals within a project or--surprise!--
           they can come without warning. The audit process can vary, depending on who is com-
           pleting the audit: internal auditors or hired, third-party experts.

           Improving the Project
           The lone output of QA? Quality improvement. But it's not just the quality of the proj-
           ect's deliverables, but also of the process to complete the project work. This is process
           analysis, and it follows the guidelines of the process improvement plan. Process analy-
           sis is completed through any or all of the following measures:
                * An examination of problems or constraints
                * An analysis of the project for non-value-added activities
                * Root cause analysis
                * The creation of preventive actions for identified problems
               Quality improvement requires action to improve the project's effectiveness. The ac-
           tions to improve the effectiveness may have to be routed through the change control
                                                                     Chapter 8: Managing Project Quality

                                                                                                   243
system, which means change requests, analysis of the costs and risks, and involvement
from the change control board (CCB).


Performing Quality Control (PMBOK, Section 8.3)
This is the section of the project where the project manager and the project team have
control and influence. QA, for the most part, is specific to your organization, and the




                                                                                                           PART II
project manager doesn't have much control over the QA processes--he just has to do
them. Quality control (QC), on the other hand, is specific to the project manager, so
there are lots of activities for the project manager to do.

             EXAM TIP Pay close attention to the quality control mechanisms--there are
             things the project manager has control over in every project.

     Quality control requires the project manager, or another qualified party, to monitor
and measure project results to determine that they are up to the demands of the qual-
ity standards. If the results are unsatisfactory, root cause analysis follows the quality
control processes. Root cause analysis is needed so that the project manager can deter-
mine the cause and apply corrective actions. On the whole, QC occurs throughout the
life of a project, not just at its end.
     QC is not only concerned with the product the project is creating, but also with the
project management processes. QC measures performance, scheduling, and cost vari-
ances. The experience of the project should be of quality--not just the product the
project creates. Consider a project manager who demands that the project team work
extreme hours to meet an unrealistic deadline; team morale suffers and likely so does
the project work the team is completing.
     The project team should do the following to ensure competency in quality control:

     * Conduct statistical quality control measures, such as sampling and probability
     * Inspect the product to keep errors away from the customer
     * Perform attribute sampling to measure conformance to quality on a per-unit basis
     * Conduct variable sampling to measure the degree of conformance
     * Study special causes to determine anomalies to quality
     * Research random causes to determine expected variances of quality
     * Check the tolerance range to determine if the results are within or without
       an acceptable level of quality
     * Observe control limits to determine if the results are in or out of quality control

Preparing for Quality Control
Quality control relies on several inputs, such as the following:

     * The quality management plan This defines how QA will be applied to the
       project, the expectations of quality control, and the organization's approach
       for continuous process improvement.
CAPM/PMP Project Management Certification All-in-One Exam Guide
244
                * Work results The results of both the project processes and the product
                  results are needed to measure the results of the project team's work and
                  compare it to the quality standards. The expected results of the product and
                  the project can be measured from the project plan.
                * Quality metrics The operational definitions that define the metrics for the
                  project are needed so that QC can measure and react to the results of project
                  performance.
                * Quality checklists If the project is using checklists to ensure that project
                  work is completed, copies of the checklists will be needed as part of quality
                  control. The checklists can then serve as indicators of completed work, as well
                  as expected results.
                * Approved change requests Approved change requests have an effect on how
                  the project work is scheduled and performed, which may affect the project's
                  overall quality.

           Inspecting Results
           Although quality is planned into a project, not inspected in, inspections are needed to
           prove conformance to the requirements. An inspection can be done on the project as a
           whole, on a portion of the project work, on the project deliverable, or even on an indi-
           vidual activity. Inspections are also known as:
                * Reviews
                * Product reviews
                * Audits
                * Walkthroughs

           Creating a Flow Chart
           Technically, a flowchart is any diagram illustrating how components within a system
           are related. An organizational flowchart shows the bottom crew of operations up to the
           "little squirt" on top. A heating, ventilation, and air conditioning (HVAC) blueprint
           shows how the air flows through a building from the furnace to each room. Flowcharts
           show the relation between components, as well as help the project team determine
           where quality issues may be present and, once done, plan accordingly.
                There are two types of flowcharts you'll need to be concerned with for these exams:
                * Cause-and-effect diagrams These diagrams show the relation between
                  the variables within a process and how those relations may contribute to
                  inadequate quality. They can help organize both the process and team
                  opinions, as well as generate discussion on finding a solution to ensure
                  quality. Figure 8-2 is an example of a cause-and-effect diagram. These
                  diagrams are also known as Ishikawa diagrams and fishbone diagrams.

                         EXAM TIP A cause-and-effect diagram is also called an Ishikawa diagram--
                         same thing, just a fancier name.

      * System or process flowcharts These flowcharts illustrate the flow of a
        process through a system, such as a project change request through the change
        control system or work authorization through a quality control process. A
        process flowchart does not have to be limited to the project management
        activities. It could instead demonstrate how a manufacturer creates, packages,
        and ships the product to the customer, as seen in Figure 8-3.

Creating a Control Chart
Ever feel like your project is out of control? A control chart can prove it.
    Control charts illustrate the performance of a project over time. They map the re-
sults of inspections against a chart, as seen in Figure 8-4. Control charts are typically
used in projects or operations where there are repetitive activities--such as manufactur-
ing, a series of tests, or help desks.
    The outer limits of a control chart are set by the customer requirements. Within the
customer requirements are the upper control limits (UCLs) and the lower control limits
(LCLs). The UCL is typically set at +3 or +6 sigma, while the LCL is set at -3 or -6 sigma.
Sigma results show the degree of correctness. Table 8-1 outlines the four sigma values
representing normal distribution. You'll need to know these for the Project Manage-
ment Professional (PMP) exam.




Figure 8-3 Flowcharts demonstrate how processes within a system are related.

        Figure 8-4 Control charts demonstrate the results of inspections.

                So what happened to sigma four and five? Nothing. They're still there; it's just that the
           difference between three sigma at 99.73 and six sigma at 99.99 is so small that statisticians
           just jump to six sigma. The mean in a control chart represents the expected result, while
           the sigma values represent the expected spread of results based on the inspection. A true
           six sigma allows only two defects per million opportunities, and the percentage to repre-
           sent that value is 99.99985 percent. For the exam, you can go with the 99.99 percent.
                For example, if a manufacturer creates 1,000 units per hour and expects 50 units
           each hour to be defective, the mean would be 950 units. If the control limits were set at
           +/- three sigma, the results of testing would actually expect up to 953 correct units and
           down to 947 correct units.
                Over time, the results of testing are plotted in the control chart. Whenever a result
           of testing is plotted beyond the upper or lower control values, it is considered to be "out
           of control." When a value is out of control, there is a reason why--it's called an assign-
           able cause. Something caused the results to change for better or for worse, and the result
           must be investigated to understand the why behind the occurrence.
                Another assignable cause is the Rule of Seven. The Rule of Seven states that whenever
           seven consecutive results are all on one side of the mean, this is an assignable cause. Thus,
           there's been some change that caused the results to shift to one side of the expected mean.
           Again, the cause must be investigated to determine why the change happened.
                While control charts are easily associated with recurring activities, like manufactur-
           ing, they can also be applied to project management. Consider the number of expected
           change requests, delays within a project, and other recurring activities. A control chart
           can plot out these activities to measure performance, positive and negative results, and
           track corrective actions.

Creating Pareto Diagrams
A Pareto diagram is somewhat related to Pareto's Law: 80 percent of the problems come
from 20 percent of the issues. This is also known as the 80/20 Rule. A Pareto diagram
illustrates the problems by assigned cause from smallest to largest, as Figure 8-5 shows.
The project team should first work on the larger problems and then move on to the
smaller problems.

Creating a Histogram
A histogram is a bar chart showing the frequency of variables within a project. For ex-
ample, a histogram could show which states have the most customers. Within project
management, a common histogram is a resource histogram that shows the frequency
of resources used on project work.

Creating a Run Chart
A run chart, as Figure 8-6 shows, is a line graph that shows the results of inspection in
the order in which they've occurred. The goals of a run chart are to first demonstrate the
results of a process over time and then use trend analysis to predict when certain trends
may reemerge. Based on this information, an organization can work to prevent the
negative trend or work to capitalize on an identified opportunity.

Creating a Scatter Diagram
A scatter diagram is like a run chart, but it instead tracks the relationship between two vari-
ables. The two variables are considered related the closer they track against a diagonal line.
For example, a project manager could track the performance of two team members, the
time and cost, or even changes between functional managers and the project's schedule.

Completing a Statistical Sampling
Statistical sampling is the process of choosing a percentage of results at random. For
example, a project creating a medical device may have 20 percent of all units randomly
selected to check quality. This process must be completed on a consistent basis through-
out the project, rather than on a sporadic schedule.

              Statistical sampling can reduce the costs of quality control, but mixed results can fol-
           low if an adequate testing plan and schedule are not followed. The science of statistical
           sampling (and its requirements to be effective) is an involved process. There are many
           books, seminars, and professionals devoted to the process. For the Certified Associate in
           Project Management (CAPM) and PMP exams, know that statistical sampling uses a per-
           centage of the results to test for quality. This process can reduce quality control cost.

           Revisiting Flowcharting
           Flowcharting uses charts to illustrate how the different parts of a system operate. This is
           valuable in quality control, because the process can be evaluated and tested to deter-
           mine where in the process quality begins to break down. Corrective actions can then be
           applied to the system to ensure that quality continues as planned--and as expected.

           Applying Trend Analysis
           Trend analysis is the science of taking past results to predict future performance. Sports
           announcers use trend analysis all the time: "The Cubs have never won in St. Louis on a
           Tuesday night in the month of July when the temperature at the top of the third inning
           was above 80 degrees."
               The results of trend analysis allow the project manager to apply corrective action to
           intervene and prevent unacceptable outcomes. Trend analysis on a project requires ade-
           quate records to predict results and set current expectations. It can monitor the following:
                   * Technical performance Trends analysis can ask, "How many errors have
                     been experienced up to this point in the project schedule, and how many
                     additional errors were encountered?"
                   * Cost and schedule performance Trend analysis can ask, "How many activities
                     were completed incorrectly, came in late, or had significant cost variances?"

           Examining Quality Control Results
           Quality control should, first and foremost, result in quality improvement. The project
           manager and project team, based on the results of the tools and techniques to imple-
                                                                     Chapter 8: Managing Project Quality

                                                                                                   249
ment quality control, apply corrective actions to prevent unacceptable quality and to
improve the overall quality of the project management processes.
   The corrective actions and the defect repairs the project manager and the project
team want to incorporate into the project may require change requests and manage-
ment approval. The value and importance of the change should be evident so that the
improvement to quality is approved and folded into the project. In addition to quality
improvement, there are other results of quality control:




                                                                                                           PART II
     * Acceptance decisions The work results are either accepted or rejected.
       Rejected items typically mean rework.
     * Rework Nonconformance to quality results in rework. Rework costs time
       and money and contributes to projects being late, over budget, or both. It
       is always more cost-effective to do the work right the first time than to do it
       correct the second.
     * Completed checklists If the project is using checklists to confirm the
       completion of work, then the completed checklists should become part of
       the project records. Some project managers require the project team member
       completing the checklists to initial them as whole and complete.
     * Process adjustments When results of inspections indicate quality is out
       of control, then process adjustments may be needed to make immediate
       corrective actions or planned preventative actions to ensure that quality
       improves. Process adjustments, depending on their nature, may qualify for a
       change request and be funneled through the change control system as part of
       integration management.
     * Recommendations The project manager and the project team can also make
       recommendations for additional defect repairs, preventative actions, corrective
       actions, and even additional change requests.


Chapter Summary
What good is a project deliverable if it doesn't work, is unacceptable, or is faulty? Proj-
ect quality management ensures that the deliverables project teams create meet the ex-
pectations of the stakeholders. For your CAPM or PMP examination, quality means
delivering the project at the exact level of the design specifications and of the project
scope--no more, no less.
    Grade and quality are two different things. Grade is the ranking assigned to differ-
ent components that have the same functional purpose. For example, sheet metal may
come in different grades based on what it is needed for. Another example is the grade
of paper based on its thickness, ability to retain ink, and so on. Low quality is always a
problem; low grade may not be.
    Quality planning happens before project work begins, but also as work is com-
pleted. Quality planning can confirm the preexistence of quality or the need for quality
improvements. Quality is planned into a project, not inspected in. However, quality
control uses inspections to prove the existence of quality within a project deliverable.
    The cost of quality is concerned with the monies invested in the project to ascertain
the expected level of quality. Examples of these costs include training, safety measures,

           and quality management activities. The cost of nonconformance centers on the monies
           lost by not completing the project work correctly the first time. In addition, this fee
           includes the loss of sales, loss of customers, and downtime within the project.
               Quality assurance is prevention-driven and is a management process. Quality con-
           trol is inspection-driven and is a project process. On your PMI exam, keep those two
           thoughts separate and you'll be ahead of the game.

                   manager and are working
                   with the project team
                   to determine the best
                   computer system for the project. You and the project team decide to measure
                   the performance of both systems to determine which one performs best. This
                   is an example of which one of the following?
                    A. Cost-benefit analysis
                    B. Benchmarking

               16. A project manager has elected not to enforce safety measures on his
                   construction project. One of the project team members has been injured
                                                                 Chapter 8: Managing Project Quality

    because of this oversight, and the job site is closed until an investigation into
    the lack of safety measures is completed. The project will now likely be late,
    be fined for the error, and will lose profitability with the customer. This is an
    example of which one of the following?
    A. Risk
    B. Trigger




                                                                                                       PART II

                    D. Ishikawa diagram

           Answers
                1. A. QA is concerned
                   with overall project
                   quality performance. B,
                   C, and D are incorrect
                   because they do not
                   correctly explain quality
                   assurance. For more
                   information, see the
                   PMBOK, Section 8.3.
                2. C. Of all the choices
                   presented, this is the
                   best answer. Quality
                   is planned into the
                   project, and the planning requires time. A is incorrect because a project of this
                   nature has been completed before. B is incorrect because there isn't enough
                   information provided to determine what the quality demands of the project are.
                   D is incorrect because quality audits are not part of the planning processes. For
                   more information, see the introduction to Chapter 8 in the PMBOK.
                3. A. Quality planning should be completed prior to the work beginning--and
                   should thereafter be revisited as needed. B is incorrect, since quality management
                   is not an applicable answer to the scenario. C and D are incorrect because QA
                   and QC are part of quality management. For more information, see the PMBOK,
                   Section 8.1.
                4. A. Quality planning is the process of creating a plan to meet the requirements
                   of quality. B, C, and D are incorrect because they do not explain the process in
                   the question's scenario. For more information, see the PMBOK, Section 8.1.
                5. A. A fishbone diagram is the same as an Ishikawa diagram. B, C, and D are
                   incorrect. These charts and diagrams accomplish goals other than the cause-
                   and-effect outcome of the Ishikawa. For more information, see the PMBOK,
                   Section 8.3.2.1.
                6. C. Quality, in regards to the project scope, is about completing the work
                   as promised. A is incorrect because though the project scope will have
                   requirements for acceptance, it may not have metrics for quality defined.
                   B and D are also incorrect. For more information, see the introduction to
                   Chapter 8 in the PMBOK.
                                                                   Chapter 8: Managing Project Quality

                                                                                                 257
 7. D. Quality is prevention-driven. Quality wants to complete the work correctly
    the first time in order to prevent poor results, a loss of time, and a loss of funds.
    A and B are incorrect. There is no guarantee that a project will cost more or less
    depending on the amount of expected quality. Incidentally, lack of quality will
    likely cost more than quality planning because of the cost of nonconformance.
    C is incorrect because quality is planned into a project, not inspected in. For
    more information, see the introduction to Chapter 8 in the PMBOK.




                                                                                                         PART II
 8. B. Training to meet the quality expectations is attributed to the cost of quality.
    A, C, and D are incorrect because these choices do not describe training as a
    cost of quality. For more information, see the PMBOK, Section 8.1.2.4.
 9. C. When project work results are faulty and must be done over, it is attributed
    to the cost of nonconformance to quality. A, B, and D are all incorrect. These
    values do not describe faulty work or the cost of nonconformance. For more
    information, see the PMBOK, Section 8.1.2.4.
10. C. The key words "cause and effect" equate to the Ishikawa diagram. A is
    incorrect. A flowchart will show how a process moves through the system,
    but not the cause and effect of the problems involved. B is incorrect as well.
    A Pareto chart maps out the causes and frequency of problems. D, a control
    chart, plots out the results of sampling, but it doesn't show the cause and
    effect of problems. For more information, see the PMBOK, Section 8.3.2.1.
11. C. Design of experiments uses experiments and "what-if" scenarios to
    determine what variables are affecting quality. A is incorrect because
    design of experiments, in regards to quality, is not interested in changing
    the relationship of activities to complete project work. B and D are also
    incorrect because design of experiments will not be changing project design
    to determine where flaws exist or to become more productive. For more
    information, see the PMBOK, Section 8.1.2.3.
12. A. Checklists are simple but effective quality management tools that the
    project manager can use to ensure that the project team is completing
    the required work. B, C, and D are all incorrect. The WBS, PND, and WBS
    dictionary are not tools the project team can necessarily use to prove they've
    completed required work. Checklists are the best approach for this scenario.
    For more information, see the PMBOK, Section 8.1.3.3.
13. C. Management wants Mark to create a Pareto diagram. Recall that a Pareto
    diagram maps out the causes of defects and illustrates their frequency. A is
    incorrect because a control chart does not identify the problems, only the
    relation of the results to the expected mean. B is incorrect because a cause-
    and-effect diagram does not map out the frequency of problems. D is also
    incorrect. Flowcharts show how a process moves through a system and how the
    components are related. For more information, see the PMBOK, Section 8.3.2.5.
14. C. The circled area shows seven consecutive sampling results, all on one side
    of the mean. This is known as the Rule of Seven, and is an assignable cause.
    A is incorrect. These values are in control. B is correct, but it does not fully
    answer the question as choice C does. D is incorrect, since standard deviation
CAPM/PMP Project Management Certification All-in-One Exam Guide
258
                   is a predicted measure of the variance from the expected mean of a sampling.
                   For more information, see the PMBOK, Section 8.3.2.2.
               15. B. This is an example of benchmarking, as the project team is comparing
                   one system to another. A, the cost-benefit analysis, would compare the
                   costs and associated benefits of each system, rather than just how the two
                   systems compare to each other. C, the design of experiments, is a method that
                   determines which factors influence the variables of the project's deliverable.
                   D is not a valid answer, as the cost of quality is the dollar amount the project
                   must invest in order to achieve the expected level of quality. For more
                   information, see the PMBOK, Section 8.1.2.
               16. C. This is an example of the cost of poor quality. The project manager should
                   have followed the safety measures for the job site, and costs associated with the
                   safety measures are considered part of D, the cost of quality. A is incorrect because
                   risk is inherent to application work, while the ramifications of not enforcing
                   the safety measures is an example of the cost of poor quality. B, trigger, is a
                   risk management term that references a condition or warning sign that a risk is
                   coming into the project. For more information, see the PMBOK, Section 8.1.2.4.
               17. D. This is an example of a quality audit to confirm that your project
                   is adhering to the quality assurance program established within your
                   organization. A and B are incorrect choices for this question. C, enterprise
                   environmental factors, may be a valid characteristic of the total quality
                   management program, but it is not the best answer for the question, which
                   centers on the audit process rather than on how the audit will be performed.
                   For more information, see the PMBOK, Section 8.2.2.2.
               18. A. The circled area shows out-of-control data points. B is incorrect as in-
                   control data points do not best answer the question. C is incorrect, as the
                   Rule of Seven refers to seven consecutive measurements, all on one side of
                   the mean. D is incorrect, since standard deviation is a predicted measure of the
                   variance from the expected mean of a sampling. For more information, see
                   the PMBOK, Section 8.3.2.2.
               19. C. You want to create a Pareto diagram. A is incorrect because a control chart
                   does not identify the problems, only the relation of the results to the expected
                   mean. B is incorrect because a cause-and-effect diagram does not map out the
                   frequency of problems. D is also incorrect. Flowcharts show how a process
                   moves through a system and how the components are related. For more
                   information, see the PMBOK, Section 8.3.2.5.
               20. A. This is a Pareto chart. B is incorrect, as a control chart shows the results of
                   measurements over time. C and D are both incorrect, as a fishbone diagram
                   and an Ishikawa diagram are essentially the same type of chart. For more
                   information, see the PMBOK, Section 8.3.2.3.
    Managing Project
    Human Resources
                                                                                CHAPTER


                                                                                               9
    In this chapter, you will
       * Plan for human resources
       * Acquire the project team
       * Develop the project team
       * Manage the project team




 Your project relies on people to get the work done. Those people, your project team,
 look to you, the project manager, to provide leadership, direction, motivation, and
 your general management skills to help them know what their project assignments are,
 get their work done, and resolve issues and dilemmas within the project.

     It's a blast! Okay, that's a bit of sarcasm. In reality, and on your Project Management
 Institute (PMI) examination, the resources involved with the project know what is ex-
 pected of them by the project manager, management, and the stakeholders, and then
 they complete those expectations. And if they don't? Then it's up to the project man-
 ager, the functional managers, and even the other project team members to enforce the
 project's ground rules so that all team members work toward the requirements in the
 project scope statement.

                VIDEO     Exploring human resource theories.


     The type of organizational structure, from functional to projectized, will also influ-
 ence how the project manager may discipline, motivate, and manage the project team.
 In a functional environment, the project manager won't have much autonomy to disci-
 pline or offer rewards beyond what management has deemed appropriate. In a projec-
 tized structure, for example, the project manager has much more autonomy to both
 discipline and reward.
     A subset of the project team is the project management team--you've seen this term
 already in this book. The project management team is the core group of project team
 members that help with the project management decision. Sometimes, this bunch of
 folks may also be called the core, executive, or leadership team. Your pal, the project
                                                                                        259

           sponsor, works directly with you, the project manager, and the project management team
           to help the team make the best decisions and to keep the project moving forward.
               For your PMI examination, you'll need to know some vital facts about managing
           the project team. We'll cover these vital facts in this chapter.


           Planning for Human Resources
           Here we go again. Have you noticed that every knowledge area for your PMI examina-
           tion starts with a planning process? Hmmm, I hope so. Planning is an iterative process
           that begins early in the project and continues through the project management life cy-
           cle. Planning for project human resources is vital to a successful project--after all,
           you've got to plan how the project work will be completed and which resources will
           complete that work.
               When it comes to planning human resources, the project manager is aiming to plan
           for several facets of the project. Specifically, this planning process answers the following
           questions:
                * What project roles are needed on the project?
                * What is the responsibility of each role on the project?
                * To whom does each role report?
                * Will resources on the project be from inside or outside of the organization?
                * How will project team members be acquired?
                * How will project team members be released from the project?
                * What training needs to be completed for the project team?
                * What are the rewards and recognition systems the project may utilize?
                * What are the compliance and safety issues that must be addressed?
                * How will the usage of the team resources affect the operations of the
                  organization?
               Phew! That's a bunch of questions the project management team must answer dur-
           ing this portion of planning. The good news is that some of these questions can be
           answered when doing other project management planning exercises, such as time and
           cost estimating. All of the answers to these questions are documented in the staffing
           management plan. The staffing management plan is the primary output of the human
           resources planning process.

           Relying on Enterprise Environmental Factors
           You've seen enterprise environmental factors over and over throughout this book and
           the Project Management Body of Knowledge (PMBOK). When it comes to relying on the
           good ol' enterprise environmental factors for human resource planning, the reliance is
           on how the organization identifies and utilizes roles and responsibilities and the inter-
           action of the organization with the project management team. The project management
           team must consider five interfaces in its planning. These are organizational interfaces
           that the project team will likely have to interact with throughout the project:
                                                             Chapter 9: Managing Project Human Resources

                                                                                                   261
     * Organizational The project management team needs to identify which
       departments are going to be involved in the project. The team considers how
       the project will interact with these different departments and organizations,
       as well as what relationships exist between the departments, the project team,
       and management.
     * Technical The project team identifies the disciplines and specialties that the
       project will require to complete the project scope statement. The technical




                                                                                                           PART II
       interfaces are the resources that will be doing the project work. In that light,
       the project manager needs to examine what work needs to be completed, how
       the project moves from phase to phase, and even the nature of the work and
       how different disciplines may need to work together to allow the project to
       move forward.
     * Interpersonal This organizational interface considers the formal and
       informal reporting relationships that may exist among the project team
       members. The interpersonal interface also considers the job descriptions of
       the project team members, existing reporting structures between supervisors
       and subordinates, and what, if any, existing relationships may affect the project
       work. This interface also considers any cultural or language differences among
       the project team that may need to be addressed.
     * Logistical Have you ever worked with project team members that are located
       around the world? What about project team members who are within footsteps
       of each other? The logistical interface considers just that--the logistics of the
       project team and the stakeholders in relation to managing the project. The project
       manager must consider the geographical locales, the time zones, countries, and
       any other logistics that may affect the project.
     * Political Uh-oh, here come the politics. This interface considers the hidden
       goals, personal agendas, and alliances among the project team and the
       stakeholders. Yep, politics is considered in project management and on the
       PMI examination.
    While the interfaces mentioned previously should be considered during the human
resource planning phase for every project, there are also constraints that could be intro-
duced through these interfaces or as independent constraints. Recall that a constraint is
anything that limits the project team's options. Here are three common constraints that
may affect your human resources planning:
     * Organizational structure The structure of the organization has a direct
       correlation to the amount of power a project manager has. Figure 9-1 provides
       a refresher on the organizational structures. For a more in-depth refresher, see
       Chapter 2.
     * Collective bargaining agreements Contracts and agreements with unions
       or other employee groups may serve as constraints for the project.
     * Economic conditions Your organization may be experiencing a hiring freeze,
       slashed the training budget, or even cut out most travel expenses. These cuts are all
       examples of economic conditions that can serve as constraints on your project.

           power.




                          EXAM TIP Contracts and grievances with unions are constraints. The unions,
                          in and of themselves, are actually stakeholders.

           Using the Organizational Process Assets
           Many projects within any organization are similar to past projects. For example, an ar-
           chitecture firm designs buildings, an IT consultancy may design software or networks,
           and a manufacturer manufactures things. Within each of these disciplines, and count-
           less others, there are projects that are similar to projects that have gone before. The past
           project records, lessons learned, and even past staffing management plans can be
           adapted for the current project. Organizational process assets provide two elements for
           human resources planning that you should know for your PMI exam:

                 * Templates Using past project records, including older staffing management
                   plans as a base for the current project, is a great example of using past projects
                   as templates for the current project--something the PMBOK loves to mention.
                 * Checklists Here's another theme throughout the PMBOK. Checklists, when
                   it comes to planning for human resources, attempt to identify common
                   elements within similar projects. Ideal things that a checklist can help the
                   project management team identify include:
                    * Roles and responsibilities
                    * Competencies for the project work
                    * Training programs
                    * Team ground rules
                    * Safety issues
                    * Compliancy
                    * Rewards and recognition considerations
                                                           Chapter 9: Managing Project Human Resources

                                                                                                 263
Referencing the Project Management Plan
The project management plan has many things to consider when it comes to staffing
the project. Let's take a quick peek at each subsidiary plan, elements within the project
management plan, and how they may affect what resources the project manager will
require on the project team. Here are the elements of the project management plan:
     * Project scope management plan Defines how the project scope will be




                                                                                                         PART II
       planned, managed, and controlled. This plan is considered, because the
       project team will be doing the work to create the things the scope promises.
     * Schedule management plan Defines how the project schedule will be
       created and managed. The availability of and the demand for the project
       team are influenced by the schedule management plan.
     * Cost management plan This plan details how the project costs will be
       planned for, estimated, budgeted, and then monitored and controlled. In
       most projects, the project manager will need to account for the cost of the
       project team and their contributions to the project work. In some instances,
       the cost is more related to the time the team member is utilized, rather than
       the actual salary of the project team member.
     * Quality management plan Quality is expected on every project. This plan
       defines what quality means for the project, how the project will achieve quality,
       and how the project will map to organizational procedures pertaining to
       quality. The project team members will need to adhere to quality expectations,
       which may include training, team development, peer reviews, and inspections.
     * Process improvement plan Who wants an extra helping of waste in their
       project? This plan aims to eliminate non-value-added activities; eliminate
       waste; and determine how the project work, execution, and management can
       be better executed and managed. The project manager wants the project team
       to get rid of non-value-added activities.
     * Staffing management plan This plan defines how project team members
       will be brought on to and released from the project team. It also defines team
       training, safety issues, and how the project's reward and recognition system
       will operate. This plan is a work in process when planning begins, but updates
       to the plan may occur as the project management team revisits planning
       throughout the project.
     * Communications management plan This plan defines who will get
       what information, how they will receive it, and in what modality the
       communication will take place. The project team will need to communicate
       with the project manager, the sponsor, stakeholders, vendors, and each other.
     * Risk management plan Risk is an uncertain event or condition that may
       affect the project's outcome. Project team members will need to know what
       risks are within the project, which risk owners will be identified, and how risk
       responses will be planned and communicated.
     * Procurement management plan The project may need to procure goods
       and services. The project team may need to interact with vendors, consultants,
CAPM/PMP Project Management Certification All-in-One Exam Guide
264
                   and even internal stakeholders, such as a procurement office or purchasing
                   department. This plan may also address how procured consultants will serve
                   as project team members.
                * Milestone list This list details the project's milestones and their attributes.
                  The milestone list is used for several areas of project planning, but also helps
                  determine how quickly the project may be achieving its objectives.
                * Resource calendar Resources are people and things like equipment, rooms,
                  and other facilities. This calendar defines when resources are available to
                  contribute to the project.
                * Schedule baseline This is the planned start and finish of the project. The
                  comparison of what was planned and what was experienced is the schedule
                  variance.
                * Cost baseline This is the aggregated costs of all of the work packages within
                  the WBS.
                * Quality baseline This documents the quality objectives for the project,
                  including the metrics for stakeholder acceptance of the project deliverable.
                * Risk register The risk register is a centralized database consisting of the
                  outcome of all the other risk management processes. Consider the outcome
                  of risk identification, qualitative analysis, and quantitative analysis.

           Charting the Human Resources
           There are lots of charts that can help the project manager and the project management
           team determine what resources are needed, what responsibilities are within the project,
           reporting relationships, accountability concerns, and lots more. Your PMI examination
           will quiz you on these schmancy charts and how they're used. Don't worry--they're not
           difficult. Let's have a look.

           Using a Hierarchical Chart
           A hierarchical chart shows the relationship between superior and subordinate employ-
           ees, groups, disciplines, even departments. You've already seen one hierarchical chart:
           the work breakdown structure. When it comes to human resource planning, there are
           five hierarchical charts to consider:
                * Organization chart This traditional chart shows how the organization
                  is broken down by departments and disciplines. It is sometimes called the
                  organizational breakdown structure (OBS) and is arranged by departments,
                  units, or teams. With regards to project management, an OBS can be used to
                  show which project responsibilities are linked with which departments.
                * Resource breakdown structure (RBS) This hierarchical chart can decompose
                  the project by the types of resources it contains. For example, your project
                  might be using mechanical engineers in several different deliverables
                  throughout the project. The RBS would organize all of the usage of the
                  mechanical engineers, as well as other resources, by their disciplines rather
                  than by where the disciplines are being utilized. An RBS is an excellent tool
                  for tracking resource utilization and resource costs.
                                                               Chapter 9: Managing Project Human Resources

                                                                                                     265
     * Responsibility assignment matrix (RAM) A RAM chart shows the correlation
       between project team members and the work they've been assigned to
       complete. A RAM chart doesn't necessarily have to be specific to individual
       team members; it can also be decomposed to project groups or units. Most
       often, however, RAM charts depict activities and individual workers.
     * RACI chart A RACI chart is another matrix chart that only uses the activities
       of responsible, accountable, consult, and inform (hence, the acronym RACI).




                                                                                                             PART II
       Technically, a RACI chart is a form of the responsibility assignment matrix, but
       I want to include it here as a separate entry. This chart, depicted in Figure 9-2,
       has gained some popularity in recent years, so I'd wager you'll see it on your
       PMI examination.
     * Text-oriented chart A text-oriented chart is really more of a shopping list
       of what a team member is responsible for within the project. These listings
       define project responsibilities, reporting relationships, project authority,
       competencies, and qualifications. You might also know these as position
       descriptions or role-responsibility-authority forms.

Networking Human Resources
My buddy, Rick, and I do an exaggerated used car salesman thumbs-up whenever one
of us mentions networking. We know networking works--it's a great way to meet new
people, find new business, and make friends. Networking events, such as your PMI
chapter meetings, luncheons, and just working a room, are all ways to help your project
move forward by better understanding how your organization moves through political
and interpersonal relationships.




Figure 9-2 RACI charts show the relation between activities and project team members.
CAPM/PMP Project Management Certification All-in-One Exam Guide
266
               Basically, networking supports the old adage that people like to do business with
           people they like. If people don't know you, they won't get a chance to like you. Net-
           working functions, especially those internal to your organization, are great methods to
           meet and greet and share news about your projects. The PMBOK advises that attending
           networking events on an ongoing basis is effective. Some project managers fall into the
           trap of networking only at the launch of a project. However, it's the steady networking
           that builds relationships.

           Identifying the Roles and Responsibilities
           Human resource planning accomplishes wonderful things. It communicates what re-
           sources the project will need, the roles and responsibilities the project team will play on
           the project, the structure of the project team, and more. One of the fundamental things
           that human resource planning does for the project is to identify the attributes of the
           project team. You'll need to know these four terms for your PMI examination:
                * Role This person is responsible for a specific portion of the project. Roles are
                  usually tied to job titles, such as network engineer, mechanical engineer, and
                  electrician. It's what a person does.
                * Responsibility A responsibility is the work that a role performs. More precisely,
                  it's the work that a project team member is responsible for within the project.
                * Authority Project team members may have authority over other project team
                  members, have the ability to make decisions, and even sign approvals for project
                  work and purchases. The authority level defines which project team member has
                  what level of authority within the project.
                * Competency This attribute defines what talents, skills, and capacities are
                  needed to complete the project work. If there is a skill gap, then training,
                  development, hiring, and even schedule and scope changes should be enacted.

           Creating a Project Organization Chart
           Another output of the human resource planning process for your project is a project
           organization chart. This chart, as its name implies, illustrates the organization of the
           project, the project team members, and all the associated reporting relationships. The
           level of detail of the project organization chart is relative to the size of the project team
           and the priority of the project. In other words, a massive international project with
           3,000 project team members around the globe will likely have more detail than a 20-
           person project team to create a new piece of software.

           Examining the Staffing Management Plan
           Here's the meat of planning for project human resources: you and the project manage-
           ment team create the staffing management plan. This plan is a subsidiary plan of the
           project management plan and details all of the following concerns:
                * Staff acquisition This portion of the project plan defines how the project
                  team will be assembled. In some organizations, the project team is assigned
                  to the project manager; in others, the project manager petitions for the project
                                                                Chapter 9: Managing Project Human Resources

                                                                                                      267
        team members that he'd like on the project. This portion of the plan also
        defines how the organization's human resources department will interact with
        the project management team and if the project team will be all internal, all
        external, or a blend of resources. Staff acquisition concerns also deal with the
        geographical location of the project team members and the costs associated
        with acquiring team members with the appropriate expertise.
     * Timetable In most projects, not all team members will be utilized on




                                                                                                              PART II
       the project all of the time. A timetable can identify when project team
       members are needed on the project and when related activities, such as team
       acquisitions, can be scheduled. In some projects, a resource histogram, as
       Figure 9-3 shows, demonstrates when resources will be utilized across the
       project. Typically, each bar in the histogram represents a project team member,
       although some resource histograms can be created to show when a project
       unit or department is involved in the project.

             EXAM TIP When an individual bar in a resource histogram extends beyond the
             maximum allowed hours, resource leveling is needed. Resource leveling lops off
             the exceeded labor amount and often causes the project duration to increase.
     * Release criteria The staffing management plan defines the conditions and
       circumstances regarding when a project staff member may be released from
       the project team. This helps the project manager, functional managers, and
       other project managers plan for how they'll use the identified resource in
       future projects and operations.
     * Training needs If the project team doesn't know how to complete the work
       within the project, the project manager must hire a contracted resource or
       train the project team. This section of the staffing management plan defines
       the need for training, the benefits of certification, and how the training can
       help the project--and often the organization--reach its goals.

                * Rewards and recognition This is a key PMI point. A clearly defined system
                  for rewards and recognition will reinforce the behavior the project manager
                  wants from her project team. Rewards and recognition, however, must be
                  based on conditions within a person's control. For example, if Bob is to be
                  rewarded for managing costs within the project but Bob has no authority over
                  the decisions that affect costs, he'll feel pretty insecure in his ability to realize
                  the reward your project promises.

                         EXAM TIP      Rewards and recognitions are part of team development.


                * Compliance issues The staffing management plan also details how the
                  project will adhere to government regulations, union contracts, and human
                  resource practices your organization abides by.
                * Safety Many projects must consider the safety of the project team. While safety
                  for the project team is part of the cost of quality, as I discussed in Chapter 8, it's
                  revisited here to reinforce the need for attention to safety issues. We'll see this
                  issue again in Chapter 11 when we discuss risks and the project team.


           Acquiring the Project Team (PMBOK, Section 9.2)
           You need people to complete your project. But have you ever managed a project where
           the resources you wanted on the project were not available? Or have you managed a
           project where the resources you were assigned weren't the best resources to complete
           the project work? Staff acquisition is the process of getting the needed resources on the
           project team to complete the project work. It focuses on working within the policies
           and procedures of the performing organization to obtain the needed resources to com-
           plete the project work. Negotiation, communication, and political savvy are the keys to
           getting the desired resources on the project team.

           Examining the Staffing Pool
           Sometimes, the project manager doesn't have any say over the project team members
           that are assigned to the project team. In other instances, the project manager can influ-
           ence the decision makers to get the best team members. This is part of enterprise envi-
           ronmental factors--how an organization operates. The project manager should always
           ask about the following things:
                * Experience What is the experience of the project team member? Has he
                  done similar work in the past? Has he done it well?
                * Interest level Are the project team members interested in working on this
                  project?
                * Characteristics How will each individual team member work with other
                  project team members?
                * Availability Will the project team members desired for the project be
                  available? Project managers should confer with functional managers on
                  the availability of potential team members.
                                                           Chapter 9: Managing Project Human Resources

                                                                                                 269
     * Knowledge What is the competency and proficiency of the available project
       team members?

Negotiating for Resources
Most projects require the project manager to negotiate for resources. The project man-
ager will likely have to negotiate with functional managers to obtain the needed re-
sources to complete the project work. The functional managers and the project man-




                                                                                                         PART II
ager may struggle over an employee's time due to demands from ongoing operations,
other projects, and desires to effectively use resources. In other instances, functional
managers may want to assign under-utilized resources on projects in order to consume
their otherwise idle employees' time.
    Project managers may also have to negotiate with other project managers to share
needed resources among projects. Scheduling the needed resources between the proj-
ect teams will need to be coordinated so that both projects may complete success-
fully.

Working with Preassigned Staff
Project team members are often preassigned to a project for a number of reasons:

     * Availability of the individual
     * Promised as part of a competitive contract
     * Required as part of the project charter for an internal project
     * Opportunity for the staff member to complete on-the-job training

    Whatever the reasoning behind the assignment of the staff to the project, the proj-
ect manager should evaluate the project team for skill gaps, availability to complete the
project work, and expectations of the project team members. The project manager must
address any discrepancies between the requirements of the project work and the project
team's ability to complete the work.

Procuring Staff
In some instances, the project manager may have no alternative but to procure the proj-
ect team or individuals to complete the project work. I'll talk all about procurement in
Chapter 12. With regard to project team procurement, reasons why the project man-
ager can use this alternative include, but are not limited to, the following:

     * The performing organization lacks the internal resources with the needed
       skills to complete the project work.
     * The work is more cost-effective to procure.
     * The project team members are present within the organization, but they are
       not available to the current project.
     * The project team members are present within the organization, but they
       cannot complete the needed work due to other project assignments.

           Assembling the Project Team
           With the project team assembled, the project manager can continue planning, assign-
           ing activities, and managing the project progression. Project team members can be as-
           signed to the project on a full- or part-time basis, depending on the project conditions.
           Once the project team is built, a project team directory should be assembled. The proj-
           ect team directory should include:
                * The project team members' names
                * Phone numbers
                * E-mail addresses
                * Mailing addresses, if the team is noncollocated
                * Contact information for key stakeholders
                * Any other relevant contact information for each team member, such as
                  photos, Web addresses, and so on


           Developing the Project Team (PMBOK, Section 9.3)
           Developing the project team is met by enhancing the competencies of the individual proj-
           ect team members and promoting the interaction of all the project team members. Through-
           out the project, the project manager will have to work to develop the project team. The
           project manager may have to develop an individual team member's skills so that she can
           complete her assignments. The project manager will also have to work to develop the proj-
           ect team as a whole so that the team can work together to complete the project.
                In matrix organizations, the project team members are accountable to the project
           manager and to their functional managers. Developing the project team can prove chal-
           lenging, since the project team members may feel pulled between multiple bosses. The
           project manager must strive to involve and develop the project team members as indi-
           viduals completing project work--and as team members completing the project objec-
           tives together.

           Preparing for Team Development
           Team development is a natural process, but it's also a process that the project manager
           can usher along. If you're the project manager and you want your team to work to-
           gether, get along, and focus on completing the project rather than on who's really in
           charge of the project, you'll need these inputs:
                * Staff assignments The assignments of the project team members define their
                  skills, their needs for development, and their abilities to complete the project
                  work as individuals and as part of the team.
                * Staffing management plan Recall that the staffing management plan details
                  how project team members will be brought on to the project and excused from it.
                * External feedback When things are not well with project team members,
                  stakeholders are often happy to tell the project manager. In some instances,
                  the project manager must query stakeholders and organizational interfaces
                  on the performance of the project team members.
                                                            Chapter 9: Managing Project Human Resources

                                                                                                  271
     * Resource availability You'll need to know when your project team members
       are available and when they're vacationing in the desert. This component also
       considers when project team members are on multiple projects within your
       organization and allows you to plan for when you'll utilize the project team
       members best.

Leading Project Team Development




                                                                                                          PART II
Due to the temporary and short-term nature of projects, it can be tough for a group of
strangers to form relationships and immediately create a successful project. Team devel-
opment is the guidance, direction, and leadership the project manager offers to influ-
ence a project team.
    Training the project team is one of the best team development exercises. The staff-
ing management plan defines the need for training, and team development is the exe-
cution of that plan. In other words, if team members don't know how to do the project
work, train them!
    Another facet of team development is a focus on getting the project work complet-
ed. The project managers are the power on the project team. While there may be some
resistance from the project team to cooperate with the project manager, complete as-
signed duties, or participate as requested, the project team should realize that the proj-
ect manager is the project authority. There are five types of powers that the project
manager yields:
     * Expert The project manager's authority comes from both experience with the
       technology the project focuses on and from expertise managing projects.
     * Reward The project manager has the authority to reward the project team.
     * Formal The project manager has been assigned the role of project manager
       by senior management and is in charge of the project. This is also known as
       positional power.
     * Coercive The project manager has the authority to discipline the project
       team members. This is also known as penalty power. When the team is afraid
       of the project manager, the project manager has coercive power.
     * Referent The project team personally knows the project manager. Referent can
       also mean that the project manager refers to the person who assigned him the
       position; for example, "The CEO assigned me to this position, so we'll do it this
       way." This power can also mean the project team wants to work on the project
       or with the project manager due to the high priority and impact of the project.

Creating Team-Building Activities
Team-building activities are approaches to developing the team through facilitated
events. The goal of team-building exercises is to allow the project team to learn about
each other, rely on each other, and form cohesiveness among the project team mem-
bers. Events can include:

     * Involving the team during planning processes
     * Defining rules for handling team disagreements
CAPM/PMP Project Management Certification All-in-One Exam Guide
272
                * Holding off-site activities
                * Facilitating quick team-involvement activities
                * Facilitating activities to improve interpersonal skills and form relationships


           Establishing Project Ground Rules
           Creating ground rules for the project team is part of team development. Ground rules
           establish the project expectations for the project team and define what is and is not ac-
           ceptable behavior by all of the project team members, including the project manager.
           When all of the project team members agree to abide by the defined ground rules, mis-
           understandings diminish while productivity increases. Once ground rules are defined,
           it's the responsibility of all the project team members to enforce them.

                         EXAM TIP Ground rules are enforced by the project team, not the project
                         manager. That's from the PMBOK, Section 9.3.2.4--there's an exam gotcha!

           Managing a Collocated Project Team
           The idea of placing all of the project team members in one geographical location is
           ideal for many project managers. In theory, having all of the project team members
           together allows the team members to quickly communicate, work with each other, and
           generally work better as a team. In reality, that's not always possible: Team members are
           spread around the globe, space isn't necessarily available in one locale, and all the
           other logistics that could prevent bringing all of the project team together in a project
           war room. (And yes, there's no fighting in the war room.)
               Virtual teams, however, are more likely in today's world. Collaboration software,
           Internet tools, phone calls, and e-mails can help increase communications and the sense
           of a collocated team without the expense and improbability of a collocated team.

           Relying on General Management Skills
           A chunk of project management relies on general management skills. Specifically, the
           project manager relies on:

                * Leading Good project managers master the art of establishing direction,
                  aligning people, and motivating the project team to complete the project work.
                * Communicating Good project managers are good communicators.
                  Remember, half of communicating is listening.
                * Negotiating Project managers will likely negotiate for scope, cost, terms,
                  assignment, and resources.
                * Problem solving Project managers must have the ability to confront and
                  solve problems.
                * Influence Project managers use their influence to get things done.
                                                                Chapter 9: Managing Project Human Resources

                                                                                                      273
Rewarding the Project Team
When discussing human resource planning, I mentioned that you, the project manager,
should create the rewards and recognition system. This system is part of team develop-
ment and encourages the behavior you want from your project team--that is, the behav-
ior that promotes the project to completion and meets the project scope statement. Per-
formance appraisals tell the project manager, and sometimes functional management,
which team members should be rewarded based on the confines of the reward system.




                                                                                                              PART II
    Obviously, positive behavior should be rewarded. If a project team member willingly
agrees to work overtime to ensure that the project will hit its schedule objective, that should
be rewarded or recognized by the project manager. However, if a project team member has
to work overtime because he has wasted time or resources, a reward is not in order.
    Win-lose awards, sometimes called zero-sum awards, should be avoided, as they can
deteriorate the project team's cohesiveness. Any award where only some of the project
team members can qualify shouldn't be given. I once worked on a project where the proj-
ect manager awarded the software developer that accomplished the most code a bonus
every month. Well, since I wasn't a software developer, I could never qualify for that bo-
nus. (Thanks a lot, Ron! Ron was my boss then, and oh sweet printed vengeance now.
Kidding...he dropped the bonus program when he saw the trouble with his plan.)

             EXAM TIP Your reward and recognition system should also consider the
             cultural differences. The PMBOK acknowledges that creating team rewards
             in a culture that encourages individualism can be difficult. In other words, the
             reward system must mesh with the culture within which the project manager
             is operating.


Managing the Project Team (PMBOK, Section 9.4)
Now that the project manager has planned for the human resources and developed the
project team, he can focus on managing the project team. This process involves tracking
each team member's performance, offering feedback, taking care of project issues, and
managing those pesky change requests that can affect the project team and its work. The
staffing management plan may be updated based on lessons learned and changes with-
in the team management process.
    In a matrix environment, where the project team members are accountable to both
the project manager and a functional manager, team management is tricky business.
The project manager and the functional managers need to work together to communi-
cate the utilization of the project team member in both operations and on the project.
The project team's demand for dual reporting to the project manager and the func-
tional manager also has to be considered--and is often the responsibility of the project
manager rather than the functional manager or project team member.

Preparing for Team Management
Managing the project team is based on many conditions and scenarios within the proj-
ect. Management of the project team is really about one thing: getting the project work
CAPM/PMP Project Management Certification All-in-One Exam Guide
274
           done as promised in the project scope statement. There are many inputs to project team
           management:
                * Organizational process assets Consider the organization's approach to
                  rewarding employees for their work in a project. Organizational process assets
                  in team management rely on dinners, certificates of appreciation, newsletters,
                  and other methods to recognize a project team's hard work on a project.
                * Project staff assignments The project manager and the project management
                  team both need a listing of the project staff assignments to monitor and evaluate
                  each project team member's project performance.
                * Project organizational charts Remember these? These charts depict the
                  reporting structure between and among project team members.
                * Staffing management plan You know this plan, right? Just in case you
                  forgot, it defines when project team members will complete their project
                  work, the training needs for the project, certification requirements, and any
                  labor compliance issues. It's the output of human resources planning.
                * Team performance assessment You'll know if your project team is doing a
                  good job or not, but you'll want to quantify their performance so that you can
                  make recommendations where needed.
                * Work performance information The project management team observes
                  and records the work a project team member performs. This doesn't necessarily
                  mean the project management team peers over the shoulder of the project
                  team member, but rather observes the team member's participation in team
                  activities, delivery on action items, and thoroughness in communication.
                * Performance reports These are just reports about the project team's
                  performance and how it meshes, or contradicts, what was promised in the
                  project management plan.
               All of these inputs feed directly into the actual process of managing the project team.
           The project manager and the project management team will use the evidence of these
           things to better manage the team in order to move the project towards completion.

           Dealing with Team Disagreements
           In most projects, there will be instances when the project team, management, and oth-
           er stakeholders disagree on the progress, decisions, and proposed solutions within the
           project. It's essential for the project manager to keep calm, lead, and direct the parties
           to a sensible solution that's best for the project. Here are seven reasons for conflict, in
           order of most common to least common:
                * Schedules
                * Priorities
                * Resources
                * Technical beliefs
                * Administrative policies and procedures
                                                             Chapter 9: Managing Project Human Resources

                                                                                                   275
     * Project costs
     * Personalities

             EXAM TIP You can expect questions on these areas of conflict on the exam.
             Don't be duped into thinking personality conflicts are the biggest problem
             with conflict resolution; they are the least important.




                                                                                                           PART II
    So what's a project manager to do with all the potential for strife in a project? There
are five different approaches to conflict resolution:

     * Problem solving This approach confronts the problem head-on and is the
       preferred method of conflict resolution. You may see this approach defined
       as "confronting" rather than problem solving. Problem solving calls for
       additional research to find the best solution for the problem, and should be
       a win-win solution. It should be used if there is time to work through and
       resolve the issue. It also serves to build relationships and trust.
     * Forcing The person with the power makes the decision. The decision made
       may not be the best decision for the project, but it's fast. As expected, this
       autocratic approach does little for team development and is a win-lose solution.
       It should be used when the stakes are high and time is of the essence or if
       relationships are not important.
     * Compromising This approach requires that both parties give up something.
       The decision made is a blend of both sides of the argument. Because neither
       party really wins, it is considered a lose-lose solution. The project manager
       can use this approach when the relationships are equal and no one can truly
       "win." This approach can also be used to avoid a fight.
     * Smoothing This approach "smoothes" out the conflict by minimizing the
       perceived size of the problem. It is a temporary solution, but can calm team
       relations and boisterous discussions. Smoothing may be acceptable when
       time is of the essence or when any of the proposed solutions will not currently
       settle the problem. This can be considered a lose-lose situation as well, since
       no one really wins in the long run. The project manager can use smoothing
       to emphasize areas of agreement between disagreeing stakeholders and, thus,
       minimize areas of conflict. It's used to maintain relationships and when the
       issue is not critical.
     * Withdrawal This conflict resolution has one side of the argument walking
       away from the problem, usually in disgust. The conflict is not resolved, and it
       is considered a yield-lose solution. The approach can be used, however, as a
       cooling-off period or when the issue is not critical.

Creating an Issue Log
It's okay to have issues within a project as long as the issues are recorded in the issue
log. An issue, technically, is something that may be preventing the project team from
reaching the project objectives. Typically, issues are identified and recorded in the issue
CAPM/PMP Project Management Certification All-in-One Exam Guide
276
           log. Each issue is assigned to an owner, who needs to find a method that will resolve
           the issue by a given date. Each issue should also be identified as to its status and the
           possible resolution. Common issues listed in the PMBOK are:
                * Differences of opinion
                * Situations to be investigated
                * Unanticipated responsibilities that need to be assigned to someone on the
                  project team

           Examining the Outputs of Team Management
           Team management begins as soon as the project team comes together; it ends as soon
           as the project is closed. Throughout the project, there will be different conditions and
           scenarios that will affect how the project manager and the project management team
           will manage the project and the resources within it. There are six outputs of managing
           the project team:
                * Requested changes Seems like just about everything can result in a change
                  request, doesn't it? Changes to the project team can have ripple effects on the
                  project scheduling, project cost, and even the project scope statement, so a
                  change request is needed when these conditions are true.
                * Recommended corrective actions These are actions to provide staffing
                  changes, training, and even disciplinary actions. Other recommended
                  corrective actions can include moving people to different assignments,
                  outsourcing some of the project work, and replacing project team members
                  who may have left the organization or project.
                * Recommended preventive actions When the project management team
                  identifies problems that could arise, they should make recommended
                  preventive actions. This is true even in project human resource management.
                  Preventive actions can include cross-training, role clarification, and even labor
                  to ensure that all of the project work is completed as planned.
                * Inputs to performance appraisals Project team members' performance
                  is reviewed and tied to their overall performance on the project team.
                  Performance appraisals can be in the form of the 360-degree appraisal, where
                  a project team member is reviewed in all directions by the project team, the
                  project manager, stakeholders, and even vendors, where appropriate.
                * Lessons learned What the project management team learns in the project
                  becomes part of organizational process assets for future projects. For example,
                  lessons learned in human resources include:
                   * Staffing management plan
                   * Organizational charts
                   * Position descriptions
                   * Ground rules
                   * Conflict management techniques
                                                           Chapter 9: Managing Project Human Resources

        * Successful rewards and recognition approaches
        * Procedures for virtual team management
        * Negotiating techniques
        * Training programs
        * Successful team-building exercises
        * Issues and solutions documented in the project log




                                                                                                         PART II
     * Project management plan updates Just like any other area of project
       management, if the project management plan needs to updated, it should
       be. Project management plan updates could be approved change requests,
       corrective actions, new project team member roles, and training decisions.


Relating to Organizational Theories
(PMBOK, Section 9.1.2.3)
In the PMBOK, this is a minor section, with hints to these project management and
human resource theories. On your exam, however, you can expect to see some of these
topics there, so let's have a look at these theories in more detail.

Maslow's Hierarchy of Needs
According to Abraham Maslow, people work to take care of a hierarchy of needs. The
pinnacle of their needs is self-actualization. People want to contribute, prove their
worth, and use their skills and abilities. Figure 9-4 shows the pyramid of needs that all
people try to ascend by fulfilling each layer, one at a time.
   Maslow's five layers of needs, from lowest to highest, are:
     * Physiological People require these necessities to live: air, water, food,
       clothing, and shelter.

Figure 9-4
Maslow's theory
states that people
ultimately work for
self-actualization.

                * Safety People need safety and security; this can include stability in life, work,
                  and culture.
                * Social People are social creatures and need love, approval, and friends.
                * Esteem People strive for the respect, appreciation, and approval of others.
                * Self-actualization At the pinnacle of needs, people seek personal growth,
                  knowledge, and fulfillment.

           Herzberg's Theory of Motivation
           According to Frederick Herzberg, a psychologist and authority on the motivation of
           work, there are two catalysts for success with people:
                * Hygiene agents These elements are the expectations all workers have. They
                  include job security, a paycheck, clean and safe working conditions, a sense
                  of belonging, civil working relationships, and other basic attributes associated
                  with employment.
                * Motivating agents These are the elements that motivate people to excel.
                  They include responsibility, appreciation of work, public recognition for a job
                  well done, the chance to excel, education, and other opportunities associated
                  with work aside from financial rewards.
               This theory says that the presence of hygiene factors will not motivate people to
           perform, as these are expected attributes. However, the absence of these elements will
           demotivate performance. For people to excel, the presence of motivating factors must
           exist. Figure 9-5 illustrates Herzberg's theory of motivation.

           McGregor's Theory of X and Y
           Douglas McGregor's theory states that, from their perspective, management believes
           there are two types of workers, good and bad, as seen in Figure 9-6. The theory goes on
           to state that management actually shifts from position to position, depending on the
           worker and the conditions that warrant the behavior of the manager:
                * X is bad. These people need to be watched all the time, micromanaged, and
                  cannot be trusted. X people avoid work, shun responsibility, and lack the
                  aptitude to achieve.
                * Y is good. These people are self-led, motivated, and can accomplish new tasks
                  proactively.

           Figure 9-5
           Hygiene agents do
           nothing to motivate,
           but their absence will
           cause performance
           and morale to
           decline.

Ouchi's Theory Z
William Ouchi's theory is based on the participative management style of the Japanese.
This theory states that workers are motivated by a sense of commitment, opportunity,
and advancement. Workers in an organization subscribing to theory Z learn the busi-
ness by moving up through the ranks of the company.
    Ouchi's theory also credits the idea of "lifetime employment." Workers will stay
with one company until they retire because they are dedicated to the company that is,
in turn, dedicated to them.

             EXAM TIP If you need a way to keep McGregor's X and Y and Ouchi's Z
             theories separate in your mind, think of this: X is bad;Y is good; Z is the best.

Expectancy Theory
Expectancy theory states that people will behave based on what they expect as a result
of their behavior. In other words, people will work in relation to the expected reward of
the work. If the attractiveness of the reward is desirable to the worker, she will work to
receive it--people expect to be rewarded for their effort.


Chapter Summary
The project manager has to plan for the needed human resources in order to complete the
project work. In addition, the project manager plans for how the human resources will be
managed, trained, motivated, and led throughout the duration of the project. The project
management team works to identify the roles within the project and their responsibilities,
which are the activities to complete the project work. The key output of planning for hu-
man resources is the staffing management plan, which defines how the project team will
be acquired, managed, trained, rewarded for the work, and then released from the project
team. The staffing management plan also defines how the project management team will
comply with government regulations and manage team safety concerns.
    The project team is acquired just like the staffing management plan asks. The team,
however, isn't always selected--it's often preassigned to the project. Sometimes, the
project manager gets to negotiate with the functional managers and other project man-
agers to get the best resources on the project as possible. When the resources aren't
available inside the organization, the project manager often has to deal with contracted
help, which means procurement.
    Some teams all work together in one locale and might huddle in the project's war
room. This idea of a collocated team supports ad-hoc conversations, team cohesiveness,
and project performance. However, in many cases, the project team is not collocated and

           a virtual team is created. Virtual teams allow people with mobility handicaps, travel is-
           sues, and home office workers to be actively involved in the project.
               Whatever conditions surround the project team, the project manager must work to
           develop it. Team development centers on building team cohesiveness through team-
           building exercises, training, and team involvement. One team development tool and
           technique is the creation of ground rules. Ground rules are created and agreed upon by
           the project team to promote performance within the project. Once ground rules are
           created, it's up to the project team to enforce them.
               Through conversations, observations, performance appraisals, conflict manage-
           ment, and the issue log, the project manager will manage the project team. The goal of
           team management is getting the project done--it's all about results.
               Human resource theories, such as Maslow's hierarchy of needs, McGregor's theory
           of X and Y, and Ouchi's theory Z, all seek to determine what motivates an employee to
           complete her project tasks. Project managers can use these theories to determine the
           best approach to motivate or inspire a project team member to elicit the behavior the
           project manager expects.


           Key Terms
           Authority power Project team members may have authority over other project team
           members, have the ability to make decisions, and even sign approvals for project work
           and purchases.
           Coercive power The project manager has the authority to discipline the project team
           members. This is also known as penalty power.
           Collective bargaining agreement constraints Contracts and agreements with unions
           or other employee groups may serve as constraints for the project.
           Competency This attribute defines what talents, skills, and capacities are needed to
           complete the project work.
           Compromising This approach requires that both parties give up something.
           Expectancy theory This theory states that people will behave based on what they ex-
           pect as a result of their behavior. In other words, people will work in relation to the
           expected reward.
           Expert power The project manager's authority comes from both experiences with the
           technology the project focuses on and from expertise in managing projects.
           Forcing power      The person with the power makes the decision.
           Formal power The project manager has been assigned the role of project manager by
           senior management and is in charge of the project.
           Herzberg's theory of motivation Frederick Herzberg's theory of the motivating agents
           and hygiene agents that affect a person's willingness to excel in his career.
           Hierarchical organizational chart A chart showing the relationship between superior
           and subordinate employees, groups, disciplines, and even departments.
                                                             Chapter 9: Managing Project Human Resources

                                                                                                   281
Interpersonal interfaces This organizational interface considers the formal and infor-
mal reporting relationships that may exist among the project team members. The inter-
personal interface also considers the job descriptions of the project team members, ex-
isting reporting structures between supervisors and subordinates, and existing relation-
ships, if any, that may affect the project work. This interface also considers any cultural
or language differences among the project team that may need to be addressed.
Issue log A logbook of the issues the project team has identified and dates as to when




                                                                                                           PART II
the issues must be resolved by. The issue log may also include team members or stake-
holders who are responsible for finding a solution to the identified issues.
Logistical interfaces The logistics of the team locale, time zones, geographical bound-
aries, and travel requirements within a project.
Maslow's hierarchy of needs Abraham Maslow's theory of the five needs all humans
have and work towards.
McGregor's theory of X and Y Douglas McGregor's theory that states management
views workers in the Y category as competent and self-led and workers in the X catego-
ry as incompetent and needing to be micromanaged.
Organization chart Traditional chart that depicts how the organization is broken
down by department and disciplines. This chart is sometimes called the organizational
breakdown structure (OBS) and is arranged by departments, units, or teams.
Organizational interfaces The project management team needs to identify which de-
partments are going to be involved in the project.
Organizational structure constraint The structure of the organization has a direct
correlation to the amount of power a project manager has within a project.
Ouchi's theory Z William Ouchi's theory is based on the participative management
style of the Japanese. This theory states that workers are motivated by a sense of com-
mitment, opportunity, and advancement.
Political interfaces The hidden goals, personal agendas, and alliances among the
project team members and the stakeholders.
Problem solving This approach confronts the problem head-on and is the preferred
method of conflict resolution.
RACI chart A RACI chart is a matrix chart that only uses the activities of responsible,
accountable, consult, and inform.
Referent The project team personally knows the project manager. Referent can also
mean that the project manager refers to the person who assigned him the position.
Resource breakdown structure (RBS) This hierarchical chart can decompose the
project by the type of resources used throughout it.
Responsibility A responsibility is the work that a role performs.
Responsibility assignment matrix (RAM) A RAM chart shows the correlation be-
tween project team members and the work they've been assigned to complete.

           Reward The project manager has the authority to reward the project team.
           Role This person is responsible for a specific portion of the project. Roles are usually
           tied to job titles, such as network engineer, mechanical engineer, and electrician.
           Smoothing This approach "smoothes" out the conflict by minimizing the perceived
           size of the problem. It is a temporary solution, but can calm team relations and boister-
           ous discussions.
           Staffing management plan A subsidiary plan of the project management plan that
           defines staff acquisition, timetables, release criteria, training needs, reward and recogni-
           tion system, compliance issues, and safety concerns for the project.
           Technical interfaces The project team identifies the disciplines and specialties that
           the project will require to complete the project scope statement. The technical inter-
           faces are the resources that will be doing the project work.
           Withdrawal This conflict resolution method sees one side of the argument walking
           away from the problem, usually in disgust.

               12. Harold is an outspoken project team member. All of the project team
                   members respect Harold for his experience with the technology, but often,
                   things have to go in Harold's favor or things do not go well. During a
                   discussion on a solution, a project team member waves her arms and says,
                   "Fine, Harold, do it your way." This is an example of which of the following?
                    A. A win-win solution
                    B. A leave-lose solution
                    C. A lose-lose solution
                   D. A yield-lose solution

                    D. Coordinator

           Answers
                1. A. The reporting interfaces for this project--the director of manufacturing,
                   HR, the IT department, and the CIO--are examples of the organizational
                   interfaces. B is incorrect; technical interfaces are the technical gurus for the
                   project, such as the engineers and designers. C, the interpersonal interfaces, is
                   not the best choice because this relationship describes the different individuals
                   working on the project. D, human resource coordination, is also incorrect. For
                   more information, see the PMBOK, Section 9.1.1.
                2. B. Because the project requires the electrician, a project role, this is a staffing
                   requirement. A is incorrect because it does not accurately describe the situation.
                   C is incorrect; contractor requirements would specify the procurement issues,
                   the minimum qualifications for the electrician, and so on. D is incorrect. A
                   resource constraint, while a tempting choice, deals more with the availability of
                   the resource or the requirement to use the resource. For more information, see
                   the PMBOK, Section 9.2.2.
                3. B. The project needs the resource of the chemical engineer to be successful.
                   When the project needs a resource, it is a staffing requirement. A, C, and D are
                   all incorrect. This is not a situation describing an organizational interface or
                   contractor requirements. Resource constraints might include a requirement to
                   use a particular resource or that a resource must be available when certain project
                   activities are happening. For more information, see the PMBOK, Section 9.2.2.
                4. C. In a weak matrix structure, functional management will have more
                   authority than the project manager. A, B, and D are all incorrect because
                   these choices do not have as much authority on a project in a weak matrix
                   environment as functional management will have. For more information, see
                   the PMBOK, Section 9.1.1.1.
                5. C. In this instance, the union is considered a project stakeholder because it
                   has a vested interest in the project's outcome. A is incorrect because the union
                                                          Chapter 9: Managing Project Human Resources

                                                                                                287
    is not a resource constraint; they are interested in the project management
    methodology and the project human resource management. B is incorrect; the
    union is the counterweight to the management of the organization, not to the
    project itself. D is also incorrect; the union is not a project team member. For
    more information, see the PMBOK, Section 9.1.1.1.
 6. B. When projects are similar in nature, the project manager can use the roles
    and responsibilities defined in the historical project to guide the current project.




                                                                                                        PART II
    A is incorrect; the entire project plan of the ACT Project is not needed. Even
    the roles and responsibilities matrix of the historical project may not be
    an exact fit for the current project. C is incorrect; copying the project team
    structure is not the best choice of all the answers presented. D is also incorrect
    because using the same project team may not be feasible at all. For more
    information, see the PMBOK, Section 9.1.1.2.
 7. B. Theory X states that workers have an inherent dislike of work and will avoid it if
    possible. With regards to this theory, micromanagement is a method used to make
    certain workers complete their work. A and C are actually examples of McGregor's
    theory Y. D is incorrect because EVM is not directly related to McGregor's theory of
    X and Y. For more information, see the PMBOK, Section 9.1.2.3.
 8. B. When the project team is afraid of the power the project manager yields,
    this is called coercive power. A, C, and D are incorrect because they describe
    assigned, referential, and technical power over the project, respectively. For
    more information, see the PMBOK, Section 9.4.2.
 9. A. The company president has assigned you to the position of the project
    manager, so you have formal power. B is incorrect because coercive power
    is the fear associated with the project manager. C is incorrect because expert
    power is derived from the project manager's experience with the technology
    being implemented. D is also incorrect; halo power is not a viable answer to
    the question. For more information, see the PMBOK, Section 9.4.2.
10. B. The halo effect is the assumption that because the person is good at a
    technology, he would also be good at managing a project dealing with that
    said technology. A, C, and D are all incorrect because these do not describe
    the halo effect. For more information, see the PMBOK, Section 9.4.2.
11. A. Confronting is the best problem-solving technique because it meets the
    problem directly. B is incorrect; compromising requires both sides on an
    argument to give up something. C is incorrect; forcing requires the project
    manager to force a decision based on external inputs, such as seniority,
    experience, and so on. D is also incorrect; avoiding ignores the problem and
    does not solve it. For more information, see the PMBOK, Section 9.4.2.3.
12. D. When Harold always has to win an argument and team members begin to
    give in to Harold's demands simply to avoid the argument rather than finding
    an accurate solution, this is a yield-lose situation. A is incorrect because both
    parties do not win. B is incorrect because the project team member did not
    leave the conversation, but instead ended it. C is incorrect; a lose-lose is a
    compromise where both parties give up something. For more information,
    see the PMBOK, Section 9.4.2.3.

               13. D. Personality conflicts are likely a concern for the customer, but are not as
                   important as project priorities, schedule, and cost. The customer hired your
                   company to solve the technical issues. A, B, and C are all incorrect because these
                   are most likely the top issues for a company in a project of this magnitude. For
                   more information, see the PMBOK, Section 9.4.2.3.
               14. B. Ouchi's theory Z states that workers need to be involved with the management
                   process. A is incorrect; McGregor's theory of X and Y believes that X workers
                   don't want to work and need constant supervision; Z workers will work if the
                   work is challenging, satisfying, and rewarding. C is incorrect; Herzberg's theory
                   of motivation describes the type of people and what excites them to work. D,
                   the expectancy theory, describes how people will work based on what they
                   expect in return. For more information, see the PMBOK, Section 9.4.2.
               15. D. The expectancy theory describes how people will work based on what they
                   expect in return. If people are rewarded because of the work they complete,
                   and they like the reward (payment), they will continue to work. A, B, and C
                   are all incorrect because these theories do not accurately describe the scenario
                   presented. For more information, see the PMBOK, Section 9.4.2.3.
               16. C. You, the project manager, have expert power on this project because of your
                   experience with the technology and with projects that are similar in nature. A,
                   B, and D are all incorrect. These project management powers do not accurately
                   describe the scenario. Formal power is appointed power. Coercive power describes
                   fear of the project manager. Referent power describes power by association and
                   personal knowledge. For more information, see the PMBOK, Section 9.4.2.
               17. D. This is referent power because the project team knows the project manager
                   personally. A and B are incorrect choices; these do not describe the scenario. C
                   is incorrect; expert power does not deal with the ability to lead and complete
                   a project, but it focuses on being an expert with the technology that the
                   project deals with. For more information, see the PMBOK, Section 9.4.2.3.
               18. B. Coercive power is the formal authority a project manager yields over
                   the project team. A is incorrect; only referent power may come through
                   lunch meetings. C is incorrect; experience is expert power. D is incorrect;
                   interpersonal relationships are examples of referent power. For more
                   information, see the PMBOK, Section 9.4.2.3.
               19. C. Forcing happens when the project manager makes a decision based on factors
                   that are not relevant to the problem. Just because a team member has more
                   seniority does not mean this individual is correct. A, B, and D are incorrect choices.
                   A, problem solving, is not described in the scenario. B, compromising, happens
                   when both parties agree to give up something. D, withdrawal, happens when a
                   party leaves the argument. For more information, see the PMBOK, Section 9.4.2.3.
               20. A. Project managers are typically assigned to a project on a full-time basis
                   in a projectized organization. B, C, and D do not accurately describe the
                   work schedule of a project manager in a projectized environment. For more
                   information, see the PMBOK, Section 9.1.1.1.

    In this chapter, you will
       * Plan for project communications
       * Distribute the project information
       * Report the project performance
       * Manage the project stakeholders




 In the movie Cool Hand Luke, the prison captain says, "What we got here is a failure to
 communicate." It's a famous line that has been repeated by musicians, politicians, and
 even muttered by project managers. Hopefully, when you, the project manager, quote
 this line, you aren't viewed as the prison captain by your project team.
     The point is that most projects experience a breakdown in communications. It's
 been said that 90 percent of a project manager's time is spent communicating. If you
 think about it, this certainly makes sense. Your project plans all communicate what
 you're going to do. Your project reports and forms communicate what you are doing or
 have done. And all of your status meetings, ad-hoc meetings, and presentations are all
 examples of communicating.

                VIDEO     Learning the communications formula.


     Managing project communications is all about the creation, collection, distribu-
 tion, storage, and handy retrieval of project information. It's what the project manager
 does day in and day out. The project manager is at the hub of communications and
 works with the project team, the project stakeholders, the sponsor, the vendors, and
 often the public to send and receive communications about the project. It can be ex-
 hausting, as somebody always needs to tell you something or you need to tell some-
 body else something. The key, of course, is to plan how to communicate and then share
 that plan and expectations at the launch of the project.
     This chapter discusses the four processes that project communication centers on. Of
 course, you'll also need to know these processes to pass your Project Management In-
 stitute (PMI) exam.

           Examining the Communications Foundation
           (PMBOK, Section 10)
           Communications is central to project management and, as part of integration manage-
           ment, works with and through all of the other knowledge areas. A poor job of commu-
           nicating ensures that the other knowledge areas may also suffer. Integration manage-
           ment, which I discussed in Chapter 4, revisits us in this chapter, as communication is
           the monitor of the other knowledge areas and serves as the vehicle for reporting infor-
           mation on these other facets of project management.

           Communication Factors
           In the Project Management Body of Knowledge's (PMBOK) introduction to Chapter 10,
           some interesting tips and terms sneak into the chapter that you'll likely see on your PMI
           examination. The first foundation you've got to know in regards to project communications
           are some of the skills a project manager uses to communicate. Consider the following:
                * Sender-receiver models These are feedback loops and barriers to
                  communications. Your project status meeting is a great example of a feedback
                  loop, as all of your project team members hear what the other team members
                  say, offer feedback to the speaker, the speaker may respond, and on and on.
                  Basically, a feedback loop is a conversation between one or more speakers
                  centering on one specific topic. A barrier to communication is anything that
                  prevents communication from occurring at optimum levels. For example, if
                  you and I are on the same project team but we're mad at each other, we're
                  not going to communicate effectively--if at all.
                * Choice of media The best modality to use when communicating is the
                  one that is relevant to the information that's being communicated. Some
                  communications demand a formal report, whereas others only warrant a
                  phone call, a face-to-face meeting, or a few sentences on a sticky note. The
                  right media is dictated by what needs to be communicated.
                * Writing style You don't have to be E.B. White to write effectively (look
                  at me!). You should, however, be conscious of the message you want to
                  communicate and choose the appropriate writing style.
                * Presentation techniques Some people cannot stand to be in front of
                  an audience, but as a project manager, they often find themselves having
                  to present project news and status. The presentation techniques, such as
                  confidence, body language, and visual aids, promote or distract from the
                  message the presenter is offering to the audience.
                * Meeting management techniques Ever attend a WOT meeting? That's a
                  "waste of time" meeting. Meetings should have an agenda and order, and
                  someone needs to keep the meeting minutes for the project.

           Understanding the Communication Model
           The second foundation that is tucked into the introduction of Chapter 10 of the PM-
           BOK is the communication model. As you can see in Figure 10-1, the model demon-

strates how communication moves from one person to another. I like to think of each
portion of the model as a fax machine to visualize all the components. Take a look:
    * Sender This is the person who wants to send the message. Let's say I want to
      fax you a contract.
    * Encoder This is the device that encodes the message to be sent. My fax
      machine is the encoder.
    * Medium This is the device or technology that transports the message. The
      telephone line is the medium between our fax machines.
    * Decoder This is the device that decodes the message as it is being received.
      Your fax machine is the decoder.
    * Receiver This is the person who receives the message. You receive my fax, jot
      a note to me, and then send it back through your fax machine to mine. When
      you send the message back to me, the communication model is reversed.
    * Noise Anything that interferes with or disrupts the message. It's possible that
      static on the phone line distorts the fax message between the two fax machines.
   You'll likely see some of this business on your PMI exam. However, throughout this
chapter, this model affects how communication happens between people.


Planning for Communications
(PMBOK, Section 10.1)
As expected, effective communications begin with effective planning. The point of
planning for communications is to determine and answer four fundamental project
management questions:
    * Who needs what information?
    * When do they need the information?
    * In what modality is the information needed?
    * Who will provide the information?
CAPM/PMP Project Management Certification All-in-One Exam Guide
292
               Communication planning, although it comes late in this book and in the PMBOK,
           is actually done very early in the project planning processes. It's essential to answer the
           previous questions as early as possible, as their outcomes can affect the remainder of
           the project planning. Throughout the project, updates to communications planning are
           expected. Even the responses to the four project management communication ques-
           tions can change as stakeholders, project team members, vendors, and other project
           interfaces change.

           Preparing for Communications
           The only output of the communications planning process is the communications man-
           agement plan. This plan answers in detail the four questions previously mentioned and
           provides information on communication requirements, expectations, and timings.
           When the project management team begins to plan for communications in their proj-
           ect and answer those four essential questions, they've got four inputs they'll rely on,
           which the following sections describe.

           Using Enterprise Environmental Factors
           Much of the communications management processes are linked to the enterprise envi-
           ronmental factors. Enterprise environmental factors that affect project communications
           planning are:
                * Organizational culture and structure
                * Standards and regulations the project must comply with
                * The logistics and organizational infrastructure
                * The human resources the project will rely on and interact with
                * The policies and procedures for personnel administration
                * The project's work authorization system
                * The marketplace conditions
                * Stakeholder risk tolerances
                * Commercial databases that the project may use for estimating
                * Project management information system

           Using Organizational Process Assets
           The organizational process assets affect how the project manager, the project team, and
           the stakeholders will communicate within a project. The primary organizational pro-
           cess assets that affect communication are:
                * Standards and policies unique to the organization
                * Organizational guidelines, work instructions, and performance measurement
                  criteria
                * Organizational communication requirements for all projects considering
                  required and approved technology, security issues, archiving, and allowed
                  communication media
                * Project closure requirements
                                                             Chapter 10: Managing Project Communications

     * Financial controls and procedures
     * Issue and defect management procedures for all projects

     * Project file structure, organization, and retention
     * Historical information and lessons learned requirements
     * Issue and defect management databases

       and cost overruns

Revisiting the Project Scope Statement
The project scope outlines all of the project work and only the project work. It also
serves as a basis for all future project decisions and communicates for all of the project
stakeholders what the project will and will not do. Recall that part of the scope cre-
ation, as I discussed way, way back in Chapter 5, is completing stakeholder analysis. I'll
talk more about stakeholder analysis and managing the project stakeholders later in
this chapter--both are key to project communications management.

Relying on the Project Management Plan
The project management plan is the collection of all those subsidiary plans and related
documents, as well as communications to the stakeholders, the project team, manage-
ment, vendors, the project sponsor, and you, the project manager. It illustrates what the
project aims to do and how it will reach its objectives. The project plan is a communica-
tions device that can be updated as conditions in the project warrant.
    The communications management plan also documents two components of just
about every knowledge area. These two components you've seen over and over, so they
shouldn't be a shock to you:
     * Constraints Anything that limits the project management team's options.
       When it comes to communication constraints, geographical locales,
       incompatible communication software, or even limited communications
       technology can constrain the project team.
     * Assumptions Anything that the project management team believes to
       be true but hasn't proven to be true. For example, the project management
       team may assume that all of the project team can be reached via cell phone,
       but, alas, there are parts of the world, as of this writing, that don't have a
       cell signal.

Identifying Communication Requirements
The project manager and the project team work together to identify who needs what
information. In other words, the project management team needs to know what the
CAPM/PMP Project Management Certification All-in-One Exam Guide
294
           requirements for successful communications are in order to plan on how to achieve
           those requirements.
               Stakeholders will need different types of information, depending on their interest
           in the project and the priority of the project. The project manager will need to complete
           an analysis of the identified stakeholders to determine what information they actually
           need, as well as how often the information is needed.
               There is no value in expending resources on generating information, reports, and
           analyses for stakeholders who have no interest in the information. An accurate assess-
           ment of stakeholders' needs for information is required early in the project planning
           processes. As a rule of thumb, provide information when its presence contributes to
           success or when a lack of information can contribute to failure.
               The project manager and the project team can identify the demand for communica-
           tions using the following:

                * Organization charts
                * The project structure within the performing organization
                * Stakeholder responsibility relationships
                * Departments and disciplines involved with the project work
                * The number of individuals involved in the project and their locales
                * Internal and external information needs
                * Stakeholder information

               On the Certified Associate in Project Management (CAPM) and Project Manage-
           ment Professional (PMP) exams, and in the real world, the project manager will need
           to identify the number of communication channels within a project. Here's a magic
           formula to calculate the number of communication channels: N (N - 1) / 2, where N
           represents the number of identified stakeholders. For example, if a project has 10 stake-
           holders, the formula would read 10 (10 - 1) / 2, for a total of 45 communication chan-
           nels. Figure 10-2 illustrates the formula.

                          EXAM TIP Know this formula: N (N - 1) / 2, where N represents the number
                          of stakeholders. It's easy, and you'll probably encounter it on the PMP exam.


           Figure 10-2

           calculated using a
           simple formula.

                                                                                                  295
Exploring Communication Technologies
Let's face it: There are many different avenues a project manager and a project team can
take to communicate. Project teams can effectively communicate through hallway
meetings or formal project status meetings. Information can be transferred from stake-
holder to stakeholder through anything from written notes to complex online data-
bases and tracking systems.
    As part of the communications planning, the project manager should identify all of




                                                                                                          PART II
the required and approved methods of communicating. Some projects may be highly
sensitive and contain classified information that not all stakeholders are privy to, while
other projects may contain information that's open for anyone to explore. Whatever the
case, the project manager should identify what requirements exist, if any, for the com-
munication modalities.
    Communication modalities can also include meetings, reports, memos, e-mails,
and so on. The project manager should identify the preferred methods of communicat-
ing based on the conditions of the message to be communicated. Consider the follow-
ing, which may have an effect on the communication plan:

     * Urgency of the information When the information is communicated can often
       be as important as what's being communicated. For some projects, information
       should be readily available, while other projects are less demanding.
     * Technology Because of the demands of the project, technology changes may
       be needed to fulfill the project request. For example, the project may require
       an internal Web site that details project progress. If such a Web site does not
       exist, time and monies will need to be invested into this communication
       requirement.
     * Project staffing The project manager should evaluate the abilities of the
       project team to determine if appropriate levels of competency exist to fulfill the
       communication requirements or if training will be required for the project team.
     * Project length The length of the project can have an influence on the
       project technology. Advances in technology may replace a long-term project's
       communication model. A short-term project may not have the same technology
       requirements as a long-term project, but could, nevertheless, benefit from the
       successful model a larger project uses.
     * Project environment How a team communicates often depends on its structure.
       Consider a collocated team versus a virtual team. Each type can be effective, but
       there will be differing communication demands for each type of team.

Creating the Communications Plan
Based on stakeholder analysis, the project manager and the project team can determine
what communications are needed. There's no advantage to supplying stakeholders with
information that isn't needed or desired, and the time spent creating and delivering
such information is a waste of resources.
CAPM/PMP Project Management Certification All-in-One Exam Guide
296
              A communications management plan can organize and document the process,
           types, and expectations of communications. It provides the following:
                * The stakeholder communications requirements in order to communicate the
                  appropriate information as demanded by the stakeholders.
                * Information on what is to be communicated. This plan includes the expected
                  format, content, and detail--think project reports versus quick e-mail updates.
                * Details on how needed information flows through the project to the correct
                  individuals. The communication structure documents where the information
                  will originate, to whom the information will be sent, and in what modality
                  the information is acceptable.
                * Appropriate methods for communicating include e-mails, memos, reports,
                  and even press releases.
                * Schedules of when the various types of communication should occur. Some
                  communications, such as status meetings, should happen on a regular
                  schedule, while other communications may be prompted by conditions
                  within the project.
                * Escalation processes and time frames for moving issues upwards in the
                  organization when they can't be solved at lower levels.
                * Methods to retrieve information as needed.
                * Instructions on how the communications management plan can be updated
                  as the project progresses.
                * A project glossary.
               The communications plan may also include information and guidelines for project
           status meetings, team meetings, e-meetings (that's electronic meetings, not meetings
           about the letter e), and even e-mail. Setting expectations for communications and meet-
           ings early in the project establishes guidelines for the project team and stakeholders.


           Distributing Project Information
           (PMBOK, Section 10.2)
           Now that the project's communication management plan has been created, it's time to
           execute it. Information distribution is the process of ensuring that the proper stakehold-
           ers get the appropriate information when and how they need it. Essentially, it's the imple-
           mentation of the communications management plan. This plan details how the informa-
           tion is to be created and dispersed, and also how the dispersed information is archived.

           Examining Communication Skills
           Here's a news flash: Communication skills are used to send and receive information.
           Sounds easy, right? If communication is so easy, then why are there so many problems
           on projects stemming from misunderstandings, miscommunications, failures to com-
           municate, and similar communication failings? Communication skills are part of the
           project manager's arsenal of general management skills--basically, it's delivering on
           the promise that the right stakeholders will get the right information at the right time.
                                                             Chapter 10: Managing Project Communications

                                                                                                   297
General management skills, in regards to project communications, are also about man-
aging stakeholder requirements.
    In the communication model that your PMI exam will quiz you on, it's the sender's
responsibility to make the message clear, complete, and concise so that the recipient
can receive it. The sender must also confirm that the recipient truly understands the
information. Have you ever been in a project team meeting where a team member im-
plied he understood the message that was being sent, but it later proved that he really




                                                                                                           PART II
didn't understand what was being sent?

             EXAM TIP Face-to-face meetings, like those in ad-hoc meetings, are ideal for
             project communications.

    Communication happens when information is transferred from one party to an-
other. Transmission of a message is just like a radio signal--it's transmitting, but there's
no evidence that anyone is actually picking up on the signal. Along these same lines,
the acknowledgement of a message means that the receiver has indeed received the
message, but she may not necessarily agree with the message that has been sent.

Examining Communication Factors and Technologies
The most common type of communication between a sender and a receiver is verbal
communication. When verbal communications are involved, the project manager
should remember that half of communication is listening. This means that the project
manager must confirm that the receiver understands the message being sent. The con-
firmation of the sent message can be seen in the recipient's body language, feedback,
and verbal confirmation of the sent message. Five terms are used to describe the process
of communicating:
     * Paralingual The pitch, tone, and inflections in the sender's voice affect the
       message being sent.
     * Feedback The sender confirms that the receiver understands the message
       by directly asking for a response, questions for clarification, or other
       confirmation of the sent message.
     * Active listening The receiver confirms that the message is being received
       through feedback, questions, prompts for clarity, and other signs of
       confirmation.
     * Effective listening The receiver is involved in the listening experience
       by paying attention to visual clues from the speaker and paralingual
       characteristics and also by asking relevant questions.
     * Nonverbal Approximately 55 percent of communication is nonverbal. Facial
       expressions, hand gestures, and body language contribute to the message.
    As pictured in Figure 10-3, the words in an oral message actually only account for 7
percent of the message. The tonality of the message accounts for 38 percent of the mes-
sage. The remaining 55 percent is body language. A classic example involves a person
talking to a dog. If the person has a friendly voice and posture, the dog will likely be
CAPM/PMP Project Management Certification All-in-One Exam Guide
298
           receptive. However, if the person has a mean voice and guarded posture, the dog may
           feel threatened and on guard. When project managers talk with stakeholders, they must be
           aware of their body language and posture--not just the words they are communicating.
                The medium in communication can help or hinder the message. For example, when
           a project manager talks to a stakeholder in person, the stakeholder has the advantage
           not only of hearing the message and tone, but also of seeing the body language. Re-
           move body language from a conversation, and the message is interpreted by just the
           words and tonality. Always be aware of the downsides of various nondirect communi-
           cation modalities: e-mail, reports, memos, and letters.

           Creating Information Retrieval Systems
           What good is information if no one can find it? An information retrieval system allows for
           fast and accurate access to project information. It can be a simple manual filing system, an
           advanced database of information storage, or a robust project management software suite.
           Whatever the approach, the information must be accessible, organized, and secure.
                The project team, the project manager, the customer, and other stakeholders may
           need access to design specs, blueprints, plans, and other project information. A good
           information retrieval system is reliable, easy to navigate, and updated as new informa-
           tion becomes available.

           Distributing Information
           Throughout the project, the project manager, the project sponsor, the project team, and
           other stakeholders are going to need to supply information to one another. The meth-
           ods for distributing information can vary, but the best modality is the one that's most
           appropriate to the information being conveyed. In other words, an e-mail may not be
           the correct format in which to share variance information regarding project costs.
               Information can be distributed through some of the following methods, given proj-
           ect demands and available technology:
                * Project meetings                          * E-mail
                * Hard-copy documentation                   * Telephone calls
                * Databases                                 * Videoconferences
                * Faxes                                     * A project Web site

           Figure 10-3
           The words used in
           communication are
           only a small portion
           of a message.

Creating Lessons Learned
Do you ever wish you could travel back in time? With lessons learned, you almost can.
The whole point of lessons learned is to improve future projects by sharing what was
learned during the current project.
    A lessons-learned session is completed with the project manager, the project team,
and key stakeholders to identify lessons they've learned in the technical, managerial,
and project processes. Think of it: You're helping other project managers in the future




                                                                                                        PART II
by documenting what works and what doesn't in your project.
    Lessons learned should happen throughout the project, not just at the project's
conclusion. As a project moves through each phase, project managers can use a lessons-
learned session as a good team-building exercise. This means documenting and learn-
ing from what worked and what didn't within the project.

Examining the Results of Information Distribution
Information distribution results in the following:
    * Lessons learned When lessons-learned sessions are completed, they're available
      to be used and applied. They are now part of the organizational process assets.
    * Project records All project communications are also part of the organizational
      process assets. This includes e-mails, memos, letters, and faxes. In some
      instances, the project team can also contribute by keeping their records in a
      project notebook.
    * Project reports Reports are formal communications on project activities,
      their status, and conditions. Management, customers, and policies within the
      performing organization may have differing requirements for when reports
      are required.
    * Project presentations Presentations are useful in providing information
      to customers, management, the project team, and other stakeholders. The
      delivery and degree of formality of the presentation should be appropriate
      for the conditions and information being delivered within the project.
    * Feedback from stakeholders Stakeholders are usually happy to offer their
      feedback on the project performance. Project managers should then document
      this feedback and apply it to improve the project's performance.
    * Stakeholder notifications As the project rolls along, there undoubtedly will
      be notifications to the stakeholders about resolved issues, approved changes,
      and the overall health of the project. This information should be kept for
      future reference.

Reporting Project Performance
(PMBOK, Section 10.3)
Throughout the project, customers and other stakeholders are going to need updates
on the project performance. The work performance information--the status of what's
been completed and what's left to do--is always at the heart of performance reporting.
Stakeholders want to be kept abreast of how the project is performing.
CAPM/PMP Project Management Certification All-in-One Exam Guide
300
                Performance reporting is the process of collecting, organizing, and disseminating
           information on how project resources are being used to complete the project objec-
           tives. In other words, the people footing the bill and who are affected by the outcome
           of the project need some confirmation that things are going the way the project man-
           ager has promised.
                Performance reporting covers more than just cost and schedule, although these are
           the most common concerns. Another huge issue is the influence of risks on the project's
           success. The project manager and the project team must continue to monitor and eval-
           uate risks, including pending risks and their impact on the project's success.
                Another major concern with reporting is the level of quality. No one will praise the
           project manager and the project team for completing the project on time and on budget
           if the quality of the work is unacceptable. In fact, the project could be declared a failure
           and cancelled as a result of poor quality, or the project team may be forced to redo the
           work, business could be lost, or individuals could even be harmed as a result of the
           poor quality of the project work.

           Examining the Tools for Performance Reporting
           You want, need, and are required to report performance on your project's status, time,
           cost variables, and more. You'll need some tools to get this job done quickly and cor-
           rectly. You already know that the work performance information is one of the primary
           inputs to this process, but you'll need five tools that'll make this task even easier (and
           better). Here are the five reporting tools you need to know for the PMI exam:
                * Information presentation tools You need some way to present your fantastic
                  and not-so-fantastic news to management and other stakeholders. This tool
                  is just any old software package that can incorporate some spreadsheet,
                  presentation, and graphics abilities to present your overall project performance.
                  (The exam will stay vendor-neutral, but for ease here, I'm going to say it: think
                  Microsoft PowerPoint.)
                * Performance information gathering and compilation You need a
                  methodology to capture the project's health and status at any time. This
                  system can be manual, which doesn't sound like much, nor is it very likely
                  in today's push-button world. More likely, you'll pull this information from
                  your project management information system. The specific information you're
                  after is status, forecasting, performance, and project progress.
                * Status review meetings You'll learn about the status of your project through
                  many avenues, but the most common is through the project's status meetings.
                  These regularly scheduled meetings measure what's been done, what's left to
                  do, and the overall health of the project.
                * Time reporting systems Remember Chapter 6 on time management? Good.
                  The time reporting system is the collection of actual time spent completing
                  project management and project tasks to complete the project scope statement.
                * Cost reporting systems I know you remember Chapter 7. This system, like
                  its time-based counterpart, is the system to record actual monies spent on the
                  project. The difference, of course, between the actual and the estimate is a cost
                  variance.
                                                            Chapter 10: Managing Project Communications

                                                                                                  301
Reviewing Project Performance
The project manager will host performance review meetings to ascertain the progress
and level of success the project team is having with the project work. Performance re-
view meetings focus on the work that has been completed and how the work results are
living up to the time and cost estimates. In addition, the project manager and the proj-
ect team will evaluate the project scope to protect it from change and creep. The project
manager and the project team will also examine quality and its effect on the project as




                                                                                                          PART II
a whole. Finally, the project manager must lead a discussion on pending or past risks
and then determine any new risks, as well as the overall risk likelihood and its potential
impact on the project's success.

Analyzing Project Variances
Performance review meetings are not the only tools the project manager uses to assess
project performance. Prior to the performance reviews, or spurred by a performance re-
view, the project manager needs to examine the time, scope, quality, and cost variances
within the project. The project manager will examine the estimates supplied for the time
and cost of activities and compare it to the time and cost actually experienced.
    The goals of analyzing project variances include the following:
     * Prevent future variances
     * Determine the root cause of variances
     * Determine if the variances are an anomaly or if the estimates were flawed
     * Determine if the variances are within a predetermined acceptable range, such
       as -10 percent or +5 percent
     * Determine if the variances can be expected on future project work
     In addition to examining the time and cost variances, which are the most common,
the project manager must examine any scope, resource, and quality variances. A change
in the scope can skew time and cost predictions. A variance in resources, such as the
expected performance by a given resource, can alter the project schedule and even the
predicted costs of a project. Quality variances may result in rework, lost time, lost mon-
ies, and even the rejection of the project product.

             EXAM TIP Performance reporting is often based on the results of earned
             value management (EVM). See Chapter 7 for detailed information on how to
             calculate EVM.

Examining the Results of Performance Reporting
The goal of performance reporting is to share information regarding the project's per-
formance with the appropriate stakeholders. Of course, performance reporting is not
something done only at the end of the project or after a project phase. Instead, it is
done according to a regular schedule, as detailed in the communication plan or as proj-
ect conditions warrant. Outputs of performance reporting include such things as:
     * Performance reports These are the results and summation of the project
       performance analysis. The communications management plan will detail the
CAPM/PMP Project Management Certification All-in-One Exam Guide
302
                   type of report needed, based on the conditions within the project, the timing
                   of the communication, and the demands of the project stakeholder.
                * Forecasting Will the project end on schedule? Will the project be on budget?
                  How much longer will it take to complete the project? And how much more
                  money will this project need to finish? Earned value management can answer
                  many of these questions for the project management team.
                * Change requests Performance results may prompt change requests to some
                  areas of the project. The change requests should flow into the change control
                  system (CCS) for consideration and then be approved or denied.
                * Recommended corrective actions Corrective actions center on bringing
                  future project performance back in alignment with the project plan.


           Managing Project Stakeholders
           (PMBOK, Section 10.4)
           The project manager is responsible for managing stakeholders, who often require, or
           demand, attention from the project manager. Therefore, the project manager must
           make time to answer questions, get the stakeholders involved in the project, and, at a
           minimum, communicate the project's status. Stakeholder management is vital to a
           project's success for several reasons:
                * It leads to resolving stakeholder issues.
                * It promotes synergy.
                * It limits disruptions during the project.
                * It promotes project buy-in.
                * It keeps the project on track.
               Stakeholder management relies on the communication management plan to direct
           what needs to be communicated and when. The communications management plan
           will also define the goals and expectations of the stakeholders, which, in turn, will
           guide conversations between the project manager and the project stakeholders. The
           communications management and your organizational process assets are the only in-
           puts to this process.

           Communicating Effectively
           The communications management plan defines what needs to be communicated to
           which stakeholders, when the communication is needed, and in what modality the
           information should be communicated. Armed with that information, the project man-
           agement team needs to adapt their methodology for communication based on the
           stakeholder, the conditions in the project, or the news that's being presented.
               Face-to-face meetings are, without a doubt, the most effective method to communi-
           cate and resolve issues with stakeholders. This gets back to the concept that 55 percent
           of all communication is nonverbal. That's why phone meetings, e-mails, and memos
           are considerably weak for communications. It's hard to read someone's reaction when
                                                               Chapter 10: Managing Project Communications

                                                                                                     303
you're in a phone conference. The project manager also needs to consider the paralin-
gual impact of the conversation. Recall that paralingual is the tone and inflection of the
speaker's voice that affects the speaker's message. Ever make a joke in an e-mail message
and someone took it the wrong way?

Revisiting Issue Logs
An issue log is just that--a logbook full of project issues. Issues are documented, and




                                                                                                             PART II
their status is recorded and updated based on changes to the issues. Typically, issues
don't evolve into projects or even project activities, but are recorded and considered to
maintain good working relationships among the stakeholders and the project team. Ide-
ally, an issue is assigned an owner and a target date for the issue to be resolved by. Unre-
solved issues can, of course, evolve into major conflicts and sources of project delays.
     The project management team should be aware of pressing issues and work with the
issue owners to ensure that they are resolved by the deadline. When an issue is resolved,
the issue log should be updated with the resolution and its impact on the project, if any.


Chapter Summary
Communication is a project manager's most important skill. Project managers have to
communicate with management, customers, the project team members, and the rest of
the stakeholders involved with the project. The project manager's foundation is com-
munication. Without effective communication, how will work get completed, progress
reported, and information dispersed?
    Communications planning centers on asking, "Who needs what information and when
do they need it?" Consider all of the different channels for communication on any project.
There are many different possibilities for information to be lost, messages to be skewed,
and progress to be hindered. The formula for calculating the communication channels is N
(N - 1) / 2, where N represents the number of stakeholders. As a general rule, larger projects
require more detail--and detail means more planning for communications.
    The communications management plan organizes and documents the communica-
tion processes, acceptable modalities for types of communication, and the stakeholder
expectations for communication. The plan should detail how information is gathered,
organized, accessed, and dispersed. The plan should also provide a schedule of ex-
pected communication based on a calendar schedule, such as project status meetings.
Some communications are prompted by conditions within the project, such as cost
variances, schedule variances, or other performance-related issues.

Key Terms
Acknowledgement The receiver signals that the message has been received; an acknowl-
edgement shows receipt of the message, but not necessarily agreement with the message.
Active listening The receiver confirms that the message is being received through
feedback, questions, prompts for clarity, and other signs of confirmation.
Choice of media The best modality to use when communicating that is relevant to
the information being communicated.

           Communication assumptions Anything that the project management team believes
           to be true but hasn't proven to be true. For example, the project management team may
           assume that all of the project team can be reached via cell phone, but parts of the world,
           as of this writing, don't have a cell signal.
           Communication barrier Anything that prohibits communication from occurring.
           Communication channels formula N (N - 1) / 2, where N represents the number of
           identified stakeholders. This formula reveals the total number of communication chan-
           nels within a project.
           Communication constraints Anything that limits the project management team's
           options. Geographical locales, incompatible communications software, and even
           limited communications technology are all examples of communication con-
           straints.
           Communications management plan A project management subsidiary plan that de-
           fines the stakeholders who need specific information, the person who will supply the
           information, the schedule for the information to be supplied, and the approved modal-
           ity to provide the information.
           Cost reporting system       A system to record the actual costs of the project activities.
           Decoder The device that decodes a message as it is being received.
           Effective listening The receiver is involved in the listening experience by paying atten-
           tion to visual clues from the speaker and paralingual characteristics and by asking rel-
           evant questions.
           Encoder The device that encodes the message being sent.
           Feedback The sender confirms that the receiver understands the message by directly
           asking for a response, questions for clarification, or other confirmation.
           Information presentation tools A software package that allows the project manage-
           ment team to present the project's health through graphics, spreadsheets, and text.
           (Think of Microsoft Project.)
           Information retrieval system        A system to quickly and effectively store, archive, and
           access project information.
           Lessons learned This is documentation of what did and did not work in the project
           implementation. Lessons-learned documentation is created throughout the project by
           the entire project team. When lessons-learned sessions are completed, they're available
           to be used and applied by the entire organization. They are now part of the organiza-
           tional process assets.
           Medium The device or technology that transports a message.
           Noise Anything that interferes with or disrupts a message.

               19. George is the project manager of the 7YH Project. In this project, George
                   considers the relation between himself and the customer to be of utmost
                   importance. Which one of the following is a valid reason for George's belief
                   in the importance of this relationship?
                    A. The customer will complete George's performance evaluation. A poor
                       communication model between George and the customer will affect his
                       project bonus.

                                                                                                        PART II
      A. The transfer of knowledge
      B. The outputting of knowledge
      C. The presence of knowledge
      D. The transmission of knowledge

Answers
   1. D. Noise is anything that interferes with the transmission and understanding
      of the message. Distance is an example of noise. A, a fax machine, is an
      example of a decoder. B is incorrect; ad-hoc conversations are informal
      conversations. C, contractual agreements, are a type of formal communication.
      For more information, see the introduction to Chapter 10 in the PMBOK.
   2. C. Management is requesting a communications management plan,
      which details the requirements and expectations for communicating
      information among the project stakeholders. A is incorrect, since a roles-
      and-responsibilities matrix depicts who does what and who makes which
      decisions. B, the scope management plan, is also incorrect because this
      plan explains how changes to the scope may be allowed, depending on the
      circumstances. D is not a valid choice for the question. For more information,
      see the PMBOK, Section 10.1.
   3. D. Lessons learned and historical information from a previous project are
      ideal inputs to communications planning. A, B, and C are incorrect because
      these choices do not fully answer the question. Lessons learned from previous,
      similar projects are the best tool to identify stakeholders' requirements for
      communication. For more information, see the PMBOK, Section 10.1.1.2.
   4. B. Using the formula N (N - 1) / 2, where N represents the number of
      stakeholders, gives us 496 communication channels. A, C, and D are incorrect.
      These values do not reflect the number of communication channels on the
      project. For more information, see the PMBOK, Section 10.1.2.1.
   5. C. This is a tough question, but typical of the CAPM and PMP exams. The
      question asks how many more communication channels exist. You'll have to
      calculate the new value, which is 231, and then subtract the original value,
      which is 171, for a total of 60 new channels. A is incorrect. 171 is the original
      number of communication channels. B is incorrect because this value reflects
      the new number of communication channels. D is not a valid choice. For
      more information, see the PMBOK, Section 10.1.2.1.

                6. A. The project sponsor is the source of the memo, since this is the sender
                   of the message. B, C, and D are all recipients of the memo, not the sender,
                   so they cannot be the source of the message. For more information, see the
                   introduction to Chapter 10 in the PMBOK.
                7. D. Team members that are not located physically close together can be a
                   communications constraint, since it can be tougher to communicate when
                   distance between team members exists. A, B, and C are all incorrect, since
                   these are not project communications constraints. For more information,
                   see the PMBOK, Section 10.1.1.4.
                8. D. RACI charts do not show project performance, but accountability of the
                   resources involved in the project. A, B, and C are incorrect, since these choices
                   do present project performance. For more information, see the PMBOK,
                   Section 10.3.3.1.
                9. A. Paralingual is a term used to describe the pitch and tone of one's voice.
                   B, feedback, is a request to confirm the information sent in the conversation.
                   C, effective listening, is the ability to understand the message through what
                   is said, facial expressions, gestures, tone, pitch, and so on. D, active listening,
                   is the process of confirming what is understood and asking for clarification
                   when needed. For more information, see the PMBOK, Section 10.2.2.1.
               10. C. An exception report is typically completed when variances exceed a given
                   limit. A is incorrect. Progress reports describe the progress of the project or
                   phase. B is incorrect because this is not a valid answer. D, a trends report, is an
                   analysis of project trends over time. For more information, see threshold in the
                   PMBOK glossary.
               11. A. Noise is the correct answer, since their phone calls are distracting from your
                   message. B, C, and D are incorrect, as they do not answer the question. For
                   more information, see the introduction to Chapter 10 in the PMBOK.
               12. B. Project meetings should have a set time limit. A, C, and D are incorrect
                   answers, although these are good attributes of project team meetings. For
                   more information, see the introduction to Chapter 10 in the PMBOK.
               13. A. Greater than 50 percent of a message is sent through nonverbal
                   communications. B, C, and D are incorrect. For more information, see
                   the introduction to Chapter 10 in the PMBOK and the section titled
                   "Examining Communication Factors and Technologies" in this chapter.
               14. C. Lessons learned takes place throughout the project life cycle, not just at the
                   end of the project or its phases. A, B, and D are incorrect choices. For more
                   information, see the PMBOK, Section 10.2.2.4.
               15. D. Lessons-learned documentation helps future project teams complete their
                   projects with more efficiency and effectiveness. A, B, and C are incorrect, since
                   each statement does not reflect the intent of lessons-learned documentation:
                   to help future project teams. For more information, see the PMBOK, Section
                   10.2.2.4.

16. C. The project currently has 13 team members, and next week, seven additional
    team members will come aboard, thus making a total of 20 team members.
    Using the formula N (N - 1) / 2, where N is the number of identified
    stakeholders, the communication channels equal 190. A, B, and D are all
    incorrect choices. For more information, see the PMBOK, Section 10.1.2.1.
17. C. Labor issues are not part of performance reporting. A, B, and D are all part
    of performance reporting. For more information, see the PMBOK, Section 10.3.

18. D. When information is sent, it is considered to be transmitted. A, B, and
    C are all incorrect choices. For more information, see the introduction to
    Chapter 10 in the PMBOK.
19. D. George and the customer's relationship can allow clearer communication
    on the project objectives than what may be expressed in the project contract.
    The contract should take precedence on any issues, but direct contact is
    often the best way to achieve clear and concise communication. A is an
    incorrect choice because the focus is on personal gain rather than the good
    of the project. B is incorrect, since the customer does not necessarily need to
    be educated about the project management process. C is incorrect because
    the customer is not always right--the contract will take precedence in any
    disagreements. For more information, see the PMBOK, Sections 10.4 and 12.5.
20. A. The transfer of knowledge is evidence that communication has occurred. B
    and C do not necessarily mean the knowledge has originated from the source
    and been transferred to the recipient. D is also incorrect because messages
    are transmitted, but knowledge is transferred. For more information, see the
    introduction to Chapter 10 in the PMBOK.

                                                                                                  11
    In this chapter, you will
       * Plan for risk management
       * Identify project risks
       * Complete qualitative risk analysis
       * Complete quantitative risk analysis
       * Plan the risk responses
       * Monitor and control project risks




 A project risk is an uncertain event or condition that can have a positive or negative
 impact on the project. That's correct--it's possible for a risk to have a positive impact.
 Technically, risk isn't a bad thing; it's the impact that can be painful, costly, or delay the
 project work. Most project managers look at risk the same way they'd look at leftover
 shrimp cocktail. Yuck. Some risks, though, are good for the project, and the project
 manager wants to accept them; others aren't so welcome.
     Let's look at this from another point of view. Imagine a golfer teeing up. To the right
 of the tee box, there's a water hazard, but just beyond the water is the green. The golfer
 can either avoid the water and take longer to get to the green or try to shoot over the
 water and get on the green in fewer strokes. Driving up the fairway is the safer play, but
 cutting over the water will improve the golfer's score. The risk with the water hazard is
 that if he can't make the shot, then he's down a penalty stroke.

                VIDEO     Creating a risk matrix.


     Risk, like the golfing scenario, must be in proportion to the reward the risk taker
 will realize as a result of taking the chance. The willingness to accept the risk is called
 the utility function. An experienced golfer may have a high utility function, so he's will-
 ing to accept the water hazard. A golf hack like me would likely have a low utility func-
 tion and drive up the fairway away from the water.
     It's true in project management, too. With some projects, you and your organization
 are willing to accept risks to realize rewards such as cost savings, time savings, or on-the-
 job training. On other projects--typically, those projects with high impact and high
 profile characteristics--you're not so willing to accept the risks. In this chapter we'll look

                                                                                           313

           at the six processes that dictate project risk management, and you'll have plenty of risk
           management questions on your Project Management Institute (PMI) exam.
               The project management processes described here are presented in the most logical
           order. They are actually iterative processes through the project life cycle. Pay special at-
           tention to monitoring and controlling project risks, as new risks can creep into the
           project or be discovered as the project moves towards closure.


           Planning for Risk Management
           (PMBOK, Section 11.1)
           Risk management planning is not the identification of risks or even the response to
           known risks within a project. Risk management planning is how the project management
           team will complete the risk management activities within the project. These activities re-
           ally set up the project to effectively manage the five other risk management activities.
               By deciding the approach to each of the risk management activities before moving
           into them, the project management team can more effectively identify risks, complete
           risk analysis, and then plan risk responses. In addition, planning for risk management
           also allows the project management team to create a strategy for the ongoing identifica-
           tion and monitoring of existing risks within the project.

           Preparing for Risk Management Planning
           There are four inputs to risk management planning, although some are more important
           than others. It's essential for the project management team to understand the priority of
           the project, which shouldn't be too tough to do. Important projects, high-profile projects,
           or projects with hefty budgets are generally risk-adverse. Smaller projects are generally
           more willing to accept risks. You'll need the following to prepare for risk management:

                * Enterprise environmental factors An organization's attitude towards risk
                  may vary, as I mentioned, based on the type, size, and profile of the project.
                * Organizational process assets An organization may have a predefined
                  approach to risk management. If that's the case, the project management team
                  uses the organization's approach and follows its established procedures. For
                  example, an organization could define risk tolerance levels, risk categories,
                  templates, roles and responsibilities, and more. A project team may also use
                  other similar projects to guide the current risk management planning activities.
                * Project scope statement The project scope is revisited throughout the
                  project, as it defines all that's in scope and out of scope. The project scope
                  statement also gives some insight into the priority and impact of the project,
                  which can influence the risk management activities.
                * Project management plan All of the subsidiary plans are needed as part of
                  integration management. There may be risks lurking in any or all of the other
                  project management plans. The project management team will examine
                  the project for risks and the anticipated impact of the risks based on these
                  other plans. I'll talk more about risk identification in a moment.
                                                                       Chapter 11: Managing Project Risks

                                                                                                    315
Completing Risk Management Planning
Planning for risk happens in--surprise, surprise!--planning meetings, where the proj-
ect team develops the risk management plan and analyzes the inputs previously men-
tioned to make the best decisions for the current project. While the project team is the
primary participant at the risk management planning meeting, the attendees may actu-
ally include the project manager, stakeholders, and other individuals within an organi-
zation that influence the risk management processes.




                                                                                                            PART II
      The purpose of these risk management meetings is to create the risk management
plan and to define the cost and schedule for risk management activities. Let's face facts:
It'll take time and monies for most projects to identify, test, and challenge the risks that
may exist within the project. These initial meetings allow monies and time to be incor-
porated within the project. Risk responsibilities are also assigned in these meetings, as
are the risk terminologies the project will use. Risk management planning also defines
and tailors the following for the project:
     * Risk templates the project should use
     * Definitions and terms for risk levels
     * Probability according to risk type
     * Impact of the risks
     * Guidelines for the risk and impact matrix to be used during risk analysis

Creating the Risk Management Plan
The whole point of risk management meetings and analysis is to create the risk man-
agement plan. This plan does not detail the planned responses to individual risks with-
in the project--this is the purpose of the risk response plan. The risk management plan
is responsible for determining how:
     * Risks will be identified
     * Quantitative analysis will be completed
     * Qualitative analysis will be completed
     * Risk response planning will happen
     * Risks will be monitored
     * Ongoing risk management activities will happen throughout the project's
       life cycle

Defining the Risk Management Methodology
The methodology is concerned with how the risk management processes will take place.
It asks the following:
     * What tools are available to use for risk management?
     * What approaches are acceptable within the performing organization?
     * What data sources can be accessed and used for risk management?
     * What approach is best for the project type and the phase of the project?
CAPM/PMP Project Management Certification All-in-One Exam Guide
316
                * Which approach is most appropriate given the conditions of the project?
                * How much flexibility is available for the project given the conditions, time
                  frame, and the project budget?

           Identifying Risk Roles and Responsibilities
           The roles and responsibilities identify the groups and individuals that will participate
           in the leadership and support of each of the risk management activities within the proj-
           ect plan. In some instances, risk management teams outside of the project team may
           have a more realistic, unbiased approach to the risk identification, impact, and overall
           risk management needs than the actual project team does.

           Creating a Risk Management Budget
           Based on the size, impact, and priority of the project, a budget may need to be estab-
           lished for the project's risk management activities. This section of the risk management
           plan defines a cost estimate for the resources needed to complete risk management.
           These costs are rolled into the project's cost baseline. A project with high priority and
           no budget allotment for risk management activities may face uncertain times ahead.

           Identifying the Risk Management Schedule
           The risk management process needs a schedule to determine how often and when risk
           management activities should happen throughout the project. If risk management hap-
           pens too late in the project, the project could be delayed because of the time needed to
           identify, assess, and respond to the risks. A realistic schedule should be developed early
           in the project to accommodate risks, risk analysis, and risk reaction.

           Defining a Project's Risk Categories
           Based on the nature of the work, there should be identified categories of risks within the
           project. Figure 11-1 depicts one approach to identifying risk categories by using a risk
           breakdown structure (RBS). Throughout the project, the risk categories should be revisited
           to update and reflect the current status of the project. If a similar risk management plan is
           available from a previous project, the project team may elect to use this plan as a template
           and tailor the risk categories accordingly. There are four major categories of risks:

                                                                         Chapter 11: Managing Project Risks

     * Technical, quality, or performance risks Technical risks are associated
       with new, unproven, or complex technologies being used on the project.
       Changes to the technology during the project implementation can also be a
       risk. Quality risks are the levels set for expectations of impractical quality and
       performance. Changes to industry standards during the project can also be
       lumped into this category of risks.
     * Project management risks These risks deal with faults in the management




                                                                                                              PART II
       of the project: the unsuccessful allocation of time, resources, and scheduling;
       unacceptable work results (low-quality work); and poor project management
       as a whole.
     * Organizational risks The performing organization can contribute to the
       project's risks through unreasonable cost, time, and scope expectations; poor
       project prioritization; inadequate funding or the disruption of funding; and
       competition with other projects for internal resources.
     * External risks These risks are outside of the project, but directly affect it--for
       example, legal issues, labor issues, a shift in project priorities, or weather. "Force
       majeure" risks can be scary, and usually call for disaster recovery rather than
       project management. These are risks caused by earthquakes, tornados, floods,
       civil unrest, and other disasters.


Identifying the Project Risks
(PMBOK, Section 11.2)
Risk identification is the systematic process of combing through the project, the project
plan, the work breakdown structure, and all supporting documentation to identify as
many of the risks that may affect the project as possible. Remember, a risk is an uncer-
tain event or condition that may affect the project's outcome. Risks can be positive or
negative. In the big picture of risk identification, there are two categories of risks:
     * Pure risks These risks have only a negative outcome. Examples include loss
       of life or limb, fire, theft, natural disasters, and the like.
     * Business risks These risks may have a negative or a positive outcome.
       Examples include using a less experienced worker to complete a task, allowing
       phases or activities to overlap, or foregoing the expense of formal training for
       on-the-job education.
    The initial risk identification meeting can be wild and unwieldy if the approach
isn't structured. The project manager may elect to address risks by category, project
phase, or the project life cycle. The goal of these meetings is to capture all of the risks so
that the project management team can plan adequately for the risk responses. The par-
ticipants of the risk identification meetings can include:
     * Project manager
     * Project team
     * Risk management team (if one exists, of course)
CAPM/PMP Project Management Certification All-in-One Exam Guide

                * Subject matter experts
                * Customers
                * End users
                * Other project managers
                * Stakeholders
                * Risk management experts
               Risk identification is not a one-time event. The project manager should encourage the
           project team and these participants to continually be on the lookout for risk events as the
           project moves toward closure. The risk management plan also includes timings for itera-
           tions of risk identification and management. Risk identification is an iterative process,
           because new risks can creep into the project or existing risks may be identified later as
           more detail becomes available. You'll need five inputs to complete risk identification:
                * Enterprise environmental factors When it comes to risk identification, having
                  commercial databases, academic studies, benchmarking results, whitepapers,
                  and other statistics and information related to your discipline is ideal.
                * Organizational process assets If an organization has completed projects
                  similar to the current project, there's no reason not to use the historical
                  information to help the risk identification along.
                * Project scope statement The project scope statement includes the assumptions
                  that the project is based on. These assumptions are often sources of risk within
                  the project.
                * Risk management plan This lone output of risk management planning is
                  needed during risk identification because the plan will identify the organization's
                  and the project's proper approach for identifying risks within the project.
                * Project management plan The project management plan is also needed, as
                  there are likely risks lurking throughout the project. Consider schedules, costs,
                  assumptions and constraints, quality issues, and all the other knowledge areas
                  where risks may be hiding.

           Finding Project Risks
           Now the fun part of risk identification: Anything goes as long as it may be perceived as
           a risk. All of the risk identification participants should identify as many risks as possi-
           ble, regardless of their perceived initial threat. I'm not really talking about sunspots and
           asteroid crashes here, but relevant risks should be recorded, regardless of their size and
           impact on the project. What begins as a small risk can bloom into something much
           larger as the project progresses.

           Reviewing the Project Documentation
           One of the first steps the risk identification participants can take is to review the project
           documentation. The project plan, scope, and other project files should be reviewed.
           Constraints and assumptions should be reviewed, considered, and analyzed for risks.
           This structure review takes a broad look at the project plan, the scope, and the activities
           defined within the project.
                                                                      Chapter 11: Managing Project Risks

                                                                                                   319
Relying on Risk Identification Methods
There are five methods the Project Management Body of Knowledge (PMBOK) dives
into when it comes gathering project information regarding risks. You'll likely see these
on your exam:
     * Brainstorming Good old-fashioned brainstorming is the most common
       approach to risk identification. It's usually completed as a project team
       with subject matter experts to identify the risks within the project. The risks




                                                                                                           PART II
       are identified in broad terms and posted, and then the risks' characteristics
       are detailed. Your pal, the risk breakdown structure, can help facilitate the
       brainstorming process. The identified risks are categorized and will pass
       through the qualitative and quantitative risk analyses later. I'll discuss those
       in just a few pages--no peeking!
     * Delphi Technique The Delphi Technique, shown in Figure 11-2, is an
       anonymous method used to query experts about foreseeable risks within a
       project, phase, or component of a project. The results of the survey are analyzed
       by a third party, organized, and then circulated to the experts. There can be
       several rounds of anonymous discussion with the Delphi Technique without fear
       of backlash or offending other participants in the process. The Delphi Technique
       is completely anonymous, and the goal is to gain consensus on project risks
       within the project. The anonymous nature of the process ensures that no single
       expert's advice overtly influences the opinion of another participant.
        I often get asked why this approach is called the Delphi Technique. This
        approach was developed during the Cold War as a forecasting and consensus-
        building device. It's called the Delphi Technique after the "Oracle of the Delphi."
        Delphi is a Greek archeological site that, according to legend, is the center of
        the universe. However, as fascinating as Greek mythology is, there won't be
        any legends on your PMI examination. Sorry.

                * Hosting interview sessions Interviewing subject matter experts and project
                  stakeholders is an excellent approach to identifying risks on the current
                  project based on the interviewees' experiences. The people responsible for
                  risk identification share the overall purpose of the project, the project's
                  work breakdown structure (WBS), and, likely, the same assumptions as the
                  interviewee.
                   The interviewee, through questions and discussion, shares his insight on what
                   risks he perceives within the project. The goal of the process is to learn from
                   the expert what risks may be hidden within the project, what risks this person
                   has encountered on similar work, and what insight the person has into the
                   project work.
                * Root cause identification Project managers and the project team often see
                  the impact of a risk, but not always its cause. Root cause identification aims to
                  find out why a risk event may be occurring, the causal factors creating the risk
                  events, and then, eventually, how the events can be mitigated or eliminated.
                * Implementing SWOT analysis SWOT stands for strengths, weaknesses,
                  opportunities, and threats. SWOT analysis is the process of examining the
                  project from the perspective of each characteristic. For example, a technology
                  project may identify SWOT as:
                   * Strengths The technology to be installed in the project has been installed
                     by other large companies in our industry.
                   * Weaknesses We have never installed this technology before.
                   * Opportunities The new technology will allow us to reduce our cycle time
                     for time-to-market on new products. Opportunities are things, conditions,
                     or events that allow an organization to differentiate itself from competitors
                     and improve its standing in the marketplace.
                   * Threats The time to complete the training and simulation may overlap
                     with product updates, new versions, and external changes to our technology
                     portfolio.

           Using Checklists
           Checklists are a quick approach to risk identification. The lowest of the risk breakdown
           structures might serve as a checklist, for example. More likely, similar projects that have
           been completed in the past are going to have risk registers that the current risk identifi-
           cation process can benefit from. The PMBOK warns that while checklists can be created
           quickly and easily, it's impossible to build an exhaustive risk checklist.

                         EXAM TIP The danger in using or relying on risk identification checklists is
                         that the risk identification participants don't consider risks that aren't on the
                         checklists. Even for projects that have been completed over and over, based on
                         the nature of the work, the project team must actively seek to identify risks
                         that are outside of the organizational process assets checklists.
                                                                     Chapter 11: Managing Project Risks

                                                                                                  321
Examining the Assumptions
All projects have assumptions. Assumption analysis is the process of examining the as-
sumptions to see what risks may stem from false assumptions. Examining assumptions
is about finding the validity of the assumptions. For example, consider a project to in-
stall a new piece of software on every computer within an organization. The project
team has made the assumption that all of the computers within the organization meet
the minimum requirements to install the software. If this assumption were wrong, cost




                                                                                                          PART II
increases and schedule delays would occur.
    Examining the assumptions also requires a review of assumptions across the whole
project for consistency. For example, consider a project with an assumption that a se-
nior employee will be needed throughout the entire project work; the cost estimate,
however, has been billed at the rate of a junior employee.

Utilizing Diagramming Techniques
Several diagramming techniques can be utilized by the project team to identify risks:
     * Ishikawa These cause-and-effect diagrams are also called fishbone diagrams,
       as seen in Figure 11-3. They are great for analyzing the root causes of risk
       factors within the project. The goal is to identify and treat the root of the
       problem, not the symptom.
     * Flow chart System or process flow charts show the relationships between
       components and how the overall process works. These are useful for
       identifying risks between system components.




Figure 11-3 Ishikawa diagrams are also known as fishbone diagrams.

                * Influence An influence diagram charts out a decision problem. It identifies
                  all of the elements, variables, decisions, and objectives and also how each
                  factor may influence another.

           Creating a Risk Register
           The only output of risk identification is the project's risk register. The risk register is a com-
           ponent of the project plan that contains all of the information related to the risk manage-
           ment activities. It's updated as risk management activities are conducted to reflect the sta-
           tus, progress, and nature of the project risks. The risk register includes the following:
                * Risks Of course, the most obvious output of risk identification is the risk
                  that has been successfully identified. Recall that a risk is an uncertain event
                  or condition that could potentially have a positive or negative effect on the
                  project's success.
                * Potential responses During the initial risk identification process, there
                  may be solutions and responses to identified risks. This is fine, as long
                  as the responses are documented here. Along with the risk responses, the
                  identification of risk triggers may also occur. Triggers are warning signs or
                  symptoms that a risk has occurred or is about to occur. For example, should
                  a vendor fail to complete her portion of the project as scheduled, the project
                  completion may be delayed.
                * The root causes of risk        Risk identification can identify why risk
                  conditions exist.
                * Updated risk categories Risk identification may prompt the project team to
                  identify new categories of risks. These new categories should be documented
                  in the risk register, and if a risk breakdown structure is utilized, it will need to
                  be updated as well.


           Using Qualitative Risk Analysis
           (PMBOK, Section 11.3)
           The first, and somewhat shallow, risk analysis is qualitative analysis. Qualitative risk
           analysis "qualifies" the risks that have been identified in the project. Specifically, quali-
           tative risk analysis examines and prioritizes the risks based on their probability of oc-
           curring and the impact on the project if the risks do occur. Qualitative risk analysis is a
           broad approach to ranking risks by priority, which then guides the risk reaction process.
           The end result of qualitative risk analysis (once risks have been identified and priori-
           tized) can either lead to more in-depth quantitative risk analysis or move directly into
           risk response planning.
               The status of the project will also affect the process of qualitative risk analysis. Early
           in the project, there may be several risks that have not yet surfaced. Later in the project,
           new risks may become evident and need to pass through qualitative analysis. The status
           of the project is linked to the available time needed to analyze and study the risks. There
           may be more time early in the project, while a looming deadline near the project's end
           may create a sense of urgency to find a solution for the newly identified risks.
                                                                          Chapter 11: Managing Project Risks

             EXAM TIP When you think of "qualitative," think of qualifying.You are
             qualifying, or justifying, the seriousness of the risk for further analysis. Some
             Certified Associate in Project Management (CAPM) and Project Management
             Professional (PMP) candidates like to remember that qualitative is a list. The
             "L" in qualitative and list ties the two together.

Preparing for Qualitative Analysis




                                                                                                               PART II
As with most of the project planning processes, the project management team is in-
cluded in the rapid analysis of the project's risks. There are four inputs to qualitative
analysis:

     * Organizational process assets Past projects and lessons learned--the
       organization's historical information--are ideal resources for the qualitative
       risk analysis process. No need to reinvent the wheel.
     * Project scope statement Consider an organization that does the same type
       of projects over and over, such as installing networks or constructing bridges.
       These repetitive projects have known risks and known risk responses. An
       organization that is attempting project work that it has never done before
       has more unknowns, which can represent risks in a project. The project
       scope statement can help identify a project's uniqueness. The project scope
       statement's assumptions and constraints can also be examined for risks.
     * Risk management plan The risk management plan is the key input to
       qualitative risk analysis. The plan will dictate the process, the methodologies
       to be used, and the scoring model for identified risks. In addition to the risk
       management plan, the identified risks from the risk register, obviously, will
       be needed to perform an analysis. These are the risks that will be scored and
       ranked based on their probability and impact.
     * Risk register This project-centric database of identified risks and their status
       is referenced to qualify risks.

Completing Qualitative Analysis
During the risk identification process, all possible risks are identified. Of course, not all
risks are worth responding to, while others demand attention. Qualitative analysis is a
subjective approach to organizing and prioritizing risks. Through a methodical and logical
approach, the identified risks are rated according to probability and potential impact.
    The outcome of the ranking determines four things:

     * It identifies the risks that require additional analysis through quantitative risk
       analysis.
     * It identifies the risks that may proceed directly to risk response planning.
     * It identifies risks that are not critical, project-stopping risks, but that still must
       be documented.
     * It prioritizes risks.
CAPM/PMP Project Management Certification All-in-One Exam Guide

           Applying Probability and Impact
           The project risks are rated according to their probability and impact. Risk probability is the
           likelihood that a risk event may happen, while risk impact is the consequence that the result
           of the event will have on the project objectives. Two approaches exist to ranking risks:
                 * Cardinal scales identify the probability and impact on a numerical value,
                   from .01 (very low) to 1.0 (certain).
                 * Ordinal scales identify and rank the risks from very high to very unlikely.

           Creating a Probability-Impact Matrix
           Each identified risk is fed into a probability-impact matrix, as seen in Figure 11-4. The
           matrix maps out the risk, its probability, and its possible impact. The risks with higher
           probability and impact are a more serious threat to the project objectives than risks with
           lower impact and consequences. The risks that are threats to the project require quantita-
           tive analysis to determine the root causes, the methods to control the risks, and effective
           risk management. We'll discuss quantitative risk management later in this chapter.
               The project is best served when the probability scale and the impact scale are pre-
           defined prior to qualitative analysis. For example, the probability scale rates the likeli-
           hood of an individual risk happening and can be on a linear scale (.1, .3, .5, .7, .9) or
           the scale can be the ordinal scale. The scale, however, should be defined and agreed
           upon in the risk management plan. The impact scale, which measures the severity of
           the risk on the project's objectives, can also be ordinal or cardinal.
               By identifying and assigning the scales to use prior to the process of qualitative
           analysis, all risks can be ranked by the system, including future identified risks. A shift
           in risk-rating methodologies mid-project can cause disagreements with regards to how
           the project risks should be handled.
               A probability-impact matrix multiplies the value for the risk probability by the risk
           impact, giving a total risk score, as seen in Figure 11-5. The risk's scores can be cardinal,
           and then preset values can qualify the risk for a risk response. For example, an identi-
           fied risk in a project is the possibility that the vendor may be late in delivering the
           hardware. The probability is rated at .9, but the impact of the risk on the project is rated

at .10. The risk score is calculated by multiplying the probability times the impact--in
this case, resulting in a score of .09.
     The scores within the probability-impact matrix can be referenced against the per-
forming organization's policies for risk reaction. Based on the risk score, the performing
organization can place the risk in differing categories to guide risk reaction. There are
three common categories, based on an "RAG (Red, Amber, Green) Rating" risk score:
     * Red condition High risk; these risk scores are high in impact and probability.




                                                                                                               PART II
     * Amber condition (also called yellow condition)             These risks are somewhat
       high in impact and probability.
     * Green condition Risks with a green label are generally fairly low in impact,
       probability, or both.

Relying on Data Precision
Here's the truth about qualitative risk analysis: It's easy, fast, cheap, and not very reliable.
One of the toughest parts of qualitative risk analysis is the biased, subjective nature of
the process. A project manager and the project team must question the reliability and
reality of the data that leads to the ranking of the risks. For example, Susan may have
great confidence in herself when it comes to working with new, unproven technologies.
Based on this opinion, she petitions the probability of the work to be a very low score.
    However, because she has no experience with the technology due to its newness, the
probability of the risk of failure is actually very high. The biased opinion that Susan can
complete the work with zero defects and problems is slightly skewed because she has
never worked with the technology before. Obviously, a low-ranked score on a risk that
should be ranked high can have detrimental effects on the project's success.
    Data precision ranking takes into consideration the biased nature of the ranking,
the accuracy of the data submitted, and the reliability of the nature submitted to exam-
ine the risk scores. Data precision ranking is concerned with the following:
     * The level of understanding of the project risk
     * The available data and information about the identified risk
     * The quality of the data and information of the identified risk
     * The reliability of the data about the identified risk

           Assessing the Risk Score
           Once the qualitative risk assessment has been completed, you can step back, heave a
           sigh of relief, and then acknowledge that this process will need to be repeated through-
           out the project as new risks come into play. Risk assessment is an ongoing, iterative
           process that lasts throughout the project. Want some more sad news? The risk ratings in
           the qualitative risk matrix can change based on conditions in the project or as more
           information about the risks becomes available.
               One nice thing about the qualitative risk analysis process is the ability to categorize
           risks. Remember the RBS? The qualitative risk analysis process may give you an oppor-
           tunity to create new risk categories that you've identified or to reorganize the RBS. The
           goal of updating the RBS is to group risks by common categories to create better risk
           responses later on in the risk management processes.
               Finally, assessing the risk score gives the project manager an opportunity to address
           near-term risks. Imminent risks are usually considered of higher urgency than future
           risks. Consider the risk ranking, the time needed for the risk response, and the condi-
           tions that indicate the risk is coming to fruition.

           Updating the Risk Register
           At the beginning of the qualitative risk analysis process, the risk register was fairly sim-
           ple. The list of identified risks, some potential responses, and supporting detail for the
           risks are all that you'd likely find in that database. Now that more information has be-
           come available, the project manager and the project team can update the risk register
           accordingly.
               As qualitative risk analysis happens throughout the project, new risks will be identi-
           fied. The project manager should route the risks through the qualitative risk analysis
           process. The end results of qualitative risk analysis are all updated in the risk register:

                * Overall risk ranking of the project This allows the project manager,
                  management, customers, and other interested stakeholders to comprehend
                  the risk, the nature of the risks, and the condition between the risk score and
                  the likelihood of success for a project. The risk score can be compared to other
                  projects to determine project selection, the placement of talent in a project,
                  prioritization, the creation of a benefit-cost ratio, or even the cancellation of a
                  project because it is deemed too risky.
                * Risk categories Within the risk register, categories of risks should be created.
                  The idea is that not only will related risks be lumped together, but also there
                  may be some trend identification and root-cause analysis of identified risks.
                  As risks are categorized, it should be easier to create risk responses as well.
                * Near-term risks Qualitative analysis should also help the project team
                  identify which risks required immediate or near-term risk responses. However,
                  risks that are likely to happen later in the project can be acknowledged,
                  allowing imminent risks to be managed first.
                * Risks requiring additional analysis The risks categorized as high will likely
                  need additional analysis, such as quantitative analysis. Some risks may demand
                                                                           Chapter 11: Managing Project Risks

                                                                                                        327
        immediate risk management based on the nature of the risks and the status of
        the project.
     * Low-priority risk watchlist Let's face it: not all risks need additional analysis.
       However, these low-priority risks should be identified and assigned to a watchlist
       for periodic monitoring.
     * Trends in qualitative analysis As the project progresses and risk analysis is
       repeated, trends in the ranking and analysis of the risk may become apparent.




                                                                                                                PART II
       These trends can allow the project manager and other risk experts to respond
       to the root cause and predicted trends to either eliminate or respond to the
       risks within the project.


Preparing for Quantitative Risk Analysis
(PMBOK, Section 11.4)
Quantitative risk analysis attempts to numerically assess the probability and impact of
the identified risks. It also creates an overall risk score for the project. This method is
more in-depth than qualitative risk analysis and relies on several different tools to ac-
complish its goal.
     Qualitative risk analysis typically precedes quantitative risk analysis. All or a portion
of the identified risks in qualitative risk analysis can be examined in the quantitative
analysis. The performing organization may have policies on the risk scores in qualitative
analysis, which require the risks to advance to the quantitative analysis. The availability
of time and budget may also be a factor in determining which risks should pass through
quantitative analysis. Quantitative analysis is a more time-consuming process, and is,
therefore, also more expensive. The goals of quantitative risk analysis are to:

     * Quantify the cost and impact of the risk exposure
     * Ascertain the likelihood of reaching project success
     * Ascertain the likelihood of reaching a particular project objective
     * Determine the risk exposure for the project
     * Determine the likely amount of the contingency reserve needed for the project
     * Determine the risks with the largest impact on the project
     * Determine realistic time, cost, and scope targets

Interviewing Stakeholders and Experts
Interviews with stakeholders and subject matter experts can be one of the first tools to
quantify the identified risks. These interviews can focus on worst-case, best-case, and most-
likely scenarios if the goal of the quantitative analysis is to create a triangular distribution;
most quantitative analysis, however, uses continuous probability distributions. Figure 11-6
shows five sample distributions: normal, triangular, uniform, beta, and lognormal.
    Continuous probability distribution examines the probability of all possibili-
ties within a given range. For each variable, the probability of a risk event and the

      Normal                Lognormal                   Beta                  Triangular            Uniform

Figure 11-6 Risk distributions illustrate the likelihood and impact of an event within a project.

           corresponding consequence of the event may vary. In other words, depending on
           whether the risk event occurs and how it happens, a reaction to the event may also
           occur. The distribution of the probabilities and impact includes:
                 * Uniform
                 * Normal
                 * Triangular
                 * Beta
                 * Lognormal

                          EXAM TIP It's doubtful you'll be tested on these risk distributions for the
                          exam. The PMBOK mentions them only briefly, so you just need to be topically
                          aware of them. Don't invest hours memorizing the subject.

           Applying Sensitivity Analysis
           Sensitivity analysis examines each risk to determine which one has the largest impact
           on the project's success. All other risks in the project are set at a baseline value and then
           compared against all of the other risks individually. The individual risk is then exam-
           ined to see how it may affect the success of the project. The goal of sensitivity analysis
           is to determine which individual risks have the greatest impact on the project's success
           and then escalate the risk management processes based on these risk events. The tor-
           nado diagram is most likely to be used when completing sensitivity analysis.

           Finding the Expected Monetary Value
           The expected monetary value (EMV) of a project or event is based on the probability of
           outcomes that are uncertain. For example, one risk may cost the project an additional
           $10,000 if it occurs, but there's only a 20 percent chance of the event occurring. In its
           simplest form, the expected monetary value of this individual risk impact is, thus,
           $2,000. Project managers can also find the expected monetary value of a decision by
           creating a decision tree.
               Table 11-1 is an example of a simple risk matrix that determines the expected mon-
           etary value for some sample risks. Note that the sum of the EMV reveals what the con-
           tingency reserve for these risks should be.

           Using a Decision Tree
           A decision tree is a method used to determine which of two or more decisions is the
           best one. For example, it can be used to determine buy-versus-build scenarios, lease-or-
           purchase equations, or whether to use in-house resources rather than outsourcing proj-
                                                                                Chapter 11: Managing Project Risks

ect work. The decision tree model examines the cost and benefits of each decision's
outcome and weighs the probability of success for each of the decisions.
    The purpose of the decision tree is to make a decision, calculate the value of that
decision, or determine which decision costs the least. Follow Figure 11-7 through the
various steps of the decision tree process.

Completing a Decision Tree
As the project manager of the new GFB Project, you have to decide whether to create a
new Web application in-house or send the project out to a developer. The developer
you would use (if you were to outsource the work) quotes the project cost at $175,000.
Based on previous work with this company, you are 85 percent certain they will finish
the work on time.
    Your in-house development team quotes the cost of the work as $165,000. Again,
based on previous experience with your in-house developers, you feel 75 percent certain
they can complete the work on time. Now let's apply what we know to a decision tree:
     * Buy or build is simply the decision name.
     * The cost of the decision if you "buy" the work outside of your company
       is $175,000. If you build the software in-house, the cost is $165,000.
     * Based on your probability of completion by a given date, you apply the
       85-percent certainty to the "strong" finish for the buy branch of the tree.
       Because you're 85 percent certain, you're also 15 percent uncertain; this value
       is assigned to the "weak" value on the buy branch. You complete the same
       process for the build branch of the tree.

           Using a Project Simulation
           Project simulations allow the project team to play "what-if" games without affecting
           any areas of production. The Monte Carlo analysis (sometimes called the Monte Carlo
           technique) is the most common simulation. This technique got its name from Monte
           Carlo, Monaco (world-renowned for its slot machines, roulette wheels, and other games
           of pure chance). The Monte Carlo technique, typically completed using a computer
           software program, completely simulates a project, using values for all possible vari-
           ables, to predict the most likely model.

           Examining the Results of Quantitative Risk Analysis
           Quantitative risk analysis is completed throughout the project as risks are identified
           and passed through qualitative analysis, as project conditions change, or on a preset
           schedule. The end result of quantitative risk analysis should be reflected in the risk reg-
           ister and includes the following:
                * Probabilistic analysis The risks within the project allow the project manager
                  or other experts to predict the likelihood of the project's success. The project
                  may be altered by the response to certain risks; this response can increase cost
                  and push back the project's completion date.
                * Probability of costs and schedule objectives Based on the identified risks,
                  their impact, and the probability of occurrence, forecasts for the project
                  schedule and the project costs are created. The more negative the risks that
                  occur within a project, the greater the chance of delays and increased costs.
                * A prioritized list of risks This list of quantified risks demonstrates those
                  with the highest potential for endangering the project's success. This list
                  includes the risks that have the greatest opportunity to affect the project.
                  Each risk is identified with its probability and impact.
                * Trends As the project moves towards completion, quantitative risk analysis
                  may be repeated over and over. In each round of analysis, trends in the identified
                  risks may become visible. These trends can help the project team eliminate the
                  root cause of the risk, reduce their probability, or control their impact.

           Updating the Risk Register
           You guessed it. After completing a round of quantitative risk analysis, the risk register
           needs to be updated to reflect all the new information the project manager has learned
           about the project and its risks. Here's what gets updated in the risk register:
                * Probability of the project succeeding
                * Probability of achieving the project's cost and time objectives
                                                                     Chapter 11: Managing Project Risks

    The risk register and the risk information will be updated throughout the project.
This is a PMI-ism--the risk register is part of the project management plan and has to
be updated throughout the project.

Planning for Risk Responses (PMBOK, Section 11.5)
Risk response planning is all about options and actions. It focuses on how to decrease
the possibility of risks from adversely affecting the project's objectives and also on how
to increase the likelihood of positive risks that can aid the project. Risk response plan-
ning assigns responsibilities to people and groups close to the risk event. Risks will in-
crease or decrease based on the effectiveness of risk response planning.
    The responses to identified risks must be in balance with the risks themselves. The
cost and time invested in a risk must be met with the gains from reducing the risk's
impact and probability. In other words, a million-dollar solution for a hundred-dollar
problem is unacceptable. The individuals who are assigned to the risk must have the
authority to react to the project risk as planned. In most cases, several risk responses
may be viable for the risk--the best choice for the identified risk must be documented,
agreed upon, and then followed through should the risk come to fruition.

Preparing for Risk Responses
To successfully prepare for risk response, the project manager, project team, and appro-
priate stakeholders rely on several inputs--many of which stem from qualitative and
quantitative risk analyses. The risk management plan is needed during the risk response
planning, but the risk register is also needed to provide the following:
     * A list of prioritized risks
     * A risk ranking
     * A prioritized list of quantified risks
     * A probabilistic analysis of the project
     * The probability of the project meeting the cost and schedule goals
     * The list of potential responses decided upon when risks were first identified
     * Any risk owners who have been identified
     * A list of risks with common causal factors
     * Trends from qualitative and quantitative analyses

Creating Risk Responses
There are several tools and techniques that the project team can employ to respond to
risks. Each risk should be evaluated to determine which category of risk response is
most appropriate. When a category has been selected, the response must then be devel-
CAPM/PMP Project Management Certification All-in-One Exam Guide
332
           oped, refined, documented, and readied for use, if needed. In addition, secondary re-
           sponses may be selected for each risk. The purpose of risk response planning is to bring
           the overall risk of the project down to an acceptable level. In addition, risk response
           planning must address any risks that have unacceptably high scores.

           Avoiding Negative Risks
           Avoidance is simply avoiding the risk. This can be accomplished in many different ways,
           and generally happens early in the project, when any change will result in fewer conse-
           quences than later on in the project plan. Examples of avoidance include the following:
                * Changing the project plan to eliminate the risk
                * Clarifying project requirements to avoid discrepancies
                * Hiring additional project team members who have experience with the
                  technology that the project deals with
                * Using a proven methodology rather than a new approach

           Transferring Negative Risks
           Transference is the process of transferring the risk (and the ownership of the risk) to a
           third party. The risk doesn't disappear--it just becomes someone else's problem. Trans-
           ference of a risk usually costs a premium for the third party to own and manage. Com-
           mon examples of risk transference include:
                * Insurance
                * Performance bonds
                * Warrantees
                * Guarantees
                * Fixed-priced contracts

           Mitigating Negative Risks
           Mitigating risks is an effort to reduce the probability and/or impact of an identified risk
           in the project. Mitigation is done based on the logic before the risk happens. The cost
           and time to reduce or eliminate the risks is more cost effective than repairing the dam-
           age caused by the risk. The risk event may still happen, but hopefully the cost and im-
           pact of the risk will both be very low.
               Mitigation plans can be created so that they are implemented should an identified
           risk cross a given threshold. For example, a manufacturing project may have a mitiga-
           tion plan to reduce the number of units created per hour should the equipment's tem-
           perature cross a given threshold. The reduction is the number of units per hour that it
           may cost the project in time. In addition, the cost of extra labor to run the equipment
           longer because the machine is now operating at a slower pace may be attributed to the
           project. However, should the equipment fail, the project would have to replace the
           equipment and be delayed for weeks while awaiting repairs.
               Examples of mitigation include:
                * Adding activities to the project to reduce the risk probability or impact
                * Simplifying the processes within the project
                                                                        Chapter 11: Managing Project Risks

                                                                                                     333
     * Completing more tests on the project work before implementation
     * Developing prototypes, simulations, and limited releases

Managing the Positive Risk and Opportunities
While most risks have a negative connotation, not all risks are bad. There are instances
when a risk may create an opportunity that can help the project, other projects, or the
organization as a whole. The type of risk and the organization's willingness to accept




                                                                                                             PART II
the risks will dictate the appropriate response.

Exploiting Positive Risks or Opportunities
When an organization would like to take advantage of a positive risk that will likely
happen, it can exploit the risk. Positive risk exploitation can be realized by adding re-
sources to finish faster than was originally planned, increasing quality to recognize
sales and customer satisfaction, utilizing a better way of completing the project work,
or any other method that creates the positive outcomes of the identified risk.

Sharing Positive Risks
The idea of sharing a positive risk really means sharing a mutually beneficial opportu-
nity between two organizations or projects, or creating a risk-sharing partnership. When
a project team can share the positive risk, ownership of the risk is given to the organiza-
tion that can best capture its benefits.

Enhancing Positive Risks
This risk response seeks to modify the size of the identified opportunity. The goal is to
strengthen the cause of the opportunity to ensure that the risk event does happen. En-
hancing a project risk looks for solutions, triggers, or other drives to ensure that the risk
does come to fruition so that the rewards of the risk can be realized by the performing
organization.

Accepting the Risks
Risk acceptance is the process of simply accepting the risks because no other action is fea-
sible or because the risks are deemed to be of small probability, impact, or both and that
a formal response is not warranted. Passive acceptance requires no action; the project team
deals with the risks as they happen. Active acceptance entails developing a contingency
plan should the risk occur. Acceptance may be used for both positive and negative risks.
    A contingency plan is a predefined set of actions the project team will take should
certain events occur. Events that trigger the contingency plan should be tracked. A fall-
back plan is a reaction to a risk that has occurred when the primary response proves to
be inadequate.

Updating the Risk Register
Are you noticing a theme here? Every time new information about the project's risks is
learned, the risk register has to be updated. Since I'm dealing with risk responses in this
section, the updates to the risk register are:
     * Identified risks and how each one can threaten the project
CAPM/PMP Project Management Certification All-in-One Exam Guide
334
                * Risk owners and their responsibilities for the risk events
                * Risk response strategies and the responses to risk events
                * Symptoms and warning signs of risk
                * Budget and schedule impact of the risk response activities
                * Contingency reserves for time and costs
                * Contingency plans and triggers to implement the plan
                * Fallback plans
                * Residual risks (these are risks that are expected to remain after a risk response)
                * Secondary risks (these are new risks that are created as a result of a risk response)

           Creating Contracts for Risk Response
           When multiple entities are involved in a project, contractual agreements may be neces-
           sary to identify the responsible parties for identified risks. The contract may be needed
           for insurance purposes, customer acceptance, or the acknowledgement of responsibili-
           ties between the entities completing the project. Transference is an example of contrac-
           tual agreements for the responsibility of risks within a project.

           Justifying Risk Reduction
           To reduce risk, additional time or monies are typically needed. The process and logic
           behind the strategies to reduce the risk should be evaluated to determine if the solution
           is worth the tradeoffs. For example, a risk may be eliminated by adding $7,500 to a
           project's budget. However, the likelihood of the risk occurring is relatively low. Should
           the risk happen, it would cost, at a minimum, $8,000 to correct and the project would
           be delayed by at least two weeks.
               The cost of preventing the risk versus the cost of responding to it must be weighed
           and justified. If the risk is not eliminated with the $7,500 cost and the project moves
           forward as planned, it has, theoretically, saved $15,500 because the risk did not happen
           and the response to the risk did not need to happen.
               However, if the risk does happen, the project will lose at least $8,000 and be de-
           layed at least two weeks. The cost inherent in the project delay may be more expensive
           than the solution to the risk. The judgment of solving the risk to reduce the likelihood
           of delaying the project may be wiser than ignoring the risk and saving the cost by solv-
           ing the risk problem.

           Updating the Project Plan
           The risk reactions, contingency plans, and fallback plans should all be documented and
           incorporated into the project plan--for example, updating the schedule, budget, and
           WBS to accommodate additional time, money, and activities for risk responses. The
           responses to the risks may change the original implementation of the project and
           should be updated to reflect the project plan and intent of the project team, manage-
           ment, and other stakeholders. A failure to update the project plan and the risk register
           may cause risk reactions to be missed--and skew performance measurements.
                                                                      Chapter 11: Managing Project Risks

                                                                                                   335
Monitoring and Controlling Project Risks
(PMBOK, Section 11.6)
Risks must be actively monitored and new risks must be responded to as they are dis-
covered. Risk monitoring and control is the process of monitoring identified risks for
signs that they may be occurring, controlling identified risks with the agreed-upon re-
sponses, and looking for new risks that may creep into the project. Risk monitoring and




                                                                                                           PART II
control is also concerned with the documentation of the success or failure of risk re-
sponse plans and keeping records of metrics that signal risks are occurring or disappear-
ing from the project.
    Risk monitoring and control is an active process that requires participation from
the project manager, the project team, key stakeholders, and, in particular, risk owners
within the project. As the project progresses, risk conditions may change and require
new responses, additional planning, or the implementation of a contingency plan.
    There are several goals to risk monitoring and control:
     * Confirm that risk responses are implemented as planned
     * Determine if risk responses are effective or if new responses are needed
     * Determine the validity of the project assumptions
     * Determine if risk exposure has changed, evolved, or declined due to trends in
       the project progression
     * Monitor risk triggers
     * Confirm that policies and procedures happen as planned
     * Monitor the project for new risks

Preparing for Risk Monitoring and Control
A project manager's work is never done--at least, not until the project is closed. Risk
monitoring and controlling is an active process. There are several inputs the project
team and the project manager must rely on to effectively monitor and control risks:
     * The risk management plan The risk management plan defines the
       organization's approach to risk management. It is not the strategy for specific
       risks within a project, but the overall strategy for risk analysis and planning.
     * The risk register The risk register is the central repository for all project risk
       information. It includes the identified risks, the potential responses, the root
       causes of risks, and any identified categories of risk.
     * Scope changes Change requests should be analyzed for their impact on the
       project and for any risks in the proposed change that could affect the project
       objectives, as well as any new risks the increased scope presents.
     * Work performance information The results of project work can inform the
       project manager and the project team of new and pending risks. In addition,
       project team members may create reports to monitor or document risks.
       These reports are known as issue logs, action items, jeopardy warnings, and
       escalation notices.
CAPM/PMP Project Management Certification All-in-One Exam Guide
336
                * Performance reports The project performance focuses on the balance of the
                  project schedule, costs, and scope. Should any of these factors suffer, new risks
                  are likely to enter the project.

           Monitoring and Controlling Risks
           Risk monitoring and control happens throughout the project. These are not solitary
           activities that are completed once and never revisited. The project manager and the
           project team must actively monitor risks, respond with the agreed-upon actions, and
           scan the horizon for risks that have not been addressed. Risk monitoring and control is
           a recurring activity that requires input from all project participants.
               Project risk should be on the agenda at every project team meeting. The periodic
           risk review is a regularly scheduled discussion throughout the project to ascertain the
           level of foreseeable risks, the success of risk responses in the project to date, and a re-
           view of pending risks. Based on circumstances within the project, risk rankings and
           prioritization may fluctuate. Changes to the project scope, team, or conditions may
           require qualitative and quantitative analyses.

           Completing Risk Response Audits
           You don't just assume your risk responses work--you have to test them. A risk response
           audit examines the planned risk responses, how well the planned actions work, and the
           effectiveness of the risk owners in implementing the risk responses. The audits happen
           throughout the project to measure the effectiveness of mitigating, transferring, and
           avoiding risks. The risk response audit should measure the effectiveness of the decision
           and its impact on time and cost. Of course, you'll update the risk register once the audit
           has been completed.

           Analyzing Project Variances
           A variance is the difference between what was planned and what was experienced. No
           one likes to hear that variances are in the project, but ignoring variances can only lead
           to more risks, more troubles, and more headaches. Cost variances can eat into the proj-
           ect budget, which in turn creates new risks, such as running out of cash, having to
           choose a lower grade of materials, or even removing deliverables from the scope. Cost
           variances can also force the project manager to have to ask for more funds, which is not
           a pleasant experience.
               Schedule variances are just as deadly. Delays in the project work, vendor deliveries,
           and time estimates that were too optimistic can eat into the management reserve and
           consume the project's float. These risks can create new risks. Consider the risks inherent
           to the schedule variance responses:

                * Crashing the project
                * Fast-tracking the project
                * Overworking the project team
                * Rushing the project work
                * Rushing through quality control and quality audits to regain time
                                                                      Chapter 11: Managing Project Risks

                                                                                                   337
    Remember earned value analysis? Earned value analysis measures project perfor-
mance. When project performance is waning, the project is likely missing targeted costs
and schedule goals. The results of earned value analysis can signal that risks are hap-
pening within the project or that new risks may be developing.
    For example, a schedule performance index (SPI) of .93 means the project is off
schedule by 7 percent. A risk based on this value could mean that the project team is
having difficulty completing the project work as planned. Additional work will con-




                                                                                                           PART II
tinue to be late, the project will finish late, and quality may suffer as the team attempts
to rush to complete assigned tasks.

Measuring Technical Performance
Throughout the project, the project team's technical competence with the technology
being used in the project should increase. The level of technical achievement should be
in proportion to the expected level of technical performance within the project. If the
project team is not performing at a level of expected technical expertise, the project may
suffer additional risks due to the discrepancy. Technical performance can be measured
by the successful completion of activities throughout the project or project phases.

Examining the Results of Risk Monitoring and Control
Risk monitoring and control helps the project become more successful. Risk monitor-
ing and control measures the planned responses to risks and creates reactions to un-
planned risks. The outputs of risk monitoring and control also aim to help the project
reach its objectives. Consider these outputs:
     * Risk register updates As the project moves along and the project manager
       and the project team complete the risk assessments, audits, and risk reviews,
       they'll need to record their findings in the risk register. This update may include
       the reevaluation of the risk's impact, probability, and expected monetary value.
       For those risks that have passed in the project, the risk register should record
       what actually happened with the risk event and its impact on the project.
     * Change requests Your favorite, I'm sure. As workarounds and contingency
       plans are used, they require changes to the project plan. Changes that occur
       as a result of the risks are completed through integrated change control. The
       changes are documented, approved, and incorporated into the project plan.
     * Recommended corrective actions As risks come to fruition, corrective
       actions are needed to bypass them. The two types of corrective action are
       workarounds and contingency plans. Corrective actions are actions taken
       to bring the project back into compliance with the project plan.
     * Recommended preventive actions Preventive actions are steps taken to
       bring the project back into alignment with the project management plan.
     * Risk response plan updates As risks occur, the responses to them should
       be documented and updated in the risk response plan. Should risk rankings
       change during the project, the change in ranking, the logic behind the change,
       and the results of the risk rank change should be documented in the risk
       response plan. For the risks that do not occur, the risks should be documented
       and considered closed in the risk response plan.
CAPM/PMP Project Management Certification All-in-One Exam Guide
338
                * Organizational process asset updates The risks from the current project
                  can help other project managers in the future. Therefore, the project manager
                  must work to ensure that the current risks, their anticipated impact, and their
                  actual impact are recorded. The current risk matrix, for example, can become
                  a risk template for other projects in the future. This is true for just about any
                  risk document--from risk responses to the risk breakdown structure, lessons
                  learned, and checklists.
                * Project management plan updates Some change requests and risk
                  responses may require updates to the project management plan.


           Chapter Summary
           All projects have some level of risks--just how much the project's stakeholders are will-
           ing to accept varies by project and organization. The quantification of the stakeholders'
           tolerance for risk is called the utility function: the higher the project's importance, the
           lower the utility function. Low-priority projects are generally more likely to accept risks
           than those projects that have a big impact on your organization.
                Recall that at the launch of the risk planning process, there's the creation of the risk
           management plan. This plan addresses how the project's risk management approach
           will be directed. This plan is not specific to the risks within the project, but creates the
           boundaries, expectations, and general rules for the risk management process. Once this
           plan is in place and everyone is in agreement to abide by it, the project-specific risk
           management activities can commence.
                The first stop is all about risk identification. This isn't a private meeting--the proj-
           ect team, the project manager, the project sponsor, vendors, stakeholders, end users,
           even customers can participate if it's necessary. Any project-relevant risks are accepted.
           It's good to have a variety of participants, as their point of view can help identify risks
           that may have been overlooked otherwise.
                As risks are identified, the project manager can use the Delphi Technique to build a
           consensus on which risks have the highest impact on the project. This anonymous ap-
           proach allows participants to speak freely about the risks, unhindered by the opinions
           of other stakeholders. The comments on the identified risks are distributed to all of the
           participants, allowing participants to comment, concur, or dismiss opinions on the
           identified risks. Through rounds of discussion, a consensus on the risks is reached.
                Then it's off to quantitative analysis, where the risks' probability and impact are
           quantified. Specifically, the risk exposure for the project is tied to a dollar amount. The
           risk exposure is offset by a contingency reserve. Should risk events happen, monies from
           the contingency reserve are used to counteract the risk events. Ongoing monitoring and
           controlling of the risk events and their impact is essential to effective risk management.
                Involved with all of these processes is the risk register. It's the project's journal and
           database of risks, their status, their impact, and any supporting detail about the risk
           events. As more information is gathered about the risks, the project management team
           updates the risk register. As the project moves past risk events, their status and out-
           comes are updated in the risk register. The risk register is part of the project manage-
           ment plan and becomes, once the project closes, part of organizational process assets
           for future projects.

Key Terms
Acceptance A risk response appropriate for both positive and negative risks, but often
used for smaller risks within a project.
Avoidance A risk response to avoid the risk; sometimes called a workaround.
Brainstorming The most common approach to risk identification; usually completed
as a project team with subject matter experts to identify the risks within the project.




                                                                                                           PART II
Business risks These risks may have negative or positive outcomes. Examples include
using a less experienced worker to complete a task, allowing phases or activities to over-
lap, or foregoing the expense of formal training for on-the-job education.
Cardinal scales A ranking approach to identify the probability and impact on a nu-
merical value, from .01 (very low) to 1.0 (certain).
Checklists A quick and cost-effective risk identification approach.
Data precision The consideration of the risk ranking scores that takes into account any
bias, the accuracy of the data submitted, and the reliability of the nature submitted.
Decision tree A method to determine which of two or more decisions is the best one.
The model examines the cost and benefits of each decision's outcome and weighs the
probability of success for each of the decisions.
Delphi Technique An anonymous method of querying experts about foreseeable
risks within a project, phase, or component of a project. The results of the survey are
analyzed by a third party, organized, and then circulated to the experts. There can be
several rounds of anonymous discussion with the Delphi Technique, without fear of
backlash or offending other participants in the process. The goal is to gain consensus
on project risks within the project.
Enhancing A risk response that attempts to enhance the conditions to ensure that a
positive risk event will likely happen.
Expected monetary value (EMV) The monetary value of a risk exposure based on the
risk's probability and impact in the risk matrix. This approach is typically used in quan-
titative risk analysis, as it quantifies the risk exposure.
Exploit A risk response that takes advantage of the positive risks within a project.
External risks These risks are outside of the project, but directly affect it--for exam-
ple, legal issues, labor issues, a shift in project priorities, or weather. "Force majeure"
risks call for disaster recovery rather than project management. These are risks caused
by earthquakes, tornados, floods, civil unrest, and other disasters.
Flow charts System or process flow charts show the relationship between compo-
nents and how the overall process works. These are useful for identifying risks between
system components.
Influence diagrams An influence diagram charts out a decision problem. It identifies
all of the elements, variables, decisions, and objectives and also how each factor may
influence another.

           Ishikawa diagrams These cause-and-effect diagrams are also called fishbone diagrams
           and are used to find the root cause of factors that are causing risks within the project.
           Low-priority risk watchlist Low-priority risks are identified and assigned to a watch-
           list for periodic monitoring.
           Mitigation A risk response effort to reduce the probability and/or impact of an identi-
           fied risk in the project.
           Monte Carlo technique A simulation technique that got its name from the casinos of
           Monte Carlo, Monaco. The simulation is completed using a computer software pro-
           gram that can simulate a project, using values for all possible variables, to predict the
           most likely model.
           Ordinal scales A ranking approach that identifies and ranks the risks from very high
           to very unlikely or to some other ordinary value.
           Organizational risks The performing organization can contribute to the project's
           risks through unreasonable cost, time, and scope expectations; poor project prioritiza-
           tion; inadequate funding or the disruption of funding; and competition with other
           projects for internal resources.
           Probability and impact matrix A matrix that ranks the probability of a risk event oc-
           curring and its impact on the project if the event does happen; used in qualitative and
           quantitative risk analyses.
           Project management risks These risks deal with faults in the management of the
           project: the unsuccessful allocation of time, resources, and scheduling; unacceptable
           work results; and poor project management.
           Pure risks These risks have only a negative outcome. Examples include loss of life or
           limb, fire, theft, natural disasters, and the like.
           Qualitative risk analysis This approach "qualifies" the risks that have been identified
           in the project. Specifically, qualitative risk analysis examines and prioritizes risks based
           on their probability of occurring and their impact on the project should they occur.
           Quantitative risk analysis This approach attempts to numerically assess the proba-
           bility and impact of the identified risks. It also creates an overall risk score for the proj-
           ect. This method is more in-depth than qualitative risk analysis and relies on several
           different tools to accomplish its goal.
           RAG rating An ordinal scale that uses red, amber, and green to capture the probabil-
           ity, impact, and risk score. The first letter of red, amber, and green equate to "RAG" in
           the system.
           Residual risks These are risks that are expected to remain after a risk response.
           Risk A project risk is an uncertain event or condition that can have a positive or nega-
           tive impact on the project.
           Risk identification The systematic process of combing through the project, the proj-
           ect plan, the work breakdown structure, and all supporting documentation to identify
           as many risks that may affect the project as possible.
                                                                      Chapter 11: Managing Project Risks

Risk management plan A project management subsidiary plan that defines how risks
will be identified, analyzed, responded to, and monitored within the project. The plan also
defines the iterative risk management process that the project is expected to adhere to.
Risk management planning The agreed-upon approach to the management of the
project risk processes.
Risk owners The individuals or entities that are responsible for monitoring and re-




                                                                                                           PART II
sponding to an identified risk within the project.
Risk register The risk register is a project plan component that contains all of the in-
formation related to the risk management activities. It's updated as risk management
activities are conducted to reflect the status, progress, and nature of the project risks.
Risk response audit An audit to test the validity of the established risk responses.
Risk responsibilities    The level of ownership an individual or entity has over a proj-
ect risk.
Risk score The calculated score based on each risk's probability and impact. The ap-
proach can be used in both qualitative and quantitative risk matrixes.
Root cause identification Root cause identification aims to find out why a risk event
may be occurring, the causal factors for the risk events, and then, eventually, how the
events can be mitigated or eliminated.
Secondary risks New risks that are created as a result of a risk response.
Sensitivity analysis A quantitative risk analysis tool that examines each risk to deter-
mine which one has the largest impact on the project's success.
Sharing A risk response that shares the advantages of a positive risk within a project.
SWOT analysis SWOT analysis is the process of examining the project from the per-
spective of each characteristic: strengths, weaknesses, opportunities, and threats.
Technical, quality, or performance risks Technical risks are associated with new, un-
proven, or complex technologies being used on the project. Changes to the technology
during the project implementation can also be a risk. Quality risks are the levels set for
expectations of impractical quality and performance.
Transference A risk response that transfers the ownership of the risk to another party.
Insurance, licensed contractors, or other project teams are good examples of transference.
A fee and contractual relationships are typically involved with the transference of a risk.

                   project manager notifies you that additional risk planning will need to be
                   added to the project schedule. Why?
                    A. The risk planning should always be the same amount of time as the
                       activities required by the scope change.
                    B. Risk planning should always occur whenever the scope is adjusted.
                    C. Risk planning should only occur at the project manager's discretion.
                    D. The project manager is incorrect. Risk planning does not need to happen
                       at every change in the project.
                6. Which one of the following best describes the risk register?

           Answers
                1. D. Risks that are in balance with the reward are appropriate for acceptance. A,
                   B, and C are all incorrect because these solutions are all false responses to risk
                   management. For more information, see the introduction to Chapter 11 in the
                   PMBOK.
                2. C. Planning meetings are used to create the risk management plan. The project
                   manager, project team leaders, key stakeholders, and other individuals with
                   the power to make decisions regarding risk management attend the meetings.
                   Choices A, B, and D are incorrect, since these choices do not fully answer the
                   question.
                3. A. An error value of 7 percent represents the threshold the project is
                   allowed to operate under. Should the number of errors increase beyond 7
                   percent, the current plastic will be substituted. B is incorrect, since tracking
                   is the documentation of a process through a system or workflow or the
                   documentation of events through the process. C, budgeting, is also incorrect.
                   D, JIT manufacturing, is a scheduling approach to ordering the materials
                   only when they are needed in order to keep inventory costs down. For more
                   information, see the PMBOK, Section 11.5.2.1.
                4. A. The utility function describes a person's willingness to tolerate risk. B is
                   incorrect. Herzberg's theory of motivation is a human resources theory that
                   describes motivating agents for workers. C is also incorrect. Risk acceptance
                   describes the action of allowing a risk to exist because it is deemed low in
                   impact, low in probability, or both. D, the risk-reward ratio, is incorrect. This
                   describes the potential reward for taking on a risk in the project.
                5. B. When the scope has been changed, the project manager should require risk
                   planning to analyze the additions for risks to the project's success. A is incorrect.
                   The scope changes may not require the same amount of time as the activities
                   needed to complete the project changes. C is incorrect because risk planning
                   should not occur at the project manager's discretion. Instead, it should be based
                   on evidence within the project and the policies adopted in the risk management
                   plan. D is also incorrect. When changes are added to the project scope, risk
                   planning should occur. For more information, see the PMBOK, Section 11.6.1.3.
                6. A. The risk register documents all of the outcomes of the other risk management
                   processes. B, C, and D are all incorrect definitions of the risk register. For more
                   information, see the PMBOK, Section 11.2.3.1.
                                                                    Chapter 11: Managing Project Risks

                                                                                                 347
 7. B. Pure risks are the risks that could threaten the safety of the individuals on
    the project. A is incorrect because business risks affect the financial gains or
    loss of a project. C and D are incorrect, since these terms are not relevant.
 8. C. Risks are not planned; they are left to chance. The accommodation and the
    reaction to a risk can be planned, but the event itself is not planned. If risks
    could be planned, Las Vegas would be out of business. A, B, and D are all
    incorrect, since these terms do not accurately complete the sentence. For




                                                                                                         PART II
    more information, see the introduction to Chapter 11 in the PMBOK.
 9. D. Risk identification is an iterative process that happens throughout the
    project's life cycle. A and B are both incorrect because risk identification is
    not limited to any one process group. C is incorrect because risk identification
    happens, technically, throughout the project management life cycle, which is
    unique to each project, and not through the product management life cycle.
    For more information, see the PMBOK, Section 11.2.
10. C. Risk identification happens throughout the project. Recall that planning is
    iterative: As the project moves towards completion, new risks may surface that
    call for identification and planned responses. A is incorrect. Risk identification
    should happen throughout the project, not just at the beginning. B is incorrect
    because risk identification is part of planning. D is incorrect because the nature
    of the project phase may require and reveal more than one opportunity for risk
    identification. For more information, see the PMBOK, Section 11.2.
11. C. The Delphi Technique, an anonymous risk identification method, is the
    correct answer. A is incorrect. Decision tree analysis is appropriate for calculating
    the expected monetary value of a decision, but not risk identification. B is
    incorrect because the decomposition of the project scope will result in the
    WBS. D is incorrect. Creating a Pareto chart is part of quality control, not risk
    identification. For more information, see the PMBOK, Section 11.2.2.2.
12. D. An anonymous poll that allows experts to freely submit their opinion
    without fear of backlash is an example of the Delphi Technique. A, B, and C
    are incorrect. These choices do not accurately answer the question. For more
    information, see the PMBOK, Section 11.2.2.2.
13. B. The risk ranking is based on the very high, high, medium, low, and very
    low attributes of the identified risks. A is incorrect because it is not relevant
    to the question. This answer is quantifiable, not quantitative. C is incorrect.
    Utility function describes an organization's tolerance for risk. D, SWOT
    analysis, is part of risk identification. For more information, see the PMBOK,
    Sections 11.3.2.1 and 11.3.2.2.
14. B. A table of risks, their probability, and impact equate to a risk score in a risk
    matrix. A is incorrect, since it does not fully answer the question. C and D are
    incorrect because a risk matrix can be used in both quantitative and qualitative
    risk analyses. For more information, see the PMBOK, Section 11.3.2.2.
15. D. Risk Event 3 has a probability of 45 percent and an impact cost of -$300,
    which equates to -$135. A, B, and C are incorrect because their values are

                   wrong answers for the formula. For more information, see the PMBOK,
                   Section 11.1.3.1.
               16. C. The calculated amount for each of the risk events is shown in the following
                   table:

                     Risk Event          Probability          Impact Cost/Benefit        Ex$V
                     1                        0.35                   - 4,000             -1,400
                     2                        0.4                    50,000              20,000
                     3                        0.45                 -300,000            -135,000
                     4                        0.3                    50,000              15,000
                     5                        0.35                  - 45,000            -15,750
                                                                                       -117,150

                   A, B, and D are incorrect answers because they do not reflect the contingency
                   amount needed for the project based on the preceding table. For more
                   information, see the PMBOK, Section 11.1.3.1.
               17. D. Because the risk is not eliminated but transferred to someone else or
                   another entity, it is considered transference. A is incorrect because the risk
                   still exists--it is just being handled by another entity. B is incorrect because
                   the project manager has not accepted the risk, deciding instead to allow
                   another entity to deal with it. C is incorrect. The risk has not been mitigated
                   in the project. For more information, see the PMBOK, Section 11.5.2.1.
               18. B. The 80 percent mark is a threshold. A is incorrect. An upper control
                   limit is a boundary for quality in a control chart. C is incorrect. Mitigation
                   is a planned response should a risk event happen. D is also incorrect. A
                   workaround is an action to bypass the risk event. For more information,
                   see the glossary in the PMBOK and also Section 11.5.
               19. C. Marty is 60 percent certain that he can save the project $7,000. The $4,200
                   represents the 60 percent certainty of the savings. A, B, and D are all incorrect,
                   since these values do not reflect the potential savings of the project. For more
                   information, see the PMBOK, Section 11.1.3.1.
               20. B. The Monte Carlo technique can reveal multiple scenarios and examine the
                   risks and probability of impact. A, a decision tree, helps guide the decision-
                   making process. C, a Pareto chart, helps identify the leading problems in a
                   situation. D, a Gantt chart, compares the lengths of activities against a calendar
                   in a bar chart format. For more information, see the PMBOK, Section 11.4.
    Introducing Project
    Procurement Management
                                                                                CHAPTER


                                                                                                12
    In this chapter, you will
       * Plan for project procurement
       * Select the project vendors
       * Create contracts for the project work
       * Control and administer the contractual relationships
       * Close out the contract with the project vendors




 Projects routinely require procurements. Projects need materials, equipment, consul-
 tants, training, books, software, hardware, and lots of other stuff in order for the project
 to be successful. Project procurement management is the process of purchasing the
 products necessary to meet the needs of the project scope.
     Procurement management also involves planning, requesting seller information,
 choosing a source, administering the contract, and closing out the contract. Procure-
 ment management, as far as your Certified Associate in Project Management (CAPM)
 and Project Management Professional (PMP) exams are considered, focuses on the
 practices from the buyer's point of view, not the seller's. Usually. Sometimes, you may
 be presented as the vendor that is completing a project for your customer, the buyer.
 You should also recognize that the seller can be seen as a contractor, subcontractor,
 vendor, or supplier. In whatever condition you're put into on your exam, always do
 what's "fair" for both parties and what's in the best interest of the project scope.
     When buying anything from a vendor, the buyer needs a contract. A contract be-
 comes a key input to many of the processes within the project. The contract, above
 anything else, specifies the rules and agreements for the project.
     Here's a neat twist: When the seller is completing his or her obligations to supply a
 product, Project Management Institute (PMI) treats those obligations as a project. In
 other words, if ABC Electricians were wiring a building for your company, ABC Electri-
 cians would be the performing organization completing its own project. Your company
 becomes the customer of their project--and is, of course, a stakeholder in their project.

               In the scenarios described in this chapter, the seller will be outside of the performing
           organization. The buyer will be managing a project and procuring resources from a ven-
           dor. However, all of the details in this chapter can be applied to internal work orders,
           formal agreements, and contracts between organizational units within a single entity.


           Planning for Procurement (PMBOK, Section 12.1)
           Procurement planning is the process of identifying which part of the project should be
           procured from resources outside of the organization. Generally, procurement decisions are
           made early on in the planning processes. Procurement planning centers on four elements:
                * Whether procurement is needed                   * How much to procure
                * What to procure                                 * When to procure
               The project schedule is also taken into consideration when procurement decisions
           are made. Consider the lead time from when the purchase decision is made to when
           the purchase actually happens. And then consider the time from when the purchase
           happens to the time when the vendor actually delivers the goods or services. In light of
           the schedule, it's often more practical to just hire an expert to complete the work than
           to do the work in-house because of limited resources, the expertise of the internal re-
           sources, and the promised (or demanded) project completion date.
               There are six inputs to the plan purchases and acquisitions processes--nothing new
           or alarming here:
                * Enterprise environmental factors These are the conditions of the marketplace;
                  the available products, services, and results; the availability of the things you'd
                  like to purchase; and the terms and conditions of the purchase agreement. If
                  your organization doesn't have a formal purchasing department, the project
                  team has to step up and complete the project procurement activities.
                * Organizational process assets When it comes to purchases, you likely have
                  rules and procedures unique to your organization on how you can buy anything
                  for your project. The internal rules in your organization police how the project
                  manager may purchase, negotiate, agree to contractual obligations, and pay the
                  vendor. (If you don't have these rules and policies in your organization, allow
                  me to offer my services directly to you. Sign on the dotted line.)
                * Project scope statement The project's scope statement serves as an input to
                  making procurement decisions. Because the project scope statement defines the
                  project work, and only the required work, to complete the project, it also defines
                  the limitations of the project. Knowing the limits of what the project includes
                  can help the project manager, the contract specialists, or other procurement
                  professional determine what needs to be purchased and what does not.
                * Work breakdown structure (WBS) Here's your buddy, the WBS, again. The
                  WBS is needed during procurement decisions because it exposes all of the
                  project deliverables and what needs to be purchased in order to create all of
                  the promised deliverables.
                * WBS dictionary If you're going to use the WBS, you might as well rely on
                  the WBS dictionary, too. The WBS dictionary provides the full description of
                                                  Chapter 12: Introducing Project Procurement Management

                                                                                                   351
       the WBS deliverables. This can, of course, help the project manager and the
       project team determine exactly what needs to be procured and what does not.
     * Project management plan The project management plan has lots of
       information for the project management team to consider when making
       purchase decisions. The subsidiary plans, scope management plan, the
       procurement management plan, quality management plan, and even the
       contract management plan can all help guide purchase decisions and




                                                                                                           PART II
       requirements for vendors. Other project plan components that are likely
       referenced during the procurement planning process include the following:
       * Risk register In Chapter 11, we discussed the risk register: the centralized
          database of all project risks and their impact. The risk exposure, risk
          owners, and risk responses may all need to be considered for possible
          procurement decisions.
       * Risk-related contractual agreements Remember the risk response
          transference? It's where a risk is transferred to another party, usually for
          a fee. Transference often results in a contractual agreement between your
          organization and the vendor. Consider the risk of hiring an electrician to
          manage the electrical work within a project. The electrician owns the risk,
          and you'd have to pay him a fee for the services he'd provide.
       * Activity resource requirements Resources are people and things. A project
          manager may need to hire a consultant, a contractor, or a new employee to
          complete the project work. Resource requirements may also include tools,
          equipment, and materials. All of this costs--cha-ching!--money.
       * Project schedule The project schedule is considered for cash flow
          forecasting, the consideration of purchase decisions, and the timing for
          procurement processes.
       * Activity cost estimates Remember these from Chapter 7? You'll need your
          cost estimates to complete cost budgeting and to track your expenses for
          activities.
       * Cost baseline The cost baseline demonstrates the expected cost of the
          project and then the actual costs of the project. The difference between
          what was planned and what was expected is a variance.

Using the Procurement Planning Tools
Procurement planning should be done early in the planning processes, with certain
exceptions. As needs arise, as project conditions change, or as other circumstances de-
mand, procurement planning may be required throughout the project. Whenever pro-
curement planning happens early in the project, as preferred, or later in the project, as
needed, a logical approach to securing the proper resources is necessitated.

Determining to Make or Buy
The decision to make or buy a product is a fundamental aspect of project management.
In some conditions, it is more cost-effective to buy; in others, it makes more sense to
create an in-house solution. The make-or-buy analysis should be made in the initial
CAPM/PMP Project Management Certification All-in-One Exam Guide
352
           scope definition to determine if the entire project should be completed in-house or
           procured. As the project evolves, additional make-or-buy decisions are often needed.
                The initial costs of the solution for the in-house or procured product must be con-
           sidered, but so, too, must the ongoing expenses of the solutions. For example, a com-
           pany may elect to lease a piece of equipment. The ongoing expense of leasing the piece
           of equipment should be weighed against the expected ongoing expense of purchasing
           the equipment and the monthly costs to maintain, insure, and manage the equipment.
                For example, Figure 12-1 shows the mathematical approach to determining whether
           it is better to create a software program in-house or buy one from a software company.
           The in-house solution will cost your company $25,000 to create your own software pack-
           age and, based on historical information, another $2,500 per month to maintain it.
                The development company has a solution that will cost your company $17,000 to
           purchase, but the development company requires a maintenance plan for each software
           program installed, which will cost your company $2,700 per month. The difference
           between making the software and buying it is $8,000. The difference between support-
           ing the software the organization has made and allowing the external company to sup-
           port their software is only $200 per month.
                The $200 per month is divided into the difference between creating the software
           internally and buying it--which is $8,000 divided by $200, or 40 months. If the soft-
           ware is to be replaced within 40 months, the company should buy the software. If the
           software will not be replaced within 40 months, it should build the software.
                There are multiple reasons why an organization may choose to make or buy. Table 12-1
           provides some common reasons for making and buying.

                         EXAM TIP You may be presented with one or two questions on make-
                         versus-buy analysis. In the preceding example, and on the exam, you won't be
                         confronted with the tax benefits of make-versus-buy--although in your job as
                         a project manager, you may be. For the exam, focus on determining which is
                         the most cost-effective, fair solution.

Using Expert Judgment
Procurement planning can rely on expert judgment. It may be beneficial to rely on the
wisdom of others--whether those in the performing organization or subject matter
experts--to determine the need for procurement. Expert judgment for procurement
management planning can come from the following:
     * Units or individuals within the performing organization
     * Consultants and subject matter experts
     * Professional, trade, or technical associations
     * Industry groups

Determining the Contract Type
There are multiple types of contracts when it comes to procurement. The project work, the
market, and the nature of the purchase determine the contract type. Here are some general
rules that CAPM and PMP exam candidates, and project managers, should know:
     * A contract is a formal agreement between the buyer and the seller. Contracts
       can be oral or written--although written is preferred.
     * The United States backs all contracts through the court system.
     * Contracts should clearly state all requirements for product acceptance.
     * Any changes to the contract must be formally approved, controlled, and
       documented.
     * A contract is not fulfilled until all of its requirements are met.
     * Contracts can be used as a risk mitigation tool, as in transferring the risk. All
       contracts have some level of risk; depending on the contract type, the risk
       can be transferred to the seller. If a risk response strategy is to transfer, risks
       associated with procurement are considered secondary risks and must go
       through the risk management process.
     * There are legal requirements governing contracts. In order for a contract to be
       valid, it must:
        * Contain an offer
CAPM/PMP Project Management Certification All-in-One Exam Guide
354
                   * Have been accepted
                   * Provide for a consideration (payment)
                   * Be for a legal purpose
                   * Be executed by someone with capacity and authority
                * The terms and conditions of the contract should define breaches, copyrights,
                  intellectual rights, and force majeure.

                         EXAM TIP Force majeure is a powerful and unexpected event, such as a
                         hurricane or other natural disaster.


           Fixed-Price Contracts
           These contracts must clearly define the requirements the vendor is to provide. These
           contracts may also provide incentives for meeting or exceeding contract requirements--
           such as meeting deadlines--and require the seller to assume the risk of cost overruns,
           as Figure 12-2 demonstrates.

           Cost-Reimbursable Contracts
           These contract types pay the seller for the product. In the payment to the seller, there is
           a profit margin--the difference between the actual costs of the product and the sales
           amount. The actual costs of the product fall into two categories:
                * Direct costs Costs incurred by the project in order for the project to exist.
                  Examples include equipment needed to complete the project work, salaries
                  of the project team, and other expenses tied directly to the project's existence.
                * Indirect costs Costs attributed to the cost of doing business. Examples
                  include utilities, office space, and other overhead costs.
              Cost-reimbursable contracts require the buyer to assume the risk of cost overruns.
           There are three types of cost-reimbursable contracts:
                * Cost plus fixed fee

           Figure 12-2

           transfer risk to the
           seller.

                                                                                                       355
     * Cost plus percentage of costs
     * Cost plus incentive fee

              NOTE Cost plus percentage of costs is not used often--and isn't allowed in
              many organizations. Don't plan on seeing this contract type on your exam.




                                                                                                               PART II
Time and Materials Contracts
Time and materials (T&M) contracts are sometimes called unit price contracts. They are
ideal for instances when an organization contracts out a small project or for instances
when smaller amounts of work within a larger project are to be completed by a vendor.
T&M contracts, however, can grow dangerously out of control as more work is assigned
to the seller. While time and materials is an easy-to-create and administer-contract type,
they can pose a threat to the buyer if a "not-to-exceed" clause is not included in the
contract. A not-to-exceed clause states the maximum amount of monies the vendor can
bill for the contracted work. Figure 12-3 is an example of how T&M contracts can pose
a risk for the buyer.

Understanding Contract Types
On the CAPM and PMP examinations, you can anticipate a few questions on contract
types. Familiarize yourself with Table 2-2.

              EXAM TIP The contractual relationship between the buyer and the seller is
              often considered confidential and secret. This relationship is known as privity.

Examining the Results of Procurement Planning
Procurement planning is a process that should happen early in the planning processes.
The outputs of procurement planning allow the project manager and the project team
to proceed with confidence in the procuring of products and services needed to success-
fully complete the project. If it is determined early in the project that there no need for
procurements, then, obviously, the balance of the procurement processes is not neces-
sary for the project.

           Procurement Management Plan
           This subsidiary project plan documents the decisions made in the procurement plan-
           ning processes and specifies how the remaining procurement activities will be man-
           aged. The plan details the following:

                * How vendors will be selected
                * The type of contracts to be used
                * The process of independent estimating
                * The relationship between the project team and the procurement office within
                  the performing organization (if one exists)
                * The procurement forms, such as contracts, the project team is required to use
                * How multiple vendors will be managed to supply their contracted product
                * The coordination between sellers and the project team and among project
                  activities, project reporting, scheduling, business operations, and other project
                  concerns

Using the Contract Statement of Work
In the contract statement of work (often just called the SOW), the seller fully describes
the work to be completed and/or the product to be supplied. The SOW becomes part of
the contract between the buyer and the seller. It is typically created as part of the pro-
curement planning process, and it allows the seller to determine if he or she can meet
the written requirements of the SOW.
    Particular industries have different assumptions about what constitutes an SOW.




                                                                                                            PART II
What one industry calls a SOW may be a statement of objectives (SOO) in another. An
SOO is a document describing a problem to be solved by the seller.

             EXAM TIP The SOW can be updated as the project moves through
             negotiations with the vendor or as more details about the purchase
             become available.

Miscellaneous Procurement Planning Business
You may have noticed that the Project Management Body of Knowledge (PMBOK) has
a habit of little odds and ends that come out of the many planning processes. Procure-
ment planning is no different. You know that one of the procurement planning tools is
the make-or-buy decision process. The results of those decisions are documented, in-
cluding the supporting detail of why the decision to make or buy was determined.
    Another output of procurement planning is--surprise, surprise--change requests. Dur-
ing the procurement planning process, the vendor may offer some great ideas that cause
change requests. Or the vendor's price is more than what was expected, so change requests
are implemented. The point here is that through the procurement planning process, you,
the project manager, may have changes that need to be entertained, and if approved, the
integration management processes have to be enacted. Sounds like a fun time.


Planning for Contracting
(PMBOK, Section 12.2)
Now that the project manager has made a decision on what needs to be procured, it's
time to plan for the actual contracting. Plan contracting, as the PMBOK puts it, is the
process of soliciting the vendors to respond to the requests to purchase goods or ser-
vices. Yes, I said, "solicit." Gasp! You won't find the word solicit in the third edition of
the PMBOK because that word could have a naughty meaning. Come on, we're all
adults. We're just talking about buying goods and services--just not that service.
    In order to plan for contracting, the project management team needs four things:

     * Procurement management plan This subsidiary plan sets out the
       methodologies and expectations of procurement within the performing
       organization.
     * Contract statement of work This document provides detailed information
       on what the seller will be providing for the performing organization. Recall
       that this document allows the seller to determine if he or she can provide the
       product and meet the requirements of the project team.
CAPM/PMP Project Management Certification All-in-One Exam Guide
358
                * Make-or-buy decision The make-or-buy decision tells the project manager
                  what the conditions have to be to make or buy from a vendor.
                * Project management plan Throughout the project management plan,
                  there are planning outputs that affect the plan-contracting process. Consider
                  the schedule, resource requirements, quality issues, and one of the most
                  important topics: risk. When it comes to risk, consider the risk register and
                  its information about each identified project risk and any transference risk
                  response that will result in a risk-related contract.

           Completing the Plan-Contracting Process
           The plan-contracting process relies on the outputs of procurement planning. The pro-
           curement management plan will guide the process as the project team has planned, as the
           performing organization requires, or under the guidance of a procurement office within
           the performing organization. There are two primary tools used for plan contracting:
                * Standard forms Within the performing organization, there may be different
                  standardized forms for contracts, descriptions of procurement items, bid
                  documents, and other procurement-related documents. The project manager
                  also considers nondisclosure agreements, proposal evaluation checklists, and
                  any standardized documents to aid in the procurement process.
                * Expert judgment Expert judgment may be needed to review and help the
                  project manager select the best source for the procured product.

           Creating the Procurement Documents
           The primary outputs of the plan-contracting process are the procurement documents.
           These documents guide the relationship between the buyer and the seller. Communica-
           tion between the buyer and the seller should always be specific as to the requirements
           and expectations of the seller. In initial communications, especially when requesting a
           price or proposal, the buyer should include the contract statement of work, relevant spec-
           ifications, and, if necessary, any nondisclosure agreements (NDAs). Requests from buyers
           to sellers should be specific enough to give the seller a clear idea of what the buyer is re-
           questing, but general enough to allow the seller to provide viable alternatives.
                Here are some specific documents the project manager--and the PMP and CAPM
           candidate--should be familiar with:
                * Invitation for bid (IFB) From buyer to seller. Requests the seller to provide
                  a price for the procured product or service.
                * Request for quote (RFQ) From buyer to seller. Requests the seller to provide
                  a price for the procured product or service.
                * Request for proposal (RFP) From buyer to seller. Requests the seller to provide
                  a proposal to complete the procured work or to provide the procured product.
                * Purchase order (PO) A purchase order is a form of a unilateral contract
                  that the buyer provides to the vendor which shows the purchase has been
                  approved by the buyer's organization.
                * Bid From seller to buyer. Price is the determining factor in the decision-
                  making process.

                                                                                                      359
     * Quotation From seller to buyer. Price is the determining factor in the
       decision-making process.
     * Proposal From seller to buyer. Other factors, such as skill sets, reputation,
       or ideas for the project solution; may be used in the decision-making process.

Creating Evaluation Criteria
Another output of the plan-contracting process is the evaluation criteria. This is used to




                                                                                                              PART II
rate and score proposals from the sellers. In some instances, such as with a bid or quote,
the evaluation criteria are focused just on the price the seller offers. In other instances,
such as a proposal, the evaluation criteria can be multiple values: experience, referenc-
es, certifications, and more. The project management team can use any combination of
the following questions to help determine which vendor should be selected to supply
the project's procurement needs:
     * Does the vendor understand the project needs?
     * What's the overall cost of the project?
     * What's the life cycle cost of the deliverable?
     * Does the seller have the technical capability to complete the deliverable?
     * What's the vendor's technical approach to the project's needs?
     * What's the vendor's management approach to creating the deliverable?
     * Does the seller have the financial backing to deliver as promised?
     * Will the vendor have sustained capacity and interest in the project's
       deliverable for future assignments?
     * What is the vendor's business model? Is it a small business, woman-owned, or
       disadvantaged business that may qualify for the contract as defined in some
       governmental agencies?
     * Can the vendor provide references?
     * Who retains the intellectual and proprietary property rights?

    These questions--and others--can help the project management team make the
best decision when it comes to choosing which vendor should support the project. For
your PMP or CAPM exam, always choose the vendor that offers the best solution for the
project.

Requesting Seller Responses
(PMBOK, Section 12.3)
Once the plan-contracting process has been completed, the actual process of asking the
sellers to participate can begin. Fortunately, the sellers, not the buyers, perform most of the
activity in this process--usually at no additional cost to the project. The sellers are busy
trying to win the business. There are three inputs to the request seller responses process:
     * Organizational process assets Yes, you've seen organizational process assets
       throughout the project, but the specific asset you're considering is a history
       of qualified sellers. A list of qualified sellers (also preferred sellers or approved
CAPM/PMP Project Management Certification All-in-One Exam Guide

                   sellers) generally has contact information, history of past experience with
                   the seller, and other pertinent information. In addition to the internal
                   qualified seller list, there are other resources that can help determine which
                   sellers may qualify for the proposed work: Internet resources, industry
                   directories, trade associations, and so on.
                * Procurement management plan This plan is needed because it directs the
                  procurement processes. Go figure.
                * Procurement documents These are created in plan-contracting processes.
                  These are the invitations for bid (IFB), request for proposal (RFP), and request
                  for quote (RFQ) documents.

           Hosting a Bidder Conference
           Buy some donuts and make the coffee--all your bidders are coming over! A bidder
           conference, also called a contractor conference or vendor conference, is a meeting with
           prospective sellers to ensure that all sellers have a clear understanding of the product or
           service to be procured and are all on equal footing. Bidder conferences allow sellers to
           query the buyer on the details of the project statement of work to help ensure that their
           proposals are adequate and appropriate for the proposed agreement. At this point of
           the process, all sellers are considered equal.

           Advertising for Sellers
           Have you ever opened your Sunday newspaper and checked out the classifieds? Chances
           are, you've seen classified ads announcing opportunities for organizations to bid on
           upcoming projects. That's the idea behind this tool and technique. These advertisements
           usually run in newspapers or trade journals specific to the industry of the organization.
           Some government agencies require advertisements inviting sellers to solicit the project
           work, attend a bidder conference, or present a proposal for the described work.

           Creating a Qualified Sellers List
           One of the inputs to this process is to rely on your organizational process assets' quali-
           fied sellers list. If the organization doesn't have such a list, the project management
           team can start creating one. The qualified sellers list can be created through trade mag-
           azines, interviews, the Internet, interviews with past customers, and even site visits. It's
           a bunch of fun!

           Examining Vendor Responses
           The procurement document package is a collection of documents prepared by the buy-
           er and sent to each of the vendors that may participate in the procurement process. The
           procurement document package defines the requirements of the purchase, the specifi-
           cations of the needs, and how the vendor should respond.
                The end result of requesting a seller response is, as expected, a collection of propos-
           als, bids, or quotations, depending on what the buyer asked for. These documents indi-
           cate the sellers' ability and preparedness to complete the project work. The proposals
                                                    Chapter 12: Introducing Project Procurement Management

                                                                                                     361
should be in alignment with the stated expectations of the buyer, and they may be pre-
sented orally, electronically, or in hard copy format. Of course, the relationship be-
tween the buyer and seller--and the type of information being shared--will determine
which modality is the best choice of communication.

Selecting a Seller (PMBOK, Section 12.4)
Once the sellers have presented their proposals, bids, or quotes (depending on what




                                                                                                             PART II
the buyer requested), their documents are examined so that the project manager can
select which sellers are the best choice for the project work. In many instances, price
may be the predominant factor for choosing a particular seller--but not always. Other
factors besides price may also be taken into consideration:
     * The cost of an item may not reflect the true cost to the performing organization
       if the item cannot be delivered in a timely manner. If a seller promises to have a
       product on site by a specific date and fails to do so, the project can be delayed,
       costing the organization thousands--or more--in losses.
     * Proposals can be separated into two categories: technical and commercial.
       The technical category describes the approach and methodology to complete
       the project work. The commercial category delves into the price to complete the
       project work. An evaluation takes into consideration both categories in order
       to determine the best choice for the project.
     * Critical, high-priority projects may rely on multiple sellers to complete the
       project work. This redundancy can balance risk, cost, and opportunity among
       multiple vendors.

Choosing the Seller
For the performing organization to finalize the process of selecting a vendor, there must
first be eligible sellers. Assuming there is more than one seller that can satisfy the demands
of the project, there are seven tools and techniques the project manager can rely on:
     * Weighting system A weighting system takes out the personal preferences
       of the decision-maker in the organization to ensure that the best seller is
       awarded the contract. A weighting system creates a matrix, as seen in Figure
       12-4. Weights are assigned to the values of the proposals, and each proposal
       is scored. Because the weights are determined before reviewing the proposals,
       the process is guaranteed to be free of personal preferences and bias. The seller
       with the highest score is awarded the contract.
     * Independent estimates These estimates are often referred to as "should cost"
       estimates. These estimates are created either by the performing organization
       or outside experts to predict what the cost of the procured product should
       be. If there is a significant difference between what the organization has
       predicted and what the sellers have proposed, either the statement of work
       was inadequate or the sellers have misunderstood the requirements.
     * Screening system A screening system is a tool that filters or screens out
       vendors that don't qualify for the contract. For example, the project manager

Figure 12-4 A weighting system scores values to the seller's ability to deliver goods or services.

                     could say that only vendors that have built eight bridges in the state of Utah
                     can qualify for the contract. Sellers that don't meet the requirements are
                     removed from the selection process, and their proposals are not considered.
                 *   Contract negotiation The performing organization creates an offer, and
                     the seller considers the offer. The contract negotiation process is an activity
                     to create a fair price for the work the seller is to complete. The performing
                     organization and the seller must be in agreement on the expectations,
                     requirements, authorities, terms, technical and business management
                     approaches, price--and any other pertinent factors covered within and
                     by the contract--prior to signing the contract.
                 *   Seller rating systems Seller rating systems are used by organizations to rate
                     prior experience with each vendor that it has worked with in the past. The
                     seller rating system can track performance, quality ratings, delivery, and even
                     contract compliance. The project manager of the current project can reference
                     this internal seller rating system to determine the expectations of working with
                     a vendor based on the vendor's past performance.
                 *   Expert judgment Sometimes, the project manager isn't the best person to
                     make a decision as to which vendor should be selected. Consider very large
                     projects, like building a new skyscraper. The project manager likely wouldn't
                     be the only person involved in making the procurement decision, but rather
                     a team comprised of different experts would contribute to the decision.
                 *   Proposal evaluation techniques This big bucket of tools and techniques
                     can include objective and subjective considerations from experts within
                     the organization, weighting systems, multiple reviewers, scoring systems,
                     screening systems--just about any source selection technique that the project
                     management team feels like using. The point is that there are many different
                     approaches to compare and contrast proposals, so the project management
                     team should use all of the appropriate techniques available to make the best
                     decision for the good of the project.

           Examining the Results of Seller Selection
           The primary output, other than the selected seller, of the selecting seller process is a
           contract between the buyer and the seller. A contract is a legally binding agreement
           between the buyer and seller in which the seller provides the described product and the
           buyer pays for the product. Contracts are known by many names:

             intending to create a contractual relationship with the seller. A letter contract
             is a contract that may be used when the work is needed to start immediately.
             A letter contract is often considered a "stop-gap" solution in procurement.

    Contracts have to be signed by a person with the power to authorize the require-
ments and payment specified in the contract. This role is called the delegation of pro-
curement authority. Whether this person is the project manager depends on the
procurement policies of the performing organization.
    In some organizations, all contracts flow through centralized contracting. Centralized
contracting requires all contracts for all projects to be approved through a central unit
within the performing organization. Other organizations use a decentralized contracting
approach, which assigns a contract administrator or contract officer to the project.
    There are four other outputs of the seller selection process that PMP and CAPM
candidates should be familiar with:
     * Contract management plan When dealing with large, wieldy contracts, a
       new subsidiary plan may need to be created. This subsidiary plan, the contract
       management plan, defines how the contract will be administered through the
       duration of the project.
     * Resource availability The demand and availability of resources related to
       the contracted decision should be documented. This documentation includes
       when resources are active in the project and when they're not needed and can
       be utilized elsewhere.
     * Procurement management plan updates The contract may cause integration
       management to kick in. Changes to the procurement process, or changes to
       the procured item itself, may cause ripples in the procurement management
       plan, which means updates.
     * Change requests We all know that change requests are likely to happen,
       and when dealing with procurement management, it's no different. Change
       requests are fed into the change control system, considered through integration
       change control, and, if approved, are then reflected in the time, cost, and
       scope baselines. Nothing new or surprising here.


Performing Contract Administration
(PMBOK, Section 12.5)
Contract administration is the process of ensuring that both the buyer and the seller
live up to the agreements in the contract. The project manager and the contract admin-
istrator must work together to make certain the seller meets its obligations, just as the
CAPM/PMP Project Management Certification All-in-One Exam Guide
364
           vendor will ensure that the buyer lives up its agreements as well. If either party does not
           fulfill its contractual requirements, legal remedies may ultimately be pursued.


                         EXAM TIP Because of the legalities associated with the contract, contract
                         administration is often handled as an operation of the organization rather than
                         as part of project management.

               Another aspect of contract administration, especially on larger projects with multi-
           ple sellers providing various products, is the coordination between the contractors. The
           project manager or contract officer schedules and confirms the performance of the sell-
           ers so that the deliverables, schedule, and performance of a contractor do not infringe
           or adversely affect the performance of another contractor.
               Within the contract, there must be the terms for payment. Typically, the perfor-
           mance and progress of the contractor is directly linked to payments it receives. The
           project manager must track performance and quality to approve or decline payment as
           needed. The contract should define the metrics for acceptance to avoid disagreements
           on performance.

           Completing Contract Administration
           The actual process of completing contract administration relies heavily on communica-
           tion between the project manager, the contract officer, and the seller. The communica-
           tions plan may have considerations for how and when the communication between the
           buyer and seller should take place and what the purpose of the communication should
           be. There are several tools and techniques to assist the project management team with
           the contract administration process:

                * Contract change control system The contract change control system
                  defines the procedures for how the contract may be changed. The process
                  for changing the contract includes the forms, documented communications,
                  tracking, conditions within the project, business, or marketplace that justify
                  the needed change, dispute resolution procedures, and the procedures for
                  getting the changes approved within the performing organization. The system
                  is part of integrated change control.
                * Performance reporting Performance reporting is the communication between
                  the project manager and management on how the seller is performing under
                  the guidelines in the contract. This is part of communications and should be
                  documented within the communications management plan. The buyer has to
                  confirm that the vendor is living up to the terms of the contract.
                * Inspections and audits If you hired an architect to build your dream home,
                  would you wait until the house is completely built before inspecting the work?
                  Of course not. You'd have to, and likely want to, perform periodic inspections,
                  audits, and walk-throughs of the home as it's under construction. The same is
                  true in project management: The buyer completes inspections and audits to
                  confirm that the seller is abiding by the contracted requirements for the project.
                                                  Chapter 12: Introducing Project Procurement Management

                                                                                                   365
    * Payment system Sellers like to be paid when they have completed their
      obligations. How the sellers are paid is controlled by the payment system,
      which includes interaction of the project manager and the accounts payable
      department. The performing organization may have strict guidelines for
      how payment requests are submitted and approved and how payments
      are completed. On larger projects, the project management team may have
      specific procedures for submitting the payment requests.




                                                                                                           PART II
    * Claims administration Uh-oh! Claims are disagreements between the buyer
      and the seller usually centering on a change, who did the change, and even if
      a change has occurred. Claims are also called disputes and appeals, and are
      monitored and controlled through the project in accordance with the contract
      terms. The contract can, and usually does, determine the path to resolution,
      which may include arbitration or litigation to resolve the claims between the
      buyer and seller. No fun.
    * Records management system Guess what this system does. Yep. It
      records and organizes all of the documentation of the contract, the related
      communications, the work results, and performance of the vendor. The records
      management system is part of the project management information system.
    * Information technology Who's administering a contract manually?
      Information technology (IT) can help the project manager, the project
      management team, and the vendor efficiently abide by the terms of the contract
      and keep the project moving forward. For example, IT can help the project
      manager build the information recorded in the records management system.
    * Buyer-conducted performance reviews The buyer has to confirm that the
      seller is living up to the terms of the contract. Specifically, the buyer reviews
      the quality of what the vendor has created, the cost of what's been created,
      and if the vendor is on schedule. All of these items are documented in the
      terms of the contract--no fudging from the vendors is allowed.

Reviewing the Results of Contract Administration
Contract administration calls for communication between the seller and buyer, the proj-
ect manager and the vendor, and the stakeholders. There must be significant documen-
tation of the agreement that both the buyer and the seller agree to before the procured
work begins. Once the procured work, service, or product has been delivered from the
seller to the buyer, there must be agreement that the delivery is in alignment with the
original agreement. There are five outputs of the contract administration process:
    * Contract documentation All of the contract documentation, including
      the contract, schedules, approved and declined contract changes, technical
      documentations, and any other contract-related paperwork is included as part
      of the contract documentation.
    * Contract change requests Both approved and declined changes are
      documented as to their cost, time, and effect on the project and the procured
      work. Changes that are approved require updates to the project plan, subsidiary
CAPM/PMP Project Management Certification All-in-One Exam Guide
366
                   plans, and possibly to other project documentation. Recall that integration and
                   the contract change control system are invoked for proposed changes that affect
                   the contracted work.
                * Recommended corrective actions The buyer may make recommended
                  corrective actions for the seller to bring the seller's performance into
                  alignment with the project scope and the contracted requirements.
                * Organizational process asset updates Consider the correspondence
                  between the project manager and the seller, the seller's payment requests,
                  and the seller's performance review. These documents all become part of
                  organizational process assets for future reference.
                * Project management plan updates The contract administration process
                  may cause the project management plan to be updated. Specifically, the
                  procurement management plan and the contract management plan may need
                  to be revised.


           Performing Contract Closure
           (PMBOK, Section 12.6)
           Contract closure is analogous to administrative closure. Its purpose is to confirm that
           the obligations of the contract were met as expected. The project manager, the cus-
           tomer, key stakeholders, and, in some instances, the seller may finalize product verifica-
           tion together to confirm that the contract has been completed.
               Contract closure can also be linked to administrative closure, because it is the pro-
           cess of confirming that the work was finished. In instances where the contract was ter-
           minated, contract closure is reviewed and the project is considered closed because of
           the termination. The project records should be updated to reflect the contract closure
           and the acceptance of the work or product.

           Auditing the Procurement Process
           The successes and failures within the procurement process of the project are reviewed
           from the procurement planning stage through to contract administration. The intent of
           the audit is to learn what worked and what didn't during the procurement processes.
           This knowledge can then be applied to other areas within the current project and to
           other projects within the performing organization.

           Completing Contract Closure
           Once the deliverables have been accepted and the contract has been closed, it's essential
           to collect all of the contract information and record it in the contract file. A contract file
           is a complete indexed set of records of the procurement process and is incorporated
           into the administrative closure process. These records include financial information as
           well as information on the performance and acceptance of the procured work.
               Assuming the procured work is acceptable and meets the requirements of the con-
           tract, the contract can be closed. The formal closure of a project comes in a written
           notice from the contract officer to the seller. The notice informs the seller that the work
                                                   Chapter 12: Introducing Project Procurement Management

                                                                                                    367
is acceptable and that the contract is considered closed. The formal closure process may
vary, according to the size of the project. The requirements for contract closure should
be documented within the contract.


Chapter Summary
Projects can buy or build as much as they need to be successful. Part of the procurement
process is making the decision of what needs to be procured. The WBS and the project




                                                                                                            PART II
scope can help the project management team determine what things or services need to
be procured in order for the project to be completed. Once the decision of what needs
to be procured is made, the project manager can, often with the help of expert judg-
ment, query the vendors for bids, quotes, or proposals based on the details of the proj-
ect manager's SOW.
    Vendors may need to attend a bidder conference in order to get clarification on the
SOW--plus, it helps to chat with the project manager to get a clear understanding of what
the project calls for. Vendors will then provide their quotes, bids, or proposals, according
to what the project manager has requested. And then they'll hope they win the gig.
    Once the project manager's organization has made the decision as to what vendor
will be providing the service, the contract is issued. Now both parties have to live up to
the terms and conditions of the contract. Of course, if there are issues that escalate dur-
ing contract administration, there can be--gulp!--claims between the buyer and seller.
    The project manager and the vendor should work together for the best interest of
the project. During contract closure, the buyer inspects the project work and confirms
that the vendor delivered and performed according to the contract terms. And then
everyone lives happily ever after.

Key Terms
Bid From seller to buyer. Price is the determining factor in the decision-making process.
Bidder conference A meeting of all the project's potential vendors to clarify the con-
tract statement work and the details of the contracted work.
Claims These are disagreements between the buyer and the seller, usually centering
on a change, who did the change, and even if a change has occurred. Claims are also
called disputes and appeals, and are monitored and controlled through the project in
accordance with the contract terms.
Contract A contract is a formal agreement between the buyer and the seller. Contracts
can be oral or written--though written is preferred.
Contract change control system This defines the procedures for how the contract
may be changed. The process for changing the contract includes the forms; document-
ed communications; tracking; conditions within the project, business, or marketplace
that justify the needed change; dispute resolution procedures; and the procedures for
getting the changes approved within the performing organization.
Contract statement of work (SOW) This document requires that the seller fully de-
scribe the work to be completed and/or the product to be supplied. The SOW becomes
part of the contract between the buyer and the seller.

           sumes the risk of a cost overrun.
           Cost plus incentive fee A contract type that requires the buyer to pay a cost for the
           procured work, plus an incentive fee, or a bonus, for the work if terms and conditions

           sider fire, hurricanes, tornados, and earthquakes.
           Independent estimates These estimates are often referred to as "should cost" esti-
           mates. They are created by the performing organization or outside experts to predict
           what the cost of the procured product should be.
           Indirect costs These are costs attributed to the cost of doing business. Examples in-
           clude utilities, office space, and other overhead costs.

           the procured product or service.
           Letter contract A letter contract allows the vendor to begin working on the project
           immediately. It is often used as a stop-gap solution.
           Letter of intent A letter of intent is not a contract, but a letter stating that the buyer is
           intending to create a contractual relationship with the seller.
           Make-or-buy decision A process in which the project management team determines the
           cost effectiveness, benefits, and feasibility of making a product or buying it from a vendor.
           Privity The contractual relationship between the buyer and the seller is often consid-
           ered confidential and secret.
           Procurement management plan A project management subsidiary plan that docu-
           ments the decisions made in the procurement planning processes.

           skills, the vendor's reputations, and ideas on how the vendor can complete the con-
           tracted work for the buyer.

between the buyer and the seller.
Screening system    A tool that filters or screens out vendors that don't qualify for the
contract.
Seller rating systems These are used by organizations to rate prior experience with
each vendor that it has worked with in the past. The seller rating system can track per-
formance, quality ratings, delivery, and even contract compliance.
Time and materials contract A contract type in which the buyer pays for the time and
materials for the procured work. This is a simple contract, usually for smaller procure-
ment conditions. These contract types require a not-to-exceed clause, or the buyer as-
sumes the risk for cost overruns.
Weighting system This takes out the personal preferences of the decision-maker in
the organization to ensure that the best seller is awarded the contract. Weights are as-
signed to the values of the proposals, and each proposal is scored.


Case Study
Litke Greenhouse and Nursery: Procurement Processes
Litke Greenhouse and Nursery is Knoxville, Tennessee's agricultural supplier. They spe-
cialize in commercial and home-based plants, ranging from orchids and roses to dog-
wood and jasmine trees. Ros Litke, owner, sponsored a project to create a year-round
garden and showcase that would serve multiple purposes:

     * A greenhouse that could hold plants
     * An educational facility for classes and seminars
     * A marketing piece that could gain national attention
     * A tourist destination for gardeners, photographers, and local residents

   The project scope called for the design and installation of a large greenhouse like no
other facility in the Southeast. The greenhouse simulates a lush Smoky Mountain cove
with adult trees, younger saplings, indigenous plants, a water feature with rainbow

           trout, and a limited amount of birds. The project was dubbed "Snapshot of East Tennes-
           see" because it reflected the ideal East Tennessee environment.

           Planning for Procurement
           Ros Litke, the project sponsor, named Jen Stein as the project manager and Ty Koenig as
           the project manager assistant. When Jen, Ty, and the project team planned this project,
           they identified which deliverables in the WBS they would be able to feasibly create in-
           house and which items needed to be procured. The internal team was qualified to com-
           plete the placement of the plants, design of the garden environment, and installation of
           the water feature. The deliverables in the WBS that required procurement included:

                * Architectural design and construction of the greenhouse
                * Fish and wildlife for the greenhouse
                * Marketing process to inform the public of the final product

               The project team, Jen, and Ty determined that Litke Greenhouse and Nursery would
           need to procure these resources because the internal talent did not have the skill sets to
           complete the required work. In addition, the fish and birds needed for the project
           would need to come from a supplier. While Litke Greenhouse and Nursery does have a
           full-time marketing manager, it was determined that this individual, Jeff Honeycutt,
           did not have the time to dedicate to the complete campaign. In addition, Jeff did not
           have the skill set to create the desired Web site to promote the new space. Jeff Honeycutt
           was, however, involved with selecting the vendor for the marketing campaign.
               As there were multiple items to procure, different procurement items were created.

           Procuring the Architectural Design
           The vision of the finished project was discussed in detail with Ros Litke, Jen Stein, and
           Ty Koenig. The details of the facility were documented and mapped to a statement of
           work. The statement of work defined the design of the architectural plans according to
           the specifications of Litke Greenhouse and Nursery.
               With the SOW created, Jen created a request for proposal that she submitted to five
           selected architectural and construction organizations.

           Procuring the Wildlife
           Based on the planned space of the facility, it was determined that eight birds and 144
           rainbow trout would need to be procured. Jen created a request for quote for this pro-
           curement, because price was the only determining factor in the selection. The RFQ was
           sent to five suppliers of the birds and fish.

           Procuring the Marketing
           Jeff Honeycutt, the full-time marketing pro at Litke Greenhouse and Nursery, worked
           with Jen and Ty to define the SOW for the marketing. Because of the nature of the work
           to be procured, an RFP was created. Jeff wanted a marketing company to see the whole
           vision of the project, and then share that vision with the public.
                                                  Chapter 12: Introducing Project Procurement Management

                                                                                                   371
Hosting a Bidder Conference
Jen and Ty agreed to meet with each of the proposed bidders to discuss the RFP, the
project, and to answer any questions the bidders may have. The conferences were held
on a preset date, as detailed in the RFP, and each bidder had the opportunity to sched-
ule a 40-minute session with Jen and Ty. This allowed the vendor to clarify any issues
and to gather as much detail as possible to create the proposal that he or she believed
would be most valuable to the buyer.




                                                                                                           PART II
    A bidder conference was allowed for both the architectural and the marketing pro-
curement processes. During the marketing bidder conferences, Jen and Ty relied on Jeff's
marketing experience to help lead the conversation and to answer vendor questions.
    A bidder conference was not needed for the procurement of the fish and birds. Jen
and Ty did allow the bidders to call them to clarify any questions on the procured
items. Only one bidder for the wildlife called with a question: "How many female rain-
bow trout would the project require?"

Selecting a Vendor
Jen and Ty read each of the proposals and bids supplied by the sellers. The bid for the
wildlife was the easiest decision to make because it was driven solely by price. While all
of the bidders that supplied a quote for the wildlife were close, Jen and Ty selected the
vendor with the lowest price. All of the vendors guaranteed their fish and fowl to be
healthy and disease-free.
    The architectural selection process was not as clear because of the proposals in-
volved. Ty assisted Jen in creating evaluation criteria to compare and contrast each
proposal. Proposals were ranked according to the following specifications:

     * Qualifications and experience of each firm
     * Ability to address all issues in the provided statement of work
     * Ability to fulfill the design and construction based on the determined timeline
     * New ideas presented within the proposal
     * Price

   Based on this ranking of information, Jen selected an architectural firm to design
and build the facility. Jen and Ty followed a similar approach in selecting the marketing
vendor, but also involved Jeff Honeycutt to make the best decision.

Negotiating the Contract
After selecting the vendors for each of the items that needed procurement, Jen worked
with the vendors to negotiate the contract. Each contract was relative to the type of
work or item to be procured. For example, the architectural firm initially wanted a cost
plus percentage of costs contract. This would have caused the final price for the project
to fluctuate based on the costs of the materials throughout the project.
    Jen negotiated with the seller to use a fixed-price and incentive fee contract for
the project. This contract ensured that the vendor would receive a guaranteed fee for the
CAPM/PMP Project Management Certification All-in-One Exam Guide
372
           project work, but also created an opportunity to gain a bonus if the contracted work
           was completed ahead of schedule.
               The contracted work for the marketing was assigned to a time and materials con-
           tract. This contract type allowed the selected marketing firm to bill for time invested in
           the project's marketing creation, the Web site, and marketing literature. The contract
           did, however, include a not-to-exceed fee for the entire project work. Jen and the seller
           agreed that reports on the expense of the work would be provided every two weeks. This
           would allow Jen to track the marketing expenses against the deliverables the seller was
           creating.

               13. You are the project manager for a software development project for an
                   accounting system that will operate over the Internet. Based on your research,
                   you have discovered that it will cost you $25,000 to write your own code.
                   Once the code is written, you estimate you'll spend $3,000 per month
                   updating the software with client information, government regulations,
                   and maintenance.
                   A vendor has proposed to write the code for your company and charge a fee
                   based on the number of clients using the program every month. The vendor
                   will charge you $5 per month per user of the Web-based accounting system.
                   You will have roughly 1,200 clients using the system per month. However,
                   you'll need an in-house accountant to manage the time and billing of the
                   system, so this will cost you an extra $1,200 per month.
                   How many months will you have to use the system before it is better to write
                   your own code than to hire the vendor?
                    A. 3 months
                    B. 4 months
                    C. 6 months
                    D. 15 months

                1. B. Contracts can be used as a risk mitigation tool. Procurement of risky
                   activities is known as transference; the risk does not disappear, but the
                   responsibility for the risk is transferred to the vendor. A, C, and D are all
                   incorrect. A vendor proposal, a quotation, and project requirements do
                   nothing to serve as a risk mitigation tool. For more information, see the
                   PMBOK, Section 12.2.1.4.
                2. A. Of all choices presented, A is the best choice. Contracts have an offer
                   and a consideration. B is incorrect, as not all contracts demand signatures
                   and notary public involvement. C is incorrect; a contract may not explicitly
                   determine what the value and worth of the procured product or service is. D
                   is also incorrect; a contract may specify a start date, but the acceptance of the
                   start date is vague and not needed for all contracts. For more information, see
                   the PMBOK, Section 12.4.3.2.
                3. C. The project scope statement defines the details and requirements for
                   acceptance of the project, serves as a valuable input to the process of
                   determining what needs to be procured, and defines what the end result
                   will be. When dealing with vendors to procure a portion of the project, the
                   procured work must support the requirements of the project's customer. A is
                   incorrect because the project scope statement defines the project as a whole,
                   not just the contracted work, which may be just a portion of the project. B is
                   incorrect; the project scope statement does not define the requirements for the
                   contract work. D is also incorrect; the vendor likely will not have a copy of the
                   product description. For more information, see the PMBOK, Section 12.1.1.3.
                4. B. This is the best answer of all the choices presented. The contract change
                   control system will determine the best route to incorporate the change. A,
                   while feasible, is not the best answer to the question. A new contract does not
                   update the original agreement and may cause delays, as the contract may have
                   to be resubmitted, reapproved, and so on. C and D are not viable answers. For
                   more information, see the PMBOK, Section 12.5.2.1.
                5. C. All contracts in the United States are backed by the U.S. court systems. A, B,
                   and D are not correct answers. For more information, see the PMBOK, Section
                   12.4.3.2.
                6. C. A purchase order is an example of a unilateral contract. A, B, and D are all
                   incorrect choices. An SOW is a statement of work. A legally binding contract
                   does not fully answer the question. D, an invoice from the vendor, is not
                   what the purchasing department is requesting. For more information, see the
                   PMBOK, Section 12.1.2.3.
                7. B. A fair contract shares a reasonable amount of risk between the buyer
                   and the seller. A is incorrect; a contract may transfer the majority of the
                   responsibility to the vendor. C is incorrect; the reward is not an appropriate
                   answer to the question. D is also incorrect; the accountability of the services
                   contracted to the vendor is not shared between the buyer and the seller. For
                   more information, see the PMBOK, Section 12.1.2.3.
                                               Chapter 12: Introducing Project Procurement Management

                                                                                                377
 8. C. Privity is a confidential agreement between the buyer and seller. A, B, and
    D are incorrect choices, as these do not fully answer the question.
 9. D. A fixed-price contract contains the least amount of risk for a project. The
    seller assumes all of the risk. A, B, and C are incorrect because these contract
    types carry the risk of cost overruns being assumed by the buyer. For more
    information, see the PMBOK, Section 12.1.2.3.
10. C. A lump-sum contract provides a fixed fee to complete the contract; the




                                                                                                        PART II
    seller absorbs any cost overruns. A and B are incorrect because these contracts
    require the seller to carry the risk of cost overruns. D is incorrect, because a
    time and materials contract requires the buyer to pay for cost overruns on the
    materials and the time invested in the project work. For more information, see
    the PMBOK, Section 12.1.2.3.
11. B. The contractor's rate of $120 per hour plus the cost of the materials is an
    example of a time and materials contract. A is incorrect; a cost plus fixed fee
    contract charges the cost of the materials, plus a fixed fee, for the installation
    or work to complete the contract. C is incorrect; a unit price contract has a set
    price for each unit installed on the project. D is also incorrect, as a lump-sum
    contract does not break down the time and materials. For more information,
    see the PMBOK, Section 12.1.2.3.
12. C. The risk register is not an input to the contract statement of work. Only A,
    B, and D are inputs for the contract statement of work. For more information,
    see the PMBOK, Section 12.1.3.2.
13. C. The monies invested in the vendor's solution would have paid for your
    own code in six months. This is calculated by finding your cash outlay for the
    two solutions: $25,000 for your own code creation; zero cash outlay for the
    vendor's solution. The monthly cost to maintain your own code is $3,000.
    The monthly cost of the vendor's solution is $7,200. Subtract your cost of
    $3,000 from the vendor's cost of $7,200 and this equals $4,200. Divide this
    number into the cash outlay of $25,000 to create your own code, and you'll
    come up with 5.95 months. Of all the choices presented, C, 6 months, is the
    best choice. A, B, and D are all incorrect, as they do not answer the question.
    For more information, see the PMBOK, Section 12.1.2.1.
14. B. Henry intends to buy from the ABN Contracting Company. A, C, and D
    are all incorrect; these choices do not adequately describe the purpose of the
    letter of intent.
15. D. An invitation for bid is a request for a sealed document that lists the seller's
    firm price to complete the detailed work. A and B, request for proposal and
    request for information, are documents from the buyer to the seller requesting
    information on completing the work. C, a proposal, does not list the price to
    complete the work, but instead offers solutions to the buyer for completing
    the project needs. For more information, see the PMBOK, Section 12.2.2.1.
16. B. Procurement documents detail the requirements for the work to ensure
    complete proposals from sellers. A is incorrect; procurement documents
    allow input from the seller to suggest alternative ways to complete the project

                   work. C is incorrect; informing the performing organization as to why the bid
                   is being created is not the purpose of the procurement documents. D is not
                   realistic. For more information, see the PMBOK, Section 12.2.3.1.
               17. C. The select seller process happens during the execution process group.
                   A, B, and D are all incorrect, as these process groups do not include source
                   selection. For more information, see the PMBOK, Sections 12.4 and 3.2.3.7.
               18. C. For immediate work, a letter contract may suffice. The intent of the letter
                   contract is to allow the vendor to get to work immediately to solve the project
                   problem. A, B, and D are all incorrect; these contracts may require additional
                   time to create and approve. When time is of the essence, a letter contract is
                   acceptable.
               19. C. Any additional work is a change in the project scope. Changes to the
                   project scope should be approved by the mechanisms in the contract change
                   control system. The stakeholder needs to approve the changes to the project
                   scope. A, B, and D are not realistic expectations of the project. This question
                   borders on the PMP Code of Professional Conduct. Typically, when a project
                   scope has been fulfilled, the project work is done. The difference in this
                   situation is that the additional tasks are optional requirements for the project
                   scope. For more information, see the PMBOK, Section 12.5.2.1.
               20. A. Force majeure, sometimes called "an act of God," is a natural disaster that
                   can wreck a project. B, risk transference, is incorrect, as this describes the
                   response to the risk, not the tornado itself. C, direct cost, describes costs that
                   cannot be shared with other organizations but that are attributed directly to
                   your project. D, an unknown unknown, does not fully describe the tornado
                   as choice A does, so this choice is also incorrect. For more information, see
                   the PMBOK, Section 12.2.1.4.
    PMP Code of
    Professional Conduct
                                                                                   CHAPTER


                                                                                                   13
    In this chapter, you will
       * Learn the PMP Code of Conduct
       * Understand how a project manager should behave
       * Represent PMI as a PMP or CAPM
       * Agree to live according to the PMP Code of Conduct (forever and ever)




 The PMP Code of Professional Conduct is the authoritative guide on how the project
 management professional (PMP) should act as a professional and how the PMP should
 behave with customers and the public in general. The PMP exam candidate will be
 tested on the knowledge of the PMP Code of Professional Conduct.

     The code, while only one page in length, covers a broad array of do's and don'ts for
 the PMP. Essentially, the PMP and certified associate in project management (CAPM)
 should always take the high road. There should be no room for misconceptions, errors
 in judgment, or actions that could be interpreted as conflicts of interest, shady, or just
 plain wrong.
     Whenever the project manager is considering doing something that could be seen
 as wrong, just remember, "When in doubt, don't." The full PMP code of conduct is
 available through the Project Management Institute (PMI) Web site at: www.pmi.org/
 prod/groups/public/documents/info/pdc_pmpcodeofconduct.pdf.
     The PMP and the CAPM exams cover more than just the PMP Code of Professional
 Conduct in regards to professional responsibility. Many of these topics have been cov-
 ered in communications and human resources. The five areas of professional responsi-
 bility are:
       * Ensuring integrity                                   * Balancing stakeholder interests
       * Contributing to the knowledge base                   * Respecting differences
       * Applying professional knowledge

                VIDEO     Adhering to the Code of Conduct.

           Understanding Your Responsibilities
           to the Profession
           The project manager must adhere to a high set of principles, rules, and policies. This
           includes the organizational rules and policies, the certification process, and the ad-
           vancement of the profession. On the PMP exam, always choose the answer that best
           supports the project management profession and the higher set of principles the PMP
           and CAPM are expected to adhere to.

           Complying with Rules and Policies
           Honesty is expected in all areas regarding the PMP examination process, including:
                * Exam applications must be honest and reflect actual education and work
                  experience.
                * Test items, questions, answers, and scenarios are not to be shared with other
                  PMP candidates.
                * PMP renewal information must reflect an honest assessment of education and
                  experience.
                * Continuing education information must be honest and accurate; continuing
                  education reporting must reflect actual courses completed.
               The project manager should report violations of the PMP code when clear and fac-
           tual evidence exists of the code being violated. Based on the scenario, the reporting may
           be to PMI, to the performing organization's management, or to the proper law enforce-
           ment authorities.
               The PMP and CAPM must disclose to clients and customers scenarios where the
           project manager may be perceived as having an unfair advantage, a conflict of interest,
           or where he or she may profit from conditions within the project. Any appearances of
           impropriety must be avoided and disclosed.

           Applying Honesty to the Profession
           The PMP and CAPM candidates are expected, at all times, to provide honesty in experience
           documentation, advertisement of skills, and performance of services. The project manager
           must, of course, adhere to and abide by all applicable laws governing the project work. In
           addition, the ethical standards within the trade or industry should be adhered to.

                         EXAM TIP Industry standards are recommendations for how the work and
                         practice should be followed. Regulations are requirements for how the work
                         and practice must be followed. A project manager must know the difference.

           Advancing the Profession
           PMPs and CAPMs must respect and recognize the intellectual work and property of
           others. A project manager can't claim others' work as his own. He must give credit
           where credit is due. Work, research, and development sources must be documented and
           acknowledged by the project manager relying on others' work.
                                                              Chapter 13: PMP Code of Professional Conduct

                                                                                                     381
    Another method of advancing the project management profession is to distribute
the PMP Code of Professional Conduct to other PMP and CAPM candidates.


Understanding Your Responsibilities to the
Customer and the Public
The project manager also has a responsibility to the customer of the project and the




                                                                                                             PART II
public. Projects that affect internal customers are expected to meet requirements, stan-
dards, and fulfill the business need of the performing organization. Essentially, the
project manager is working for the customer.
    Projects that serve a community and citizens have a responsibility that is somewhat tied
to public service. The project manager is held accountable for the work completed for the
public--and for the transactions, quality of work, and the ethics enforced in the project.

Enforcing Project Management Truth and Honesty
PMPs and CAPMs must represent themselves and their projects truthfully to the gen-
eral public. This includes statements made in advertising, press releases, and in public
forums. When project managers are involved in the creation of estimates, truth is also
expected. The project manager must provide accurate estimates on time, cost, services
to be provided, and realistic outcomes of the project work.
     When a project is assigned to a CAPM or PMP, the project manager has the respon-
sibility to meet the project scope as expected by the customer. PMPs and CAPMs work
for the customer and must strive for customer satisfaction while fulfilling the project
objectives. As part of the project implementation, the project manager keeps confiden-
tial information confidential. There is an obligation to the customer to maintain pri-
vacy, confidentiality, and nondisclosure of sensitive information.

Eliminating Inappropriate Actions
PMPs and CAPMs must avoid conflicts of interest and scenarios where conflicts of in-
terest could seem apparent, opportunistic, or questionable to the customer or other
stakeholders. In addition, the project manager must not accept any inappropriate gifts;
inappropriate payments; or any other compensation for favors, project management
work, or influence of a project. The exception to this rule is when the laws or customs
of the country where the project is being performed call for gifts to the project manager.
However, PMPs and CAPMs should be aware of what gifts are acceptable and appropri-
ate within the country where the project is taking place. Lavish gifts outside of the norm
should be refused.


Summing Up the Code
The PMP Code of Professional Conduct and the professional conduct of a project man-
ager account for a big chunk of questions on the PMP and CAPM examination. To an-
swer these questions correctly, always take the "ethical high road." The questions con-
cerning ethics, conflict of interest, and personal gain are representative of the types of
situations project managers can find themselves in on a regular basis. For the PMP and
CAPM/PMP Project Management Certification All-in-One Exam Guide

           CAPM exams--and in daily practice--follow the Code of Professional Conduct, and
           you'll do fine.
               A project manager must follow the laws he or she is governed by. This means know-
           ing the difference between optional standards and the required regulations. Next, the
           project manager must follow the policies of the organization he or she is employed by.
           This means that if the project manager's company has a policy against a certain condi-
           tion--no matter how small or innocent it may seem--the policy must be followed first.
           Finally, the project manager must avoid conflicts of interest and appearances of impro-
           priety.
               When a project manager is completing projects in another country, the project
           manager must be respectful of the laws, people, culture, and values of the country the
           work is taking place in. Project managers must not succumb to ethnocentrism--the act
           of believing that their own culture is better than anyone else's. The project manager
           must work to understand the culture, traditions, and expectations of the people he is
           working with in the foreign countries while still complying with the policies of his or-
           ganization.

           Key Terms
           Confidentiality The privacy allotted to customers and stakeholders regarding the
           terms, conditions, and circumstances within a project.
           Conflict of interest An ethical dilemma in which a project manager could affect
           a project decision for personal gain rather than doing what's in the best interest of the
           project.
           PMP Code of Professional Conduct A PMI-endorsed code that PMP and CAPM can-
           didates are expected to abide by in their career and role as a project manager.

           Questions
                1. You are the project manager of the JKN Project. The project customer has
                   requested that you inflate your cost estimates by 25 percent. He reports that
                   his management always reduces the cost of the estimates, so this is the only
                   method to get the monies needed to complete the project. Which of the
                   following is the best response to this situation?
                    A. Do as the customer asked to ensure that the project requirements can be
                       met by adding the increase as a contingency reserve.
                    B. Do as the customer asked to ensure that the project requirements can be
                       met by adding the increase across each task.
                    C. Do as the customer asked by creating an estimate for the customer's
                       management and another for the actual project implementation.
                    D. Complete an accurate estimate of the project. In addition, create a risk
                       assessment on why the project budget would be inadequate.

2. You are the project manager for the BNH Project. This project takes place in a
   different county than where you are from. The project leader from this country
   presents a team of workers that are only from his family. What should you do?
   A. Reject the team leader's recommendations and assemble your own project
      team.
   B. Review the resume and qualifications of the proposed project team before
      approving the team.

   C. Determine if the country's traditions include hiring from the immediate
      family before hiring from outside the family.
  D. Replace the project leader with an impartial project leader.
3. You are about to begin negotiations on a new project that is to take place
   in another country. Which of the following should be your guide on what
   business practices are allowed and discouraged?

   worked so that his theft remains private. What should you do?
   A. Fire the project team member.
   B. Report the team member to his manager.

  D. Tell the team member you're disappointed in what he did and advise him
     not to do something like this again.

   quality of the work. The manager has requested that you get to work on several
   of the activities on the critical path even though you and she have not solved the
   issues concerning the project. What should you do?

   B. Complete the activities as requested.
   C. Ask to be taken off of the project.

                6. PMI has contacted you regarding an ethics violation of a PMP candidate. The
                   question is in regards to a friend that said he worked as a project manager
                   under your guidance. You know this is not true, but to save a friendship, you
                   avoid talking with PMI. This is a violation of what?
                    A. The PMP code to cooperate on ethics violations investigations
                    B. The PMP code to report accurate information
                    C. The PMP code to report any PMP violations
                    D. Law concerning ethical practices
                7. You are the project manager for the Log Cabin Project. One of your vendors
                   is completing a large portion of the project. You have heard a rumor that
                   the vendor is losing many of its workers due to labor issues. In light of this
                   information, what should you do?
                    A. Stop work with the vendor until the labor issues are resolved.
                    B. Communicate with the vendor regarding the rumor.
                    C. Look to secure another vendor to replace the current one.
                    D. Negotiate with the labor union to secure the workers on your project.
                8. You are the project manager for the PMH Project. Three vendors have submitted
                   cost estimates for the project. One of the estimates is significantly higher than
                   similar project work in the past. In this scenario, you should do what?
                    A. Ask the other vendors about the higher estimate from the third vendor.
                    B. Use the cost estimates from the historical information.
                    C. Take the high cost to the vendor to discuss the discrepancy before
                       reviewing the issue with the other vendors.
                    D. Ask the vendor that supplied the high estimate for information on how
                       the estimate was prepared.
                9. You are the project manager of the LKH Project. This project must be completed
                   within six months. The project is two months into the schedule and is starting to
                   slip. As of now, the project is one week behind schedule. Based on your findings,
                   you believe that you can make some corrective actions and recover the lost time
                   over the next month to get the project back on schedule. Management, however,
                   requires weekly status reports on cost and schedule. What should you do?
                    A. Report that the project is one week behind schedule, but will finish on
                       schedule based on cited corrective actions.
                    B. Report that the project is on schedule and will finish on schedule.
                    C. Report that the project is off schedule by a few days, but will finish on
                       schedule.
                    D. Report that the project is running late.
               10. As a contracted project manager, you have been assigned a project with a
                   budget of $1.5 million. The project is scheduled to last seven months, but
                                                        Chapter 13: PMP Code of Professional Conduct

    your most recent earned value management (EVM) report shows that the
    project will finish ahead of schedule by nearly six weeks. If this happens,
    you will lose $175,000 in billable time. What should you do?
    A. Bill for the entire $1.5 million, since this was the approved budget.
    B. Bill for the $1.5 million by adding additional work at the end of the project.
    C. Report to the customer the project status and completion date.




                                                                                                       PART II
    D. Report to the customer the project status and completion date, and ask if
       they'd like to add any additional features to account for the monies not spent.
11. You are the project manager of the PMH Project. You have been contracted
    to design the placement of several pieces of manufacturing equipment. You
    have completed the project scope and are ready to pass the work over to the
    installer. The installer begins to schedule you to help with the installation of
    the manufacturing equipment. You should do what?
    A. Help the installer place the equipment according to the design documents.
    B. Help the installer place the equipment as the customer sees fit.
    C. Refuse to help the installer, since the project scope has been completed.
    D. Help the installer place the equipment, but insist that the quality control
       be governed by your design specifications.
12. You are the project manager of the 12BA Project. You have completed the
    project according to the design documents and have met the project scope.
    The customer agrees that the design document requirements have been met;
    however, the customer is not pleased with the project deliverables and is
    demanding additional adjustments be made to complete the project. What
    is the best way to continue?
    A. Complete the work as the customer has requested.
    B. Complete the work at 1.5 times the billable rate.
    C. Do nothing. The project scope is completed.
    D. Do nothing. Management from the performing organization and the
       customer's organization will need to determine why the project failed
       before adding work.
13. You are the project manager of the AAA Project. Due to the nature of the
    project, much of the work will require overtime between Christmas and New
    Year's Day. Many of the project team members, however, have requested
    vacation during that week. What is the best way to continue?
    A. Refuse all vacation requests and require all team members to work.
    B. Only allow vacation requests for those team members who are not needed
       during that week.
    C. Divide tasks equally among the team members so that each works the
       same amount of time.
    D. Allow team members to volunteer for the overtime work.

               14. You are a project manager for your organization. Your project is to install
                   several devices for one of your company's clients. The client has requested that
                   you complete a few small tasks that are not in the project scope. To maintain
                   the relationship with the client, you oblige her request and complete the work
                   without informing your company. This is an example of what?
                    A. Effective expert judgment
                    B. Failure to satisfy the scope of professional services
                    C. Contract change control
                    D. Integrated change control
               15. You are completing a project for a customer in another country. One of the
                   customs in this country is to honor the project manager of a successful project
                   with a gift. Your company, however, does not allow project managers to accept
                   gifts from any entity worth more than $50. At the completion of the project,
                   the customer presents you with a new car in a public ceremony. What should
                   you do?
                    A. Accept the car, since it is a custom of the country; to refuse it would be an
                       insult to your hosts.
                    B. Refuse to accept the car, since it would result in a conflict with your
                       organization's policy on gifts.
                    C. Accept the car and then return it, in private, to the customer.
                    D. Accept the car and then donate the car to a charity in the customer's name.
               16. You have a project team member who is sabotaging your project because he
                   does not agree with it. What should you do?
                    A. Fire the project team member.
                    B. Present the problem to management.
                    C. Present the problem to management with a solution to remove the team
                       member from the project.
                    D. Present the problem to management with a demand to fire the project
                       team member.
               17. You are the project manager of a project in Asia. You discover that the project
                   leader has hired family members for several lucrative contracts on the project.
                   What should you consider?
                    A. Cultural issues
                    B. Ethical issues
                    C. Organizational issues
                    D. Political issues
               18. Of the following, which one achieves customer satisfaction?
                    A. Completing the project requirements
                    B. Maintaining the project cost

  19. A PMP has been assigned to manage a project in a foreign country. The
      disorientation the PMP will likely experience as he gets acclimated to the
      country is known as what?
      A. The Sapir-Whorf hypothesis




                                                                                                        PART II
      B. Time dimension
      C. Ethnocentrism
      D. Culture shock
  20. You are the project manager for an information technology project. It has
      come to your attention that a technical problem has stopped the project work.
      How should you proceed?
      A. Measure the project performance to date and account for the cost of the
         technical problem.
      B. Rebaseline the project performance to account for the technical problem.
      C. Work with the project team to develop alternative solutions to the
         technical problem.
      D. Outsource the technical problem to a vendor.


Answers
   1. D. It would be inappropriate to bloat the project costs by 25 percent. A risk
      assessment describing how the project may fail if the budget is not accurate
      is most appropriate. A, B, and C are all incorrect, since these choices are
      ethically wrong. The PMP should always provide honest estimates of the
      project work.
   2. C. You should first confirm what the local practices and customs call for
      regarding hiring family members before others. A and D are incorrect, since
      they do not consider the qualifications of the project team leader and the
      project team. In addition, they do not take into account local customs. B is
      incorrect as well; although it does ponder the qualifications of the project
      team, it does not consider the local customs.
   3. C. The company polices and procedures should guide the project manager
      and the decision he makes in the foreign country. A and B are incorrect, since
      these documents are essential but usually do not reference allowed business
      practices. D is incorrect; while the PMP harbors crucial information, the
      company's policies and procedures are most specific to the project work and
      requirements.
   4. B. This situation calls for the project team member to be reported to his
      manager for disciplinary action. A is inappropriate because the project
      manager may not have the authority to fire the project team member. C
CAPM/PMP Project Management Certification All-in-One Exam Guide
388
                   is inappropriate because the project manager must take action to bring the
                   situation to management's attention. D is also inappropriate, since there are
                   no formal discipline actions taken to address the problem.
                5. B. The project manager must respect the delegation of the functional manager.
                   A, C, and D are all inappropriate actions, since they do not complete the
                   assigned work the functional manager has delegated to the project manager.
                6. A. By avoiding the conversation with PMI regarding your friend's ethics
                   violation, you are, yourself, violating the PMP code to cooperate with PMI. B,
                   C, and D are incorrect answers, since they do not fully answer the question.
                7. B. The project manager should confront the problem by talking with the
                   vendor about the rumor. A is incorrect and would delay the project and
                   possibly cause future problems. C is incorrect and may violate the contract
                   between the buyer and seller. D is also incorrect--the agreement is between
                   the vendor and the performing organization, not the labor union.
                8. D. Most likely, the vendor did not understand the project work to be procured,
                   so the estimate is skewed. A clear statement of work is needed for the vendors
                   to provide accurate estimates. A, B, and C are all inappropriate actions, since
                   they discuss another vendor's estimate. This information should be kept
                   confidential between the buyer and seller. In some government projects, the
                   winning bid may be required to be released.
                9. A. The project manager should report an honest assessment of the project,
                   with actions on how he plans to correct the problem. B is incorrect because
                   it does not provide an honest answer to management. C is also incorrect
                   because it does not provide an honest answer to management. D is incorrect
                   because it does not provide a solution to the problem.
               10. C. Honest and accurate assessment of the project work is always required. A
                   and B are incorrect because these actions do not reflect an honest assessment
                   of the work. D is incorrect because it offers gold plating and recommends
                   additional changes that were not part of the original project scope. In addition,
                   because this is a contracted relationship, the additional work may not be
                   covered within the original project contract and may result in legal issues.
               11. C. When the project scope is completed, the contract is fulfilled and the
                   project is done. Any new work items should not be sent through. In this
                   instance, the contract change control system or a new contract should be
                   created. A, B, and D are incorrect because these choices are outside of the
                   scope and have not been covered in the contract.
               12. C. When the project scope has been completed, the project is completed.
                   Any additional work, without a contract change or new contract, would be
                   dishonest and would betray the customer or the project manager's company.
                   A and B are both incorrect; additional work is not covered in the current
                   contract. D is incorrect because the project did not fail--the deliverables
                   met the requirements of the project scope and the design document.
                                                        Chapter 13: PMP Code of Professional Conduct

                                                                                               389
13. D is the best choice for this scenario, because it allows the project team to be
    self-led and is sensitive to the needs of the project team. A, B, and C are all
    autocratic responses to the problem, and while the results may seem fair, D
    is the best choice.
14. B. When the project manager completes activities outside of the contract
    and does not inform the performing organization, it is essentially the same
    as stealing. The PMP must be held accountable for all the time invested in




                                                                                                       PART II
    a project. A is incorrect; this is not expert judgment. C is incorrect because
    the contract has not been changed or attempted to be changed. D is also
    incorrect; the changes the project manager completed for the customer were
    not sent through any change control system, but were completed without
    documentation or reporting.
15. B is the best answer. Although this solution may seem extreme, to accept the
    car in public would give the impression that the project manager has defied
    company policy. In addition, accepting the car would appear to be a conflict
    of interest for the project manager. A, C, and D are all incorrect. Accepting the
    car, even with the intention of returning it or donating it to charity, would be
    in conflict with the company's policies regarding the acceptance of gifts.
16. C. The project team member that is causing the problems should be presented
    to management, with a solution to remove the project team member from the
    project. Remember, whenever the project manager must present a problem
    to management, he should also present a solution to the problem. A is
    incorrect because it likely is not the project manager's role to fire the project
    team member. B is incorrect because it does not address a solution for the
    problem. D is incorrect because the project manager's focus should be on the
    success of the project. By recommending that the project team member be
    removed from the project, the problem is solved from the project manager's
    point of view. Management, however, may come to the decision on their own
    accord to dismiss the individual from the company altogether. In addition, a
    recommendation from the project manager to fire someone may be outside
    the boundary of human resources' procedure for employee termination.
17. A. The project manager should first determine what the country's customs
    and culture call for when hiring relatives. It may be a preferred practice in the
    country to work with qualified relatives first before hiring other individuals
    to complete the project work. B, C, and D are not the best choice in this
    scenario. They may be followed up by first examining the cultural issues
    within the country.
18. A. The largest factor when it comes to customer satisfaction is the ability
    to complete the project requirements. B, C, and D are incorrect because
    achieving these factors, while good, is not as complete as achieving the project
    requirements, which may include the cost, schedule, and quality expectations.
19. D. Culture shock is the typical disorientation a person feels when visiting
    a foreign country. A is incorrect; the Sapir-Whorf hypothesis is a theory
CAPM/PMP Project Management Certification All-in-One Exam Guide
390
                   that believes an individual can understand a culture by understanding its
                   language. B is incorrect; time dimension is the local culture's general practice
                   for respecting time and punctuality. C is incorrect; ethnocentrism is a person's
                   belief that his or her own culture is the best and that all other cultures should
                   be measured against it.
               20. C. When problems arise that stop project tasks, the project manager should
                   work with the team to uncover viable alternative solutions. A and B do
                   nothing to find a solution to the problem, so they are incorrect. D is incorrect,
                   since the solution for the problem has not necessarily been addressed. The
                   end result of C, to find an alternative solution, may be D, but outsourcing the
                   problem to a vendor should not be the first choice in this scenario.

 Projects are full of plans, reports, and other documents. Having a clear understanding of
 each of the document types and why they may, or may not, be needed in a project can
 help you answer exam questions correctly. What follows is every document type and its
 Project Management Body of Knowledge (PMBOK) reference.

 Activity cost estimate supporting detail This is the collection of documents
 that detail how the project's cost estimate was created. The supporting detail should in-
 clude the following (for more information, see the PMBOK, Section 7.1.3.2):
       * The scope of the work that the estimate is based on
       * The basis for the estimate
       * Documentation of the assumptions used in the estimate creation
       * Documentation of the constraints used in the estimate creation
       * The range of possible estimates, such as the +/- percentage of dollar amount

 Activity duration estimate An estimate of the likely time it will take to com-
 plete the project, a phase, or individual activities within the project. For more information,
 see the PMBOK, Section 6.4.3.1.

 Activity list The collection of schedule activities is called the activity list. For more
 information, see the PMBOK, Section 6.1.3.1.

 Analogous estimate An estimate based on a previous similar project to predict
 the current project's time or cost expectations. For more information, see the PMBOK,
 Sections 6.4.2.2 and 7.1.2.1.

 Arrow diagramming method A network diagram where the arrows represent
 the activities in the project and the diagram's nodes show the dependencies of the ac-
 tivities. This network diagramming approach only uses the finish-to-start relationship
 between activities. Should two activities need to happen in tandem, a "dummy activity"
 is added to the network diagram and is illustrated by a dashed line. For more informa-
 tion, see the PMBOK, Section 6.2.2.2.

                                                                                           393

           Bar charts A histogram that typically depicts the project activities and their associ-
           ated start and end dates. For more information, see the PMBOK, Section 6.5.3.1

           Bill of materials (BOM) Defines the materials and products needed to create the
           items defined in the corresponding work breakdown structure (WBS). The BOM is ar-
           ranged in sync with the hierarchy of the deliverables in the WBS. For more information,
           see the PMBOK, Section 5.3.3.2.

           Business case A business case is often needed for the project charter to justify the
           project's existence. For more information, see the PMBOK, Section 4.1.

           Cause-and-effect diagrams Also known as Ishikawa diagrams and fishbone dia-
           grams. These illustrate how potential problems within a project may contribute to failure
           or errors within the project. For more information, see the PMBOK, Section 8.3.2.1.

           Change requests A documented request to change the project's scope is managed
           through the project's integrated change control process. For more information, see the
           PMBOK, Section 4.4.3.2.

           Claim A documented disagreement between the buyer and the seller. Claims are of-
           ten settled through negotiations, mediation, or in the courts, depending on the terms
           of the contract. For more information, see the PMBOK, Section 12.5.2.6.

           Communications management plan This subsidiary plan defines who needs
           what information, when the information is needed, the frequency of the communica-
           tion, and the accepted modalities for the communication needs. For more information,
           see the PMBOK, Section 10.1.3.1.

           Contract A legal relationship between the buyer and the seller that describes the
           work to be completed, the fee for performing the work, a schedule for completing the
           work, and acceptance criteria to deem the contract complete. If a project is being com-
           pleted by one organization for another organization, there is typically a contractual
           relationship between the seller and the customer. Contracts may be inputs for the proj-
           ect charter. For more information, see the PMBOK, Sections 4.1.1 and 12.4.3.2.

           Contract management plan A plan that is used for significant purchases. This
           plan directs the acquisition and adherence of both the buyer and the seller to the terms
           of the contract. For more information, see the PMBOK, Section 12.4.3.3.

           Contract statement of work This document defines the product and services
           that are being procured to satisfy portions of the project scope statement. For more in-
           formation, see the PMBOK, Section 12.1.3.2.

           Control charts This quality-control tool illustrates the stability of a process and
           allows the project management team to determine if the process may have trends and
           predictability. For more information, see the PMBOK, Section 8.3.2.2.

           Cost baseline A time-phased budget that tracks the planned project expenses
           against the predicted project expenses. This document is used to measure, monitor, and
                                                             Appendix A: Project Management Documents

structure for estimating, budgeting, and controlling project costs. For more informa-
tion, see the introduction to Chapter 7 in the PMBOK and Section 7.1.3.4.

Cost plus fee or cost plus percentage of costs A contract in which the
buyer pays the seller a fee for the contract work or deliverable plus an additional fee
based on the percentage of the total costs for the goods or service provided. For more
information, see the PMBOK, Section 12.1.2.3.

Cost plus fixed fee A contract in which the buyer pays the seller the costs of the
materials and/or labor to complete the contract work or deliverable plus a predeter-




                                                                                                        PART III
mined fee. For more information, see the PMBOK, Section 12.1.2.3.

Cost plus incentive fee A contract in which the buyer pays the seller the costs of
the materials and labor plus an incentive bonus for reaching objectives set by the buyer.
Incentives are typically based on reaching schedule objectives. For more information,
see the PMBOK, Section 12.1.2.3.

Decision tree A diagram that identifies and evaluates each available outcome of a
decision and the decision's implication, consideration of each choice, and the value of
each decision. For more information, see the PMBOK, Section 11.4.2.2.

Defect repair requests Requests to repair defects within the project deliverables.
For more information, see the PMBOK, Section 4.4.

Fishbone diagrams Also known as cause-and-effect diagrams and Ishikawa dia-
grams. These illustrate how potential problems within a project may contribute to failure
or errors within the project. For more information, see the PMBOK, Section 8.3.2.1.

Fixed-price or lump-sum contract A contract that defines the total price for
the work or product the organization agrees to purchase. For more information, see the

           Independent estimate Also known as a third-party estimate and should-cost
           estimate, this document serves as a mean for estimates provided by potential vendors
           to complete the work the contract calls for. An independent estimate is often created by
           a third party for the performing organization for a fee. For more information, see the
           PMBOK, Section 12.4.2.2.

           Influence diagram A chart that shows the relationships between and among caus-
           al factors, events, situations, and other project conditions. For more information, see

           date by which the issued must be resolved. For more information, see the PMBOK, Sec-
           tion 9.4.2.4.

           Lessons-learned documentation The results of quality control and other types
           of lessons learned are documented and become part of organizational process assets.
           Lessons-learned documentation is created throughout the project's life cycle. For more
           information, see the PMBOK, Section 8.3.3.8.

           Milestone chart A chart that depicts the promised milestone completion and the ac-
           tual milestone completion dates. For more information, see the PMBOK, Section 6.5.3.1.

           Milestone list The documented collection of the project milestones and their at-
           tributes, deadlines, and requirements. The milestone list is part of the overall project
           management plan. For more information, see the PMBOK, Section 6.1.3.3.

           Nondisclosure agreement A procurement document that requires the vendor
           to not disclose information about the contract to anyone within or without of the per-
           forming organization. For more information, see the PMBOK, Section 12.2.2.1.

           Organizational breakdown structure There can be two versions of this docu-
           ment. First, there's the decomposition of the project's hierarchy of organizations, depart-
           ments, and disciplines related to the work packages in the WBS. This document helps the
           project management team determine which disciplines or departments are responsible for
           which work packages as identified in the WBS. For more information, see the PMBOK, Sec-
           tion 5.3.3.2. Second, this could depict the organization's departments, teams, functional
           departments, and business units. For more information, see the PMBOK, Section 9.1.2.1.

           Parametric estimate An estimate based on a parameter, such as a cost per metric
           ton or number of hours to complete a repetitive activity. For more information, see the
           PMBOK, Sections 6.4.2.3 and 7.1.2.4.

Pareto chart A histogram that shows the categories of failure within a project. A
Pareto chart ranks the failures from largest to smallest, which then allows the project
management team to attack the largest problems within the project. Pareto charts are
based on Pareto's law, which states that 80 percent of the problems are related to 20
percent of the causes. For more information, see the PMBOK, Section 8.3.2.5.

Performance reports The project's communications management plan defines the
expectations and frequency of the project's performance reports. Performance reports up-
date the necessary stakeholders on the status and progress information, and may include
bar charts, S-curves, histograms, and tables. These reports provide documentation about
the project and project team's overall performance during the project's execution. Perfor-
mance can measure work results, time, cost, scope, quality, and other specifics within the
project. For more information, see the PMBOK, Sections 9.4.1.8 and 10.3.3.1.

PMBOK Guide A book published by Project Management Institute (PMI) that
serves as a guide to the project management body of knowledge. It is generally accepted
in the project management discipline as providing good practices for most projects,
most of the time. For more information, see the PMBOK, Section 1.1.

Preliminary project scope statement This is a preliminary, high-level defini-
tion of the project scope. This early project document will be refined through progres-
sive elaboration as the project moves deeper into the planning processes. For more in-
formation, see the PMBOK, Section 4.2.

Probability and impact matrix Demonstrates through either a cardinal or an
ordinal scale the probability, impact, and risk score of each identified risk event. The
process is a result of both qualitative and quantitative risk analyses. For more informa-
tion, see the PMBOK, Section 11.1.3.1.

Process improvement plan This project management subsidiary plan instructs
the project management team how to identify and react to any non-value-added activi-
ties and waste that may exist or creep into the project. For more information, see the
PMBOK, Section 8.1.3.4.

Procurement management plan This subsidiary plan of the overall project man-
agement plan defines the processes and policies for choosing, selecting, and working with
a vendor on the project. The plan defines the contracts that should be used, the standard
procurement documents, and the conditions to work with (and sometimes manage) the
client-vendor relationship. For more information, see the PMBOK, Section 12.1.3.1.

Product scope The features and function of the product, service, or result that a
project may bring about. For more information, see the introduction to Section 5 in the
PMBOK.

           tifies the business needs and the new product, service, or result the project will bring
           about in the organization. For more information, see the PMBOK, Section 3.2.1.1.

           Project closure documents The documentation of the project's completion,
           closure, and transfer of the project deliverables to other parties within the organization
           or to the project customers. If the project has been cancelled, the project closure docu-
           ments detail why the project has been cancelled and what has happened to the project
           deliverables that may have been created during the limited project execution. For more
           information, see the PMBOK, Section 4.7.3.4.

           Project management plan This document defines all of the accepted project
           management processes for the current project, including how the project will be initi-
           ated, planned, executed, monitored, controlled, and closed. The project management
           plan is comprised of the following subsidiary plans (these plans are also defined in this
           appendix, but for quick reference, their PMBOK location is listed here as well). For

Project scope management plan This is a subsidiary plan of the overall project
plan. It defines how the project scope will be defined, documented, verified, managed,
and controlled. This plan also defines how the project's WBS will be defined, main-
tained, and approved. The scope verification process is also documented within the
project scope management plan. Finally, this plan defines the scope change control pro-
cess the project will adhere to. For more information, see the PMBOK, Section 5.1.3.1.

Project scope statement This document defines the scope of the project and the
work required to deliver the project scope. For more information, see the PMBOK, Sec-
tion 5.2.3.1. The project scope statement provides several pieces of project information:

           performing organization. For more information, see the PMBOK, Section 12.3.2.3.

           Quality baseline This document defines the quality objectives for the project. Re-
           sults of project performance measurement are compared against the project baseline so
           that improvements may be made; if the work is acceptable, the project may continue.
           For more information, see the PMBOK, Section 8.1.3.4.

           Quality checklists A checklist, as the name implies, is a project management tool
           used to ensure that a series of steps have been performed as planned and required by the
           project management team. For more information, see the PMBOK, Section 8.1.3.3.

           Quality management plan This subsidiary project management plan defines
           how the project management team will adhere to and implement the requirements of
           the performing organization's quality policy. For more information, see the PMBOK,
           Section 8.1.3.1.

           RACI chart A responsibility-assignment matrix that documents the project roles
           and the responsibilities for each within the project. In a RACI chart, the activities of
           responsible, accountable, consult, and inform are used (hence, the acronym RACI). For
           more information, see the PMBOK, Section 9.1.2.1.

           Request for proposal A request from the buyer to potential vendors to provide

Resource breakdown structure (RBS) A hierarchical decomposition of the
resources required to complete the deliverables within the project. For more informa-
tion, see the PMBOK, Section 5.3.3.2.

Resource calendar The calendar that defines when people and equipment are
available for the project's use. The resource calendar identifies if a resource is idle, on
vacation, or being utilized on the current or another project within the organization.
For more information, see the PMBOK, Sections 6.3.3.4 and 6.4.1.7.

Responsibility assignment matrix (RAM) Illustrates the connection be-
tween the project work and the project team members who will complete the project
work. For more information, see the PMBOK, Section 9.1.2.1.

Risk breakdown structure (RBS) The project's risks are depicted in a hierar-




                                                                                                         PART III
chy of risk categories. For more information, see the PMBOK, Section 5.3.3.2.

Risk register A component of the project management plan that documents the
outcome of all risk management activities. For more information, see the PMBOK, Sec-
tion 11.2.3.1. The risk register includes:

     * List of identified risks
     * List of potential responses
     * Root causes of risk

Risk-related contractual agreements Should the planned response to a risk
event use transference, a contractual agreement is often demanded. For more informa-
tion, see the PMBOK, Section 11.5.3.3.

Risk management plan This defines how the risk management activities within
the project will occur. A risk management plan is a subsidiary plan of the overall project
management plan. For more information, see the PMBOK, Section 11.1.3.1. The risk
management plan includes:

     * Methodology
     * Roles and responsibilities
     * Budgeting
     * Timing
     * Risk categories
     * Definitions of risk probability and impact
     * Updated risk categories

Run charts Similar to a control chart, these charts show measured trends over time.

           Scatter diagram A quality-control diagram that shows the relationship between
           two or more variables within a project. For more information, see the PMBOK, Sec-
           tion 8.3.2.7.

           Schedule activities The work package is decomposed into the tasks needed to
           create the work package deliverable. The collection of schedule activities may also be
           called the activity list. For more information, see the PMBOK, Section 6.1.2.1.

           Schedule baseline A baseline depicting the expected start and completion dates
           of project activities, dates for the milestones, and finish dates for the entire project or
           project phase. For more information, see the PMBOK, Section 6.5.3.3.

           Schedule comparison bar charts A bar chart that depicts the discrepancies
           between the current activity status and the estimated activity status. For more informa-
           tion, see the PMBOK, Section 6.6.2.6.

           Schedule network templates An organization that may be repeating the same
           type of projects may elect to use a schedule network template. These templates are pre-
           populated with activities and their preferred sequence. Often, schedule network tem-
           plates are based on previous similar projects and are adapted for the current project. For
           more information, see the PMBOK, Section 6.2.2.3.

           Scope baseline The project's scope baseline is comprised of the project's scope
           statement, the WBS, and the WBS dictionary. For more information, see the PMBOK,
           Section 5.3.3.4.

           Staffing management plan The project management subsidiary plan that de-
           fines when and how staffing needs will be fulfilled in the project's life cycle. The plan
           defines, at a minimum, the process of staff acquisition, the timetable for resource utili-
           zation, release criteria, training needs, the rewards and recognition for the project, hu-
           man resource compliance, and safety issues for the project team members. For more
           information, see the PMBOK, Section 9.1.3.3.

           Strategic plan An organization's strategic plan is considered when a project is be-
           ing chartered. All projects within an organization should support the organization's
           strategic plan. For more information, see the PMBOK, Section 4.1.1.2.

           Subnetwork template When a project includes repetitive work, such as the cre-
           ation of identical floors within a skyscraper, the network diagram may use a subnet-
           work template to illustrate the repetition in the project. For more information, see the
           PMBOK, Section 6.2.2.3.

           Summary budget Project charters often refer to a summary budget, which may
           address the predetermined budget allotted for a project or a rough order of magnitude
           estimate based on the preliminary project scope statement. For more information, see
           the PMBOK, Section 4.1.
                                                              Appendix A: Project Management Documents

                                                                                                  403
Summary milestone schedule A schedule of when the project management
team can expect the milestones within the project to be reached. This schedule is part
of the project charter. For more information, see the PMBOK, Section 4.1.

Text-oriented responsibility formats When roles and responsibilities need
more documentation than a RACI or RAM chart can provide, a text-oriented version is
used. These may also be known as position descriptions or role-responsibility-author-
ity forms. For more information, see the PMBOK, Section 9.1.2.1.

Three-point estimate An estimate based on the average of the optimistic, most like-
ly, and pessimistic time estimates. For more information, see the PMBOK, Section 6.4.2.4.

Time and materials contract A simple contract type in which the buyer pays
the seller for the time and materials to deliver the product or service the contract calls




                                                                                                         PART III
for. This contract type should have a "not-to-exceed" clause to cap the contract's total
costs. For more information, see the PMBOK, Section 12.1.2.3.

Work breakdown structure (WBS) A document that visualizes the deliver-
ables that comprise the project scope. The WBS uses a code of accounts to number and
identify the elements within the decomposition. The smallest item within the WBS is
called the work package. For more information, see the PMBOK, Section 5.3.

Work breakdown structure dictionary This is a companion document to
the WBS and details each item in it. Every entry in the WBS dictionary includes its re-
lated code of account identifier, responsible organization, schedule, quality require-
ments, technical references, and may include charge numbers, related activities, and a
cost estimate. For more information, see the PMBOK, Section 5.3.3.3.

Work breakdown structure template A work breakdown structure template is
a WBS from a previous similar project that has been adapted and modified to map to the
current project's deliverables. For more information, see the PMBOK, Section 5.3.2.1.

Work package The smallest item in the WBS that cannot, or should not, be de-
composed any farther as a project deliverable. For more information, see the PMBOK,
Section 6.1.2.1.

Work performance information This is an input to quality control measure-
ment and includes work completion information, status of project deliverables, status
of corrective actions, and overall technical performance measurements. For more infor-
mation, see the PMBOK, Section 8.3.1.5.

    Passing the CAPM
    and the PMP Exam
                                                                                APPENDIX


                                                                                                 B
 Obviously, you want to pass your Project Management Professional (PMP) or Certified
 Associate in Project Management (CAPM) exam on the first attempt. Why bother sit-
 ting for an exam if you know you're not prepared? In this appendix, you'll find the de-
 tails that you must know to pass the exam. These facts won't be everything you need to
 know to pass the PMP or CAPM exam--but you can bet you won't pass the exam if you
 don't know the critical information contained in this appendix.


 Tips to Pass the Exam
 For starters, don't think of this process as preparing to take an exam--think of it as
 "preparing to pass an exam." Anyone can prepare to take an exam: just show up. Pre-
 paring to take the PMP and then CAPM exam requires project management experience,
 diligence, and a commitment to study.

 Days Before the Exam
 In the days leading up to your scheduled exam, here are some basics you should do to
 prepare yourself for success:
       * Get some moderate exercise. Find time to go for a jog, lift weights, take a swim,
         or do whatever workout routine works best for you.
       * Eat smart and healthy. If you eat healthy food, you'll feel good and feel better
         about yourself. Be certain to drink plenty of water, and don't overdo the caffeine.
       * Get your sleep. A well-rested brain is a sharp brain. You don't want to sit for
         your exam feeling tired, sluggish, and worn-out.
       * Time your study sessions. Don't overdo your study sessions--long, crash study
         sessions aren't that profitable. In addition, try to study at the same time every
         day at the time your exam is scheduled.

 Create Your Own Answer Key
 If you could take one page of notes into the exam, what information would you like on
 this one-page document? Of course, you absolutely cannot take any notes or reference
                                                                                           405

           materials into the exam area. However, if you can create and memorize one sheet of
           notes, you absolutely may re-create this once you're seated in the exam area.
               Practice creating a reference sheet so that you can immediately, and legally, re-create
           this document once your exam has begun. You'll be supplied with several sheets of
           blank paper and a couple of pencils. Once your exam process begins, re-create your
           reference sheet. The following are key pieces of information you'd be wise to include on
           your reference sheet (you'll find all of this key information in this appendix):
                * Activities within each process group
                * Estimating formulas
                * Communications formula
                * Normal distribution values
                * Earned value management formulas
                * Project management theories

           Testing Tips
           The questions on the PMP and CAPM exams aren't always direct and easy, they may
           offer a few red herrings, and some people have reported that they found the exam like
           reading War and Peace. But there are some practical exam-passing tips. For starters, you
           may face questions that state, "All of the following are correct options, expect for which
           one?" The question wants you to find the incorrect option or the option that would not
           be appropriate for the scenario described. You're looking for the answer that doesn't fit
           with the others listed. Be sure to understand what the question is asking for. It's easy to
           focus on the scenario presented in a question and then see a suitable option for that
           scenario in the answer. However, if the question is asking you to identify an option that
           is not suitable, then you just missed the question. Carefully read the question to under-
           stand what is expected for an answer.
               Here's a tip that can work with many of the questions: Identify what the question wants
           for an answer, and then look for an option that doesn't belong with the other possible an-
           swers. In other words, find the answer that doesn't fit with the other three options. Find the
           "odd man out." Here's an example: EVM is used during the ____________________.
                A. Controlling phase
                B. Executing phase
                C. Closing phase
                D. Entire project
               Notice how options A, B, and C are exclusive? If you choose A, the controlling
           phase, it implies that earned value management (EVM) is not used anywhere else in the
           project. The odd man out here is D, the entire project; it's considered the "odd" choice
           because, by itself, it is not an actual process group. Of course, this tip won't work with
           every question--but it's handy to keep in mind.
               For some answer choices, it may seem like two of the four options are both possible
           correct answers. However, because you may only choose one answer, you must discern
           which one is the best choice. Within the question, there will usually be some hint de-
                                                         Appendix B: Passing the CAPM and the PMP Exam

                                                                                                  407
scribing the progress of the project, the requirements of the stakeholders, or some oth-
er clue that can help you determine which answer is the best one for the question.

Answer Every Question--Once
The PMP exam has 200 questions, while the CAPM exam has 150 questions. You need to
answer every question. Do not leave any question blank, even if you don't know the an-
swer to the question. A blank answer is a wrong answer. As you move through the exam
and you find questions that stump you, use the "mark question" option in the exam soft-
ware, choose an answer you suspect may be correct, and then move on. When you have
answered all of the questions, you are given the option to review your marked answers.
   Some questions in the exam may prompt your memory to come up with answers to
questions you have marked for review. However, resist the temptation to review those
questions you've already answered with confidence and haven't marked. More often




                                                                                                         PART III
than not, your first instinct is the correct choice. When you completed the exams at the
end of each chapter, did you change correct answers to wrong answers? If you did it in
practice, you'll likely do it on the actual exam.

Use the Process of Elimination
When you're stumped on a question, use the process of elimination. For each question,
there'll be four choices. On your scratch paper, write down "ABCD." If you can safely
rule out "A," cross it out of the ABCD you've written on your paper. Now focus on
which of the other answers won't work. If you determine that "C" won't work, cross it
off your list. Now you've got a 50-50 chance of finding the correct choice.
    If you cannot determine which answer is best, "B" or "D" in this instance, here's the
best approach:
     1. Choose an answer in the exam (no blank answers, remember).
     2. Mark the question in the exam software for later review.
     3. Circle the "ABCD" on your scratch paper, jot any relevant notes, and then
        record the question number next to the notes.
     4. During the review, or from a later question, you may realize which choice is
        the better of the two answers. Return to the question and confirm that the best
        answer is selected.


Everything You Must Know
As promised, this section covers all of the information you must know going into the exam.
It's highly recommended that you create a method to recall this information. Here goes.

The 44 Project Management Processes
Table B-1 shows the 44 project management processes. The intersection of the knowl-
edge area and each stage (initiating, planning, executing, controlling, and closing) de-
scribes the activity that happens at that point in the project. For example, follow the
project scope management row and the controlling column to find Scope verification
and change control. The number next to each process represents the number of processes
you'll find in that process group.

           Organizational Structures
           Organizational structures are relevant to the project manager's authority. A project
           manager has authority from weakest to highest in the following order:
                   * Functional
                   * Weak matrix

WBS Facts
The work breakdown structure (WBS) is the big picture of the project deliverables. It is
not the activities that will create the project, but the components that the project will
create. The WBS helps the project team and the project manager create accurate cost and
time estimates. It also helps the project team and the project manager create an accurate
activity list. The WBS is an input to five planning processes:

     * Activity definition
     * Resource planning
     * Cost estimating
CAPM/PMP Project Management Certification All-in-One Exam Guide

                * Cost budgeting
                * Risk management planning

           Project Scope Facts
           Projects are temporary endeavors to create a unique product or service. Projects are se-
           lected by one of two methods:

                * Benefit measurement methods These include scoring models, cost-benefit
                  ratios, and economic models.
                * Constrained optimization models These include mathematical models
                  based on linear, integer, and dynamic programming. (You probably won't
                  see constrained optimization on the CAPM exam.)

               The project scope defines all of the required work, and only the required work, to
           complete the project. Scope management is the process of ensuring that the project
           work is within scope and protecting the project from scope creep. The scope statement
           is the baseline for all future project decisions, as it justifies the business need of the
           project. There are two types of scope:

                * Product scope Defines the attributes of the product or service the project is
                  creating
                * Project scope Defines the required work of the project to create the product

              Scope verification is the process completed at the end of each phase and of each
           project to confirm that the project has met the requirements. It leads to formal accep-
           tance of the project deliverable.

           Project Time Facts
           Time can be a project constraint. Effective time management is the scheduling and sequenc-
           ing of activities in the best order to ensure that the project completes successfully and in a
           reasonable amount of time. These are some key terms related to time management:

                * Lag     Waiting between activities.
                * Lead     Activities come closer together and even overlap.
                * Free float The amount of time an activity can be delayed without delaying
                  the next scheduled activity's start date.
                * Total float The amount of time an activity can be delayed without delaying
                  the project's finish date.
                * Float Sometimes called slack--a perfectly acceptable synonym.
                * Duration May be abbreviated as "du." For example, du=8d means the
                  duration is eight days.
                                                            Appendix B: Passing the CAPM and the PMP Exam

                                                                                                     411
   There are three types of dependencies between activities:
    * Mandatory This hard logic requires a specific sequence between activities.
    * Discretionary This soft logic prefers a sequence between activities.
    * External Due to conditions outside of the project, such as those created by
      vendors, the sequence must happen in a given order.
    There are three types of precedence between activities that you should know for
the exam:
    * Finish to Start The predecessor activity must finish before the successor
      activity can start.
    * Finish to Finish The predecessor activity must finish before the successor




                                                                                                            PART III
      activity can finish.
    * Start to Start The predecessor activity must start before the successor activity
      can start.

Project Cost Facts
There are several methods of providing project estimates:
    * Bottom-up Project costs start at zero, each component in the WBS is estimated
      for costs, and then the "grand total" is calculated. This method takes the longest
      to complete, but provides the most accurate estimate.
    * Analogous Project costs are based on a similar project. This is a form of
      expert judgment, but it is also a top-down estimating approach, so it is less
      accurate than a bottom-up estimate.
    * Parametric modeling Price is based on cost per unit; examples include cost
      per metric ton, cost per yard, and cost per hour.
   There are four types of costs attributed to a project:
    * Variable costs The costs are dependent on other variables. For example, the
      cost of a food-catered event depends on how many people register to attend
      the event.
    * Fixed costs The cost remains constant throughout the project. For example,
      a rented piece of equipment has the same fee each month even if it is used
      more in some months than in others.
    * Direct costs The cost is directly attributed to an individual project and
      cannot be shared with other projects (for example, airfare to attend project
      meetings, hotel expenses, and leased equipment that is used only on the
      current project).
    * Indirect costs These are the costs of doing business; examples include rent,
      phone, and utilities.

           Quality Management Facts
           The cost of quality is the money spent investing in training, in meeting requirements
           for safety and other laws and regulations, and in taking steps to ensure quality accep-
           tance. The cost of nonconformance is the cost associated with rework, downtime, lost
           sales, and waste of materials.
               Some common quality management charts and methods include the following:

                * Ishikawa diagrams (also called fishbone diagrams) are used to find causes
                  and effects that contribute to a problem.
                * Flow charts show the relationship between components and the flow of a
                  process through a system.
                * Pareto diagrams identify project problems and their frequencies. These are
                  based on the 80/20 rule: 80 percent of project problems stem from 20 percent
                  of the work.
                * Control charts plot out the result of samplings to determine if projects are "in
                  control" or "out of control."
                * Kaizen technologies comprise approaches to make small improvements in an
                  effort to reduce costs and achieve consistency.
                * Just-in-time ordering reduces the cost of inventory but requires additional
                  quality because materials would not be readily available if mistakes occurred.

           Human Resource Facts
           There are several human resource theories that the CAPM and PMP candidate should
           be familiar with on the exams. They include the following:

                * Maslow's Hierarchy of Needs There are five layers of needs for all humans:
                  physiological, safety, social needs (such as love and friendship), self-esteem,
                  and the crowning jewel, self-actualization.
                * Herzberg's Theory of Motivation There are two catalysts for workers:
                  hygiene agents and motivating agents.
                   * Hygiene agents These do nothing to motivate, but their absence demotivates
                     workers. Hygiene agents are the expectations all workers have: job security,
                     a paycheck, clean and safe working conditions, a sense of belonging, civil
                     working relationships, and other basic attributes associated with employment.
                   * Motivating agents These are the elements that motivate people to excel.
                     They include responsibility, appreciation of work, recognition, opportunity
                     to excel, education, and other opportunities associated with work other
                     than just financial rewards.
                * McGregor's Theory of X and Y This theory states that "X" people are lazy,
                  don't want to work, and need to be micromanaged. "Y" people are self-led,
                  motivated, and can accomplish things on their own.
                                                             Appendix B: Passing the CAPM and the PMP Exam

                                                                                                      413
     * Ouchi's Theory Z This theory holds that workers are motivated by a sense
       of commitment, opportunity, and advancement. People will work if they are
       challenged and motivated. Think participative management.
     * Expectancy Theory People will behave based on what they expect as a result
       of their behavior. In other words, people will work in relation to the expected
       reward.

Communication Facts
Communicating is the most important skill for the project manager. With that in mind,
here are some key facts on communications:
     * Communication channels formula: N(N-1)/2. N represents the number of
       stakeholders. For example, if you have 10 stakeholders, the formula would read




                                                                                                             PART III
       10(10-1)/2, or 45 communication channels. Pay special attention to questions
       wanting to know how many additional communication channels you have
       based on added stakeholders. For example, if you have 25 stakeholders on your
       project and have recently added five team members, how many additional
       communication channels do you now have? You'll have to calculate the
       original number of communication channels: 25(25-1)/2=300 and then
       calculate the new number with the added team members: 30(30-1)/2=435
       and, finally, subtract the difference between the two: 435-300=135, which is
       the number of additional communication channels.
     * 55 percent of communication is nonverbal.
     * Effective listening is the ability to watch the speaker's body language, interpret
       paralingual clues, and decipher facial expressions. Following the message,
       effective listening has the listener asking questions to achieve clarity and
       offering feedback.
     * Active listening requires receivers of the message to offer clues, such as nodding
       the head to indicate that they are listening. It also requires receivers to repeat the
       message, ask questions, and continue the discussion if clarification is needed.
     * Communication can be hindered by trendy phrases, jargon, and extremely
       pessimistic comments. In addition, other communication barriers include
       noise, hostility, cultural differences, and technical interruptions.

Risk Management Facts
Risks are unplanned events that can have positive or negative effects on the projects.
Most risks are seen as threats to the project's success--but not all risks are bad. For ex-
ample, let's say there is a 20 percent probability that a project will realize a discount in
shipping, which will save the project $15,000. If this risk happens, the project will save
money; if the risk doesn't happen, the project will have to spend the $15,000. Risks
should be identified as early as possible in the planning process. A person's willingness
to accept risk is the utility function (also called the utility theory or risk tolerance level).
The Delphi technique can be used to build consensus on project risks.
CAPM/PMP Project Management Certification All-in-One Exam Guide
414
              The only output of the risk planning process is the risk management plan. There are
           two broad types of risks:

                * Business risk The loss of time and finances (where a downside and upside
                  exist)
                * Pure risk The loss of life, injury, and theft (where only a downside exists)

               Risks can be responded to in one of seven methods:

                * Avoidance Avoid the risk by planning a different technique to remove the
                  risk from the project.
                * Mitigation Reduce the probability or impact of the risk.
                * Acceptance The risk's probability or impact may be small enough that the
                  risk can be accepted.
                * Transference The risk is not eliminated, but the responsibility and
                  ownership of the risk is transferred to another party (for example, through
                  insurance).
                * Exploit Positive risks that are likely to happen can be exploited to take
                  advantage of the conditions the risk may create.
                * Sharing Positive risks can be shared with other organizations.
                * Enhancing Positive risks that may not occur on their own can be enhanced
                  to increase their probability of occurring.

              When a project manager does risk assessment, he'll be doing analysis and then a
           ranking of the risks. Here are the key terms with these activities:

                * Qualitative analysis       This approach qualifies the risks for further analysis.
                * Quantitative analysis        This method assigns numeric values to probability
                  and impact.
                * Cardinal scale A numeric ranking.
                * Ordinal scale A word ranking (high, medium, low).

           Procurement Facts
           A statement of work (SOW) is provided to the potential sellers so that they can create
           accurate bids, quotes, and proposals for the buyer. A bidders' conference may be held
           so that sellers can query the buyer on the product or service to be procured.
               A contract is a formal agreement, preferably written, between a buyer and seller. In
           order to be valid, a contract must have:

                * An offer
                * Acceptance
                * Consideration
                                                          Appendix B: Passing the CAPM and the PMP Exam

                                                                                                   415
     * A legal purpose
     * Capacity to enter into a contract

    On the CAPM exam, procurement questions are usually from the buyer's point of
view. All requirements the seller is to complete should be clearly written in the contract.
Requirements of both parties must be met, or legal proceedings may follow. Contract
types include the following:

     * Cost-reimbursable contracts require the buyer to assume the risk of cost
       overruns.
     * Fixed-price contracts require the seller to assume the risk of cost overruns.
     * Time and material contracts are good for smaller assignments, but can
       impose cost overrun risks to the buyer if the contract between the buyer and




                                                                                                          PART III
       seller does not include a "not to exceed clause." This clause, commonly called
       an NTE clause, puts a cap on the maximum amount for the contract time and
       materials.
     * A purchase order is a unilateral form of contract.
     * A letter of intent is not a contract, but shows the intent of the buyer to
       purchase from a specific seller.


A Letter to You
My goal for you is to pass your exam. As I teach my PMP Boot Camp for different orga-
nizations around the globe, I'm struck by one similarity among the most excited course
participants: these people want to pass their exam. Sure, project management is not the
most exciting topic, but the individuals are excited about passing their exam. I hope
you feel the same way I believe that your odds of passing the PMP or the CAPM is like
most things in life, you're only going to get out of it what you put into it. I challenge
you to become excited, happy, and eager to pass the exam.
    Here are 10 final tips for passing your PMP or CAPM examination:

     * Prepare to pass the exam, not just take it.
     * If you haven't done so already, schedule your exam. Having a deadline makes
       that exam even more of a reality.
     * If you haven't done so already, create a clutter-free area for studying.
     * Study in regular intervals right up to the day before your examination.
     * Repetition is the mother of learning. If you don't know the formula, repeat
       and repeat. And then repeat it again.
     * Create your own flash cards from the terms and glossary in this book.
     * Always answer the exam questions according to Project Management Institute
       (PMI), not how you'd do it at your organization.

416
                * Practice creating the one page of notes that you'll create at the start of your exam.
                * Create a significant reward for yourself as an incentive to pass the exam.
                * Make a commitment to pass.

           your PMP or CAPM success story, drop me a line: certified@projectseminars.com. Fi-
           nally, I won't wish you good luck on your PMP or CAPM exam--luck is for the ill-pre-
           pared. If you follow the strategies I've outlined in this book and apply yourself, I am
           certain you'll pass the exam.

    Understanding the Code
    of Ethics and Professional
                                                                                APPENDIX


                                                                                              C
    Conduct
    In this appendix you will
       * Explore the new PMI Code of Ethics and Professional Conduct
       * Learn the structure of the code
       * Learn about the code's stance on fairness and honesty
       * Learn how to adhere to the code's mandatory standards




 In 1981, back when Jordache jeans and the song "Bette Davis Eyes" were all the rage,
 some folks at Project Management Institute (PMI) were more concerned with ethics
 than parachute pants. PMI created the Ethics, Standards, and Accreditation Group to
 create a code of ethics for the project management profession. Sounds like a bunch fun,
 doesn't it? By the end of the '80s, the group's discussions and reports evolved into the
 Ethics Standard for the Project Management Professional. In 1998, this document be-
 came the early version of a new member Code of Ethics. This was a code that all PMI
 members, whether certified as a project manager or not, agreed to abide by in their
 professional practices. Consequently, in January 1999, the Ethics, Standards, and Ac-
 creditation Group approved a process for ethics complaints to be filed, reviewed, and
 then acted on if the complaint proved valid.

     Since the late '90s, the global economy has changed. The business world has been
 rocked by the demise of billion-dollar companies going bankrupt. We've all witnessed
 (or participated) in the dot-com bust, and we've experienced the realization of world-
 wide competition for jobs. Part of all this chaos is the realization that ethics and moral
 standards vary among countries, companies, and cultures. The once-simple PMI Code
 of Conduct, most recently a one-page document with broad definitions and approach-
 es, has become outdated.




                                                                                       417

               PMI also considered the boom of their membership population. The organization
           has grown from just a few hundred U.S.-based members to several hundred thousands
           of members worldwide as of today. The goal of the Code of Conduct, from its incep-
           tion, was to create a moral guideline for project managers of all industries and to en-
           courage them to subscribe to a common belief in fairness and honesty, and to hold
           themselves to a higher level of expectation than project managers who were not mem-
           bers of PMI. At least, that was the theory. I'm sure most of us know project managers
           who are PMI members and certainly don't subscribe to the PMI Code of Ethics.
               Because the PMI Code of Conduct was outdated, PMI created a new governing
           body--the Ethics Standard Review Committee--to examine the project management
           code of ethics in this "new" world. Part of this committee was to include a global ap-
           proach to review of the now-defunct Code of Conduct, the ethical considerations of the
           global market, and a desire to create a more exact and verbose description of what the
           ethics and character of a PMI member should be.
               In October 2006, the new, six-page PMI Code of Ethics and Professional Conduct
           was officially released. Congratulations! The organization of the document is arranged
           by chapters and sections. And, as is the case with most documents from PMI, you'd
           think a bunch of attorneys wrote the document. No offense to my pals at PMI--it's a
           great document, really. However, in this appendix, I'm going to break down their docu-
           ment in a slightly less formal, and much less official, approach. I hope you like it.


           Chapter One: Vision and Applicability
           The first chapter of the PMI Code of Ethics and Conduct paints the big picture of what
           the code is intended for. The vision of the code is, no doubt, that the project manage-
           ment community will adapt the code in its day-to-day operations and lives as represen-
           tatives of PMI. The code is necessary, however, because project managers are often in
           situations in which their ethics could be jeopardized. Let's take a detailed look at this
           first chapter.

           Exploring the Code's Vision and Purpose
           PMI wants the project management community to do what's "right and honorable."
           I'm sure we all want those same values from ourselves and other project managers. PMI
           expands that vision, however, to go beyond your role as a project manager. The code
           calls for adherence in all areas of our lives: "at work, at home, and in service to our
           profession." Don't most of us live, eat, and sleep project management, anyway?
                The real purpose of the code is reputation. From PMI's point of view, the code--and
           our agreement to adhere to it--will raise the perception of the ethical value project
           managers agree to, and are expected to abide by, as members and participants in PMI
           programs. The code is also a motivation to become a better project management prac-
           titioner. By establishing a globally accepted code for our ethics and behavior, our cred-
           ibility, reputation, and collective behavior should, in theory, rise to new standards.
                                         Appendix C: Understanding the Code of Ethics and Professional Conduct

                                                                                                         419
Participating in the Code
In the past, project management professionals (PMPs) were expected to adhere to the
PMP Code of Conduct. Certified associates in project management (CAPMs) were ex-
pected to adhere to the CAPM Code of Conduct. And, members of PMI who were cre-
dentialed as PMPs or CAPMs were also held to a separate ethical standard. It made
more sense, of course, to create a blanket code of ethics for all members and certified
candidates. So basically, everyone who is a PMI member, a CAPM, a PMP, or the latest
PMI certification: the Program Manager Professional (PgMP), will have to agree to par-
ticipate in this fresh PMI Code of Ethics and Professional Conduct. This code also ap-
plies to CAPM, PMP, and PgMP candidates.


             NOTE Kudos to PMI on this decision! A simple solution is usually the best




                                                                                                                 PART III
             one. I'm thrilled with this new code, its detailed descriptions, and application
             for all PMI participants.


Learning the Code Details
The code includes four values that PMI has deemed core to the ethics and standards for
project managers:

     * Responsibility
     * Respect
     * Fairness
     * Honesty

    These four values comprise the final four chapters of the Code of Ethics and Profes-
sional Conduct. Within each of these values, there are aspiration standards and manda-
tory standards. Basically, there are characteristics of these values that we, as project
managers, should aspire to, and then there are other facets of these values that we must
adhere to.
    The PMP Code of Ethics also includes a few scenarios and comments from PMI
about their ethical standards. You'll find a glossary of terms in the code--something
our pals at PMI haven't provided before. I'll list those terms at the end of this appendix.
No peeking!


Chapter Two: Responsibility
as a Project Manager
The second chapter of the PMI Code of Ethics and Professional Conduct centers on
responsibility. We project managers already have a level of responsibility based on the
organizational structure that we operate in (from functional to projectized).
CAPM/PMP Project Management Certification All-in-One Exam Guide
420
           What Is Responsibility?
           According to the Code of Ethics and Professional Conduct, responsibility is our duty to
           take ownership for the decisions we make or fail to make. It's also our duty to take
           ownership of our action or lack of actions. And finally, it's our duty to take ownership
           of the results of those decisions and actions.


                         NOTE This is my favorite section of the Code of Ethics and Professional
                         Conduct. I may be on my soapbox here, but I tire of project managers who
                         won't own their decisions or failures.


           Aspiring to Responsibility Expectations
           Project managers need to aspire to responsibility. The details of the responsibility aspi-
           rations for this section of the Code of Ethics and Professional Conduct include the
           following:

                * Make good decisions that affect the best interests of society, public safety, and
                  the environment.
                * Accept only assignments that mesh with our background, experience, skills,
                  and qualifications.
                * Deliver on our promises.
                * Take ownership and accountability of our errors and omissions, and make
                  quick and accurate corrections. Should we discover errors and omissions
                  caused by others, communicate with the appropriate people as soon as the
                  errors are discovered.
                * Protect proprietary and confidential information. No gossiping or blabbing.
                * Uphold the Code of Ethics and Professional Conduct, and hold others
                  accountable to it as well.

              Remember, these are aspirations of the responsibility portion of the Code of Ethics
           and Professional Conduct. There are going to be tough instances, mutually exclusive
           decisions, and scenarios that will call these aspirations into question.

           Adhering to Mandatory Standards
           There are regulations, laws, contracts, and other mandatory requirements that proj-
           ect managers have to deal with in their projects. This section acknowledges those
           requirements. Let's have a look at what the Code of Ethics and Professional Conduct
           calls for:
                                       Appendix C: Understanding the Code of Ethics and Professional Conduct

                                                                                                       421
     * Project managers have a mandatory responsibility to adhere to regulatory
       requirements and laws.
     * Project managers have a mandatory responsibility to report unethical or illegal
       conduct to management and to those affected by such conduct.
     * Project managers are required to bring valid, fact-driven violations of the Code
       of Ethics and Professional Conduct to PMI for resolution.
     * Disciplinary action should commence for project managers who seek to
       retaliate against a person raising ethic-violations concerns.

    Project managers must adhere to these points and agree to participate in them in
their roles in the project management community.




                                                                                                               PART III
Chapter Three: Adhering to the Respect Value
Rodney Dangerfield always quipped, "I can't get any respect." And Aretha Franklin
sang, "R-E-S-P-E-C-T" in the movie The Blues Brothers. Okay, that may have been a
stretch, but how many times in a project management book are you going to see Aretha
Franklin and Rodney Dangerfield?
    My point is that both of these performers were talking about the same thing: the
admiration and reverence they believed they deserved from their peers. Respect in the
PMI Code of Ethics and Professional Conduct centers not only on the respect we may
deserve as project managers, but also on the respect that others are due through their
work and contributions to our projects. Respect in project management is also aimed at
our respect for the environment we operate within.


Aspiring to Respect
There are four aspiration standards for respect:

     * We learn about the norms and customs of others, and avoid behavior that
       others may find disrespectful.
     * We listen to others and seek to understand their points of view and opinions.
     * We don't avoid people who we have conflicts or disagreements with; rather,
       we approach them in an attempt to resolve our differences.
     * We always conduct ourselves professionally, even when those we deal with
       do not.

  According to PMI, respect among individuals and towards the environment pro-
motes trust and confidence.
CAPM/PMP Project Management Certification All-in-One Exam Guide
422
           Adhering to the Mandatory Values of Respect
           As project managers, we demand four things from ourselves and fellow project man-
           agers regarding respect. Here's what the Code of Ethics and Professional Conduct
           details:

                * Our negotiations are always in good faith.
                * We don't influence decisions for personal gain at the expense of others.
                * We do not behave in an abusive manner toward others.
                * We respect the property rights of others.

              These four values are mandatory for PMI participants. Obviously, the project man-
           ager is to "take the high road" in dealings with clients and stakeholders.


           Chapter Four: Adhering to the Fairness Value
           Ever hear the phrase, "All's fair in love and war?" Or how about, "Life just isn't fair?"
           Sure you have. So what is fairness? Do we need the wisdom of King Solomon to know
           what's fair? Is fairness different from what's just? These are the types of questions the
           PMI Code of Ethics and Professional Conduct hopes for us to ask of ourselves and one
           another.
               Fairness, according to the code, is the duty to make decisions and act impartially
           and objectively. Our behavior as project managers is to be void of competing self-inter-
           ests, prejudice, and favoritism. Sounds wonderfully complex, doesn't it?


           Aspiring to Fairness
           According to the Code of Ethics and Professional Conduct, there are four things that we
           are to aspire to in the realm of fairness:

                * Demonstrate transparency in our decision-making.
                * Constantly reexamine our impartiality and objectivity, and take corrective
                  actions when appropriate.
                * Provide equal access to information to those who are authorized to have it.
                * Make opportunities equally available to all qualified candidates.

               These are lofty aspirations, even for project managers. The goal, no doubt, is to
           establish these points as characteristics that we should strive towards in our day-to-day
           lives.
                                        Appendix C: Understanding the Code of Ethics and Professional Conduct

                                                                                                        423
Adhering to the Mandatory Standards on Fairness
There are five values that PMI participants must adhere to on fairness. Two of the stan-
dards apply to conflict-of-interest scenarios, while the remaining three center on favor-
itism and discrimination. As project managers, we are to:

     * Fully disclose any real or potential conflict of interest.
     * Refrain from participating in any decision where a real or potential conflict of
       interest exists until we've disclosed the situation, have an approved mitigation
       plan, and have the consent of the project stakeholders to proceed.
     * Don't hire or fire, reward or punish, or award or deny contracts based on
       personal considerations, such as favoritism, nepotism, or bribery.
     * Don't discriminate against others on things such as race, gender, age, religion,




                                                                                                                PART III
       disability, nationality, or sexual orientation.
     * Always apply the rules of the organization (the organization being our employer,
       PMI, or other performing organization), without favoritism or prejudice.

    I think it's safe to say in regards to these requirements that if we follow the rules of
our employers, the laws of our country, and the calling voice of our conscience, we'll be
on the right track.


Chapter Five: Adhering to Honesty
Honesty is being truthful in our conversations and in our actions. This means that we,
as project managers, don't over-promise, give dates that we know are bad, or sandbag
our budgets and deliverables. We do what we say and we say what's truthful. Like the
other values in the Code of Ethics and Professional Conduct, honesty has both aspiring
and mandatory standards.

Aspiring to Honesty
According to the Code of Ethics and Professional Conduct, there are five traits of hon-
esty that we should aspire to:

     * Seek to understand the truth.
     * Be truthful in communications and conduct.
     * Provide accurate and timely information.
     * Provide commitments and promises in good faith.
     * Strive to create an environment in which others feel safe to tell the truth.
CAPM/PMP Project Management Certification All-in-One Exam Guide
424
               These five aspirations, I think, are noble. As project managers, we are often in a
           rapid-paced, get-the-work-done environment, and allot time to get the work done.
           These five aspirations cause us to pause and reflect on what's honest and truthful in our
           communications to project team members, stakeholders, and ourselves.


           Adhering to the Honesty Requirements
           There are just two mandatory standards for honesty in the Code of Ethics and Profes-
           sional Conduct:

                * Do not engage in or condone behavior that is designed to mislead
                  others; this includes, but is not limited to:
                   * Creating misleading statements
                   * Creating false statements
                   * Stating half-truths
                   * Providing information that is out of context
                   * Withholding information that, if known, would render our
                     statements false
                * Do not engage in dishonest behavior with the intention of personal
                  gain at the expense of others.

               Basically, as project managers, we don't lie. We are required, according to the code,
           to tell the truth, regardless of the impact it may have on us, our project team, or our
           projects. How many project managers do you know who are living by this requirement
           already?


           Key Terms
           Abusive manner Treating others with conduct that may result in harm, fear, hu-
           miliation, manipulation, or exploitation. For example, berating a project team mem-
           ber because he or she has taken longer than expected to complete a project assign-
           ment may be considered humiliation.
           Conflict of interest A situation in which a project manager may have two compet-
           ing duties of loyalty. For example, purchasing software from a relative may benefit the
           relative, but it may do harm to the performing organization.
           Duty of loyalty A project manager's responsibility to be loyal to another person,
           organization, or vendor. For example, a project manager has a duty of loyalty to pro-
           mote the best interests of an employer rather than the best interests of a vendor.

ample, a program manager is considered to be a project practitioner under this defi-
nition.

           Troubleshooting
           This software runs inside of your Internet browser. You must have its preferences set for
           correct playback of Flash files. The Flashplayer installer (free download from www
           .adobe.com/products/flashplayer/) may not change all of your file helpers properly.
                After installing Flash, if the video takes a very long time to load or doesn't load at
           all, verify that your browser associates the file type .swf with the Flash Player plug-in. To
           verify this, do the following:

                * If using Internet Explorer for Windows, go to Tools | Internet Options |
                  Advanced | Multimedia or Control Panels | FlashPlayer.
                * If using Internet Explorer for Macintosh, go to Preferences | Receiving Files |
                  Helpers.

 8/80 Rule A planning heuristic for creating the work breakdown structure (WBS).
 This rule states that the work package in a WBS must take no more than 80 hours of
 labor to create and no less than 8 hours of labor to create.

 Acceptance A risk response appropriate for both positive and negative risks, but
 often used for smaller risks within a project. The acknowledgement of a risk without
 taking any actions towards avoidance, transference, or mitigation.

 Acknowledgement The receiver signals that a message has been received; an ac-
 knowledgement shows receipt of the message, but not necessarily agreement with the
 message.

 Active listening The receiver confirms that the message is being received through
 feedback, questions, prompts for clarity, and other signs of confirmation.

 Activity list The primary output of decomposing the WBS's work packages.

 Actual cost (AC)            The actual amount of monies the project has spent to date.

 Administrative closure The documentation of the closing process participants,
 their roles, responsibilities, and timings. The second part of administrative closure col-
 lects all of the project records, the lessons learned, and communications for the project
 archives.

 Alternative identification A scope definition process of finding alternative so-
 lutions for the project customer while considering the customer's satisfaction, cost of
 the solution, and how the customer may use the product in operations.

           Analogous estimating A somewhat unreliable estimating approach that re-
           lies on historical information to predict what current activity durations should
           be. Analogous estimating is more reliable, however, than team member recollections.
           Analogous estimating is also known as top-down estimating and is a form of expert
           judgment.

           Application area The area of expertise, industry, or function where a project is
           centered. Examples include architecture, IT, health care, or manufacturing.

           Assumption A belief that may or may not be true within a project. Weather is an
           example of an assumption in construction projects.

           Authority power Project team members may have authority over other project
           team members, have the ability to make decisions, and even sign approvals for project
           work and purchases.

           Avoidance A risk response to avoid the risk; sometimes called a workaround.

           Balanced matrix structure An organization where organizational resources
           are pooled into one project team, but the functional managers and the project manag-
           ers share the project power.

           Benchmarking Comparing any two similar entities to measure their perfor-
           mance.

           Benefit/cost ratio (BCR) model This is an example of a benefits comparison
           model. It examines the cost-to-benefit ratio.

           Bid From seller to buyer. Price is the determining factor in the decision-making
           process.

           Bidder conference A meeting of all of the project's potential vendors to clarify
           the contract statement of work and the details of the contracted work.

           Bottom-up estimating The most accurate time- and cost-estimating approach a
           project manager can use. This estimating approach starts at "the bottom" of the project
           and considers every activity, its predecessor and successor activities, and the exact
           amount of resources needed to complete each activity.

           Brainstorming The most common approach to risk identification; usually com-
           pleted as a project team with subject matter experts to identify the risks within the
           project.
                                                                                           Glossary

                                                                                              433
Budget estimate This estimate is also somewhat broad and is used early in the
planning processes and also in top-down estimates. The range of variance for the esti-
mate can be from -10 percent to +25 percent.

Business risks These risks may have a negative or positive outcome. Examples in-
clude using a less experienced worker to complete a task, allowing phases or activities
to overlap, or foregoing the expense of formal training for on-the-job education.

Cardinal scale A ranking approach to identify the probability and impact on a
numerical value from .01 (very low) to 1.0 (certain).

Cause-and-effect diagram This diagram shows the relationships between the
variables within a process and how those relationships may contribute to inadequate
quality. This diagram can help organize both the process and team opinions, as well as
generate discussion on finding a solution to ensure quality.

Certified associate in project management (CAPM) A person who has
slightly less project management experience than a PMP but has qualified for and then
passed the CAPM examination.

Change control board (CCB) A committee that evaluates the worthiness of a
proposed change before it is approved.

Change control system (CCS) The change control system communicates the
process for controlling changes to the project deliverables. This system works with
the configuration management system and seeks to control and document proposals
to the project's product.

Change request        A documented request to add to or remove from the project
scope.

Checklist A simple approach to ensure that work is completed according to the
quality policy; also considered to be a quick and cost-effective risk identification ap-
proach.

Choice of media The best modality to use when communicating that is relevant to
the information that's being communicated.

Claims These are disagreements between the buyer and the seller, usually centering
on a change, who did the change, and even if a change has occurred. Claims are also
called disputes and appeals, and are monitored and controlled through the project in
accordance with the contract terms.

           Closing process group The project management process group that contains the
           activities to close out a project and project contracts.

           Code of accounts A hierarchical numbering system for each item in the WBS. The
           PMBOK is a good example of a code of accounts, as each chapter and its subheadings
           follow a logical numbering scheme. For example, PMBOK 5.3.3.2 identifies an exact
           paragraph in the PMBOK.

           Coercive power The project manager has the authority to discipline the project
           team members. This is also known as penalty power.

           Collective bargaining agreement constraints Contracts and agreements
           with unions or other employee groups may serve as constraints for the project.

           Commercial database A cost-estimating approach that uses a database, typically
           software-driven, to create the cost estimate for a project.

           Communication assumption Anything that the project management team be-
           lieves to be true but hasn't proven to be true. For example, the project management
           team may assume that all of the project team can be reached via cell phone, but there
           are parts of the world, as of this writing, that don't have a cell signal.

           Communication barrier                Anything that prohibits communication from oc-
           curring.

           Communication channel formula N(N-1)/2, where N represents the number
           of identified stakeholders. This formula reveals the total number of communication
           channels within a project.

           Communication constraints Anything that limits the project management
           team's options. Geographical locales, incompatible communications software, or
           even limited communications technology are all examples of communication con-
           straints.

           Communications management plan A project management subsidiary plan
           that defines the stakeholders that need specific information, the person who will sup-
           ply the information, the schedule for the information to be supplied, and the approved
           modality to provide the information.

           Competency This attribute defines what talents, skills, and capacity are needed to
           complete the project work.
                                                                                        Glossary

                                                                                           435
Composite structure An organization that creates a blend of the functional, ma-
trix, and projectized structures.

Compromising This approach requires that both parties give up something.

Confidentiality The privacy allotted to customers and stakeholders regarding the
terms, conditions, and circumstances within a project.

Configuration identification This includes the labeling of the components,
how changes are made to the product, and the accountability of these changes.

Configuration management system This system defines how stakeholders
are allowed to submit change requests, the conditions for approving a change request,
and how approved change requests are validated in the project scope. Configuration
management also documents the characteristics and functions of the project's products
and any changes to a product's characteristics.

Configuration status accounting The organization of the product materials,
details, and prior product documentation.

Configuration verification and auditing The scope verification and auditing
of completeness of project or phase deliverables to ensure that they are in alignment
with the project plan.

Conflict of interest An ethical dilemma in which a project manager could affect
a project decision for personal gain rather than in the best interest of the project.

Constraint A condition, rule, or procedure that restricts a project manager's op-
tions. A project deadline is an example of a constraint.

Contingency reserve This is a contingency allowance to account for overruns in
costs. The contingency allowances are used at the project manager's discretion, with
management's approval, to counteract cost overruns for schedule activities.

Contract A contract is a formal agreement between the buyer and the seller. Con-
tracts can be oral or written--although written is preferred.

Contract change control system This defines the procedures for how
the contract may be changed. The process for changing the contract includes the
forms; documented communications; tracking; conditions within the project,
business, or marketplace that justify the needed change; dispute resolution proce-
CAPM/PMP Project Management Certification All-in-One Exam Guide
436
           dures; and the procedures for getting the changes approved within the performing
           organization.

           Contract closure The formal verification of the contract's completeness by the
           vendor and the performing organization.

           Contract statement of work (SOW) This document requires that the seller
           fully describe the work to be completed and/or the product to be supplied. The SOW
           becomes part of the contract between the buyer and the seller.

           Control account A WBS entry that considers the time, cost, and scope measure-
           ments for that deliverable within the WBS. The estimated performance is compared
           against the actual performance to measure overall performance for the deliverables
           within that control account. The specifics of a control account are documented in a
           control account plan.

           Control chart         A quality control chart that maps the performance of project work
           overtime.

           Corrective action           A corrective action brings project work back into alignment
           with the project plan.

           Cost aggregation Costs are parallel to each WBS work package. The costs of each
           work package are aggregated to their corresponding control accounts. Each control ac-
           count is then aggregated to the sum of the project costs.

           Cost baseline A time-lapse exposure of when the project's monies are to be spent
           in relation to cumulative values of the work completed in the project. The aggregation
           of the project deliverables and their associated costs. The difference between the cost
           estimates and the actual cost of the project identifies the cost variance.

           Cost budgeting The cost aggregation achieved by assigning specific dollar amounts
           for each of the scheduled activities or, more likely, each of the work packages in the
           WBS. Cost budgeting applies the cost estimates over time.

           Cost change control system A system that examines any changes associated
           with scope changes, the cost of materials, or the cost of any other resources and their
           associated impact on the overall project cost.

           Cost management plan This plan details how the project costs will be planned
           for, estimated, budgeted, and then monitored and controlled.
                                                                                           Glossary

                                                                                              437
Cost of poor quality The monies spent to recover from not adhering to the cost
of quality. Examples may include rework, defect repair, loss of life or limb because
safety precautions were not taken, loss of sales, and loss of customers.

Cost of quality The monies spent to ascertain the expected level of quality within
a project. Examples include training, testing, and safety precautions.

Cost performance index Measures the project based on its financial perfor-
mance. The formula is CPI = EV/AC.

Cost plus fixed fee contract A contract that requires the buyer to pay for the
cost of the goods and services procured plus a fixed fee for the contracted work. The
buyer assumes the risk of a cost overrun.

Cost plus incentive fee A contract type that requires the buyer to pay a cost for
the procured work plus an incentive fee, or a bonus, for the work if terms and condi-
tions are met.

Cost plus percentage of costs A contract that requires the buyer to pay for the
costs of the goods and services procured plus a percentage of the costs. The buyer as-
sumes all of the risks for cost overruns.

Cost reporting system           A system to record the actual costs of the project ac-
tivities.

Cost variance The difference between the earned value amount and the cumula-
tive actual costs of the project. The formula is CV = EV-AC.

Cost-benefit analysis A process to study the tradeoffs between costs and the
benefits realized from those costs.

Crashing A schedule compression approach that adds more resources to activities
on the critical path to complete the project earlier. When crashing a project, costs are
added as the labor expenses increase.

Critical chain method (CCM) A network analysis approach in which the dead-
lines associated with individual tasks are removed and the only date that matters is the
promised due date of the project deliverable. CCM works to modify the project sched-
ule based on the availability of project resources rather than on the pure sequence of
events, as in the critical path method.
CAPM/PMP Project Management Certification All-in-One Exam Guide
438
           Critical path method The path in the project network diagram that cannot be
           delayed or the project completion date will be late. There can be more than one critical
           path. Activities in the critical path have no float.

           Cultural and social environment Defines how a project affects people and
           how those people may affect the project. Cultural and social environments include the
           economic, educational, ethical, religious, demographic, and ethic composition of
           the people affected by the project.

           Customer/user The person(s) who will use the project's deliverables.

           Data precision The consideration of the risk ranking in light of the biased nature
           of the ranking, the accuracy of the data submitted, and the reliability of the nature sub-
           mitted to examine the risk scores. The precision of the risk data is considered when
           weighing the risk score.

           Decision tree A method to determine which of two or more decisions is the best
           one. The decision tree model examines the cost and benefits of each decision's outcome
           and weighs the probability of success for each of the decisions.

           Decoder The device that decodes the message as it is being received.

           Defect repair        The activity to repair a defect within the project.

           Definitive estimate This estimate type is one of the most accurate. It's used late
           in the planning processes and is associated with bottom-up estimating. You need the
           WBS in order to create the definitive estimate. The range of variance for the estimate can
           be from -5 percent to +10 percent.

           Deliverable A product, service, or result created by a project. Projects can have mul-
           tiple deliverables.

           Delphi Technique The Delphi Technique is an anonymous method to query ex-
           perts about foreseeable risks within a project, phase, or component of a project. The
           results of the survey are analyzed by a third party, organized, and then circulated to the
           experts. There can be several rounds of anonymous discussion with the Delphi Tech-
           nique without fear of backlash or offending other participants in the process. The goal
           is to gain consensus on project risks within the project.

           Design of experiments An approach that relies on statistical scenarios to deter-
           mine what variables within a project will result in the best outcome.
                                                                                            Glossary

                                                                                               439
Direct costs These are costs incurred by the project in order for the project to exist.
Examples include equipment needed to complete the project work, salaries of the proj-
ect team, and other expenses tied directly to the project's existence.

Discretionary dependencies These dependencies are the preferred order of ac-
tivities. Project managers should use these relationships at their "discretion" and docu-
ment the logic behind the decision. Discretionary dependencies allow activities to hap-
pen in a preferred order because of best practices, conditions unique to the project
work, or external events.

Early finish The earliest that a project activity can finish. Used in the forward pass
procedure to discover the critical path and the project float.

Early start The earliest that a project activity can begin. Used in the forward pass
procedure to discover the critical path and the project float.

Earned value (EV) Earned value is the physical work completed to date and the
authorized budget for that work. It is the percentage of the budget at completion (BAC)
that represents the actual work completed in the project.

Effective listening The receiver is involved in the listening experience by paying
attention to visual clues from the speaker and paralingual characteristics, and by asking
relevant questions.

Encoder The device that encodes the message to be sent.

Enhancing A risk response that attempts to enhance the conditions to ensure that a
positive risk event will likely happen.

Enterprise environmental factors Any external or internal organizational
factors that can affect a project's success. Enterprise environmental factors include the
culture, organizational structure, resources, commercial databases the project will use,
market conditions, and your project management software.

Estimate at completion (EAC) These forecasting formulas predict the likely
completed costs of the project based on current scenarios within the project.

Estimate to complete (ETC) An earned value management formula that pre-
dicts how much funding the project will require to be completed. There are three varia-
tions of this formula, all based on conditions the project may be experiencing.
CAPM/PMP Project Management Certification All-in-One Exam Guide

           Executing process group The project management process group that pro-
           vides the activities to carry out the project management plan to complete the project
           work.

           Expectancy theory The expectancy theory states that people will behave based
           on what they expect as a result of their behavior. In other words, people will work in
           relation to the expected reward of the work.

           Expected monetary value (EMV) The monetary value of a risk exposure based
           on the risk's probability and impact in the risk matrix. This approach is typically used
           in quantitative risk analysis, as it quantifies the risk exposure.

           Expert power The project manager's authority comes from experience with the
           technology the project focuses on and from expertise managing projects.

           Exploit     A risk response that takes advantage of the positive risks within a project.

           External dependencies These are dependencies outside of the project's control.
           Examples include the delivery of equipment from a vendor; the deliverable of another
           project; or the decision of a committee, lawsuit, or expected new law.

           External quality assurance (QA)                 Assurance provided to the external custom-
           ers of the project.

           External risks These risks are outside of the project but directly affect it. Legal
           issues, labor issues, a shift in project priorities, and weather are all examples of ex-
           ternal risks. Force majeure risks call for disaster recovery rather than project manage-
           ment. These are risks caused by earthquakes, tornados, floods, civil unrest, and oth-
           er disasters.

           Fast tracking A schedule compression method that changes the relationship of
           activities. With fast tracking, activities that would normally be done in sequence are
           allowed to be done in parallel or with some overlap. Fast tracking can be accom-
           plished by changing the relationship of activities from finish-to-start (FS) to start-to-
           start (SS) or by adding lead time to downstream activities. Fast tracking adds risk to
           the project.

           Feedback The sender confirms that the receiver understands the message by di-
           rectly asking for a response, questions for clarification, or other confirmation.

           Finish-to-finish (FF) An activity relationship type that requires the current activ-
           ity to finish before its successor can finish.
                                                                                            Glossary

                                                                                               441
Finish-to-start (FS) An activity relationship type that requires the current activity
to finish before its successor can start.

Fixed costs Costs that remain constant throughout the project (the cost of a piece
of rented equipment for the project, the cost of a consultant brought on to the project,
and so on).

Fixed-price contracts Also known as firm fixed-price and lump-sum con-
tracts, these are agreements that define a total price for the product the seller is to
provide.

Flowchart A diagram illustrating how components within a system are related.
A flowchart shows the relationship between components and also helps the project
team determine where quality issues may be present and, once done, plan accord-
ingly.

Force majeure An "act of God" that may have a negative impact on the project;
consider fire, hurricanes, tornados, and earthquakes.

Forcing power       The person with the power makes the decision.

Formal power The project manager has been assigned this role by senior manage-
ment and is in charge of the project.

Fragnet A representation of a project network diagram that is often used for out-
sourced portions of a project, repetitive work within a project, or a subproject. Also
called a subnet.

Free float This is the total time a single activity can be delayed without delaying the
early start of any successor activities.

Functional analysis This is the study of the functions within a system, project,
or--what's more likely in the project scope statement--the product the project will be
creating. Functional analysis studies the goals of the product, how the product will
be used, and the expectations the customer has for the product once it leaves the project
and moves into operations. Functional analysis may also consider the cost of the prod-

Functional structure An organization is divided by function, and each employ-
ee has one clear functional manager. Each department acts independently of the other
departments. A project manager in this structure has little to no power and may be
called a project coordinator.

work to determine if the project deliverables are adhering to the quality expectations.

Quality management plan This plan defines what quality means for the project,
how the project will achieve quality, and how the project will map to organizational
procedures pertaining to quality.

Quality metrics The operational definitions that define the measurements within
a project and the expected targets for quality and performance.

Quality planning The process of first determining which quality standards are
relevant to your project and then finding out what the best methods are of adhering to
those quality standards.

Quantitative risk analysis A risk analysis approach that attempts to numer-
ically assess the probability and impact of the identified risks. Quantitative risk
analysis also creates an overall risk score for the project. This method is more in-
depth than qualitative risk analysis and relies on several different tools to accom-
plish its goal.

Quotation From seller to buyer. Price is the determining factor in the decision-
making process.

RACI chart A RACI chart is another matrix chart that only uses the activities of re-
sponsible, accountable, consult, and inform.

RAG rating An ordinal scale that uses red, amber, and green to capture the proba-
bility, impact, and risk score. The first letter of red, amber, and green equate to "RAG"
in the system.

Receiver This is the person who receives the message.

Referent The project team personally knows the project manager. Referent can also
mean the project manager refers to the person who assigned him or her the position.

           Refinement An update to the WBS.

           Regression analysis This is a statistical approach to predict what future values
           may be based on historical values. Regression analysis creates quantitative predictions
           based on variables within one value to predict variables in another. This form of esti-
           mating relies solely on pure statistical math to reveal relationships between variables
           and to predict future values.

           Request for proposal (RFP) From buyer to seller. Requests the seller to provide
           a proposal to complete the procured work or to provide the procured product.

           Request for quote (RFQ) From buyer to seller. Requests the seller to provide a
           price for the procured product or service.

           Reserve analysis Cost reserves for unknown unknowns within a project. The con-
           tingency reserve is not part of the project's cost baseline, but is included as part of the
           project budget.

           Residual risks These are risks that are expected to remain after a risk response.

           Resource breakdown structure (RBS) This hierarchical chart can decom-
           pose the project by the types of resources used throughout it.

           Resource calendar Resources are people and things like equipment, rooms, and
           other facilities. This calendar defines when the resources are available to contribute to
           the project.

           Resource-leveling heuristic A method to flatten the schedule when resources
           are overallocated. Resource leveling can be applied using different methods to accom-
           plish different goals. One of the most common methods is to ensure that workers are
           not overextended on activities.

           Responsibility A responsibility is the work that a role performs.

           Responsibility assignment matrix (RAM) A RAM chart shows the correla-
           tion between project team members and the work they've been assigned to complete.

           Reward       The project manager has the authority to reward the project team.

           Risk A project risk is an uncertain event or condition that can have a positive or
           negative impact on the project.
                                                                                             Glossary

                                                                                                455
Risk identification The systematic process of combing through the project, the
project plan, the WBS, and all supporting documentation to identify as many of the
risks that may affect the project as possible.

Risk management plan A subsidiary project management plan that defines how
risks will be identified, analyzed, responded to, and monitored within the project. The
plan also defines the iterative risk management process the project is expected to ad-
here to.

Risk management planning The agreed-upon approach to the management of
the project risk processes.

Risk owners The individuals or entities that are responsible for monitoring and
responding to an identified risk within the project.

Risk register The risk register is a project plan component that contains all of
the information related to the risk management activities. It's updated as risk man-
agement activities are conducted to reflect the status, progress, and nature of the
project risks.

Risk-related contractual agreements When the project management team
decides to use risk response transference, a risk-related contractual agreement is created
between the buyer and the seller.

Risk response audit          An audit to test the validity of the established risk re-
sponses.

Risk responsibility       The level of ownership an individual or entity has over a proj-
ect risk.

Risk score The calculated score based on each risk's probability and impact. The
approach can be used in both qualitative and quantitative risk matrixes.

Role This person is responsible for a specific portion of the project. Roles are usually
tied to job titles, such as network engineer, mechanical engineer, or electrician.

Rolling wave planning The imminent work is planned in detail, while the future
work is planned at a high level. This is a form of progressive elaboration.

Root-cause identification Root-cause identification aims to find out why a risk
event may be occurring, the causal factors for the risk events, and then, eventually, how
the events can be mitigated or eliminated.

           Rough order of magnitude This estimate is "rough" and is used during the
           initiating processes and in top-down estimates. The range of variance for the estimate
           can be from -25 percent to +75 percent.

           Rule of Seven The components of a control chart that illustrate the results of
           seven measurements on one side of the mean that are considered "out of control" in
           the project.

           Run chart A quality control tool that shows the results of inspection in the order in
           which they've occurred. The goals of a run chart are to first demonstrate the results of a
           process over time and then use trend analysis to predict when certain trends may re-
           emerge.

           Scatter diagram A quality control tool that tracks the relationship between two
           variables over time. The two variables are considered related the closer they track against
           a diagonal line.

           Schedule baseline The expected timeline of the project; the difference between
           the planned schedule and the experienced schedule reveals schedule variances within
           the project.

           Schedule management plan Defines how the project schedule will be created
           and managed.

           Schedule performance index (SPI) A measurement of the project based on its
           schedule performance. The formula is SPI = EV/PV.

           Schedule variance (SV) The difference between the earned value (EV) and the
           planned value (PV). The formula is SV = EV-PV.

           Scheduled milestones The project customer may have specified set dates when
           phases of the project should be completed. These scheduled milestones are often treat-
           ed as project constraints.

           Scope baseline The sum of the project deliverables; the WBS is often called the
           project scope baseline. Differences between the WBS and what is created are scope vari-
           ances.

           Scope creep Undocumented, unapproved changes to the project scope.

           Scope verification The formal inspection of the project deliverables that leads to
           project acceptance.
                                                                                            Glossary

                                                                                               457
Scoring models These models use a common set of values for all of the projects up
for selection. For example, values can be profitability, complexity, customer demand,
and so on.

Screening system A screening system is a tool that filters, or screens out, vendors
that don't qualify for the contract.

Secondary risks These are new risks that are created as a result of a risk response.

Seller rating system This is used by an organization to rate prior experience with
each vendor that it has worked with in the past. The seller rating system can track per-
formance, quality ratings, delivery, and even contract compliance.

Sender This is the person who wants to send a message.

Sender-receiver models Feedback loops and barriers to communications.

Sensitivity analysis A quantitative risk analysis tool that examines each risk to
determine which one has the largest impact on the project's success.

Sharing     A risk response that shares the advantages of a positive risk within a
project.

Single source Many vendors can provide what your project needs to purchase, but
you prefer to work with a specific vendor.

Smoothing This approach smoothes out the conflict by minimizing the perceived
size of the problem. It is a temporary solution, but can calm down team relations and
boisterous discussions.

Soft logic The order of the activities doesn't necessarily have to happen in a specific
order. For example, you could install the light fixtures first, then the carpet, and then
paint the room. The project manager could use soft logic to change the order of the
activities if he or she desired.

Sole source Only one vendor can provide what your project needs to pur-
chase. Examples include a specific consultant, specialized service, or unique type
of material.

Staffing management plan A subsidiary plan of the project management plan
that defines staff acquisition, timetables, release criteria, training needs, reward and
recognition system, compliance issues, and safety concerns for the project.
CAPM/PMP Project Management Certification All-in-One Exam Guide

           Stakeholder analysis A scope definition process whereby the project manage-
           ment team interviews the stakeholders and categorizes, prioritizes, and documents
           what the project customer wants and needs. Stakeholder analysis demands quantifica-
           tion of stakeholder objectives; goals such as "good," "satisfaction," and "speedy" aren't
           quantifiable.

           Stakeholder notifications Notices to the stakeholders about resolved issues,
           approved changes, and the overall health of the project.

           Start-to-finish (SF) An activity relationship that requires an activity to start so
           that its successor may finish. This is the most unusual of all the activity relationship
           types.

           Start-to-start (SS) An activity relationship type that requires the current activity
           to start before its successor may start.

           Statistical sampling A process of choosing a percentage of results at random. For
           example, a project creating a medical device may have 20 percent of all units randomly
           selected to check for quality.

           Status review meeting A regularly scheduled meeting to discuss the status of the
           project and its progress towards completing the project scope statement.

           Strong matrix structure An organization where organizational resources are
           pooled into one project team, but the functional managers have less project power than
           the project manager.

           Subnet A representation of a project network diagram that is often used for out-
           sourced portions of project, repetitive work within a project, or a subproject. Also called
           a fragnet.

           Subproject A smaller project managed within a larger, parent project. Subprojects
           are often contracted work whose deliverable allows the larger project to progress. The
           electrical wiring of a new building is a subproject of the parent project--the actual con-
           struction of the new building.

           Sunk costs Monies that have already been invested in a project.

           SWOT analysis SWOT analysis is the process of examining the project from the
           perspective of four characteristics (strengths, weaknesses, opportunities, and threats).
                                                                                           Glossary

                                                                                              459
System engineering This project scope statement creation process studies how
a system should work, designs and creates a system model, and then enacts the work-
ing system based on the project's goals and the customer's expectations. System engi-
neering aims to balance the time and cost of the project in relation to the project's
scope.

System or process flowcharts These flowcharts illustrate the flow of a process
through a system, such as a project change request through the change control system
or a work authorization through a quality control process.

Systems analysis A scope definition approach that studies and analyzes a system,
its components, and the relationship of the components within the system.

Technical interfaces The project team identifies the disciplines and specialties
that the project will require to complete the project scope statement. The technical in-
terfaces are the resources that will be doing the project work.

Technical, quality, or performance risks Technical risks are associated with
new, unproven, or complex technologies being used on the project. Changes to the
technology during the project implementation can also be a risk. Quality risks are the
levels set for expectations of impractical quality and performance.

Template A previous project that can be adapted for the current project.

Three-point estimate An estimating technique for each activity that requires an
optimistic, most likely, and pessimistic estimate be created. Based on these three esti-
mates, an average can be created to predict how long each activity should take.

Time and materials contract A contract type in which the buyer pays for the
time and materials for the procured work. This is a simple contract, usually used for
smaller procurement conditions. These contract types require a not-to-exceed (NTE)
clause, or the buyer assumes the risk for cost overruns.

Time reporting system A system to record the actual time spent to complete
project activities.

Total float This is the total time an activity can be delayed without delaying the
project's completion.
CAPM/PMP Project Management Certification All-in-One Exam Guide

           Transference A risk response that transfers the ownership of the risk to another
           party. Insurance, warranties, a licensed contractor, or other project teams are good ex-
           amples of transference. There is typically a fee and contractual relationship involved
           with the transference of the risk.

           Trend analysis The science of taking past results to predict future performance.

           Triple Constraints of Project Management Also known as the Iron Tri-
           angle. This theory posits that time, cost, and scope are three constraints that every
           project has.

           Value analysis Like value engineering, this approach examines the functions of
           the project's product in relation to the cost of the features and functions. This is
           where, to some extent, the grade of the product is in relationship to the cost of the
           product.

           Value engineering This project scope statement creation approach attempts
           to find the correct level of quality in relation to a reasonable budget for the proj-
           ect deliverable while still achieving an acceptable level of performance for the
           product.

           Variable costs These are costs that change, depending on the conditions applied
           in the project (the number of meeting participants, the supply and demand of materi-
           als, and so on).

           Variance The difference between what was expected and was experienced.

           Variance at completion (VAC) A forecasting formula that predicts how much
           of a variance the project will likely have based on current conditions within the project.
           The formula is VAC = BAC-EAC.

           WBS dictionary A WBS companion document that defines all of the characteris-
           tics of each element within the WBS.

           WBS template A prepopulated WBS for repetitive projects. A previous project's
           WBS is often used as a WBS template for current similar projects.

           Weak matrix structure An organization in which organizational resources are
           pooled into one project team, but the functional managers have more project power
           than the project manager.
                                                                                            Glossary

                                                                                               461
Weighting system A system that takes out the personal preferences of the decision
maker in the organization to ensure that the best seller is awarded the contract. Weights
are assigned to the values of the proposals, and each proposal is scored.

Withdrawal This conflict resolution method has one side of the argument walking
away from the problem, usually in disgust.

Work breakdown structure (WBS)                A deliverables-orientated decomposition
of the project scope.

Work package The smallest item in the WBS.

Work performance information The results of the project work as needed.
This includes technical performance measures, project status, information on what the
project has created to date, corrective actions, and performance reports.

Workaround An immediate response to a negative risk within the project. This is
an example of a corrective action.
