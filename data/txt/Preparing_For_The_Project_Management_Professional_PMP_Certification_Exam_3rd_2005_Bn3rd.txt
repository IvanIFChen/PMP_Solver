T
       his book has been written to help those preparing for the Project Management
       Professional Examination. It is aimed at those who want to learn project manage-
       ment methodology. It is not intended to be a drill in exam questions; there are
more than enough of those around. It is intended to cover all of the material that the
Project Management Institute (PMI) considers important enough to be included in the
exam. This book has been revised to reflect the changes in the Project Management
Professional Examination put into effect as of the third quarter of 2005 and reflects the
Guide to the Project Management Body of Knowledge, Third (2004) Edition.
      I have been working in the field of project management for the past thirty years and
was managing projects long before that and long before there was a methodology called
project management. Once I began to consider project management as a profession and
a disciplined methodology, it became clear to me what had gone wrong with some of my
projects in the past.
      From that point on I began applying the tools and techniques of project manage-
ment, and slowly the unification and completeness of the methodology became clear.
Project management works as a unified body of knowledge, but all of the tools and
techniques depend on one another to succeed. You cannot do a good job of cost estimat-
ing if you have not developed a good set of deliverables for the project any more than
you can produce a good schedule without taking the time necessary to develop good
estimates of the task durations.
      If you practice project management using the methodology outlined in this book
and the Project Management Institute's Guide to the Project Management Body of Knowl-
edge, you will become a good project manager. Learning project management is more
than studying a book or even a group of books. Project management must also be learned
in the field with experience and exposure to real responsibility on real projects. The
Project Management Professional (PMP) certification is designed to certify project man-
agers who meet the criteria for both knowledge and experience. To qualify for certification
you must have both. PMI requires that you have at least 4,500 hours of experience if you
have a bachelor's degree. Some of this experience must extend past more than the last
three years, but not more than past the last six years. There is also a criterion for people
not holding a bachelor's degree. This requires more experience--7,500 hours--but
allows the hours to be over a five-year period and not exceeding eight years.
      In addition, there is a requirement of thirty-five hours of project management edu-

cation. This requirement is really not very difficult to fulfill, since there is no time limit
and the training can be provided by practically anyone.
      The forms for applying for the certification are not included in this book, because
they change fairly often and can be easily downloaded from the Project Management
Institute's Internet site at www.pmi.org/certification/.
      This book is intended to cover the subject matter of the PMP exam. Since the PMP
exam is a comprehensive examination of your knowledge of project management tools
and techniques, the book is also comprehensive. However, every answer to every question
on the PMP examination is not in this book. Nor is it in any other book. PMI is
continually introducing new questions and replacing questions that have been around for
some time. I do the best job I can to keep aware of the nature of the examination and
pass this information on to you.
      My philosophy is that no one should be able to pass the PMP exam without having
an extremely good working knowledge of the practice of project management. In this
book I have tried to explain the nature of project management, how all of the tools and
techniques relate to one another, and how it all goes together to make a unified methodol-
ogy that can be used to successfully manage projects.
      There are a few comments to be made about how this book relates to the PMBOK.
There is not a direct chapter to chapter relationship between this book and the PMBOK.
If you are preparing for the PMP examination, read the entire PMBOK several times. I
do not want to sell you another copy of the PMBOK. Instead I have made an effort to
explain the methodology of project management and supplement the PMBOK. This
book is largely based on the knowledge areas of the PMBOK. I believe that organizing
the project management methodology by knowledge areas is much clearer, and this is the
way the PMBOK is organized with a few exceptions. For example, in my book there is
no chapter on the integration knowledge area. The topics in the integration chapter of
the PMBOK are covered better by discussing them in the knowledge areas that relate to
them. For instance, developing the project charter and scope statement fit much better
into a discussion of the scope knowledge area. Developing the project management plan
must be done in all of the knowledge areas and so on. I did not fill the pages with endless
lists of the ITTOs, PMI's inputs, outputs, tools, and techniques. You will see plenty of
these in the PMBOK.
      I hope that this book will help you prepare for the Project Management Professional
certification and that you will embark on a long and prosperous career in project manage-
ment.

                                            MANAGEMENT




P
        roject management is quickly becoming the method of management for more and
        more industries. Projects are being done for everything from building the largest
        skyscrapers to planning the smallest wedding. Many large companies now have a
stated policy to manage their entire company using project management methods. We
hope to encourage the use of project management in all businesses, and we hope to
encourage and help project managers learn more about the profession of project manage-
ment and pass the Project Management Professional (PMP) examination.
      If the professional organization for project managers, the Project Management Insti-
tute (PMI), has been instrumental in promoting project management, we should be
able to get some idea of the growth of project management by looking at the growth of
the membership in this organization. Founded in 1969, PMI has now been in existence
more than thirty-five years. When I joined PMI in 1989 they boasted of having about
5,000 members and a thousand Project Management Professionals (PMPs). Since 1989
the organization has experienced fantastic growth. In 2004, PMI's membership was well
over 100,000, and the number of PMPs was over 75,000. These numbers represent a
growth greater than even PMI had anticipated.
      Of course, all project managers and those working in the project management pro-
fession are not members of PMI, just as all people practicing any profession do not join
a professional organization. If the growth of PMI is any indication of the growth in the
project management profession itself, then it can easily be said that the profession is
growing by great leaps.
      PMI has done much for the growth of project management as a profession. It has
set the standards for the body of knowledge that makes up the project management
profession. In 2001 PMI received ISO 9001 recognition for its PMP certification pro-
gram from the International Organization for Standardization (ISO). This indicates that
PMI's program for certifying individuals as PMPs meets the highest international quality
standards. According to the ISO, a standard is a ``document approved by a recognized
body, that provides, for common and repeated use, rules, guidelines, or characteristics for
products, processes, or services with which compliance is not mandatory.''
      In addition PMI was able to obtain American National Standards Institute (ANSI)

recognition for the Guide to the Project Management Body of Knowledge (PMBOK). This
certification makes this guide the standard document for project management knowledge.
      Other factors have contributed to the growth of the profession as well. The body of
knowledge that comprises project management contains very few tools and techniques
that were not around before we started calling the work of doing projects ``project man-
agement.'' Gantt charts have been around for nearly a hundred years, PERT analysis was
a tool invented in the 1950s, and concepts of teamwork and participative management
have been around for that long as well. What project management as a profession does is
draw these tools together into a homogeneous whole and forge them into a new tool that
produces reliable results in the management of projects.


                What Is Project Management Anyway?
The Guide to the PMBOK defines project management as follows:

     Project Management is the application of knowledge, skills, and techniques to proj-
     ect activities in order to meet stakeholder needs and expectations from a project.

      So project management is using a set of tools and techniques to manage projects.
But it isn't fair to use the words you are defining as the definition. We had better first
talk about what a project is and then see if we can come up with something better.
      There are certain areas of expertise that are required for a project team to manage
projects in the most effective way. These are: the Guide to the PMBOK, applicable stan-
dards and codes for the project, technical ability, general management ability, human
resource skills, and the project surroundings.

Standards and Regulations
A standard is an agreed upon set of rules that are designed to achieve the optimum degree
of order in the desired results. These are usually published by some authority on the
subject. An example of a standard would be the octane ratings of gasoline used in their
manufacture.
     A regulation is a set of rules issued by some government agency. Regulations lay
down a set of rules that are mandatory for compliance to this agency. Examples of regula-
tions are occupational health and safety regulations.
     A project is a temporary endeavor undertaken to provide a unique product or service.
That is the definition from the Guide to the PMBOK. The word temporary means that
any project done must have a beginning and an end. A project generally begins when
some sort of official document proclaims the project to have an official life. This docu-
ment, the project charter, usually creates some means of collecting the cost and expenses

 Introduction                                                                               3



of the project. Often the end of the project is when all of the project goals have been met
and all of the work of the project has been accomplished. Some projects will end when
for various reasons it has been decided to abandon the project or stop work on it. This is
generally because the goals of the project cannot be achieved practically.
      Some distinction is made between the terms project and program. Most project man-
agers feel that the project management profession can manage projects of any size and
that the methodology that is used to manage them all is nearly the same, with modifica-
tions made to accommodate different sized projects. The methods used in the project
management process are the same. While discussing the difference between projects and
programs it would be well to note that there is a hierarchy of endeavors of this type
starting at the largest, the strategic plan, followed by the portfolio, the program, the
project, and even the subproject.
      Most projects will have the characteristic of being developed through what is called
``progressive elaboration'' in the Guide to the PMBOK. This simply means that projects
are progressively developed. For example, the project scope is only broadly defined in the
beginning of the project. As the project progresses the scope becomes more clearly defined
and more detailed. Ultimately a baseline is developed to define the scope of the project
in a detailed way.
      According to the Guide to the PMBOK, a program is a group of projects managed
in a coordinated way to obtain benefits not able to be obtained by managing them
separately. Programs are generally ongoing. This definition is familiar when we speak of
very large programs, but all projects are really subprojects of larger projects or are com-
posed of subprojects. From the perspective of a subproject manager, he or she is in charge
of his or her own project. From the perspective of the manager of these managers, he or
she is responsible for his or her own project. The difficulty of this definition is that there
is no clear distinction between the size of a project and that of a program. It is also true
that in some organizations, programs may even be considered to be subprojects of other
projects. All of this goes to show that project management is not a strict science but has
some artistic aspects to it as well. We will see that there are many differences in terminol-
ogy throughout the project management profession. PMI has made a remarkable effort
to try to separate and standardize terminology.
      When we speak of portfolio management, we are talking about a number of projects
that are grouped together to help meet strategic business goals. In this way projects that
advance the strategic goals of the company are included together, and an effort is made
to ensure that each project not only is justified on its own merits but that it also supports
the strategic goals of the organization.
      It is important to realize that the end of the project is not the same as the end of
the goods or services that the project produces. A project to build a nuclear power plant
usually ends when the goal of building the plant and making it operate at some expected
level of production has been achieved. The plant continues to operate, far into the future,




                           ................. 11151$   INTR   02-09-05 08:04:01   PS              PAGE 3

even though the project has ended. Although the project itself may come to an end from
the standpoint of the project manager and the project team, it is important to understand
that the effects of the project may continue for much longer. Life cycle costs can fre-
quently be incurred over the useful life of the project. These costs include warranty repair
work and project liability and many others. Since the project is usually closed when these
costs occur, they must be recognized by the project team and allowed for as future costs
by management.
      The project team, the project manager, and upper management of the company
must also consider the project environment. The social environment must be understood.
This is how the project affects people and how their wishes and desires will affect the
project. In some projects the political environment is important. This will determine the
effect of local customs, regulations, and laws that will affect the project. Lastly, the physi-
cal environment is important. The project must be done within the bounds of the physi-
cal environment in which it takes place and under the conditions present.
      The word unique in our definition means that the good or service that the project
provides is to some extent different from anything that has been produced before. How-
ever, unique does not mean that the project is completely unique but that it is to have
certain parts that are unique and that those parts are unique enough to require a planning
process to organize the effort to be done.
      Many projects build on the results of other projects and have many things in com-
mon with projects the organization has done in the past. A project is unique because
there is something that sets each project apart from others. If it were not for this it could
not be a project. Instead, it would be a routine repetition of something done before and
would not require many of the project management tools and techniques.
      Projects are ``progressively elaborated,'' which means that the products of a project
are progressively developed throughout the project. The goals and objectives are stated at
the beginning of the project. These goals and objectives are elaborated on and made
clearer and become more detailed as the project progresses. Initially the project will be
broadly defined. As time passes and more about the project becomes known the definition
of the project becomes clearer and more specific.
      From this, the idea that project management can be used to do almost anything
comes easily to mind. Of course, those of us in project management sometimes like to
think that members of our profession can manage projects better than anyone else.
      Projects are always going to be temporary endeavors, because they are intentionally
put together for the purpose of accomplishing something. Once this ``something'' has
been accomplished, the resources that were put together for this purpose can be assigned
to other projects. This means that the people and resources that can be brought together
for a project can be the right ones, and the project team can be formed specifically for
the purpose of that project.
      In modern project management, project teams bring together resources as they are




                         ................. 11151$   INTR   02-09-05 08:04:01   PS                 PAGE 4
 Introduction                                                                              5



required. One of the great advantages of project management is its ability to form multi-
disciplined project teams of the right people at the right time. The obvious advantage of
this is that scarce skills can be brought to a project when needed.
      Projects always have limited resources, but sometimes there are projects where the
cost and amount of resources seem to be unlimited. Projects like the Apollo Project in
the 1960s and the Manhattan Project in the 1940s come to mind, but even these projects
had some resource constraints on them. To the project manager who is trying to get a
project completed with scarce or unavailable resources this might seem like a wonderful
way to manage a project, but these types of projects usually come with severe schedule
requirements.
      The person or organization that has something at stake in the results of a project we
call the ``stakeholder.'' Projects will always have more than one stakeholder, and each of
the stakeholders will have different needs and expectations.
      The ``client'' or ``sponsor'' is the main stakeholder in the project. Without this
stakeholder the project probably would not go forward. This person or organization
usually puts up the money for the project and has the most interest in its success.
      So, we can now understand the PMBOK definition, ``project management is the
application of the tools and techniques that are necessary to satisfy the expectations of
the stakeholder or stakeholders of the project.''



                                           A True Story
``Of course I don't look busy--I did it right the first time.'' This one-liner brings to mind
the problem that so many of us face in implementing project management strategies and
methods in our businesses. It seems that people are resistant to change even when it is
good for them, and they don't appreciate people getting things done if they don't look
busy enough. As a newly certified project management professional, you will undoubtedly
run into some resistance when you try to implement new ideas, and project management
techniques seem to be full of new ideas.
      There is a story (probably true) about a project manager who went to work for a
company that produced computer software. This project manager was hired to complete
a project that was to produce a significant amount of the company's income for the year,
and it had a strict deadline of twelve months.
      As time went by, the project manager settled in, and after a couple of weeks the
project manager's boss asked her how many lines of code had been written for the project
(a not too unusual measure for computer programming types).
      She replied, ``Well, none at the moment. We are describing the user's requirements
and doing some planning for the project, but no, we have no lines of code written.''
      This seemed to satisfy her manager for the time being, and the project manager




                           ................. 11151$   INTR   02-09-05 08:04:01   PS             PAGE 5

continued her work. After about a month the project manager's boss showed up again
and asked the same question, ``How many lines of code have you and your project team
written?''
      The project manager, recognizing the concern of her manager, said, ``Well, none,
but we are getting organized. We have defined our deliverables for the project, and we
have made a work breakdown structure for the project, and we have started our risk
analysis, but no, we have no lines of code written.'' Somewhat shaken, the manager left.
      This went on for some time. The project manager did planning and organizing for
the project execution to take place, and her manager grew more and more frantic with
each passing day.
      To make a long (twelve months) story shorter, after about eleven months, the project
was completed. The customer and all the stakeholders were happy. The project was fully
tested and it met all the requirements as specified. The customer accepted the system and
paid the bill.
      The project manager's boss decided to throw a party for the entire project team. So,
one Friday afternoon, the office was closed and everyone took a break for pizza and beer.
The project manager's boss took her aside during the party and said, ``I want to congratu-
late you on getting this project done within the time required, but it seems to me that if
you had not been messing around doing that planning stuff and gotten busy writing code
from the start, we would have been done about two months sooner.''
      This is the kind of reward you can expect when you follow good project manage-
ment practices and you are working in an environment where all of this is new to the
management of your organization. Sometimes a little training in the ways and methods
of project management is in order. Often we find companies that are spending many
thousands of dollars training people who will manage projects are not training any of the
managers above those project managers. When the project managers try to implement
something new that they have learned, they are frequently frustrated by upper manage-
ment's resistance to change.
      Sometimes it seems that getting these executive managers into some sort of project
management course is a lost cause. But it is imperative that we do so, if only so that they
will appreciate and understand some of the things that our new project managers are
trying to do.



                  Advantages of Project Management
Project management brings together many of the things that are needed to make endeav-
ors like projects successful. But what do we mean by a successful project? A successful
project is one that meets the expectations of the stakeholders of the project.
      By organizing the project in a way that concentrates the efforts of the project team

in the direction of accomplishing the project, a great deal of motivation is achieved. This
allows for the project teams to concentrate on the project and not be distracted by all of
the other projects and business activities that are going on in the area around them.
      The stakeholders have consistent points of contact with the project team, and the
project manager is a reliable source of information about the project and all that is going
on within it.
      The tools and techniques of project management are tried and tested and can be
used on any project with success. Nearly all of them have been available for many years
but have been somewhat difficult to use without the aid of personal computers. Project
management brings many of these tools together in one methodology that can be success-
fully applied.
      In project management we frequently speak of the triple constraints of project scope,
project budget, and project time. This means that projects must meet the stakeholders'
expectations and must be able to be done within the budget that was allocated to them
and in the time that was allocated to them.


                  Organizing for Project Management
Most projects are smaller than the organizations to which they belong. The management
of a project is strongly influenced by the organizational environment to which they be-
long. The organization's maturity with respect to project management will have a great
influence on how the project manager is able to perform the work of managing the
project. For example, project managers who have a management style of participative
management may have trouble managing projects in a strongly hierarchical environment.
     Referring to Figure I-1, there are really only three ways that organizations can be
structured. All organizations are derivations or combinations of these structures. At one
end of the spectrum of organizations is the ``projectized'' or pure project organization. At
the other end is the functional or traditional organization. In the middle is the matrix
organization.

The Projectized Organization
In project management, the pure project organization is not the organization that we are
most interested in. It is a developmental stepping-stone to the matrix organization that is
so important to the proper use of project management. Let us look at these organizations
one at a time.
      The first type of organization used was probably the pure project organization. In
this type of organization the project manager is the supreme authority, and all questions
regarding the project are directed to him or her as the ultimate authority. The project
manager makes all of the decisions. When the Egyptian pyramids were built, this type of

organization was used. The project manager answered directly to the pharaoh, and there
were thousands of people dedicated to the completion of the project. The project took
place far from the formal organization, and most resources were completely dedicated to
the project.
      People who work in this kind of organization are generally dedicated to the project
until it is over. In some early projects, such as building the Egyptian pyramids, people
worked on these projects until they--the people or the projects--were finished. This
type of project organization is necessary when there is a very large project of great impor-
tance or when the project is taking place a great distance from the main organization.
The relationship between having a good focus on the goals of the project and good
motivation is clear, and people respond well to a clear focus.
      In this type of organization, the focus of the project team and the project goals are
clear. Communications between the customer and the project team are usually quite
good.
      There are some disadvantages to this kind of organization, however. The first is one
of efficiency. If persons with a special skill are needed, they must generally be brought to
the project for the duration of time that their skills are needed, even if the skills are
needed only part of the time. A stone carver who specializes in carving birds might be
needed for only one week a month, but because of the distance and difficulty transporting
him to and from the project site, he would have to be employed full time. For the other
three weeks of the month this person would have to be utilized in some other capacity.




                         ................. 11151$   INTR   02-09-05 08:04:02   PS                      PAGE 8
 Introduction                                                                              9



      The second problem with this type of organization is what to do when it is over.
There are thousands of people working on a pyramid out there in the desert. They all
had the goal of constructing a pyramid. They all had a deadline of getting it done before
the pharaoh dies. When the pyramid is finished, so is the project--and so is the team.
There is usually a big celebration with everyone patting each other on the back while the
project manager comes around and hands out everyone's termination notice.
      In modern times the same thing happens in this type of organization. An example
is the Apollo Program. President John F. Kennedy gave his famous speech and said, ``I
believe this nation should commit itself to the goal of sending a man to the moon before
the end of the decade and returning him safely to Earth.'' As we all know, this goal was
met in July of 1969 when Neil Armstrong first stepped on the surface of the moon and
returned home safely. At that same time, NASA managers were figuring out what to do
now that the program was over. For a time they were able to keep life in the program,
but eventually the funding dried up, and many of the highly skilled aerospace engineers
and managers were terminated. When NASA, a few years later, tried to start up the space
shuttle program, many of these former employees had changed careers and were happy
in their new occupations.
      We can say that this organization can be used for special projects that are large in
size or remote from their home organization. For most of the projects that we will be
involved in, this type of organization has too many serious disadvantages to be used
successfully. This brings us to the next organization we will consider.

The Functional or Traditional Organization
The functional organization has been with us for quite some time--it has been the
dominant form of organization for over a hundred years. The development of ``scientific
management'' by such persons as Fredrick Taylor and Henry Ford led to the extensive
use of the concepts of this type of organization, which are still used today. In this type of
organization the intention is to place people into jobs that they do best, train them to do
their jobs even better, and organize the work so that it takes advantage of their skills in
the most effective way.
      This kind of organization is set up primarily on the basis of organizing people with
similar skills into the same groups, working under a manager who is similarly skilled. In
this way the skills are concentrated into pools of workers in such a way that the manager
can distribute the work to those who are best qualified for a specific job. The manager of
this group, being experienced in this type of work, is also an appropriate person to
recommend training and career-enhancing assignments to each of the members of the
group.
      In the past, traditional organization people became specialists in their jobs and
became very good at what they did. This allowed them to become somewhat complacent
about what they did. As long as they were continually asked to do things that were




                           ................. 11151$   INTR   02-09-05 08:04:02   PS             PAGE 9

familiar and within their area of expertise they were successful. With people working this
way companies became this way as well. They were very good at what they did as long as
they could keep on doing it over and over again with little change. Companies like these
were not easily changed when market demands and new technology entered their business
areas.
      Suppose Sally worked for a large automotive company in the 1970s. Her job was to
design disk brake assemblies for all of the cars that this company made. She was very
good at it. In fact, you could say that she was as good at it as anyone in the business. She
was so good at designing disk brakes that she was employee of the month and received
many awards for her designs in terms of quality and cost. She had been with the company
since leaving college and progressed through the ranks and received regular raises. She
received training to help enhance her skills and was allowed to go to a limited number of
conferences held for people in her profession. She knew that in a few years she would be
the head of a design group and perhaps some day be manager of a department.
      Things changed and the company decided to diversify. One new line of business
was producing a super-lightweight vehicle. This vehicle required the design of a disk
brake assembly of the lightest weight possible. For Sally this meant that she would have
to design the brake assembly using materials that she had never used before. This both-
ered her, and she delayed starting the task. She had no contact with the customer and
knew nothing about the strategic objectives of this project.
      Meanwhile, her boss was also less than enthusiastic about the project. Fortunately
for him, the new ultra-lightweight vehicle was only a minor part of the work that was
going on in his department. As a result he did not monitor Sally too much on the design
of the disk brake assembly. To him it seemed that there was the more important work of
the company's normal business to take care of. This new, here-today-and-gone-tomor-
row, super-lightweight vehicle was just another dream of the marketing department and
nothing to be concerned about when there were thousands of customers continuing to
buy the standard products of the company.
      In another department of the company, where the bulk of the vehicle design work
was taking place, the manager was under a lot of pressure to get this design completed.
It represented a large amount of the work that had to be done in that department. His
job was all the more difficult since his fellow department heads were not concerned with
this project. In addition, this manager probably had very little direct contact with the
customer, and the communications problem of going through the marketing and sales
people to find out what the customer really wanted was formidable.
      As long as companies are doing the same sorts of things that they always did, this
type of organization works well. Each person has a boss who knows what that person's
job is and how well the person does it. The boss knows how to administer salaries,
training, and all the other administrative things that employees need. By being familiar

with the work and the people doing the work, the boss is able to best use the skills that
are available.
     However, the problem with this kind of organization is that it is difficult to make a
change in what people do. Sally avoided working on the ultra-lightweight brake because
it was more difficult to learn new things to get the job done. She was measured by the
amount of designs she completed and to a lesser extent by the difficulty of the designs.
She naturally avoided the difficult and new in favor of the tried and true. Since the whole
company worked this way, it was very resistant to change and the development of new
products.

The Matrix Organization
The matrix organization came into being in the 1970s. It was an attempt to put the best
of the projectized and the traditional organizations together.
      In the matrix organization, all of the employees report to functional managers much
like the managers in the traditional organization. The employees are organized strictly by
skills. In the traditional organization, there are many exceptions to organizing by skills.
An electrical engineer might be in a department of mechanical engineers, for example. In
matrix organizations this does not take place. All people of the same skill report to the
same functional manager. The functional managers are responsible for project managers'
staffing and direct the administrative work that is needed for the employees. The project
managers direct the bulk of the work done by the employees.
      There is an organization of project managers as well. The project managers are
responsible for the work that is done, but not for the administrative work that must be
done for the employees actually doing the work. This allows the project managers to
form teams that can concentrate on the project at hand without getting bogged down by
administrative work. It allows the project team to focus on the customer, the stakeholders,
and the project much as in the projectized organization.
      In operation, the project manager puts together the project plans and develops a list
of people needed to work on the team. He or she then meets with the functional manager
and negotiates for the people who are available and who have the proper skills to work on
the project. Together, they develop the staff that will work on the project. The functional
managers do this with all of the project managers who require skills that are in their
organizations. Here is one way of thinking about this: If a project manager has a Gantt
chart that lists all of the activities in a project, the functional manager has a similar chart
listing all of the employees in the organization and the projects that they are assigned to
work on, shown as bars against a timeline.
      There are several difficulties with this kind of organization. There needs to be a
balance of power between the project managers and the functional managers. If there is
not, one group will dominate the other. If the project managers become too powerful,




                            ................. 11151$   INTR   02-09-05 08:04:03   PS              PAGE 11
12                   Preparing for the Project Management Professional Certification Exam



they can force the functional managers to allocate the best people to their projects, or
even allocate more people than their projects require. The result of this is that all of the
people end up reporting to project managers, who then can trade people between projects
without consulting with the functional managers. The functional managers end up being
underutilized. This type of organization where the project managers are very powerful is
called a strong matrix organization.
      If the balance of power is toward the functional managers, we end up with the
traditional organization, only now we have a group of project managers as well. Sooner
or later someone will realize that the functional managers are assigning and monitoring
all the work and the project managers are merely expediting projects. This type of organi-
zation, where the project manager has less power than the functional manager, is called a
weak matrix organization.
      Balance can be achieved by deciding when work should be done by the project team
and when work should be assigned to the functional department organizations them-
selves. For example, organizations can make a rule that any work done that requires a
person to work full time for more than one month will be done in the project under the
direction of the project manager, and any work that takes less time than this will be
assigned to the functional organization. This allows work to be done in the functional
areas as well as in the projects. This type of organization, where there is a balance of
power between the functional managers and the project managers, is called a balanced
matrix organization.



     The Project Office and the Project Management Office
``Project management office'' is a term that has come into use in the past few years. It
should be noted that, in common usage, the term ``project office'' is different from
``project management office.'' The project office is the place where the project team is
managed and where the project manager and the project team reside. As companies
become more project oriented, quite a lot of inefficiency can result. This is because
project managers want to have direct control of all the work that goes on inside their
project. But it is not practical for all project teams to have complete independence.
      For example, although they might find it desirable, each project team cannot have
their own high-speed copy machine, accounting group, payroll department, purchasing
department, and so on. Common services that are required for several projects can be
organized into a project management office (PMO). One PMO can support the needs of
several project teams. It can be much more efficient to have one large copy machine
serving the needs of several project teams. Other resources are appropriately shared
through the PMO. The PMO can also be very helpful in helping to coordinate project




                        ................. 11151$   INTR   02-09-05 08:04:03   PS               PAGE 12
 Introduction                                                                             13



policies, procedures, reports, and documentation. In addition the PMO can be useful in
coordinating quality efforts, communications, and mentoring.
      The danger of having the responsibilities of the project team handled by the PMO
is that the authority of the project team may be eroded. For example, it might be econom-
ically practical to have one copy machine shared by several project teams and to locate
the copy machine in the PMO. What happens if we decide that it makes sense to have
the PMO produce the project schedule or some of the other reports that are generated
regularly by all projects? What if those using the project schedule will now come to the
scheduler in the PMO to make project schedule changes? Before we know it the PMO
may end up giving advice and literally running aspects of the project that should be done
by the project team. This is leading us away from the idea of project management and
back to the functional organization.
      What project management brings to the table is the ability to coordinate all of these
activities and at the same time help to motivate people to work on them. By bringing
people together into a project team, the work of the project is coordinated through a
project manager who is in close contact with the client and stakeholders. This allows the
project manager to focus the project team on the completion of the project.
      The project manager and his or her team are able to focus on the goals of the project
with relatively little distraction. To the project team, this project is the main thing in
their working life for the time being. People with the proper skills can be brought into
close proximity to each other, and by having this close proximity they develop a synergy
of mutual assistance and complete the work with remarkable results.


      How the Project Manager Makes Projects Successful
When we think of project managers we should think of them as small business managers.
Many of the characteristics that are required to be successful in the managing of a small
business are the same as those needed for the proper management of projects. In fact,
since many project managers today are rooted in technical disciplines, it is surprising that
the skills they are called upon to have were previously considered unusual skills for techni-
cal managers.
      Today the project manager is expected to be familiar with and have considerable
knowledge in the areas of finance, accounting, sales, marketing, manufacturing, research
and development, strategic and operational planning, the characteristics of organizations,
personnel, administration, managing work relationships, motivation, and other people
skills. This is necessary because project managers are managing projects much like people
manage small businesses. The multidisciplined project team becomes an entity in itself,
focused on the needs of the project and trying to satisfy those needs in the best way
possible.

                                 The Project Life Cycle
Projects of any size, large or small, can be managed using the project management meth-
odology. Because all projects are unique in some way, it might be helpful to look at the
life cycle or phases of projects and note the many similarities between projects and that
all projects go through similar phases. The project life cycle defines the beginning and
the end of a project and various phases within it. At various points in the project life
cycle the project is reevaluated and a decision is made whether to go forward with the
project or to stop work on it. The points between the beginning and the end of the
project vary considerably depending on the type of business and the specific project being
done. The definition of specific phases will differ greatly from organization to organiza-
tion with most organizations defining their own phases. Most often a phase's completion
is marked by some sort of management review and a decision to move into the next
phase. This is not always the case since phases will overlap especially when ``fast tracking''
a project.
      During the life cycle of a project there will be accomplishments made at each phase.
The completion of these accomplishments results in the creation of a ``deliverable,'' a
tangible verifiable product of the work being done on the project. These may be products
that are delivered external to the project or something needed for other project work to
take place, which are considered to be ``internal deliverables.''
      If we consider the project life cycle as having at least three phases--an initial phase,
a final phase, and one or more intermediate phases--we see that projects share many
characteristics.
      PMI describes the project management processes as the initiating processes, plan-
ning processes, executing processes, controlling processes, and closing processes. These
processes are repeated over and over in each phase of the project life cycle.
      As can be seen in Figure I-2, in a project's initial phase, cost and staffing levels are
low. There are only a few key people who spend their time on the project at this point.
Few if any materials have been purchased, and the company's financial commitment is
not great. At this phase there is the greatest chance that the project will never be com-
pleted. Many projects reach this phase only to be discontinued when it is determined
that the cost of doing the project meets or exceeds the benefits received from doing the
project. At this phase of the project there is little known about the project.
      As the project moves into the second phase the rate of spending increases for the
project. This is a result of having more people working a greater amount of time on the
project. At this time the cost of changes and the impact of the risks increases as well,
since it will take more effort and time to make corrections.
      At some point the project's rate of spending begins to decrease. This is because some
of the people on the project team have completed their work and are moving on to other
projects. Much of the material and equipment has been purchased. From this point on
the project will spend less and less.

                                   Duration of the Project

      At the final phase of the project it is important that the project manager make a
transition of the stakeholders, changing from the project team to an ongoing maintenance
and support group. If this is not done the good relationship that the project team has
with the stakeholders will come back to haunt the team members. Stakeholders have
enjoyed working with the project team and are familiar with the members of the team
and what they do. The team members have not moved to other projects and will spend
much of their time working with previous project stakeholders. This can be difficult if
the stakeholders are major customers or our own upper management.


                         Project Management Processes
In the Guide to the Project Management Body of Knowledge, the basic project management
processes are discussed. This approach to finding a way to look at the project management
process uses the systems management approach to project management. By this we mean
that project management is a process that takes inputs, processes them, and produces
outputs. Within the project management process are other process groups: the initiating
process group, the planning process group, the executing process group, the monitoring
and control process group, and the closeout process group.
     The initiating process group includes the processes that authorize the start of a new
project or the next phase of a project. The rough estimates of the project success are
estimated and a preliminary scope definition is made. These estimates are used to per-




                           ................. 11151$   INTR   02-09-05 08:04:04    PS                          PAGE 15

form, at least, a preliminary project justification. The project is authorized by the project
charter. Prior to the issuing of the project charter, the project does not officially exist.
      The planning process group includes the processes that make it possible to plan the
project. At this time the project is ``progressively elaborated'' (sometimes called ``rolling
wave planning''), and the project scope is matured and more clearly defined. These pro-
cesses are used to gather much additional information about the project from many
sources both inside and outside of the project.
      The executing process group includes the processes that are required to actually do
and complete the work defined in the project plan. This work will result in the accom-
plishment of the project's objectives and the delivering of the deliverables to the stake-
holders. During the execution process there will be more resources used than at any other
time in the project. A great deal of effort must be spent coordinating these resources. It
is therefore necessary to have a quality effort that will ensure that the project will meet
the stakeholder expectations.
      The monitoring and control process group includes the processes that are required to
monitor and control the execution phase. The project is monitored for results and per-
formance according to the project plan. Recommendations for corrective action are made
and the results of the corrective actions are monitored. The change management system
is part of this group and is essential to controlling ``scope creep'' and ``creeping elegance.''
      The closing process group includes the processes that are required to formally termi-
nate the project. With this group we put an end to the project. The deliverables are
delivered and accepted by the stakeholders, accounts that were opened for the project are
closed, and purchasing activities are reconciled.
      Of course, each of the knowledge areas mentioned in the Guide to the PMBOK
operates in each of these major processes. For example, the knowledge area of cost man-
agement is concerned with the initiation process, because we must have preliminary
estimates for a project to be able to move forward into the planning phase or process. We
must have cost information for the planning process, because we must know how much
our project is going to cost when it is actually done. In the execution process we must
collect actual cost data to allow us to control the project. In the closeout phase of the
project we must have cost information to close out the accounts and make sure that all
of the bills associated with the project are paid.
      The process groups all take place over the life of the project. That is, if we look at a
project from beginning to end each of the process groups will have taken place. It is
important to note that all of the process groups will take place during each phase or
subproject of the project. In other words, if a particular phase of a project produces
deliverables, either internal or external, we must go through the initiation processes, the
planning processes, the execution processes, the monitoring and control processes, and
the closeout processes. It is also important to note that the process groups do not necessar-

ily occur in sequence. There can be considerable overlap from one process or process
group to the next.
     In each of the knowledge areas--integration management, scope management, time
management, cost management, quality management, human resources management,
communications management, risk management, and contracts and procurement man-
agement--it can be seen that they all may apply to each and every one of the processes.
One could say that some knowledge from each of the knowledge areas is required in
every one of the process groups.


                                            Summary
Project management is quickly becoming the management method of choice not only in
the United States but around the globe as well. The reasons for this are that project
management works, and people are finding out that it is the most comprehensive method
of management available today.

                                                       Scope Management



W
             ithout a doubt, the most common reason that projects fail is because of poor
             scope definition. By that I mean that the expectations of the stakeholders, and
             especially the client or sponsor, are different from the expectations of the
project team. This is a most difficult problem, but it is critical to the success of the project
that it is overcome. There are many reasons why a project fails, and understanding them
will give us insights as to how to avoid them.
      The relationship between the project team and the customer has to reverse itself at
the time of scope definition. Up to this point the customer's main contact has been
someone from a sales organization. During this part of the project the salesperson has
been trying to convince the customer that the project is a good project to do. Sometimes
the salesperson becomes overly enthusiastic about the project and intentionally or unin-
tentionally leads the customer to believe that everything imaginable is actually going to
be produced by the project. This is rarely the case.
      When the project team is formed and begins to hold meetings with the customer to
develop the scope of the project, the customer already has the notion that the project is
already defined. As a result the customer views the whole process of scope definition as a
waste of time. In fact the customer may actually resist the scope definition process because
of reluctance to commit to defining the project.
      It becomes very difficult for the project team to convince the customer that both
the project team and the customer have the same goal for the project, that is, that the
goal of the project is to give the customer something that is useful and something that
does what is wanted in the first place. There is no point in having an adversarial relation-
ship between the customer and the project team. Both want the project to succeed, and
both want the project to be useful and serve the purpose for which it was intended.
      The project team needs to understand the customer as well. The team should not

                                                      18

 Scope Management                                                                            19



be frustrated if the customer seems to know less about the project than the project team.
After all, the reason that the project team is doing the project is that they are expert at
accomplishing the project. The customer is not expert in doing the project. That is why
the project team was formed in the first place.
     Sometimes extraordinary means must be used to develop the scope of the project. It
may be necessary for one or more project team members to work in the customer's area
for a period of time and become trained in the work that the project is supposed to
enhance. This is a good technique when the customer is not willing or able to cooperate
in devoting the necessary time and manpower to working with the project team. The
project team member simply becomes a surrogate customer and learns enough about the
customer's operation to speak for the customer.
     Of course it is much more desirable to have the customers themselves play this role.
The customer should be represented in the project team, as should all of the project
stakeholders. The greater the involvement and the greater the level of communications
that you have with all of the stakeholders, the sounder the project will be. This will start
with the definition of the scope of the project.


                              Initiation of the Project
A project comes into existence with the creation of a formal document called the project
charter. The project charter is a small document but one that is extremely important to
getting a project started in the right direction. Projects are done for a number of reasons.
Generally, for commercial companies, the reason for doing a project is to make money.
There are many other reasons for doing projects, such as establishing goodwill, conform-
ing to government regulations and laws, and attempting to stay current with developing
technology.

Project Charter
In the third edition of the PMBOK , PMI has chosen to expand the content of the
project charter. It also recommends that the contract with the customer be completed
before the approval of the project charter. Some considerations must be made for this
approach. The more information that is put into the project charter, the greater the
possibility for people to disagree. If there is much disagreement about the project charter
and its specific contents, there will have to be discussion and clarification in order to get
managers to approve it. Since the project charter officially begins the project, work that
is done prior to project charter approval may not be accounted for properly. This means
that the effort taken prior to the approval of the project charter may not be properly
accounted for. This in turn understates the true cost of the project and leads to underbud-
geting of future projects when this project is used as a reference. I feel that project charters




                            ................. 11151$   $CH1   02-09-05 08:06:20   PS               PAGE 19
20                   Preparing for the Project Management Professional Certification Exam



should be kept to a minimum in order to speed approval. The host of documents PMI
considers could easily be done after the completion and approval of the project charter.
For these reasons, in the real world of project management, some caution must be used
when following the PMBOK recommendations for the project charter.
      The project charter should contain a statement of the purpose of the project and
the project name. It should also contain the business case for doing the project, the needs
and expectations of the stakeholders, a rough schedule and budget for the project, and a
list of the assumptions and constraints that we recognize at this point in the project.
      The project charter formally authorizes the project to begin and names the project
manager. This is usually done by creating some sort of financial account that will allow
costs to be accumulated for this project.
      The project charter is written by the project manager, but it must be distributed
under the signature of the person who is authorized to initiate or sponsor the project and
create funding for the project. It would make no sense to have project managers creating
and authorizing their own projects. However, it is important that the project manager
actually write the project charter, because this is the first opportunity for the project
manager to define the project as he or she sees it. Several documents should be done prior
to the creation of the project charter.

      Statement of Work
      The statement of work is a narrative that describes what work will be done in the
course of completing this project. The statement of work for the project can come in
many forms. It can be part of the bid process or the request for proposals process. When
coming in the form of a bid, the statement of work is defined by the organization request-
ing the bid. In the case of a request for proposals from outside the company, the statement
of work is only functionally defined by the requestor and the detailed statement of work
is proposed by the proposing organization. It can also be a statement of work required
by part of our own organization.

    Business Need
    The business need is a statement of the need to do the project. This can be in the
form of a request for a needed product or service that will result from doing the project.

      Scope Description
      The project scope description is a statement of the requirements of the project as
they are seen today. The scope of the project at this point is not terribly detailed and will
be progressively elaborated as the project plan unfolds. The project scope should be
sufficiently detailed so that it can be used for planning purposes. The scope description
should also show how the items described in the scope description relate to the business
needs that were to be addressed by the project.

 Scope Management                                                                       21



     Environmental and Organizational Factors
     This document should address all of the organizational factors surrounding the
project and the marketplace. It should identify strengths and weaknesses in the environ-
ment in which the project will have to be done and the ability of the company to carry on
the project. Since projects are so dependent on information, a statement of the company's
management information systems is appropriate. Stakeholder and industry risk tolerance
should be estimated and addressed. Personnel administration should also be addressed as
the company's hiring and firing practices will have an effect on the ability of the project
manager to add and remove people from the project team.

      Organizational Process Assets
      These items, included in the project charter or subsequent documentation, are the
principal company documentation of standards and procedures already completed and
available for the project to use. They include any standards that have been created for
managing projects as well as lessons learned from previous projects, both successes and
failures.
      Also included are all procedural standards and communication policies, such as
distribution of reports, the frequency of distribution, reporting of actual cost during the
project, and the method used for reporting progress and performance of the project team.
It should be noted that when we refer to the project team we include people normally
considered outside the project, such as vendors and functional departments that do work
for the project.

     Change Management Procedure
     The project charter should include the change management procedure. This proce-
dure will need to be followed as soon as the baselines of the project are established. The
procedure itself needs to be in place early so that stakeholders and project team members
are aware of how changes to project scope, cost, and schedule should be processed.

     Risk Control Procedures
     As companies become more mature in the management of projects, the need for
good risk management becomes more important. The project charter should contain
the risk management procedures, the methods of identifying risk, and the methods for
calculating impact, probability, and severity.

Organizational Knowledge Bases
The project charter should contain the lessons-learned documents, including progress
and performance, identified risks and the results of risk management, financial data, issue
and defect management, and history from previous related projects.

Constraints and Assumptions
In addition to the project charter, any constraints that will limit the project team's choices
in any of the project activities must be noted. Predetermined or edicted project schedules,
project completion dates, and project budgets need to be reckoned with early in the
project.
      Assumptions must be made for the purpose of planning the project. These will be
considerations for the availability of resources, other needs and expectations, vendors,
start dates, contract signing, and others. Assumptions are not a bad thing--we make
assumptions every day. From the moment we get out of bed each morning we assume
that the electricity will work and the water will come out of the faucets. To successfully
plan a project many assumptions will be made or the project will never get started.

Project Selection Methods
This section of the project charter should outline the standard methods that should be
used in justifying projects. It should include the methods that can be employed during
different times of the project life. In the early stages of the project when only small
commitments are being made, fairly easy but less accurate justification methods, such as
``breakeven'' analysis or the calculation of ``payback points,'' can be employed. As the
project develops, more complete and accurate justification methods can be used. As the
amount of money committed to the project increases it is necessary to have more detailed
and accurate project justifications, such as the ``internal rate of return on investment''
calculation. These will be discussed in detail later in this chapter.


                        Who Are Those Stakeholders?
First of all we should say that the stakeholders are all of the people who have something
to gain or lose in the project. By this definition we must include, among others, the
project team. If we consider all of the far-reaching effects of doing almost any project, we
can see that there are a lot of stakeholders indeed. We must be careful that we consider
all of the stakeholders in a project, some to a lesser extent than others.
       Our main concern is going to be the ``key'' stakeholders. The first problem is to
identify them. How can we best accomplish this task? For some reason there is reluctance
on the part of project managers to contact all of the key stakeholders in the project, let
alone the ones that are not so critical. This results in a poor definition of what the project
is all about. With a poor definition of what the project is all about, there is no hope of
ever being able to construct a project plan and determine the cost, schedule, and scope
objectives that project managers hold so dear to their hearts.
       One of the techniques that can be used is to have seven to ten members of your
project team get together and use one of the group dynamics techniques to come up with




                         ................. 11151$   $CH1   02-09-05 08:06:21   PS                PAGE 22
 Scope Management                                                                          23



the names of all the stakeholders for the project. One technique that is gaining in popu-
larity these days is called the Crawford slip.
      Using this technique, each person in the group is given ten pieces of paper. The
facilitator asks the question, ``Who is the most important stakeholder in this project?''
Each of the participants must answer the question with the best answer he or she can
think of. This is all done in silence, and the answers are not discussed at this time. The
facilitator waits one minute, exactly, and asks the same question again. Each time the
question is asked, the participants must answer the question. An answer cannot be used
more than one time by each participant.
      After the question has been asked ten times, the group should have generated 70 to
100 responses. If the group has been picked carefully so that there is diversity among the
participants, there is a good chance that a high percentage of the stakeholders have been
identified.
      At this point the list of stakeholders can be compiled and distributed to the partici-
pants for additions and corrections. With this technique we have gone a long way toward
identifying the stakeholders for the project.

Cost and Its Relationship to Price
One of the things that seems to be confusing is the relationship between cost and price.
So, the first thing we should do is to make certain that we are all using the same meanings
for these two words.
      Price is the amount of money (or something else) that a customer or stakeholder is
willing to give you in order to receive something from you. Generally, in terms of project
management, the thing that is being done for the stakeholder is the project, and the
things that the customer and stakeholders receive are the deliverables of the project. These
things can be either goods or services. Money is usually the thing that is given in exchange
for doing the project. Cost, on the other hand, is the amount of resources (money, people,
materials, equipment, and so on) that are consumed in order to produce the delivered
goods or services, the results of the project.
      What is the relationship between cost and price? Are we satisfied if we are able to
make a reasonable profit on what we do for our stakeholders? Are we satisfied if the cost
of doing a project is less than the selling price by some accepted percentage?
      Let's explore this a bit. Suppose we say we would be satisfied if our total project cost
was 85 percent of the selling price. We must first ask where the selling price came from.
Did our sales and marketing people try to get the highest price they could, or were they
satisfied by being able to get the acceptable 15 percent markup from the customer?
      Eliyahu Goldratt said in his book It's Not Luck that the price of something should
be determined by ``the perceived value to the buyer.'' What this means is that the selling
price of anything we do should be determined by what the customer and the stakeholders
are willing to pay. Having determined what the stakeholders are willing to pay, we then




                           ................. 11151$   $CH1   02-09-05 08:06:21   PS              PAGE 23
24                    Preparing for the Project Management Professional Certification Exam



need to determine whether it is profitable enough for us to do the work. To determine
this we must determine cost.
      In order for us to stay competitive in a world of global competition it is important
that we recognize this. In the beginning of a product life cycle or when a new service is
being offered for the first time, it is important that the stakeholders pay the price equiva-
lent to the value of the goods or services they receive. It is also important that the project
team produce the deliverables of the project for the minimum cost.
      This will leave what may seem like an excessive profit. It is important for the future
of the company that these excessive profits be used to invest in improving the company's
ability to produce future projects for less cost. The competition will be eager to come
into a highly profitable and growing new business area. When they do, they will be
willing to reduce the price to your customers to entice them away from your organization.
And when this happens the company that started it all had better have been making cost
improvements all the while or risk the loss of a major market share.
      So, a couple of things are important here. One is that we ask the customer to pay a
price that is relevant to the perceived value of what they receive. The second is that the
company providing the goods or services takes the extra profit and invests it in its ability
to reduce costs as the product matures and competition enters the market.

Overbid or Underbid: Which Is Better for Your Company?
We said that it was important to price things according to the perceived value to the
customer. In other words, if a project has a high value to stakeholders and customers,
they should pay a price that is high as well.
      Now, suppose we are in a bidding situation. Our organization is in the kind of
business where the stakeholders publish requirements and companies like ours submit a
firm fixed price to do the work specified. Many construction projects work this way, but
other types of projects are done this way, too. A number of companies are bidding for
the same project.
      The question is then: Is it better for companies to underbid or overbid projects like
this? Most people would say, ``It is better to overbid the project because if I underbid I
may win the project but lose money trying to complete it.'' Let us explore this issue.
      A company that underbids a project and wins the bid finds that the cost estimate
for doing the work was too low and as a result they did not charge enough to the
stakeholder to make a profit. In fact the company may actually lose money on this
project. This gives the company immediate feedback: They know soon after starting the
work that there will not be enough money coming from the customer to pay all the costs
and expenses associated with the project. At this point lots of unhappy things take place.
      The company may go to the customer or stakeholders and ask for additional funds.
The company may have to grin and bear it and lose money or at least not make as much
money as they would like. The company may try to reduce the requirements to save cost,




                         ................. 11151$   $CH1   02-09-05 08:06:21   PS                PAGE 24
 Scope Management                                                                          25



with or without the customer's approval. Panic may follow, leading to a very unhappy
situation all around.
      But, every cloud has a silver lining. The company in this situation at least knows
where it stands, and one way or another, the next time the company bids on a job it will
increase the price. Companies in this situation either learn from this experience or they
soon find another line of work.
      In the other situation we talked about--where the company overbids the work--
only two things can happen: The company bids too high and does not get the work, or
the company bids high and gets the work anyway.
      In the first case, the company loses the bid and does not get to work on the project.
This may or may not have a positive effect on future business. If the company was
convinced that the bid it submitted was just too high, it might look into the cost esti-
mating process or some of the costs associated with the way it is doing things. Many
companies don't do this. They become convinced that for some unknown reason the
competition got the job and they did not. You will hear about how so-and-so's brother-
in-law was a friend of the purchasing agent or so-and-so's wife is in a bridge club with
the company's owner, and so on. Companies are reluctant to admit that they may be
doing something wrong, and they wait for the next opportunity to come along.
      Now let's consider the case where the company overbids the project and is awarded
the contract anyway. This could actually be the worst thing for the company. Where the
company overbid and lost the project, there at least was some feedback to the company
that something was wrong, providing the impetus for doing business differently in the
future.
      When a company overbids a project and is awarded the contract, what budget will
the company assign to the project manager of this project? It will probably take the bid
price, reduce it by some acceptable level of profit, and ask the project manager to com-
plete the project with those funds.
      This sounds right except that, in this situation, the company overbid the project. As
a result, the company is going to over-budget the project. The reason is that it doesn't
really know that it had overbid the project in the first place.
      The project manager will measure the progress and the performance of the project
according to the allocated budget. As long as the project is completed on time and under
budget, and the requirements are all satisfied, no one is likely to complain about the
project performance. As time goes by, more jobs like this are bid and won, and the
company continues on with an acceptable profit. The projects are completed, and every-
one is happy. Ignorance is bliss.
      However, sooner or later a competitor is going to figure out that there is extra profit
to be made in this type of business. The competitor discovers this by doing a better cost
analysis than our company and starts to bid the same jobs but at a lower price.
      At first, there is no reaction. Lost work is considered just part of the normal business




                           ................. 11151$   $CH1   02-09-05 08:06:22   PS              PAGE 25

cycle. As time goes by and there is less and less business, the company may eventually
come to its senses, realize that its costs are too high, and take some corrective action.
     This is very hard for companies to do. They are in the situation where for years they
have been doing things the way they always have and been successful. Now they are
losing business, and they have a lot of trouble figuring out why. If they had had good
cost estimates they still might have been able to overbid the projects, but the budget for
the projects would have been based on more accurate cost estimates, and the profits
would have been larger. What must happen next is that the company must take those
excess profits and invest them in the company and modernize before being forced to do
so by their competition.
     We can see that the worst thing that could happen to companies is that they overesti-
mate costs. From that, they overbid work, over-budget projects, and learn inefficient ways
to do things. From all of that, they may go out of business.



                        Getting to the Scope Baseline
We are concerned about two major things in defining the scope of the project, the project
scope and the product scope. The product scope is all of the features and functions that
the completion of the project will provide to the stakeholders, whereas the project scope is
the work that must be done to deliver the product scope to the stakeholders.
      The first thing that happens in a project is usually characterized by the feeling of
wild and unbridled enthusiasm. This results in a great many things being included as the
needs of the project. In many respects this is a good thing. If the project has many good
things that can result, it is probably a good project to do. The problem is that many of
these things are not necessary or may be impractical. Many of the items may just not be
the things that the stakeholder needs or really wants.
      The solution is to have the project team and the stakeholders come together one or
more times and separate out the needs that everyone agrees are not going to be practical
or necessary for the project to be useful. When we reduce the needs of the project by
deleting the ones that everyone agrees are not part of the project, the result is a list of the
``requirements.''
      We are not nearly finished at this point. We have only reduced the project by the
items that everyone agrees to eliminate. We will need to further reduce these items by the
items that may not be good for the project. These items are not so obvious and will not
have the agreement of all the stakeholders. There will have to be some investigation and
some justification applied to make these items acceptable or not acceptable to the project.
When this analysis is completed the result is the project's scope baseline. This is the first
baseline that we will develop. We need to have the scope baseline before the remaining
two baselines, cost and schedule, can be completed.




                         ................. 11151$   $CH1   02-09-05 08:06:22   PS                 PAGE 26

      When moving from requirements to scope baseline, the items that are eliminated
from the project must be documented as exclusions to the project. It is important to do
this since, at one time, these items were thought to be good for the project by at least
some of the stakeholders. If their exclusion is not properly documented, they will return
again and again as new requirements to be considered.
      In all of these items that will or will not be included in the project there are a
number of factors that must be considered, such as cost, expense, time to develop, service,
and maintenance. These items are called the deliverables of the project or the product
scope definition.
      It is critically important that all of the stakeholders be involved with the parts of the
project in which they have a stake. To accomplish this there must be a good cooperative
relationship between the stakeholders and the project team. Detailed descriptions of the
intentions of the project must be obtained.
      All items making it to the scope baseline must be fully documented and clearly
defined. There must be measurable tangible results that will be achieved. These should
be documented along with the acceptance criteria as part of the scope definition. When
this is not done, scope cannot be controlled, and project scope tends to creep ever upward
with requests from the stakeholders that start out by saying, ``There is one little change
that we need to make to the project'' or ``This item should have been included in the
original scope of the project.''
      When all of this is completed, we will have developed a set of deliverables that the
stakeholders and the project team can agree upon. These deliverables must be formally
agreed to by all stakeholders, and there should be a formal sign-off. Everything should be
done to impress all of the participants in the project that the deliverables list is a conclu-
sive, exhaustive list of the things that the project is going to produce. There should be no
doubt in anyone's mind that the deliverables list that has been agreed to is final unless a
formal change is approved and paid for by someone. They must also know that approved
changes to the project after this point are going to result in increases in cost. Oftentimes
these changes are paid for by the customer or sponsor, but frequently the changes will be
absorbed by the company organization doing the project. In any case, if the scope changes
the project budget should be adjusted as well.
      To make all this possible, each of the project deliverables must be clear and concise.
Each deliverable must have tangible, measurable criteria that determine that the deliver-
able has been completed and accepted by the stakeholder. Every effort must be made to
avoid describing deliverables in a way that can be misunderstood. The situation where
the project team thinks they have completed a deliverable and the customer disagrees
must be avoided. It is also important when defining the scope that the acceptance criteria
for each of the deliverables be defined as well. The stakeholders are likely to accept the
acceptance criteria early in the project but will be more reluctant to accept the test criteria
later in the project. This is because as the project progresses and the stakeholders find

additional requirements they will attempt to include them in the test criteria for accep-
tance.
      For example, a project team determines that a user manual for the system they are
proposing will be required. The deliverable that they put into the scope of the project is
entered as ``User Manual,'' with no additional description. The customer sees this and
agrees to the item.
      When the user manual is delivered to the customer, it is a five-page document that
basically says to hit the green button to start and hit the red button to stop. The project
team does not want to give too much information to the customer, because they want
their own maintenance and support people to take care of problems that might arise in
the life of the product they are delivering.
      On the other hand, the customer's expectations were for a fully detailed user manual
that would allow them to understand the inner workings of the product delivered--200
or 300 pages of detailed information about the product and its use. Stakeholders want
this information because they do not want to be committed to the supplying company
forever. They are concerned that they may have to maintain the product after they have
terminated their relationship with the supplying company. They are also concerned that
the supplying company may go out of business.
      When this dilemma becomes known, usually late in the project when there are
many things to be done, the project team says that they have met the agreed-upon
requirement with their five-page user manual, and the stakeholders disagree. Generally,
at this point, the stakeholders appeal to higher levels of management in the project team's
company, and eventually the project team will write that 300-page manual.
      At this point in the development of the project scope we have determined what all
of the project deliverables are, and we have gotten full agreement from all of the stake-
holders. All of the deliverables are tangible and measurable items that cannot be easily
misunderstood. There has been a formal sign-off on the deliverables that are due to each
stakeholder. In addition to the deliverables being developed from a preliminary definition
to a detailed baseline for scope, there should be a development of risk in parallel to the
scope development. An order of magnitude estimate should be done to determine if the
project is feasible.



                         Work Breakdown Structure
At this point in our project development we have determined the deliverables that are
due to all the stakeholders. But we cannot plan the project from this list of deliverables.
To plan the project we must convert these into individual pieces of work that must be
done to complete the project. For this we need the ``work breakdown structure,'' or
WBS.

 Scope Management                                                                         29



     The work breakdown structure is the most central item in the project plan. Without
it we do not have a definition of the work that has to be done to complete the project.
Without knowing the work that has to be done we cannot possibly determine the cost of
the project or determine the schedule of the project.
     Without knowing the cost or schedule of the project how will it be possible to
control the project or determine how much should be spent to complete it? The amount
of resources that must be used on the project and when they must be made available
cannot be determined without knowing the schedule. Funding to do the project cannot
be scheduled to be in place when the project needs it without a time-phased budget for
the project. Without knowing the work to be performed on the project, risk management
cannot be done in a satisfactory way. These things cannot be done without the work
breakdown structure.
     According to the Guide to the PMBOK, the definition of a work breakdown structure
is:

     A deliverable oriented grouping of project components that organizes and defines
     the total scope of the project. Each descending level represents an increasing detailed
     definition of the project work. The WBS is decomposed into work packages. The
     deliverable orientation of the hierarchy includes both internal and external deliver-
     ables.

     Work outside the WBS is outside the scope of the project. In this definition of the
WBS, we are striving for a method to identify the work that is required to produce all of
the deliverables of the project. As we will see, with many projects it will be possible to
identify close to 95 percent of the work that must be done in the project.
     To create a WBS is a simple task: The project is first broken down into a group of
subprojects. Each of these subprojects can be broken down to sub-subprojects. The sub-
subprojects can be broken down again and again until the desired level of detail is
reached. The level of detail is termed the work package level. The work package is the
lowest level of management that the project manager needs to manage. Below the work
package other project team members may break down their parts of the project into
additional levels.
     The reason this technique is so effective is that it follows the principle of ``divide
and conquer.'' If we were to hold a meeting and write down a list of all the things that
had to be done to complete the project, the meeting would not produce a very good list.
In a meeting of this type where there is little focus, attention will drift into one area and
do a pretty good job of listing the work needed in that area and ignore other areas of the
project.
     A better way to do this is to break the project into smaller projects or products of
the project. When we do this we can think of each one of these subprojects as producing




                           ................. 11151$   $CH1   02-09-05 08:06:24   PS             PAGE 29

one or more of the deliverables of the whole project. In this way we can also think of the
WBS as a product-oriented breakdown as well. This allows project management to be-
come a methodology that will work well on the largest of projects or programs as well as
the smallest. At the top levels of the project, particularly large projects, think of these
early levels of breakdown as product breakdowns. This is because on larger projects there
can be a grouping of deliverables into large deliverables that might be called products.
      So, initially the project is broken up into a group of subprojects. These subprojects
are further broken down into sub-subprojects, and so on. In this way the largest project
we can imagine could be broken down into subprojects. Since each of these subprojects
could be considered to be a project in its own right, any large project can be thought of
as a family of smaller projects that are interrelated.
      A project can also be thought of as a microcosm or a macrocosm. At any level in
the breakdown structure, from the standpoint of the manager in charge of a particular
part of the project, there is a separate project for which he or she is responsible. All
projects are part of some larger project, and all projects have subprojects within them. It
is just a matter of perspective.
      For example, in the 1960s the United States took on the challenge of getting a man
to the moon and safely back to Earth. The resulting project was very large, employing
many thousands of people. The project manager lived in Washington, D.C., and spent
most of his time dealing with Congress and other parts of the government.
      When the Apollo Program was in full swing in the 1960s, it was a very large project
indeed. There were perhaps 40,000 people working on it at any given time. There was a
project to develop the engines for the Saturn V booster, the first stage of the launch
vehicle. This project had a project manager and many people involved. The engine devel-
opment project had several locations and several hundred people working on it. Within
this project there were other projects, such as engine testing, fuel systems, fuel delivery,
cooling, and so on.
      Although the engine development project for the Apollo program was a large effort,
it was only a small part of the program. Depending on where you were in the hierarchy
of the program, you might consider yourself as a program manager, a project manager,
or even a subproject manager.
      As a matter of practicality, it does not make sense for the top-level program manager
or project manager to manage all of the details of the project. In fact it is not necessary
for him or her to even know about them. So, we can see that extremely large projects
result in smaller projects or subprojects. The subprojects are themselves projects in their
own right and have their own work breakdown structures. Each project may be part of
some bigger project or macrocosm, and each project may have smaller projects, or micro-
cosms, within it.
      The important thing about project management is that it is a powerful methodology
that adapts to any size project or program. The tools and methodology that are used are

 Scope Management                                                                         31



similar in all projects. The WBS is the tool that allows all projects to be broken down
into smaller, more manageable projects.
      The end result of the WBS is a group of individual pieces of work defined. Each of
these small individual pieces of work must be assigned to one person on the project team.
The primary purpose of the WBS is to divide the project into subprojects until a point is
reached where this assignment of the individual pieces of work can be made.
      For a large project the WBS might stop at a rather high level. This may be the level
of control for the project manager. As mentioned above, this level of the WBS is generally
called the work package. It must be understood that at this high level other project
managers will take the lowest level of the initial breakdown and further break it down
until the individual piece of work is reached.
      The bottom level of any project, then, must be the place where an individual piece
of work that can be done by one person or a group is described. This person or group of
persons is actually going to accomplish the work rather than manage the work. This level
is considered to be the task or activity level.
      There is a change in terminology in this area, and the Guide to the PMBOK is not
entirely clear as to the terms used. The WBS breaks down the project into manageable
pieces but stops at the work package level. The work package is the lowest level that the
project manager would have under his or her direct control. It is then possible to break
the work packages down further before the actual work assignments at the detail level are
made. Work packages can be broken down into ``activities,'' and activities can be further
broken down into ``tasks.''
      The Guide to the PMBOK refers to the lowest level of the WBS as the work package
level. Work package managers will further divide the work of the project into what they
consider to be subprojects and work packages. Common usage has the task or activity at
the lowest level of the ultimate WBS.
      I recommend that the WBS be developed just for one purpose--to discover all of
the work that must be done to complete the project. If an attempt is made to use the
WBS to simultaneously produce an organization chart, a chart of accounts for the project,
or any of the other organizational requirements of the project, it is likely that the attempt
to discover all of the work to be done will fail. These items, the ``organizational break-
down structure'' (OBS) and the ``chart of accounts'' should be separate items from the
WBS that are related through the lower level elements of the WBS.

Systems Approach to Work Breakdown Structure
At this point we have broken the project down into subprojects and continued this
breakdown to the work package level. In smaller projects, the work package level may be
the task or activity level where the work actually takes place. In larger projects it may be
that the work package has a work package manager who continues to divide the work
into lower levels until the task or activity level is reached.

       It is extremely important that each of the lowest levels have only one person respon-
sible for the work that is to be done to satisfy that work component, regardless of whether
it is called work package, task, or activity.
       What's next? We have identified all the work in the project. Our ability to do this,
however, defines only about 90 percent of the work that is necessary. We would like to
be able to more accurately identify more of the work that is required.
       According to the systems management concept, all work is considered to be a system
where the work is a process that converts inputs to outputs. Taking this concept to the project
level, we can describe a project as a process that converts inputs, resources, money, and
people's effort into outputs, the deliverables of the project.
       If we apply this concept to our work breakdown structure, we could say that each
task at the bottom level of our WBS is a process that converts inputs to outputs. The
inputs are something that the task owner needs from some other part of the project or
from somewhere external to the project. The outputs are items that are needed in some
other part of the project or are items that represent all or part of a deliverable.
       We can apply these ideas to our definition of project work. Each person responsible
for a task looks to other tasks to find the items needed for a specific task. Each will also
look for other parts of the project to deliver the outputs. In this way each person on the
project team must look at each input and output at least two times. All inputs to a task
must come from somewhere inside the project or from some external source. All outputs
from a task must go to another task in the project or directly contribute to the delivery
of a deliverable.
       Input items that cannot be found externally or from outputs of other project tasks
must be added to other project tasks. Output items that cannot be delivered to other
parts of the project or to a deliverable can be considered extra work. In this way almost
all of the additional work not already in the plan can be discovered. In addition, all of
the work that has been developed in the project that can be considered ``creeping ele-
gance'' can be dropped from the project plan.
       Last of all, there is a good chance that duplicated work can be eliminated as well.
When a task owner who is seeking input for the task work finds more than one task
supplying the same or nearly the same input, one or the other may be eliminated.

Work Breakdown Structure Dictionary
The work breakdown structure dictionary is used to expand on the information for each
of the elements in the WBS. For each element it should contain an elemental statement
of work, schedule and duration, budget, all of the associated elements and activities
related to it, the organization responsible, and the risks associated with it.

Additional Project Breakdown Structures
It is important to recognize that there are many other types of breakdowns used in
projects. The WBS that we have been discussing must be used only to generate the




                         ................. 11151$   $CH1   02-09-05 08:06:25   PS                 PAGE 32

individual pieces of work that must be done in the project. To try to use the WBS to
develop anything else would confuse the effort and make the identification of work less
effective.
      Other breakdown structures that are used that should not be confused with the
WBS are:

      * Contractual WBS (CWBS). This breakdown is used to define the reporting infor-
mation and the timeliness of information that a supplier will supply to the buyer. It is
usually not as detailed as the WBS that is used to plan the work that is going to be done.
      * Organizational Breakdown Structure (OBS). The main purpose of this structure is
to show the organization of resources and of the people who will work on the project. In
the OBS, the work components of the WBS are shown related to the groups of individu-
als and resources that will accomplish the work.
      * Resource Breakdown Structure (RBS). This is a refinement of the OBS in that the
detail of the RBS generally goes to the individual level.
      * Bill of Material (BOM). The various product components are included in the
BOM in a hierarchical way. Products produced, subassemblies, and lower level of assem-
bly are shown as a ``goes into'' hierarchy.
      * Risk Breakdown Structure (RBS). This is a hierarchical listing of the project risks
according to the risk categories that were developed for this project.


                                  Scope Verification
Scope verification takes place at the end of the project. Once the scope of the project has
been defined and delivered, the scope of the project delivered must be verified. This
means getting approval of the delivered scope of the project from all of the stakeholders.
Generally it is a good practice to get the stakeholders to agree to the acceptance criteria
at the beginning of the project rather than the end of it. A set of acceptance criteria is
drawn up and the acceptance criteria are agreed to when the project scope is accepted by
the stakeholders.


                              Change Management
A change control process must be put in place to control the project once the scope
baseline has been set. The change control process is a formal process that controls the
project scope baseline. The change management must be in place early in the project,
certainly no later than the completion of the scope baseline.
      The point of the change management process is to establish recognition for changes




                          ................. 11151$   $CH1   02-09-05 08:06:25   PS            PAGE 33

in the project funding whenever there is a change in the project scope. Changes in scope
and funding do not necessarily mean increases in project scope and funding. Many times
there can be agreed-upon changes that reduce the project scope or increase it.
      In the change management process there are certain essentials that must be included
regardless of whether the project changes are funded internally or externally to the proj-
ect. The proposed change must first be evaluated as to how much time and effort it will
take to evaluate the implementation of the change. Stakeholders who ask for new things
to be incorporated into the project can bog down a project team. The investigation of
these changes can cost much in time and effort. So, the first thing that needs to take
place in the change management process is that the stakeholder must authorize funding
to investigate the change itself.
      Once this funding is approved, the project team can bring in additional resources
to complete the investigation. The investigation must include the effect that the change
has on all other things that are being done in the project. Once the effect on cost,
schedule, and scope of the project is determined, a justification for the change can take
place. If the justification is adequate and the stakeholder wishes to authorize the funds
for the change, the change can move into the project plan.
      The change management process is actually a small project plan. All of the things
that must be done in planning a project must be done for project changes as well. When
all of this has been done, the project baselines of cost, schedule, and scope are changed,
and the new project plan is implemented.


                                 Project Justifications
There are many reasons for doing projects. Some of them are more tangible than others.
Projects may be a response to a government order, such as a redesign of an unsafe auto-
mobile or changing a process that is found to be polluting air or water. Other projects
may be justified by the opportunity to create a new business or enter a new field. The
potential benefits of a project can be the result of a market demand for a product, a
customer request, a government requirement, or meeting or creating new competition or
social needs.
       Of course, one of the strongest and most compelling project justifications is the
concept of a benefit occurring to the organization after making some effort. The most
efficient way to measure this is to compare the monetary benefits to the monetary cost of
the project. To this end, many justification methods have been developed over the years.
It is important to use the appropriate method for project justification. The selection of a
justification technique has its own costs and benefits. Some methods produce results that
consider many aspects of the project costs and benefits, while others consider only some
of these factors. Of course, the more aspects of the project that are considered, the higher
will be the cost of the justification itself.

     These analysis techniques are forms of cash flow analysis. Cash flow analysis is mea-
suring the cash flowing into and out of an organization over time. Projects that have
more cash flowing into the organization than cash flowing out of the organization are
good projects. In most projects it is necessary to make an investment in the project (cash
outflow) before the benefits can begin (cash inflow).

The Breakeven Chart
The breakeven chart is useful when comparing two or more alternatives. In the question
of justifying a project, doing the project can be compared to not doing the project. Where
there is more than one choice, several alternatives can be considered at the same time.
      Refer to Figure 1-1. The vertical axis shows dollars, and the horizontal axis shows
time. The variable cost of each of the alternatives is plotted over time and is plotted from
time zero. In the case of an alternative requiring that money be spent before the benefits
of the project can be realized, the variable cost is plotted from a point on the vertical axis
representing the total fixed, one-time cost of the project. In the case of an ongoing
alternative, the choice of doing nothing, there is no fixed cost. At some point in time, if
the project has an overall benefit, the lines will cross. This is the ``breakeven point,'' the
point where the benefits of doing the project outweigh the cost of doing the project when
compared to not doing the project at all. The point on the horizontal time axis is the
point in time when this occurs. This point in time is also called the ``payback period.''
      For example, suppose a manufacturing plant has a machine that is used to make
left-handed widgets. The machine is getting old. The machine can manufacture widgets

for $2 per widget. A new machine can be purchased and installed that will manufacture
widgets for $1.50 each. If the company makes 25,000 widgets per month, and the new
machine costs $200,000, what is the breakeven point of the project? (See Figure 1-2.)

      Problems with Breakeven Charts
      I said earlier that the simpler methods of justification are less expensive to use but
produce results that do not consider as many factors as other techniques. The breakeven-
point method has some shortcomings.
      The time that exists after the breakeven point is reached is not considered. This
means that projects that have a high early return will be favored over projects that may
have higher returns in the long run. For example, buying a cheap machine that wears out
quickly and has high maintenance costs is favored over a machine that is built to last
longer but costs more to buy.
      Because breakeven-point charts are used as a very rough justification method, it is
usually assumed that the production rates are constant, allowing the use of linear variable
cost lines.

Average Rate of Return on Investment
One way to add a little more accuracy to our justification technique is to eliminate the
problem of shortsightedness that exists in the breakeven-point and payback-period analy-

ses. In these techniques the analysis stops when the payback point or the breakeven point
is reached.
      The ``average-rate-of-return-on-investment'' method solves this problem by using
the same time period to compare alternative projects. Regardless of when the project has
its payback point or breakeven point, the time period in this justification method covers
the approximate life of the project. It then measures all of the cash flows from the begin-
ning of the investment to the end of the useful life of the project. In this way we consider
all of the money that is being spent.
      For example, to expand on our example from above, let's say that the sales forecast
for widgets changes over time, and that the maintenance cost of the new machine is now
recognized. Table 1-1 summarizes the data. We can see from the table that the total cash
flow for this project was a positive $935,000. This represents a return on our investment
of $200,000, or 468 percent, an average rate over ten years of 46.8 percent.
      This method of project justification is not often used these days because the more
sophisticated methods of justification have become easier to calculate since the appearance
of the personal computer. However, using these methods requires more time and effort
to collect data and make forecasts.

Present Value of Money
Before we talk about the more sophisticated methods of justification, we should look at
the present value of money and the net present value of money.
      Suppose I borrow $100 from you today and pay you back $100 tomorrow. This is
a reasonable transaction among friends. But suppose I borrow $100 from you and don't
pay it back to you for two years. Is this still a fair arrangement? You should say ``No!''
because I have had the use of your money for two years and have paid you nothing for
the use of your money. If I had not borrowed the money from you, you could have
invested the money in something, and you would have had something more than the
$100 you started with.
      This is the idea behind using the present value of money. Money that I receive in
the future is worth less than money I receive now. This is not to say that money I receive
in the future is worthless--it's just worth less than money I get today. The further into
the future I receive the money, the less valuable it is to me today. In the example, I
should have given you back $115 for borrowing $100 from you for two years.
      The calculation that I use to figure out what my $100 will be worth two years from
now is the compound interest formula:
      If you invest $100 at 7 percent interest for one year, you would receive $107.
                                       FV  PV  (PV  I)
    where PV is the present value of the money, FV is the future value of the same
money, and I is the interest rate paid by the investment.

     If you leave the money in the bank at the same interest rate, you would get more

    With a little manipulation, the series of calculations can be generalized into the
compound interest formula:
                                          FV  PV (1  I)n

     The new term in this formula is n, the number of time periods that the interest is
applied.
     Your $100 invested at 7 percent for two years looks like this:
                                      FV  100 (1  .07)2
                                      FV  100 (1.07)2
                                      FV  100 (1.1449)
                                      FV  114.49

     Now that we have reviewed compound interest calculations, it is time to look at
calculating the present value of money that we will get in the future. This is really just
the compound interest calculation solved for the present value instead of the future value.
     Start with the compound interest formula:
                                          FV  PV (1  I)n

     Solve for the present value:
                                        PV  FV / (1  I)n

      Now let's say that we can do something that will result in a return of $100 two
years from now. We would like to know what the equivalent present value of that money
is. Remember that money we receive in the future is worth less than money we receive
now. Here we are trying to determine the present value of the $100 we will receive two
years from now.
                                        PV           FV / (1  I)n
                                        PV           100 / (1.07)2
                                        PV           100 / 1.1449
                                        PV           87.34

     You can check this number by calculating the future value of $87.34 invested at 7
percent for two years. The result should be $100.

     To bring all this into the context of a project, projects usually start out by investing
an amount of money at the beginning of the project and receiving benefits from the
project in the future. By using the present value calculations we can now more accurately
determine the true value of the project. Projects that have very high returns early in the
project's useful life will be considered better projects than projects that have the same
returns but later in the project.
     ``Net present value'' is the sum of all the cash flows of a project adjusted to present
values. For example, suppose we have two projects that have the same initial cost of
$100,000. The two projects have the same net cash flows as well, but the time that the
money comes to us is different. The interest rate for borrowing money is 7 percent. Table
1-2 illustrates the present value cash flow.
     Notice that here the two projects have the same total return over the ten-year life of
the projects, but project A gets more of the returns sooner, making the net present value
of the money higher. Remember, the present value of the money is the value today of
money that will be received in the future.
     In this justification analysis, we considered much more than in previous methods.
Here we recognized all of the costs and revenues that occur over the useful life of the
project. If this were a project to buy a machine, for example, we would look at the cash
flows over the expected life of the machine. This would allow us to consider the effect of
changing sales forecasts and changing maintenance costs. Then we can adjust for the time
value of the money that is involved in the project. This method gives us a pretty good
idea of which projects should be selected over other projects.
     There is one difficulty with this method. There is a problem distinguishing small
projects that have small investments and relatively small returns when compared to large
projects. The method of justification we have just seen tells us only the net present value
of the project. It does not tell us whether we would be better off selecting a number of
small projects or a few large ones. What we need is a method of justification that gives us
a single value that will be highest for the most favorable project, regardless of size. If we
had a method like that, we would be able to rank all of our potential projects by this
value and use the ranking order to pick the projects that are the most favorable for
financial reasons.

Internal Rate of Return on Investment
The internal rate of return on investment (IRR) method meets all of the criteria for a
justification method that gives a single value. It is, however, the most complicated of
them all. For practical reasons, a computer is required to make the calculations.
      In the last example we looked at the cash flows of two different projects. Both of
the projects had the same total cash flow at the end of their useful life, but one of them
was favored because of the adjustment of the value of future monies received. The factor
in our calculations that brought about this result was the interest rate that was used. It

should be clear that if the interest rate were zero, both projects would be the same in
terms of desirability.
      What we are really talking about here is what we can do with our money. We usually
want to use money to finance projects that will return money to us in the future. But all
of these projects have risk attached to them. There is the possibility that we will spend
all the money on the project, and it will not work. The marketplace might change, and
the expected revenues are not what we had predicted. Many other things can go wrong
in any business venture.
      Since all of the projects we run into in business have some risk associated with them,
we might want to consider what a risk-free investment might be. There is such a thing.
For example, investing in U.S. Treasury bills is considered a risk-free investment. Gener-
ally speaking, however, investing in the projects of a company and taking advantage of
business opportunities are going to generate a higher return on our investment than
putting the same money into U.S. Treasury bills.
      Suppose interest rates were higher. If they were high enough, we could consider
putting money into the risk-free investment of U.S. Treasury bills. If they were not high
enough, we would invest in projects. At any given interest rate, it would be wise to invest
in some projects and not in others. With this in mind, we can come up with another
justification system.
      In the internal rate of return on investment justification method, we are calculating
the interest rate on Treasury bills that would make the proposed project and investing in
the Treasury bills ``equal opportunities.''
      To make the calculation we compare the net present value of the project at the end
of its useful life to the net present value of the risk-free investment. At low interest rates
the project with the risk and relatively higher cash flows into the organization will be
favored. As interest rates increase, the difference between the two investments will change
and become smaller until the interest rate is high enough to make investing in the risk-
free investment as favorable as investing in the risky investment.
      Notice that when we look at projects this way, the size of the project does not
matter. Only the value of the project matters.
      These calculations need to be done by a computer, because the calculations cannot
be handled algebraically but must be solved in an iterative manner. An example will show
this best.
      Suppose we take the project from the previous example and look at what the cash
flows would be at various interest rates (Table 1-3). If we calculate the present value of
each of the cash flows, we will find that at the end of the time period of the project, the
net cash flows are either positive or negative. We have the cash flows already calculated
at 7 percent interest. Now we will calculate the net present value cash flows for various
interest rates.

     We use the equation:
                                          FV  1 / (1  int)n
      where FV is the future value of the cash flow, int is the proposed equivalent interest
rate in decimal form, and n is the number of the time periods from present to future
value.
      When we have reached the point when the net cash flows are no longer positive,
then, for the time period in question, we have found the equivalent interest rate that
would make investing in a risk-free investment equal to investing in the project. Referring
to Table 1-3, we can see that this interest rate is between 40 percent and 42.5 percent.

                                               Summary
The most common reason for project failure is not clearly identifying what exactly is to
be delivered by the project. The project charter is a device that helps get the project off
the ground and headed in the right direction. It allows project managers to express their
understanding of the project and what its accomplishments are intended to be.
      All of the stakeholders in the project must be identified. A stakeholder is any person
who has something to gain or lose in the carrying out of the project. The project team,
the customer, the management of the supplying company, and many others are all stake-
holders.
      The project manager must have input into the pricing of the project. The price
should not be determined by the cost of the project, but the cost of the project is a very
real consideration in making sure that the project benefits are high enough to justify the
cost.
      The scope baseline is the first of the three baselines that measure the success of the
project. Without the scope baseline it is not possible for the cost and schedule baselines
to be meaningful.
      The work breakdown structure is the heart of the project. From the work break-
down structure it is possible to determine the detailed definitions of the work that has to
be done in the project. It is the basis for making a bottom-up estimate and for producing
the project schedule.
      Change management is initiated as soon as it is practical in the definition of the
scope of work for the project. It must be implemented by the time the scope baseline is
defined. From that point on all changes to the project scope should be traceable to an
authorized change.
      All projects must be justified. There are many justification methods for projects.
With the exception of mandated projects, projects are justified on the basis of cost versus
benefits. Today, because of the availability of sophisticated, fast computers, the internal
rate of return on investment (IRR) has become the most popular method of financial
justification of projects.

                                                           Time Management



T
     he Guide to the Project Management Body of Knowledge describes project time
     management as ``the process used to ensure the timely completion of the project.''
     The guide goes on to say that there are five major processes that are required to do
proper project time management:

     1. Activity Definition. Defining the specific activities that are necessary to complete
the project and produce all of the project deliverables.
     2. Activity Sequencing. Identifying the sequence in which the activities must be
done. This is the same as identifying the interdependencies that the activities have be-
tween each other and inputs external to the project.
     3. Activity Duration Estimating. In addition to the cost estimate for each activity in
the project plan, the duration of time that is necessary for each activity must be estimated.
     4. Schedule Development. Analyzing all of the data available to determine the project
schedule that will work for the project.
     5. Schedule Control. Controlling changes that occur in the project that affect the
project schedule.


                                   Activity Definition
The main tool that is required for the definition of the activity as well as the determina-
tion of the duration and sequence of activities is the work breakdown structure (WBS).
If you recall, in our discussion of the WBS, we found that it was used to methodically
break down the project into manageable subprojects.

                                                      47

       The end result of this breakdown process is the creation of the lowest level of
breakdown. This lowest level of breakdown comprises the individual pieces of work that
must be done to complete the project. Because the WBS is a representation of the entire
project in various levels of detail, it represents all the work that must be done to complete
the project. The WBS defines the lowest level of control that the project manager is
required to manage. This is the work package level. From the viewpoint of the subproject
manager, this level of control may reach down to the work package; it may be broken
down further to the activity level or still further to the individual activity level.
       The result of this decomposition is that the work packages are decomposed into
activities. The activities represent the necessary work that must be done to complete all
of the deliverables of the project. If there is similarity to projects that have been planned
successfully in the past then it is possible to start with a template from the previous
project as a starting point for the activity descriptions.
       The WBS represents all of the work that the project team must do to complete the
project. Before the scheduling work can begin, the scope statement, the constraints and
assumptions, and any other historical information must be reviewed to be certain that
the work definition is correct and complete.
       The schedule, like the project plan, can be progressively elaborated. This is called
rolling wave planning. This approach is helpful in large or long-term projects where there
is some uncertainty about continuing with the project beyond a certain point in time. In
this technique the work packages that are further in the future are planned at only a high
level. Work packages that are closer in time are planned in detail. The result of this
technique is that we can save a lot of planning time by not planning things that have a
relatively high chance of never reaching execution. An example of this type of project
would be the development of a pharmaceutical product. Many new drugs reach the
experimental stage but few of them are actually brought to market.
       Planning components may be included in the WBS. These components can be used
for planning later parts of the project. These components may also contain accounting
information and separate account numbers to collect the cost of the planning work when
it is done.



                                  Activity Sequencing
The activity's identity comes from the work breakdown structure. When the WBS is
completed, the bottom of the work breakdown structure defines the individual pieces of
work that are necessary to complete the project. These individual pieces of work are the
same items that become the activities in the project schedule. One of the things that is
done in the development of the WBS is to check that each of the activities has inputs for
the work required. Each output from an activity is used by another activity or is required

 Time Management                                                                          49



as a part of a project deliverable. Since an activity requires something from another
activity, which is that activity's output, both activities must be done in sequence or at
least partly so. An activity that is not complete but delivers enough of its outputs to the
dependent activity to allow it to start can overlap the dependent activity. Taking advan-
tage of this and scheduling activities to be done in parallel when they would have other-
wise been done in sequence is called fast tracking.
      Dependencies can be categorized as mandatory, discretionary, or external, and they
can be restricted by constraints and assumptions. Mandatory dependencies are those that
are required as part of the nature of the work. These dependencies are sometimes called
``hard'' dependencies. For example, the walls of a house cannot be built until the founda-
tion is completed. Discretionary dependencies are those that are defined by management.
These are preferred ways of doing things and may be determined by past experiences.
External dependencies are those that are external to the project. These are all of the inputs
that are supplied by anyone or anything outside the project.

Activity on Arrow Diagramming
Activity on arrow diagramming (AOA) is a network diagramming method that is seldom
used today. Still, there are a number of places where these can still be seen (mainly in the
PMBOK). Nearly all, if not all, software programs that are available for project manage-
ment scheduling have stopped using this diagramming method. However, because they
are still present in the latest release of the Guide to the PMBOK, we will discuss them
here very briefly.
      In activity on arrow diagrams the network diagram will always be shown with the
activity information on the arrows instead of in the nodes of the diagram. The nodes of
an activity on arrow diagram will always be shown as circles. This diagramming nomen-
clature is always followed.
      Each activity in the diagram has two events associated with it. These events are of
zero duration and are located at the beginning of the arrow and at the end of the arrow.
This means that there are three things associated with each activity in the diagram: the
activity description itself, the starting event of the activity, and the ending event of the
activity.
      The one advantage of this diagramming method is that, since the arrow is a line,
the length of the line can be varied in proportion to the duration of the activity. This can
be helpful in recognizing the magnitude of the duration of the activity. However, most
project management professionals feel that the complexity and difficulty in using this
diagramming method is not compensated for by this feature.
      Since the arrows in the diagram in Figure 2-1 represent the activities, it is necessary
to create dummy activities to show multiple dependencies in the project being repre-
sented.
      Calculations of schedules using this diagramming method are a bit more compli-

same.

Gantt Charts and Milestone Charts
Once the schedule has been determined it is necessary to communicate it to those who
will use it for information about the project schedule. Both of these techniques are good
communication techniques and have their place alongside of the network diagram.
      The Gantt chart is the familiar bar chart that we have all seen many times. It has
horizontal bars, one for each activity. There is a timescale that is usually linear. The
bars are drawn proportional to their duration with the start and finish of the activity
corresponding to the dates on the timescale. Using project management software it is
possible to annotate the bars with color and text information from the database for the
project. Care must be taken to limit the amount of data displayed so that clutter does
not occur.

      The milestone chart is a simplification of the Gantt chart. In the days before comput-
ers, Gantt charts were done on large pieces of paper, usually several large pieces of paper.
If each of the projects were to submit the full schedule to the project manager's manager
the volume of paper would be overwhelming. To solve this problem, the project managers
instead reported milestones. A milestone represents a group of work activities, usually an
element in the work breakdown structure. Milestones have a duration of zero. The mile-
stones could all be plotted on one chart for the manager, called the milestone chart.
      Milestones can be created in project management software by creating an activity
that has a duration of zero. Project management software actually gives us a better choice,
and it is done automatically. If the WBS is entered into the software it will automatically
create summary activities that show the start and finish dates for the earliest start and the
latest scheduled finish date for the activities subordinate to them. If all of the WBS is
entered there will be a summarizing hierarchy of all of the elements in the WBS including
a project summary bar, which shows the start and finish schedule for the project.

Precedence Diagramming Method (PDM)
Precedence diagramming is the method currently being used in nearly all of the project
management scheduling software available today. This diagram is used to explain the
mechanics of scheduling.
      Precedence diagrams can be easily recognized. The network diagram will always be
shown with the activity information on the nodes instead of on the arrows of the diagram.
The nodes of an activity on precedence diagrams will always be shown as rectangles. This
diagramming form is always followed.
      In its simplest form the diagram contains boxes to indicate the activities in the
schedule and arrows connecting them. The boxes can contain any activity information
that is desired, and all of the project management scheduling software today has a great
deal of flexibility in this regard. Today, all of this is done through the use of computer
software for project management scheduling. The software allows you to annotate the
boxes in the diagram with nearly any information you desire. Color and symbols can be
used effectively to describe the diagram more fully.
      The basic information normally included in the precedence diagram boxes is the
activity number, description, early start, early finish, late start, late finish, and duration.
The arrows connect the activities according to the logic that is required by the project.
The arrows indicate the logical order that the activities may be worked on. The logic of
the schedule can be considered as two activity pairs at a time. A pair of activities is any
two (and only two) activities that are joined by an arrow. The tail (the part without the
head) of the arrow indicates the independent activity of the pair, and the head of the
arrow indicates the dependent activity. Reading the logic of the diagram is easy if you
keep this in mind and always consider the logical relationships of the network two activi-
ties at a time.




                            ................. 11151$   $CH2   02-09-05 08:06:29   PS              PAGE 51

     By saying that a relationship exists between two and only two activities, I do not
mean to say that any activity cannot have more than one relationship. An activity might
have two or more predecessors, and it might have two or more successors (Figure 2-3).
The relationship has only two activities associated with it, however.


                                  Logical Relationships
Four logical relationships are possible. These relationships can be remembered if you use
the same statement to describe the relationship and simply substitute the letters designat-
ing the relationship. The statement is: The independent activity must (first letter of the
relationship) before the dependent activity can (second letter of the relationship), as
shown in Figure 2-4.

Finish-Start Relationship (FS)
Most projects that you are likely to encounter will use the logical relationship of finish-
start more often than any other relationship. This relationship is stated like this: The
independent activity in the relationship must finish before the dependent activity can
start.
       This simply says that where there are two activities connected by an arrow, the one
that is connected to the tail of the arrow must be finished before the dependent activity
connected to the head of the arrow is allowed to start. It does not say that the dependent
activity must start at that point; it could start later, but it is not allowed to start any
sooner than the finish of the independent activity.
       For example, I have two activities to complete in my project, which is to construct
a wedding cake. The activities are to make the cake and put on the frosting. The finish-
start relationship says that I cannot start putting the frosting on the cake until I have
baked the cake layers. Notice that I could, logically, put the frosting on any time after
that. The relationship constricts the start of the activity of frosting the cake to be no
sooner than the finish of baking the cake.

Start-Start Relationship (SS)
The start-start relationship is stated in the same way as the finish-start relationship except
that the word start is substituted for finish. The relationship is stated like this: The inde-
pendent activity in the relationship must start before the dependent activity can start.
      This simply says that where there are two activities connected by an arrow, the one
that is connected to the tail of the arrow must start before the activity connected to the
head of the arrow is allowed to start. It does not say that the dependent activity must
start then. The activity could start later than that time, but it is not allowed to start any
sooner than the start of the independent activity.

         Leads or lags add or subtract time to the arrowhead event.


      For example, using the above example of constructing a wedding cake, I do not
want to apply the frosting to the cake until the master chef is on scene. The two activities
then are: (1) apply frosting to cake, and (2) master chef supervises cake construction. The
start-start relationship says that I cannot start putting the frosting on the cake until I have
the master chef present. Notice that I could, logically, put the frosting on any time after
that. The relationship constricts the start of the activity of frosting the cake to be no
sooner than the beginning of the master chef supervising the cake construction.

Finish-Finish Relationship (FF)
The finish-finish relationship is expressed in the same way as the finish-start relationship
except that the word finish is substituted for start. The relationship is stated like this: The
independent activity in the relationship must finish before the dependent activity can
finish.
      This says that where there are two activities connected by an arrow, the one that is
connected to the tail of the arrow must finish before the activity connected to the head
of the arrow is allowed to finish. It does not say that the dependent activity must finish
then. The activity could finish later than that time, but it is not allowed to finish any
sooner than the finish of the independent activity.
      For example, using the example of applying the frosting to the wedding cake, I must
have the master chef there until the frosting is complete so that he or she can approve it.

The master chef is then restricted from finishing the supervising activity until the frosting
activity is finished. The two activities are: (1) apply frosting to cake, and (2) master chef
supervises cake construction. The finish-finish relationship says that the master chef can-
not finish supervising the cake construction until the frosting is completed. Notice that I
could, logically, have the master chef continue supervising after that. The relationship
constricts the finish of the master chef supervising activity to be no sooner than the finish
of the frosting activity.

Start-Finish Relationship (SF)
The start-finish relationship is very seldom used and has even been dropped from some
of the project management scheduling software packages. This relationship is stated in
the same sentence as the finish-start relationship except that the words start and finish are
substituted for finish and start. The relationship is stated like this: The independent
activity in the relationship must start before the dependent activity can finish.
      This says that where there are two activities connected by an arrow, the one that is
connected to the tail of the arrow must start before the activity connected to the head of
the arrow is allowed to finish. It does not say that the dependent activity must finish
then. The dependent activity could finish later than that time, but it is not allowed to
finish any sooner than the start of the independent activity.
      For an example, using the wedding cake example again, the project is still to con-
struct a wedding cake, and the activity is to apply the frosting to the cake. We do not
want to finish applying the frosting to the cake until the master chef is on the scene. The
two activities then are: (1) apply frosting to cake and (2) master chef supervises cake
construction. Remember that the start-start relationship says that I cannot start putting
the frosting on the cake until I have the master chef present. The start-finish relationship
says that I can start putting on the frosting of the cake before the master chef is present,
but I am not allowed to finish putting on the frosting until the master chef has started
supervising. Notice that I could, logically, start putting the frosting on any time before
the master chef begins to supervise. The relationship constricts the finish of the activity
of frosting the cake to be no sooner than the beginning of the master chef supervising
the cake construction.
      These relationships must be available to project managers and schedulers in order
to be able to schedule all of the real relationships that are necessary to properly schedule
a project. They are seldom used until attempts are made to reduce total schedule time.
      In the examples involving frosting the cake, I related the frosting of the cake to the
presence of the master chef to supervise the operations. At first the relationship was a
start-start relationship, in which the frosting operation had to wait until the master chef
began supervising. If we were trying to shorten the schedule, one of the things that might
help would be to change the relationship between these two activities to a start-finish




                           ................. 11151$   $CH2   02-09-05 08:06:30   PS             PAGE 55

relationship. This would allow the frosting of the cake to begin much sooner but still
require that the master chef supervise the completion of the activity.
Leads and Lags
To complete our discussion of relationships between schedule activities we must discuss
leads and lags. Leads and lags are delays that are imposed in the relationship between the
independent and dependent activity. They can help to shorten schedules as well as allow
for delays between activities. Leads and lags are designated by adding a plus for lags, and
a minus for leads, as well as the number of time periods that the lead or lag adds to the
schedule.
      A lag causes the dependent activity of the pair of activities in the relationship to
have a designated number of time periods added to the start or finish of the dependent
activity. A lead causes the dependent activity of the pair of activities in the relationship
to have a designated number of time periods subtracted from the start or finish of the
dependent activity.
      For example, in the two activities previously discussed, baking the cake and putting
the frosting on the cake, we established a finish-start relationship between the two activi-
ties. This said that we could not apply the frosting until the cake was baked. This is all
right if the baking the cake activity included the time for the cake to cool. If it did not,
and the cake activity ended when it was removed from the oven, then it would be neces-
sary to insert a lag between the two activities. It is not possible to put the frosting on a
hot cake, since it would melt and make a mess. This may be necessary because the cake
baker would like to have closure on the baking activity and go about doing other things,
and we may not want him to be responsible for waiting until the cake cools.
      We would change the relationship from an FS to an FS  1. This would force the
schedule to allow one time period between completion of the baking activity and the
start of the frosting activity.
      A lead, on the other hand, allows the dependent activity to start sooner than the
logical relationship would normally allow. In the example showing the start-finish rela-
tionship, we wanted to show that the frosting activity could start sooner in this relation-
ship than if it used a start-start relationship. The problem with the start-finish
relationship is that the frosting activity could start very much earlier than the supervising
activity. The result of this might mean that the person responsible for the frosting cannot
get closure on the activity until the master chef arrives. Another way to show this relation-
ship is to make it an SS 1 relationship. This means that the frosting operation could
start as early as one time period before the master chef arrives.

                         Diagramming Relationships
The convention used in network diagramming of relationships and leads and lags is that
the relationship is shown on the logical arrow only if it is not a finish-start relationship.
If there are no leads or lags, no designation is given.

Project Start and Project Finish Events
Each activity in the diagram will always have a predecessor and a successor if the following
convention is used. The convention is to create two events, the start of the project and
the finish of the project. An event is a project activity that has zero duration and marks a
place of significance in the project. Creating a start and finish event for the project
allows all other activities to have at least one predecessor and at least one successor. This
convention keeps the diagram tidy and avoids having multiple places in the diagram
where the project can start and finish. These are called ``danglers.''
      Since nodes (the boxes) represent the activities in the diagram, it is not necessary to
create dummy activities to show multiple dependencies in the project being represented.
Notice that it is easy to show multiple relationships between activities. Activity 4 in the
diagram in Figure 2-3 is dependent on activity 1 and activity 2, as well as the start of the
project.

Logical Precedence Diagram
At this point it is possible to lay out the logical relationships of the project activities. The
activities themselves came from the work breakdown structure. There should be a one-
to-one correspondence between the activities that resulted at the bottom of the work
breakdown structure and the activities that are in the schedule. The logical relationship
between the activities is also determined in the development of the work breakdown
structure. We accomplished this when we developed the inputs and outputs for each
activity in the work breakdown structure. Since inputs required for one activity are the
outputs for another activity, this gives us much of the information we need for sequencing
the order of the activities.

      Activity Durations
      The durations of the activities were developed when we estimated the cost of the
project. Again, this was done with the help of the work breakdown structure. When we
broke the project down to the individual activities that had to be done in the project, we
were able to do a bottom-up estimate on cost for the project. While estimating the cost
of each of the activities in the project we must also estimate the duration for each activity
as well. The duration of an activity will not necessarily be the same as the effort to do the
activity. Please refer to Chapter 3, Cost Management, for a complete discussion of the
estimating process.
      Effort is the number of people-hours needed to do the activity and will help us
estimate cost. We speak of effort as being one hundred people-hours. This means that I
might have one person working on the activity for one hundred hours, or I might have
one hundred people working on the activity for one hour.
      Duration is the length of time that it takes to do an activity. This would be the
number of days that one person or more actually work on the activity. If project activity
is scheduled to be done on Monday and Tuesday by Mary and Joe, Wednesday and

58                    Preparing for the Project Management Professional Certification Exam



Thursday by Madelyn and Joe, and Friday by Nancy and Fran, the duration of the
activity is five days. If a project activity is scheduled to be done on Monday and Tuesday
by Mary and Joe, no work is scheduled on Wednesday and Thursday, and work is sched-
uled on Friday for Nancy and Fran, and on Monday and Tuesday for Madelyn and Joe,
the duration of the activity is still five days. Wednesday and Thursday are considered to
be nonworking days and contribute nothing to the activity's duration. This is a split
activity. It is easy to think of this type of activity as being two activities, or parts A and B
of the same activity. The important thing is to realize that the duration of the activity
does not include the time when the activity is not being worked.
      The span of an activity is different from duration as well. Span is the time that
elapses between the start and finish of the activity. Span is simply the number of days
that go by between the start and finish of the activity, regardless of whether the activity
is being worked on.
      Continuing the above example with Mary, Madelyn, Joe, Nancy, and Fran, note
that the activity started on Monday of the first week and finished on Tuesday of the
second week. The span of the activity is seven days, the duration of the activity is five
days, and the effort of the activity is ten people-days.
      Fortunately for the sake of our sanity, project schedules are put together without
very much use of interrupted activities. This is usually an inefficient way to schedule
work. The interrupted activity is, however, often used in adjusting schedules for problems
that appear during project execution.

     Building the Network Diagram
     Now that we have the durations and logic of the project, we can actually build the
schedule. A sequence of steps should be followed in developing the schedule:

      1.   Create a list of the activities that are to be scheduled.
      2.   Assign a duration to each of the activities.
      3.   Determine the predecessor for each activity.
      4.   Calculate the forward pass, the early schedule for each activity.
      5.   Calculate the backward pass, the late schedule for each activity.
      6.   Calculate the float for each activity.
      7.   Determine the critical path.
      8.   Determine if the predicted project completion is earlier than the promise date.
      9.   Adjust schedule or promise date.
     10.   Apply resources and determine resource constraints.
     11.   Adjust the schedule to allow for resource constraints.
     12.   Determine if the predicted project completion is earlier than the promise date.
     13.   Adjust schedule or promise date.
     14.   Get approval on schedule.

      Calendars must be entered if project management software is used. They must be
considered when scheduling even when software is not being used. A calendar is the data
that tells precisely when a resource is available for work. It defines the holidays, days off
each week, and the time of day that the resource is available. A separate calendar is
necessary for each resource that has a different work schedule, but resources having the
same work schedule can use the same calendar. For example, Arnie and Zara are working
on the same project. Arnie works from 8:00 A.M. to 5:00 P.M. with an hour off for lunch
from 12:00 noon to 1:00 P.M. He works Monday through Saturday and takes off all of
the company standard holidays. Zara works from 8:00 A.M. to 5:00 P.M. with an hour off
for lunch from 12:00 noon to 1:00 P.M. She works Monday through Friday and takes off
all of the company standard holidays. Zara and Arnie would require separate calendars.
      The first thing we do is to create a list of activities (1) that will be in our schedule.
This list is identical to the bottom level of the work breakdown structure. The duration
of each activity (2) was determined during the estimating process. The predecessor of
each activity (3) was determined during the final stages of the construction of the work
breakdown structure.
      Calculating the early schedule for each activity (4) requires the adoption of a few
scheduling conventions. These conventions are accepted by the scheduling community.
The first activity is always scheduled to start on the project start date. This date is input
as part of the project plan. The first start date is the project start. The early finish date is
the early start date plus the duration of the activity. Here another convention comes into
play. Each activity is considered to have started at the beginning of the period that it
starts on and to finish at the end of the period it finishes on. This means that if an activity
has a duration of one day and it starts on January first, it ends on January first, too. Due
to this convention the early finish of any activity equals the early start plus the duration
minus one. So, activity 1 starts on day 1 and finishes on day 15 (Table 2-1).
      The next activity must start at the beginning of the time period it starts in. This
means that the next activity starts in the next available time period. Since activity 1
finishes on day 15, activity 2 must start on day 16, and it finishes on day 20.
      Activities 3 and 4 present a new problem. Both of these activities depend on activity
2 to be completed before they can start. Both have an early start date of day 21. The
schedule development continues.
      In order to complete the backward pass (5) we must start at the last activity that
was completed in the early schedule. The rationale for this is that if the early schedule
was the soonest that the project could be completed, then what we seek in the backward
pass is the latest that each of the activities can be done so that the final completion of the
project can be made.
      We begin by taking the latest of the early finish times from the last activity to be
completed. This is the late finish time. The duration is then subtracted from the late

finish time to get the early finish time. The late schedule times, late start and late finish,
for activity 11 are thus days 90 and 94. Since activity 11 has a late start date of day 90,
activities 10 and 3 must be finished no later than day 89. This will be the late finish date
for both of them. It is the latest that they can be finished in order to support the project
completion on day 94 and the latest start of activity 11.
      Remember the convention that says that the activity work always starts at the begin-
ning of the work period and ends at the end of the work period. A late finish of day 94
and a duration of 5 days means that the activity must have started on day 90. Days 90,
91, 92, 93, and 94 are the five days worked. The durations are subtracted to get the late
start dates for each activity. When we come to activity 2 we must be careful to choose a
late finish date that supports the late start dates of activities 3, 4, and 6. Since the late
start dates for activities 3, 4, and 6 are days 86, 53, and 21, respectively, the latest that
activity 2 can be finished is day 20.
      Now, referring to Table 2-1, we see that we have completed the calculation of the
early start, early finish, late start, and late finish dates for our schedule.
      When we calculated the early and late schedule dates for our project we found that
sometimes the early and late schedule dates were the same, and in other activities the
dates were different. In these activities there was a difference between the earliest day that
we could start an activity and the latest day we could start the activity. The difference
between these two dates is called ``float,'' or sometimes ``slack.'' These terms mean exactly
the same thing and can be used interchangeably. The float of an activity is the amount of
time that the activity can be delayed without causing a delay in the project.
      To calculate the float (6) for each activity, subtract the early start day from the late
start day of the activity. Incidentally, the subtraction could be performed using the late
finish and the early finish days as well, since the difference between start and finish dates
is simply the duration, and that is the same for the early and late schedules.
      The critical path (7) is really not a path at all. In the days when activity on arrow
diagramming was used, the activities formed a path through the project schedule. Today,
with the use of computerized project management scheduling software, the critical path
can be more versatile. The critical path is defined as the group of activities that cannot be
delayed without delaying the completion date for the entire project. In other words, it is
the series of activities that have ``zero float.''
      Using computerized project management scheduling software, we can modify the
list of activities on the critical path to include activities that are nearly on the critical
path. This is important, since the critical path method is a management method for
managing project schedules. The activities that have zero float are the activities that
cannot be delayed without delaying the completion of the project. These are the activities
that must be monitored closely if we want our project to finish on time. Conversely, the
activities that are not on the critical path, those activities that have something other than
zero float, need not be managed quite as closely. In addition, it is important to know




                           ................. 11151$   $CH2   02-09-05 08:06:32   PS              PAGE 61

which activities in the project may be delayed without delaying the project completion.
Resources from activities having float could be made available to do a ``workaround'' if
the need should arise.
       Now that we have determined our schedule for the earliest completion of the project
it is time for a reality check (8). The schedule should be showing a completion date that
is earlier than the promise date that may have already been given to the stakeholders. If
this is not the case, then warning flags should be up and waving.
       The schedule that we have produced so far does not yet include delays that will
occur if resources are not available when they are needed. Schedule reserves have not yet
been added to allow for the effect of known and unknown risks. We also have not taken
into consideration the normal variations that will occur between the predicted and actual
project activity durations.
       Next, we must adjust the schedule or the promise date (9). We have two situations,
a schedule that has a promise date that is earlier than the predicted date, and a schedule
that has a promise date that is later than the predicted date. If the predicted date of the
schedule is later than the promise date we must compress the schedule. Crashing or fast
tracking must be used. Crashing a schedule is doing anything at all to reduce the sched-
uled completion of the project. Examples of crashing would include reducing the scope
of the project, adding additional resources for selected activities, eliminating activities,
and changing the process to eliminate steps.
       Fast tracking is a special case of crashing. In fast tracking activities that would have
been scheduled in sequence are scheduled to be done with some overlap instead. The use
of leads in the logical relationships between activities can be used to facilitate this, or the
relationships can be changed completely.
       For example, suppose the project is to paint a house (Figure 2-5). The original
schedule called for one crew of people to scrape off the loose paint, apply the primer,
and then apply the finish coat. The schedule calls for the three activities to be done in
sequence.
       To improve on the scheduled completion of the project, some of the activities could

                                  Project duration is 30 hours.

be fast tracked. Instead of one crew, two crews could be utilized. The first crew starts
chipping and scraping. Eight hours later the second crew starts applying the primer to
the scraped areas. When the first crew finishes scraping and chipping the house they can
begin painting the finish coat over the primer that the second crew has been applying
and which is now half done.
     The overall effect on the project is to reduce the time for doing the project from 30
hours to 22 hours. The work content, the effort, remains the same at 30 person-hours. If
the crew size were 2 people, then the project effort would be 60 person-hours. The
disadvantage of fast tracking the schedule as we have done here, and the disadvantage of
crashing any schedule, is that cost or risk, or both, will increase.
     In this example, the overall cost of the project did not go up according to what we
have measured. However, the real cost of the project, if all things were considered, would
have gone up. Transportation of the additional crew to the job site would have increased.
The cost of the additional equipment needed for two crews would have gone up.
     The risk of the project goes up as well. If a mistake is made by one crew or the
other, there will be little time to recover before the project schedule is affected. For
example, if the wrong primer was used by the second crew, the finish coat may have
already been applied before the mistake is found (Figure 2-6).

      Buffering the Schedule
      The other problem that we addressed was what to do if the schedule is earlier than
the promise date (12) of the project to the stakeholders. This is a much more pleasant
problem than trying to shorten the schedule. It is a very important problem to solve,
however. This must be done after allowing for reserve schedule time, normal fluctuations
in the activity durations, and resource limitations on the schedule (Figure 2-7). If after
all of this the schedule time is less than the promise date, buffering may be applied.

      A project schedule should not be adjusted by lengthening the duration of the activi-
ties (see Figure 2-8). If this is done, each of the people responsible for a scheduled activity
will essentially be given the extra allowance and will probably work to this schedule. The
schedule should also not be left as it is, since this is an optimistic schedule with no
allowances for the items we discussed earlier.
      A better way to schedule the project is with a buffer (Figure 2-9). Buffering a sched-
ule is simply adding float to selected activities. In some project management scheduling
software this feature is available. If it is not a part of your software, it can still be done.
There are two methods: using lags in the relationships and creating buffer activities.
      Using relationship lags is easily done but is tedious to accomplish. Each pair of
activities must be considered and a lag added wherever it is desired to add buffer. To
increase the project's scheduled completion time, a lag may be added between any two
activities on the critical path. Changing the relationship from a normal finish-start to an
FS  10 would add 10 days of float to the activity and also shift the project completion
day to ten days later.

      Another technique is to create a duplicate activity for each activity that is to be
buffered (Figure 2-10). The activity created is inserted between the independent activity
to be buffered and the dependent activity in the relationship. If there was originally an
FS relationship between activities A and B, the new relationship would add activity A.
This gives us an FS relationship between A and A and another between A and B. When
this technique is used, the buffering dummy activities can be selected out of the schedule
so that they will not appear. The remaining activities in the schedule will show with their
correct dates.
      Which activities should be buffered? This can be answered in a number of ways.
The amount of buffer time that is applied to activities can be proportioned according to
the risk of the activity, the dependencies that follow it, or any other reason that seems
appropriate to the project manager.
      In all project management scheduling software available today there is the ability to
constrain the project with the use of resources (10). The unavailability of the resources
may cause schedule delays. This problem occurs when an activity is scheduled that uses a

particular person or equipment and that piece of equipment is being used in some other
part of the project or on some other project altogether.
     To enter the resource information into any project management scheduling software
package, a number of different pieces of information must be entered:

      * Work Calendar. This describes the work schedule of the resources. Many of these
may be necessary to take care of all the different work patterns of the various resources.
The days of the week worked, the time of day that is worked, and holidays that are not
worked must be entered.
      * Resource Availability. The availability of the resource in terms of when the resource
is available as well as the quantity of the resource that is available.
      * Resource Requirement. The amount of the resource required and when it is re-
quired.

      Next, we adjust the schedule to allow for resource constraints (11). The resource-
leveling function in all scheduling software packages is useful for a first look at this
problem but is not intelligent enough to solve any but the simplest resource problem. To
solve this problem the software contains a feature called the ``resource histogram'' (Figure
2-11).
      The resource histogram is done in a split screen format. Generally, the upper portion
of the screen shows the Gantt chart with the activities that are using the resource in
question. In the bottom portion of the screen, vertical bars indicate the amount of re-

source that is necessary for the time period in question. The time scales that are used are
the same for both views.
     By looking at the two parts of the screen in Figure 2-11, it can be seen that during
weeks 1 and 2 the resource is underutilized, and that in weeks 5 and 6 the resource is
overutilized. While the underutilized resource may be employed somewhere else in the
project, it will be very difficult to make the overutilized resource work 20 hours of over-
time for those two weeks.
     To resolve the problem, activity 2 was scheduled to be interrupted for two weeks
(Figure 2-12). By doing this the workload of this resource was leveled out, and no over-
time was required.
     Now, with the resource constraints and the schedule adjusted to meet promise dates,
another check is made to be sure that the schedule can be met (12). If the promise date
and the planned date are still not consistent, then it is time to readjust the schedule one
more time (13). Before the plan can be finalized it is important that the plan be approved
(14) and that there is a formal sign-off for this schedule baseline.

Reverse Resource Allocation Scheduling
Some projects are required to be completed on a specific date regardless of the resources
needed. This makes it necessary to schedule the resource in reverse. The end date of the
project minus the time needed for the resource determines the start date for using that
resource.

                         Critical Path Method (CPM)
The critical path is a method of managing a project effectively. We have seen how the
critical path is determined and how the float or slack is determined. Using the notion of
float, the project manager can direct his or her efforts where they will do the most good.
      Activities that are found to have float, particularly those that have large amounts of
float, can be managed less intensely than other activities in the project plan. This is
because activities with float can be delayed without affecting the project completion date.
Of course, activities that have large amounts of float can be delayed a considerable
amount before they affect the project completion (Figure 2-13).
      Conversely, the activities that have zero float cannot be delayed without affecting
the project completion date. These activities should be managed carefully by the project
manager and the project team.
      In the critical path method of managing projects, another term for float is ``free
float.'' This is somewhat different than the float we have discussed up until now. One of
the problems with managing by float is that if an activity is delayed within its float, it
may be necessary to reschedule many other activities as a result. Free float is the amount
of time an activity can be delayed without affecting the project completion date or requir-
ing any other activity to be rescheduled. This is important because rescheduling the
remaining activities in the project can cause great confusion for the project team, and the
project manager can quickly lose credibility. The use of free float prevents much of this
problem.



        Program Evaluation and Review Technique (PERT)
The PERT system was developed for the Polaris Missile Program in the 1950s. At that
time there was a lot of pressure on the U.S. Navy to complete the Polaris Missile Program.
The Cold War was raging, and the United States needed a deterrent that would discour-
age the threat of nuclear weapons by Russia. A mobile missile that could be carried aboard
a submarine and launched from beneath the surface of the sea would be a formidable
weapon.
      The problem for the U.S. Navy was that there were two separate projects to be
done. One was to develop a submarine that could launch these missiles. The second
project was to develop a missile that could be launched from a submarine. The durations
of the project plan activities had a great deal of uncertainty in them. The navy needed a
method to predict the project schedule with better reliability than was possible in the
past. PERT was developed to assist in analyzing projects where there was uncertainty in
the duration of the activities.

probability that it will occur. It turns out that by experiment, the normal distribution
describes many phenomena that actually occur. The duration as well as the estimated
cost of project activities comes close to matching a normal distribution. In reality, another
distribution, called the beta distribution, fits these phenomena better, but the normal
curve is close enough for practical purposes.
       Suppose we have a scheduled activity that has an expected completion time of thirty-
five days. In Figure 2-14, the curve shows the probability of any other day occurring.
Since thirty-five days is the expected value of the activity, it follows that it would have
the highest probability of all of the other possibilities. Another way of saying this is that,
if all of the possibilities are shown, then they represent 100 percent of the possibilities
and 100 percent of the probability.
       If it were possible for this project to be done thousands and thousands of times,
sometimes the time to do the activity would be 35 days, other times it would be 33 days,
and still other times it would be 37 days. If we were to plot all of these experiments we
would find that 35 days occurred most often, 34 days occurred a little less often, 30 days
even less, and so on. Experimentally, we could develop a special probability distribution
for this particular activity. The curve would then describe the probability that any partic-
ular duration would occur when we really decided to do the project and that activity. In
the experiment, if 35 days occurred 134 times and the experiment was performed 1,000
times, we could say that there is a 13.4 percent chance that the actual doing of the project
would take 35 days. All 1,000 of the activity times were between 20 and 50 days.
       It is impractical to do this activity a thousand times just to find out how long it will
take when we schedule it. If we are willing to agree that many phenomena, such as
schedule durations and cost, will fit the normal probability distribution, then we can
avoid doing the experiment and instead do the mathematics. To do this we need only
have a simple way to approximate the mean and standard deviation of the phenomena.
       The mean value is the middle of the curve along the x-axis. This is the average or
expected value. A good approximation of this value can be obtained by asking the activity
estimator to estimate three values instead of the usual one. Ask the estimator to estimate
the optimistic, the pessimistic, and the most likely. (The estimator is probably doing this
anyway.) The way people perform the estimating function is to think about what will
happen if things go well, what will happen if things do not go well, and then what is
likely to really happen. This being the case, the three values we need are free for the
asking. These are the optimistic, the pessimistic, and the most likely values for the activity
duration.
       If we have these three values, it becomes simple to calculate the expected value and
the standard deviation. For the expected value we will take the weighted average:

         Expected value  [Optimistic  Pessimistic  (4  Most likely)] / 6

Figure 2-14. Schedule probability.




                                                 35 Days


     Standard deviations can be calculated using the formula:
                  Standard deviation  (Pessimistic  Optimistic) / 6

      As can be seen in Table 2-2, with these two simple calculations we can calculate the
probability and a range of values that the dates for the completion of the project will
have when we actually do the project. For the purpose of ease of calculation, if we were
to decide that 95.5 percent probability would be sufficient for our purposes, then it turns
out that this happens to be the range of values that is plus or minus 2 standard deviations
from the mean value.
      If the expected value of the schedule is 93 days and the standard deviation is 3 days,
we could make this statement: This project has a probability of 95 percent that it will be
finished in 87 to 99 days.
      For example, suppose we use the same example we used earlier. This time we have
probabilistic dates instead of the specific ones that we had before. We have collected
estimates on the duration of each of the activities and show the optimistic, pessimistic,
and most likely values in the table. The expected value is from the formula:
               EV  [Optimistic  Pessimistic  (4  Most likely)] / 6

     The standard deviations can be calculated using the formula:
                  Standard deviation  (Pessimistic  Optimistic) / 6

      One thing must be pointed out here. Unlike cost estimating, where the cost of every
activity in the project must be added up to get the total cost, the sum of the time it will
take to do the project is the sum of the expected value of the items that are on the critical

path only. Other activities in the project do not contribute to the length of the project,
because they are done in parallel with the critical path.
      The sum of the durations for the critical path items is 18.3 days. The standard
deviation is 2.3 days. We can say that there is a 95 percent probability that the project
will be finished in 13.7 days to 22.9 days.


                             Monte Carlo Simulation
When a schedule with activities that have uncertainty associated with their durations is
encountered, the PERT method can be used to help predict the probability and range of
values that will encompass the actual duration of the project. While the PERT technique
uses the normal and beta distributions to determine this probability and range of values,
there is a serious flaw in the results. The assumption made in the PERT analysis is that
the critical path of the project remains the same under any of the possible conditions.
This is, of course, a dangerous assumption. In any given set of possibilities, it is quite
possible that the critical path may shift from one set of activities to another, thus changing
the predicted completion date of the project.
      In order to predict the project completion date when there is a possibility that the
critical path will be different for a given set of project conditions, the Monte Carlo simula-
tion must be used. The Monte Carlo simulation is not a deterministic method like many
of the tools that we normally use. By that I mean that there is no exact solution that will
come from the Monte Carlo analysis. What we will get instead is a probability distribu-
tion of the possible days for the completion of the project.
      Monte Carlo simulations have been around for some time. It is only recently that
personal computers and third party software for project management have become inex-
pensive enough for many project managers to afford.

The Simulation
In our project schedule, the predecessors and successors form a critical path. As I ex-
plained earlier, the critical path is the list of activities in the project schedule that cannot
be delayed without affecting the completion date of the project. These are the activities
that have zero float. Float is the number of days an activity can be delayed without
affecting the completion date of the project.
      When we have uncertainty in the duration times for the activities in the schedule,
it means that there is at least a possibility that the activity will take more time or less time
than our most likely estimate. If we used PERT to make these calculations, we already
have calculated the mean value and the standard deviation for the project and all of the
activities that have uncertainty.
      The Monte Carlo simulator randomly selects values that are the possible durations




                            ................. 11151$   $CH2   02-09-05 08:06:37   PS               PAGE 73

for each of the activities having possible different durations. The selection of a duration
for each activity is made, and the calculation of the project completion date is made for
that specific set of data. The critical path is calculated, as well as the overall duration and
completion date for the project.
      The simulator usually allows for the selection of several probability distributions.
This can be done for one activity, a group of activities, or the entire project. Depending
on the software package being used, a selection of probability distributions is offered,
such as: uniform, binomial, triangular, Poisson, beta, normal, and others.
      The Monte Carlo simulation works in a step-by-step way:

     1. A range of values is determined for the duration of each activity in the schedule
        that has uncertainty in its duration.
     2. A probability distribution is selected for each activity or group of activities.
     3. If necessary, the mean and standard deviation are calculated for each activity.
     4. The network relationships between the activities are entered.
     5. The computer simulation is begun.
     6. A duration time is selected for each activity in the schedule, whether it is on the
        critical path or not.
     7. The critical path, duration of the project, float, and other schedule data are
        calculated.
     8. This process is repeated many times until the repetitions reach a certain prede-
        fined number of cycles or until the results reach a certain accuracy.
     9. Output reports are generated.

Output from the Monte Carlo Simulation
The most common output from a Monte Carlo simulation is a chart showing the proba-
bility of each possible completion date. This is usually shown as a frequency histogram.
Generally, a cumulative plot is made as well. In this way you may see graphically the
probability of each of the possible dates. This clearly shows the most likely dates for
project completion. Because of the shifting of the critical path, it is quite possible for
early dates and late dates to be the most likely, with unlikely dates in between them.
       A cumulative curve is also generated showing the cumulative probability of complet-
ing the activity before a given date. The criticality index can also be calculated. This is
the percentage of the time that a particular activity is on the critical path. In other words,
if a simulation were run 1,000 times and a particular activity was on the critical path 212
times, its criticality index would be 21.2 percent.


                                  Critical Chain Theory
Eliyahu Goldratt wrote several books that explain his ideas. Since he is now mentioned
in the Guide to the PMBOK, it might be worthwhile to read about his work. He has

written a series of novels--The Goal, It's Not Luck, and Critical Chain--that explain
many of his ideas. Since they are written as novels, it is rather pleasant reading and a
painless way to learn some new ideas about managing and project management.
      His critical chain theory is relevant to scheduling. The first idea is that a real proj-
ect's resource constrained schedule will usually have a large number of activities that have
reasonably large amounts of float. Unlike the types of schedules that we see in the class-
room, real project schedules will have several hundred activities. Real projects will also
have many activities on the critical path that are buffered or resource constrained causing
a lengthening of the project completion date. This in turn creates float and free float in
the activities not on the critical path.
      Referring to Figure 2-15, you can think of the series of activities that make up the
critical path (those that have zero float or close to zero float) as the critical chain activities.
The activities not on the critical chain generally fall into groups of activities that are
dependent on each other but as a whole are done independent of the critical path activi-
ties until one of them joins the critical path. That is, until an activity has a critical path
activity dependent on it. These groups of activities are called feeder chains.
      Normally most projects are scheduled according to the early schedule dates or the
early schedule. When this is done the float for the feeder chains collects at the end of the
feeder chain. When this is done the last activity in the feeder chain will be completed
long before it joins the critical chain of activities. Goldratt says that this is a mistake
because any knowledge gained as a result of experience and risk events in activities on the

critical path will not benefit the activities on the feeder chains. By delaying the start
schedule for these activities we can take advantage of the knowledge that is gained work-
ing on the critical activities.
      Of course if we delay the start of the feeder chain activities too much, they will
become part of the critical chain and this is not good. The feeder chains must be buffered
to be completed two standard deviations before their late finish dates. Of course, if we
expect to make the promise date for our customer, the critical chain activities must be
buffered two standard deviations as well, and this must be done before buffering the
feeder chains (see the section on buffering schedules earlier in this chapter).


                                                Summary
Time management of a project produces the schedule baseline. The activities of the
project must be defined before they can be scheduled. The work breakdown structure
provides the individual activities to be scheduled. There is a one-to-one relationship
between the activities described at the bottom of the work breakdown structure and the
activities that are scheduled in the project schedule. Activity durations for the schedule
are determined in the estimating process.
      The activities are sequenced in the logical order in which they are done. This logical
ordering is represented in a network diagram. The network diagramming method in use
today is the precedence diagram. With the use of the correct logical relationship and the
leads and lags, every logical relationship in the schedule can be diagrammed.
      Fast tracking and crashing are two techniques for reducing schedules that must meet
a promise date sooner than what is predicted by the schedule. Buffering is a technique
for increasing schedules that have a promise date later than the date predicted by the
schedule.
      The critical path method is a method of managing a project by applying the manage-
ment effort of the project manager and the efforts of the project team in the most effective
way. Activities with little or no float are given more attention than activities with float or
great amounts of float.
      PERT is a technique that is used to predict project completions when there is a great
deal of uncertainty in the estimated durations. PERT makes a statistical approximation of
the project completion by using the estimate for the optimistic, pessimistic, and most
likely duration for each activity.
      The Monte Carlo simulation is used to eliminate a problem associated with PERT,
which is that the critical path may move from activity to activity under different condi-
tions. Monte Carlo is a simulation technique that runs many schedules with selected
durations, statistically calculates the effect of variable durations, and reports (statistically)
the results.

                                                           Cost Management



C
       ost management is the completion of the project management triple constraint of
       cost, schedule, and scope. Each of these must be completed in order to complete
       the project on time and on budget and to meet all of the customer's expectations.
In order to meet the cost goals of the project, the project must be completed within the
approved budget.


                     Why We Need Cost Management
The project manager is primarily concerned with the direct cost of the project, but the
trend in project management is that the role of the project manager in cost control will
increase to include more of the nontraditional areas of cost control. In the future it will
be expected that more project managers will have a great deal of input into the indirect
costs and expenses of the project.
      Regardless of what the project manager is or is not responsible for, it is critical that
the project be measured against what the project manager is responsible for and nothing
else. If the project manager does not have responsibility for the material cost of the
project, then it makes no sense for the project manager to be measured against this
metric.
      Timing of the collection of cost information is also important to the cost measure-
ment system. The project budgets must be synchronized with the collection of the proj-
ect's actual cost. For example, if a project team is responsible for material cost, should
the budget show the expenditure when the commitment by the project team to buy the
product is made, when the item is delivered, when it is accepted, or when it is paid for?
Timing issues like these can make project cost control a nightmare.

                                                      77




                           ................. 11151$   $CH3   02-09-05 08:06:46   PS              PAGE 77

     If the project team does not properly control cost, the project will invariably go out
of control, and more money will be spent than anticipated. It is the purpose of cost
management to prevent this.



                    Project Life Cycle and Project Cost
Lately, it has become important to consider the cost of the project for the full useful life
of the product or service that is created. This means that the cost of the project does not
end when final acceptance of the project has been completed. Guarantees, warranties,
and ongoing services that have to be performed during the life of the project must be
considered.
      With regard to project life cycle, cost decisions are made with a clearer picture of
the future commitments that the project will require. If life cycle cost is considered, better
decisions will be made. An example of this would be the project of creating a software
program for a customer. The project team can create a working software program without
organization or documentation. This is usually called ``spaghetti code.'' Considering the
cost of the project as delivered, the spaghetti-coded project will be less costly. When you
consider the life cycle cost of the project, however, this approach will be more costly.
This is because the cost of debugging and modifying the software after delivery of the
project will be more difficult.



                  Using the Work Breakdown Structure
The work breakdown structure (WBS) is the key to successful projects. The WBS pro-
duced a list of the individual pieces of work that must be done to complete a project.
These are the building blocks of the project. Each of these represents a portion of the
work of the project. Each must be the responsibility of one and only one person on the
project team. The person responsible for an individual piece of work is similar to the
project manager and is responsible for all that happens in the project regarding that piece
of work. That person is responsible for scheduling, cost estimating, time estimating, and
of course seeing that the work gets done. Like the project manager, the person responsible
may not be required to do all the work. He or she is, however, responsible for seeing that
it gets done.

Project
In order to determine the project cost accurately enough to be considered the project cost
baseline, a bottom-up estimate must be made. This estimate must have an accuracy of
5 percent to 10 percent. This type of estimate will be produced by estimating the




                         ................. 11151$   $CH3   02-09-05 08:06:46   PS                PAGE 78
 Cost Management                                                                          79



cost of each item at the bottom level of the WBS and then summarizing or rolling up the
data to the project level.
      Bottom-up estimates are inherently more accurate because they are a sum of individ-
ual elements. Each of the individual elements has a possibility of being over or under the
actual cost that will occur. When they are added together, some of the overestimates will
cancel out some of the underestimates.


                                      Cost Estimating
A cost estimate is a prediction of the likely cost of the resources that will be required to
complete all of the work of the project.
     Cost estimating is done throughout the project. In the beginning of the project
proof of concept estimates must be done to allow the project to go on. An ``order of
magnitude'' estimate is performed at this stage of the project. Order of magnitude esti-
mates can have an accuracy of 50 percent to 100 percent. As the project progresses,
more accurate estimates are required. From company to company the specified range of
values for a given estimate may vary as well as the name that is used to describe it. For
example, conceptual estimates are those that have an accuracy of 30 percent to 50
percent. Preliminary estimates are those that have an accuracy of 20 percent to 30
percent. Definitive estimates are those that have an accuracy of 15 percent to 20
percent. Finally, the control estimate of 10 percent to 15 percent is done. Early in
the project there is much uncertainty about what work is actually to be done in the
project. There is no point in expending the effort to make a more accurate estimate than
the accuracy needed at the particular stage that the project is in.

Types of Estimates
Several types of estimates are in common use. Depending on the accuracy required for
the estimate and the cost and effort that can be expended, there are several choices.

      Top-Down Estimates
      Top-down estimates are used to estimate cost early in the project when information
about the project is very limited. The term top down comes from the idea that the estimate
is made at the top level of the project. That is, the project itself is estimated with one
single estimate. The advantage of this type of estimate is that it requires little effort and
time to produce. The disadvantage is that the accuracy of the estimate is not as good as
it would be with a more detailed effort.

     Bottom-Up Estimates
     Bottom-up estimates are used when the project baselines are required or a control
type of estimate is needed. These types of estimates are called ``bottom up'' because they




                           ................. 11151$   $CH3   02-09-05 08:06:47   PS             PAGE 79

begin by estimating the details of the project and then summarizing the details into
summary levels. The WBS can be used for this ``roll up.'' The advantage of this kind of
estimate is that it will produce accurate results. The accuracy of the bottom-up estimate
depends on the level of detail that is considered. Statistically, convergence takes place as
more and more detail is added. The disadvantage of this type of estimate is that the cost
of doing detailed estimating is higher, and the time to produce the estimate is consider-
ably longer.

     Analogous Estimates
     Analogous estimates are a form of top-down estimate. This process uses the actual
cost of previously completed projects to predict the cost of the project that is being
estimated. Thus, there is an analogy between one project and another. If the project
being used in the analogy and the project being estimated are very similar, the estimates
could be quite accurate. If the projects are not very similar, then the estimates might not
be very accurate at all.
     For example, a new software development project is to be done. The modules to be
designed are very similar to modules that were used on another project, but they require
more lines of code. The difficulty of the project is quite similar to the previous project.
If the new project is 30 percent larger than the previous project, the analogy might
predict a project cost of 30 percent greater than that of the previous project.

      Parametric Estimates
      Parametric estimates are similar to analogous estimates in that they are also top-
down estimates. Their inherent accuracy is no better or worse than analogous estimates.
      The process of parametric estimating is accomplished by finding a parameter of the
project being estimated that changes proportionately with project cost. Mathematically,
a model is built based on one or more parameters. When the values of the parameters are
entered into the model, the cost of the project results.
      Resource cost rates must be known for most types of estimates. This is the amount
that things cost per unit. For example, gasoline has a unit cost of $1.95 per gallon; labor
of a certain type has a cost of $150.00 per hour, and concrete has a cost of $25.00 per
cubic yard. With these figures known, adjustments in the parameter will allow revising
of the estimate.
      If there is a close relationship between the parameters and cost, and if the parameters
are easy to quantify, the accuracy can be improved. If there are historical projects that are
both more costly and less costly than the project being estimated, and the parametric
relationship is true for both of those historical projects, the estimating accuracy and the
reliability of the parameter for this project will be better.
      Multiple parameter estimates can be produced as well. In multiple parameter esti-

mates various weights are given to each parameter to allow for the calculation of cost by
several parameters simultaneously.
      For example, houses cost $115 per square foot, software development cost is $2 per
line of code produced, an office building costs $254 per square foot plus $54 per cubic
foot plus $2,000 per acre of land, and so on.

       Control Estimates
       Control estimates are of the bottom-up variety. This is the type of estimate that is
used to establish a project baseline or any other important estimate. In a project, the
WBS can be used as the level of detail for the estimate. The accuracy of this estimate can
be made to be quite high, but the cost of developing the estimate can be quite high and
the time to produce it can be lengthy as well.
       Control estimates are based on the statistical central limit theorem, which explains
statistical convergence. If we have a group of details that can be summarized, the variance
of the sum of the details will be less significant than the significance of the variance of
the details themselves. All that this means is that the more details we have in an estimate,
the more accurate the sum of the details will be. This is because some of the estimates of
the details will be overestimated, and some will be underestimated. The overestimates
and underestimates will cancel each other out. If we have enough detail, the average
overestimates and underestimates will approach a zero difference.
       If we flip a coin one time, we can say it comes up 100 percent heads or 100 percent
tails. If we continue flipping the coin a large number of times, and the coin is a fair coin,
then 50 percent of the flips will be heads and 50 percent of the flips will be tails. It may
be that there are more heads than tails at one time or another, but if we flip the coin long
enough, there will be 50 percent heads and 50 percent tails at the end of the coin flipping.
       If we know the mean or expected values and the standard deviations for a group of
detailed estimates, we can calculate the expected value and the standard deviation of the
sum. If we are also willing to accept that the probability of the estimate being correct
follows a normal probability distribution, then we can predict the range of values and the
probability of the actual cost.
       Using the same estimates for the expected value and the standard deviation that we
used in the PERT method for schedules, we can make these calculations. These are only
approximations of these values, but they are close enough to be used in our estimating
work.
        Expected Value  [Optimistic  Pessimistic  (4  Most Likely)] / 6
                Standard Deviation  (Pessimistic  Optimistic) / 6

     Where do these values come from? Most estimators report a single value when they
complete a cost estimate. However, they think about what the cost will be if things go
badly, and they think about what the cost will be if things go well. These thoughts are




                           ................. 11151$   $CH3   02-09-05 08:06:47   PS             PAGE 81

really the optimistic and pessimistic values that we need for our calculations. They do
not cost us a thing to get. All we have to do is to get the estimator to report them to us.
      For control estimates we are usually happy to get a 5 percent probability of being
correct. As luck would have it, this happens to be the range of values that is plus or minus
2 standard deviations from the mean or expected value.
      For example, suppose we want to estimate the cost of a printed circuit board for an
electrical device of some sort. In Table 3-1, the optimistic, pessimistic, and most likely
values that were estimated are entered in columns 3, 4, and 5. From these estimated
values the expected value of the individual components can be calculated. This is shown
in column 6. The expected value of the assembly can be reached by adding the expected
values.
      The standard deviation for each component is calculated and shown in column 7.
In order to add the standard deviations they must first be squared. These values are shown
in column 8. Next, the square of each of the standard deviations for each component is
added, and the square root is taken of the total. This is the standard deviation of the
assembly.
      The expected value of the assembly is $5.54, and the standard deviation is 7.4 cents.
We are interested in the range of values that have a probability of containing the actual
cost of the assembly when it is produced. The range of values that would have a 95
percent probability of occurring is plus or minus 2 standard deviations from the expected
value. In our example we can say that the assembly has a 95 percent probability of costing
between $5.39 and $5.67.



                                        Cost Budgeting
Cost budgeting is the process of allocating cost to the individual work items in the
project. Project performance will be determined based on the budget allocated to the
various parts of the project. The result of the cost budgeting process will be to produce
the cost baseline of the project.
       The cost baseline for the project is the expected actual cost of the project. The
budget for a project should contain the estimated cost of doing all of the work that is
planned to be done for the project to be completed. In addition, cost must be budgeted
for work that will be done to avoid, transfer, and mitigate risks. Contingency must be
budgeted for risks that are identified and may or may not come to pass. A reserve must
be budgeted for risks that are not identified as well.
       On most projects, the expected value for risks is budgeted. This is reasonable since
it reflects the average risk exposure for the project. Using the worst case or the best case
situation for the project would be overly pessimistic or optimistic and make the project
overfunded or underfunded, neither of which is a good thing.

      Accounting for this money can be confusing and misleading. We do not want to
give each of the people who are responsible for an activity the operating budget for the
planned work plus the contingency budget for the work that may or may not have to be
done. People being what they are, this money would all be spent to complete the activity
whether or not the risk occurs.
      One way to avoid this is to separate the contingency reserve and place it into a
contingency activity with zero duration. When a problem occurs in an activity the money
needed to correct the problem is taken from the associated contingency activity and
placed into the operating budget for that activity.
      There is a distinction between the contingency budget and the management reserve.
The contingency budget is set up for the risks that can be identified but may or may not
take place. The management reserve is money that is budgeted for the project for risks
that are not even identified but where through experience or even intuitive insight we
feel that the money will be needed. Contingency budgets should be approved by a man-
ager one level higher than the normal approving manager or person doing the work. The
money from the management reserve requires an approval by a person two levels higher.



                                           Cost Control
Cost control is the process of controlling the project cost and taking corrective action
when the control indicates that corrective action is necessary. It is important that our
cost control system be thoroughly understood by those who are measuring with it as well
as by those who are being measured. Inappropriate responses to cost and schedule vari-
ances can result in serious quality problems and higher than acceptable risk levels.

Earned Value Reporting
The earned value reporting system is now the most commonly used method of perfor-
mance measurement and project control. The reason for the popularity of this reporting
system in project management is that it reports performance to cost and performance to
schedule in one report. Schedule and cost are both measured in dollars. Where earned
value reporting is not used, reports favor measuring performance to schedule or perfor-
mance to budget.
     In any reporting system, the principle is to set some standard, measure the actual
performance to that standard, and then report on the observed differences. In the earned
value reporting system we use the planned budget and schedule and then measure the
actual progress in the budget and schedule.
     Frequently, a Gantt chart is used to show progress and performance to schedule,
but this does not state the case clearly. If a scheduled activity is shown to be three days




                        ................. 11151$   $CH3   02-09-05 08:06:48   PS              PAGE 84
 Cost Management                                                                           85



behind schedule, it is important to know whether there is one person involved in this
activity or whether there are twenty.
      In reporting cost, actual cost is frequently compared to budget cost to date. This
does not show the full picture either. If a project is behind schedule, the actual cost could
be tracking nicely to the expected budgeted expenditures, and the project could still be
in a great deal of trouble.
      Using the earned value reporting system the progress of the project in terms of cost
is measured in dollars. The progress of the project in terms of schedule is also measured
in dollars. This may sound confusing to people who are used to thinking of schedules in
terms of days ahead or days behind. In fact, it is a more informational description of the
condition of the project schedule. If a project activity is reported as being five days behind
schedule, and there is one person working on the activity part time, it is very different
from an activity that is behind five days and has twenty people working on it.
      Obviously, what is needed is a reporting system that combines performance, sched-
ule, and budget. This is the purpose of the earned value reporting system.

      Cumulative Reporting
      Earned value reports are cumulative reports. The values collected for the current
reporting period are added to the values from the last reporting period, and the total is
plotted.
      Cumulative values will never go down unless a value is reversed. As can be seen in
Figure 3-1, cumulative cost curves have a characteristic ``S'' shape. This is because projects
typically start out spending money slowly and gradually increase their spending rate until
a peak is reached, and then they gradually decrease their rate of spending until the project
is finally completed.

      One difficulty in showing the cumulative cost curve for a large project is that the
scale required in order to show the entire cost of the project may be so compact that
relatively large variations are not visible. A $400 million project plotted on an 8.5-by-11-
inch page would show a million-dollar variation in only one-fiftieth of an inch of space.
      Where large numbers are used, a plot of the variance can be used. The scale of this
type of chart can be much less compact and still show the needed information. It is made
by simply drawing a line as a zero base and then plotting the difference between actual
and expected values (Figure 3-2).

      Earned Value Parameters
      The earned value reporting system depends on the tracking of three measurements
of the project. In this book I am showing the old and new designations for the earned
value reports. In the 2000 edition of the Guide to the PMBOK, PMI chose to change the
names of these parameters. In reviewing the 2004 edition of the Guide to the PMBOK, I
found that PMI is still listing both designations in their index. In this book I will at
least show the relationship between the two designations for each of the earned value
parameters.

     1. Budgeted cost of work scheduled (BCWS), or planned value (PV). When we
established the three project baselines, we definitively set the cost and schedule baselines.
Each of the activities in the project had its own estimated cost and schedule. The PV is
the cumulative budget plotted on a time axis showing when the expenditure is supposed
to be made according to the project plan.
     2. Actual cost of work performed (ACWP), or actual cost (AC). As the project
progresses, actual cost is accumulated. This cumulative actual cost is plotted along the
same time axis. The actual cost is plotted for every reporting time period.
     3. Budgeted cost of work performed (BCWP), or earned value (EV). This is the
cumulative plot of the value of the work actually completed. The value of the work is
equal to the budget that was estimated for the work. The cumulative earned value is

plotted on the same time axis. The earned value is plotted every time period based on the
actual work that was accomplished.

     If the project follows the project plan, each of these three parameters will be exactly
the same. Significant deviations between the values of the three parameters--PV, AC,
and EV--are cause for concern (Figure 3-3) (see the section ``Calculated Values for
Earned Value'' below for definitions of EAC and BAC).

      Difficulties in Data Collection
      Plotting the PV is rather straightforward. Care must be taken that the timing and
amounts that are plotted as PV are the same and that the timing is the same as when they
are reported as actual expenditures.
      In the area of material cost, the timing of the budget and the reporting of the actual
expenditures are important. An expenditure may be recognized when the commitment is
made to purchase the material, when the material is delivered, when the material is
accepted, when it is invoiced, or when it is paid for. All of these dates may be quite
different points in time. Care must be taken so that the timing of the PV matches the
timing of the AC.
      In the area of labor cost, difficulties frequently arise in the development of these
estimates as well. Companies often do not like to have their estimators know the salary
cost of individual employees. People are generally grouped together by similar skills.
Within the group there can be a wide range of salaries. Since it is usually not possible to

determine exactly who will be working on a project when the work is actually done, the
average cost of a person in the group is used for estimating purposes. When the project
is actually done, the average cost of a person in the group is still used.
      It may seem that this is the right thing to do, but look at the effect on the project
manager. The project manager is going to be charged the same amount per hour regard-
less of which person in the group is used to do the work. The project manager will
naturally try to get the best person of the highest skill and experience regardless of the
real needs of the project. This situation creates demand for the more senior people, while
the junior people are underutilized.
      A better situation would be to budget to the average cost for a person in the skill
group and then collect the actual cost according to the person's actual salary. This would
allow the project manager to select the less skilled person if possible and trade time and
rework for lower salary cost.

      Reporting Work Complete
      There is frequently difficulty in reporting work complete on the project. Many
people tend to report that the percent that is complete on an activity is the same as the
percent of the time that has elapsed. Thus, if 50 percent of the time to do an activity in
the project has passed but only 25 percent of the work is actually done, misleading reports
could result.
      There are several approaches to solving this problem. The 50-50 rule is one such
approach. In this approach to earned value data collection, 50 percent of the earned value
is credited as earned value when the activity begins. The remaining 50 percent of the
earned value is not credited until all of the work is completed.
      The 50-50 rule encourages the project team to begin working on activities in the
project, since they get 50 percent of the earned value for just starting an activity. As time
goes by, the actual cost of work performed accumulates, and the project team is motivated
to complete the work on the activity so that the additional 50 percent of the earned value
can be credited. This creates an incentive to start work and another incentive to finish
work that has been started. This solves the problem of reporting percent complete, and
there should be few arguments about whether work has actually begun or has been com-
pleted on a project activity.
      There are many variations of the 50-50 rule. Popular variations include the 20-80
rule and the 0-100 rule. These allow differing percentages of the earned value of the work
to be claimed at the start and completion of the work.

      Examples
      In Figure 3-4, the EV is higher than the PV. This means that the project is ahead

the EV. This means that we are spending more money to accomplish the work than we
had planned, and we are spending more money to accomplish work than the EV for that
work.
       This could mean that the manager of this part of the project is working people
overtime in anticipation of a problem that may come to pass in the near future. There
could be many explanations for these irregularities. The report tells us that we should
investigate to find out the cause for this.
       In Figure 3-5, the EV is above the PV. Again, this means that the project is ahead
of schedule. More activities are being completed, and their earned value is being credited
faster than planned. The AC is lower than the EV. This means that we are spending less
money than the earned value of the work that is being completed.
       While this looks like a good situation--ahead of schedule and under budget--it is
still not following the project plan. It is possible that things are just going well. It is also
possible that some of the work is not being done as planned and that the quality of the
work performed is suffering.
       In Figure 3-6, the EV is less than the PV. This means that the project is behind
schedule. The AC is less than the EV. This means that work is being accomplished with
less cost than planned. A possible explanation for this situation is that the project is

     Calculated Values for Earned Value Reports

     * Budget at Completion (BAC). The BAC is a point representing the total budget of
the project. On a cumulative plot it will be the last point on the PV curve. The PV
cannot be greater than the BAC.
     * Cost Variance (CV)

                                             CV  EV  AC

     This is the difference between the work that is actually completed and the cost
expended to accomplish the work. A positive variance is good, and a negative variance is
bad.

                                                      Time


     This is the difference between the work that was actually completed and the work
that was expected to be completed at this time. A positive variance is good, and a negative
variance is bad.
     * Cost Performance Index (CPI)
                                             CPI  EV / AC

     * Schedule Performance Index (SPI)
                                             SPI  EV / PV
      Indexes are used when consistent numbers are required. Cost and schedule variance
is measured in dollars. In a large project, say $100 million, a $100,000 cost or schedule
variance might not be too significant, but in a small project, say $300,000, a $100,000
cost or schedule variance might be significant.
      Cost and schedule variances also vary depending on what phase the project is in.
Early in the project small variances may be significant, and later in the project these same
size variances may not be terribly significant.
      For this reason we use indexes. The values of indexes are the same for the same
significance. The cost performance index is the EV divided by the AC. This is the amount




                           ................. 11151$    $CH3   02-09-05 08:06:53   PS               PAGE 91

of work accomplished per dollar of actual cost spent. The schedule performance index is
the EV divided by the PV. This is the amount of work accomplished per dollar of
budgeted cost expected to be spent.
     * Estimate at Completion (EAC)
                                            EAC  BAC / CPI
     The EAC is an estimate of the project cost at the completion of the project. This is
the BAC adjusted for current performance to date, cost wise. It says that if the project
continues along at its present level of performance to cost, the EAC will be the final
project cost. This is a pessimistic value since it says that the mistakes that have been made
in the project are expected to continue for the remainder of the project.
     This is often used for calculating the EAC. There are several other forms of the EAC
that can be used that yield different results. One form is identical to the one above:
                              EAC  AC  Remaining PV / CPI
    Since the remaining PV in the project is simply the difference between the total
work that must be done to complete the project (the BAC) and the work that has been
completed to date (the EV):
                                  Remaining PV  BAC  EV
And the AC could be stated as:
                                               AC  EV / CPI
The CPI is just EV / AC
    Substituting, we get:
                  EAC    EV / CPI  (BAC  EV) / CPI
                  EAC    ((EV  AC) / EV)  (BAC  EV)  AC / EV
                  EAC    AC  ((BAC  AC) / EV)  (EV  AC) / EV
                  EAC    AC  BAC / CPI  AC
                  EAC    BAC / CPI
     The above method for calculating the EAC is the one that is required for any
questions on the PMP examination. This method has been shown to represent the true
EAC for most projects. Much research has been done to support the use of this calcula-
tion for EAC. The trouble with this calculation, while statistically supportable, is that
your boss may not like it very much.
     A more optimistic approach would be to assume that the mistakes on the project
that have occurred so far are not going to continue and that the project from now on will
go according to plan. It is the sum of the AC, which is what has been spent to date and
cannot be improved on now, plus the amount of work remaining to be done.

                                  EAC  AC  Remaining PV
                                  EAC  AC  BAC  EV

     Of course, the most optimistic view is that not only will the project improve its
performance from now until the end of the project but also the expenditures over the
budget to date will be recovered by the end of the project. This is a mistake often made
by project managers. Generally speaking, if a project is over budget when 25 percent of
the project is complete, the project will be completed with an over-budget condition
greater than 25 percent, not less than 25 percent.
     * Estimate to Complete (ETC)
                                           ETC  EAC  AC

     The ETC is the remaining budget required to complete the project if work contin-
ues at the present performance rate.
     There are many other calculations used in the earned value reporting system, but
these are the calculations that are accepted by most people (Table 3-2).

Financial Measures
The business risks of a project can be best understood by looking at some of the financial
measurements that are commonly applied to business decisions. It is important to recog-
nize that many of the costs associated with a project do not stop once the project has
been delivered and each of the stakeholders has accepted the project.
      The simplest way to think of project desirability is to consider the benefit cost ratio:
all of the benefits of doing something divided by all of the costs to accomplish it. Any
sort of business consideration can be evaluated with this simple measure. If the benefit
cost ratio is 1.0 or greater, the project is desirable. If it is less than 1.0, the project is not
desirable.
      Life cycle costing is the cost and benefits of a project that begin when the first effort
is made on behalf of the project and continue through the conceptual phase, the planning
phase, the execution phase, the closeout phase, the warranty period, and on until the
project is disposed of. When projects are delivered to the customer, there are many costs
that will continue through the life of the project. Maintenance, service, additions, and
modifications are items that will continue after delivery. Some of these will result in
additional cost, such as warranty repairs, and others will result in additional benefits, such
as additions and modifications.
      ``Sunk cost'' is a term used to indicate the amount of money that has already been
spent on a project. This is money that we no longer have any control over. Although it
seems that if a project is currently very much over budget it would make sense to com-
plete the project and collect the benefits, most financial managers hold that sunk costs
should not be considered in making decisions as to whether to continue a project.

      For example, a $300,000 project is 50 percent complete but is over budget by 30
percent. Revenue from the project is estimated to be $350,000. Based on this information
it is estimated that the project, when complete, will cost $400,000. Should the project
be continued? If the project stops today, $200,000 is sunk cost, and no revenue is made.
If the project is completed, a loss of $50,000 will occur. From the point of view of many
managers, all other things being equal, it would be better to stop the project and invest
the remaining $250,000 that it would have taken to complete the project in another
project that is more profitable. Of course, customer commitments and future revenue
based on the completion of this project may influence this decision.
      Financial measures are rooted in the accounting and financial worlds. The first thing
that must be understood is that the fundamental reports in accounting--the income
statement and the balance sheet--are of particular interest to the project manager, since
the project manager's decisions directly influence these reports. The current trend in
project management is to make project managers responsible for the revenue cost and
expenses of the project. These are the basic reports of accounting for any business. In
these statements, the words profit and income are frequently interchanged. The reason
that project managers must be aware of these financial measures is that if the financial
measures applied to the project are favorable and the company can keep all of its projects
favorable, then the company's financial measures will also be favorable. The fundamental
accounting equation is:
                          Assets  Liabilities  Owner's Equity
      Assets are the things that a company owns, like cash, buildings, materials, and so
on. Liabilities are what a company owes, such as unpaid bills, long- and short-term debt,
and so on. The owner's equity is the value of the assets after the liabilities have been
subtracted. In the successful operation of a company, the company takes on liabilities in
order to produce goods and services that are then sold. When the goods and services are
sold there is, hopefully, a positive difference in revenue generated versus costs and ex-
penses incurred to allow the goods and services to be sold. At the end of a project the
assets that are increased should be greater than the liabilities incurred. To balance the
accounting equation, this difference increases the owner's equity.
      The income statement (Figure 3-7) shows where the cash flowing into and out of
the company came from, and the net profit after taxes is the sum of all the money flowing
into the company and all of the money flowing out of the company.
      The balance sheet (Figure 3-8) is the statement that shows a breakdown of the
items in the fundamental accounting equation. The assets must balance the liabilities and
owner's equity.
      Project managers have an influence on the numbers on the company's financial
reports. But the company's reports are just the summation of the different projects and
other activities of the company. It is therefore sensible to consider these financial measures

as they apply to the individual projects as well. If all projects being done by the company
are individually profitable, then the company itself must be profitable. These measures
are frequently called financial ratios.

      Return on Sales
      Return on sales, or ROS, equals the net profit after taxes divided by the gross sales.
This is another way of saying how much profit is generated for each dollar of sales. The
higher the value of ROS the better. Typically, for American business this ratio is usually
nearly 5 percent. Note that the net profit after taxes is what is left of the revenue after all
costs, expenses, and taxes have been deducted. Net profit is sometimes called the net
operating profit after taxes, or NOPAT.
      For example, a project generates revenue of $400,000. After deducting the project's
share of all the costs, expenses, and taxes, the net profit after taxes is $23,000.
                                ROS  NOPAT / Gross Revenue

per dollar of investment.
      For example, a project uses a share of the company's assets equal to $240,000. After
deducting the project's share of all of the costs, expenses, and taxes, the net profit after
taxes is $23,000.
                                ROA  NOPAT / Total Assets
                                ROA  $23,000 / $240,000
                                ROA  9.6%

     Economic Value Added
     The economic value added is also called the EVA. In this financial measurement we
are interested in finding whether a project's NOPAT is sufficient to cover the cost of
maintaining the assets that it uses. In other words, if a project uses a share of the com-
pany's assets, those assets have certain expenses associated with them. These expenses are

the cost of interest on borrowed funds and the compensation paid to shareholders in the
company. The rationale here is that the only way a company can acquire assets is by
borrowing the money to purchase them, having investors purchase stock in the company,
or generating profits. Organizations that lend money to companies are compensated in
the form of interest payments. Stockholders are compensated in the form of dividends
on their share of the company. The revenue generated by the project must be enough to
meet all of the project's costs and expenses as well as offset the interest expense and
dividends to the stockholders.
      The first thing we will have to calculate is the cost of capital. This is the weighted
average cost of the money paid to the stockholders in the form of dividends and the
money paid to the lenders in the form of interest payments.
      Suppose a company's assets are financed by 70 percent in stock sold to investors and
30 percent in funds borrowed from banks and other financial institutions in the form of
loans. The average interest that is paid on the loans is 7 percent, and the company
dividends are 17 percent. What is the cost of capital for this company?
      Seventy dollars out of every $100 of the company's assets are financed by stockhold-
ers at 17 percent, or $11.90 per year. Thirty dollars of every $100 of the company's assets
are financed by lenders at 7 percent, or $2.10 per year. The total cost of capital per $100
is $14, or 14 percent of the company's assets.
      If we take the capital or the assets that are used for this project and multiply by the
cost of capital, we will get the weighted average cost of capital (WACC).
      Let's say that the capital that the project uses is $500,000 and the cost of capital is
14 percent:
                         WACC  $500,000  14%  $70,000
If the net operating profit after taxes is $116,000:
                                 EVA  NOPAT  WACC
                                 EVA  $116,000  $70,000
Project economic value added, or EVA, would be $46,000.

Depreciation
Depreciation is a necessary function in financial management, because without deprecia-
tion the irregularities in the fundamental financial reports of a company would vary
considerably and make it difficult to compare one year or one quarter to the next. This
is because large investments in assets do not occur on a regular basis. If the total cost of
an investment were reflected in the financial time period in which it occurred, the effect
on net profits would be considerable in this period, and then the net profit would rise
significantly in the next period.
      What is done with depreciation? The cost of the new asset is spread out over the life

 Cost Management                                                                               99



of the asset. This allows the company to claim some of the cost each year rather than the
total cost of the asset all at one time.

      Straight Line Depreciation
      Straight line depreciation is the depreciation method that allows an equal amount
of depreciation to be taken each year. The amount of depreciation is determined by
subtracting the salvage value of the asset at the end of its useful life from the purchase
price of the asset. The remaining value is called the book value. The book value is divided
by the number of years, and this amount is expensed from the asset each year.
      For example, a company buys a large machine for $1 million. The purchase is made
with cash. In the accounts for this transaction, the cash account is reduced by $1 million,
and the machine account is increased by the amount of $1 million. There is no effect on
the liabilities or the owner's equity side of the accounting equation, and it remains bal-
anced. The cost of this machine must eventually be recognized.
      The machine has a useful life of ten years and is worth $100,000 at the end of its
useful life in terms of scrap value or the ability to sell the machine to someone else. This
means that the value of the machine that must be depreciated is $900,000. Since the life
of the machine is ten years, the value depreciated each year is $90,000. This is known as
straight line depreciation (Table 3-3).

    Accelerated Depreciation
    Accelerated depreciation methods are used to allow the expenses that are depreciated
from the assets to be applied earlier in the useful life of the asset. The reason for this is to

reduce the net profit after taxes (NOPAT). If NOPAT is reduced in a given year, the
amount of tax that a company pays is less by this amount.
      In accelerated depreciation methods the total amount of depreciation is the same as
in straight line depreciation, but the time that it is taken is much earlier in the useful life
of the asset. This means that more equipment expense is recognized and lower taxes are
paid in the early part of the useful life of the asset purchased. In later years the taxes will
be higher than in straight line depreciation. Because of the present value of the money,
taxes that are deferred to later years allow us to use that money in the present years.
      Two types of accelerated depreciation are commonly used: sum of the years' digits
and double declining balances.
      Sum of the Years' Digits. There is no scientific basis for the sum of the years' digits
method. There is no financial reason for using this calculation except that it has become
a standard accounting practice.
      The calculation is made by totaling the digits representing the years of the useful
life of the equipment. Thus, as can be seen in Table 3-4, for a ten-year useful life, the
total is 55 (10  9  8  7  6  5  4  3  2  1  55).
      The amount of depreciation in the first year is determined by taking the highest
digit year and dividing this by the sum of the years' digits. In the first year, the last year's
digit is used, making the calculation 10 divided by 55. This number is then multiplied
by the book value.
      In the remaining years, the next lower year's digit is used. In the second year, the
depreciation is calculated by dividing 9 by 55. Each year the numerator declines by one
year.

      Double Declining Balances. Like the sum of the years' digits depreciation, there is no
scientific basis for the double declining balance calculation either. It is, however, a consis-
tent method for accelerating the depreciation of equipment and has become a standard
accounting practice.
      The percent of depreciation is taken on the depreciable value of the item. The next
year's depreciation is taken on the remaining depreciable value of the item, and so on
until the salvage value is reached. With this method the amount taken as depreciation in
the early years is much higher than in the later years (Table 3-5).



                                               Summary
Cost management is a necessary part of project management, for it makes it possible to
manage the cost baseline of the project. Without cost management, projects would use
more or less money than allocated, and it would be impossible to fund future projects.
The project manager, as in all things, is the person responsible for project cost manage-
ment.
     The work breakdown structure is the basis for the cost estimate. Since the WBS
identifies all of the project work in a detailed workable way, it becomes the best place to
determine the cost of the project. A cost estimate done this way produces a detailed
estimate that can be rolled ``bottom up'' to any level of detail desired.
     Cost estimating is done over the life of the project. In the beginning of the project
only a small amount of information is known about the project and inaccurate estimates

are appropriate. In the creation of baselines for cost and schedule it is important that
definitive, 5 percent to 10 percent estimates be reached.
      Cost control in project management is best achieved through the use of the earned
value reporting system. This reporting system makes it possible to measure performance
to schedule and performance to budget in the same system. Project performance over or
under budget is measured in dollars. Project performance ahead or behind schedule is
measured in dollars.
      In addition to the earned value reporting system, the project manager must face
many of the financial decisions that a small-business manager must face and be aware of
the financial world of reporting.

                                                      Quality Management



O
           ne of the goals of project management is to meet the expectations of the stake-
           holders of the project. Managing the quality of the project is the function that
           will allow this to happen. Quality management will include all the work that is
necessary to ensure that each of the objectives of the project is met. In the latest edition
of the Guide to the Project Management Body of Knowledge, PMI emphasizes that the
purpose of the project is to meet the requirements of the stakeholders. In the past, the
project goal was to meet or exceed the customer's expectations.
      Quality should be concerned with prevention rather than detection. The cost of
preventing a defect in our project is much less than the cost of finding a defect and
correcting it. Worse, the cost of not finding a defect and having to correct it in the field
is even higher.
      We have discussed methods of controlling the project costs and schedule in Chapter
2, Time Management, and Chapter 3, Cost Management. These controls cover only two
of the sides of the triple constraint triangle. Quality management controls the third side
of the triangle, scope, as well as provides guidance for and assurance of meeting the other
two constraints of cost and schedule.
      It is important in modern project management to meet the stakeholders' expecta-
tions. It is also important that the expectations of the stakeholders are not exceeded. The
customer contracts for certain deliverables; delivering something that was not asked for
can be a waste of time and money. In some cases delivering more than is asked for can
make matters worse.
      Quality should not be confused with grade. Quality that is low is always going to
be a problem, while a low grade is not necessarily a bad condition. A product may be
developed and marketed to appeal to those who want an inexpensive product that will
have a limited useful life and functionality. This product may also have a lower cost.

Stakeholders should get what they pay for. The quality of the item means that it is indeed
what it was intended to be.
      Project quality management addresses both the quality of the project and the quality
of the product that is produced. The quality management of projects is generally the
same for all projects, but the quality management of the product produced by the project
will vary with the application. What we mean by this is that the measurements and
techniques that are used to ensure the quality of the construction of a tool shed will be
different from the measurements and techniques for ensuring the quality of the construc-
tion of a nuclear power plant.
      The Guide to the PMBOK defines three processes for quality management: quality
planning, quality assurance, and quality control. It is important that a distinction be
made among them.
      The quality planning function is the process that determines which quality standards
should be used to accomplish the goal of ensuring that the scope of the project fulfills the
stakeholders' expectations.
      The quality assurance function is a process that monitors the overall ability of the
project to meet the expectations of the stakeholders. The purpose of the quality assurance
function is to provide the confidence that the project will have the proper controls to be
able to meet the standards that are expected by the stakeholders. The quality assurance
function ensures that the quality of the project will be sufficient.
      The quality control function is the process used to measure the specific items that
must be monitored to determine that the project will meet the stakeholders' expectations.
      The philosophy of modern quality management is that mistakes should be pre-
vented rather than detected. It is much better to create an environment that prevents
mistakes from happening rather than to spend much time and effort trying to detect
problems that may have already occurred. ``You can't inspect quality into a product'' is
the phrase used to state this idea.



                                       Quality Planning
The quality planning process must accomplish several things if the project is to be success-
ful. It involves identifying all of the standards that are relevant to the project. For environ-
mental issues, all government regulations, rules, standards, and guidelines specific to the
specific project must be considered. There must be an overall quality policy, or company
guidelines, regarding projects of this type. Generally, this is the common policy that will
be used by all projects that the company will accomplish. Each project and each interre-
lated project must modify the guidelines and gain approval on changes that will be re-
quired for a particular project.
      The result of the quality planning process is the quality plan. This plan describes

 Quality Management                                                                      105



how the quality of the project will be assured and the functions that will be carried out
by the project team to accomplish this. The plan also serves to provide the additional
activities that will be added to the project scope, budget, and schedule that will allow
these things to happen.
      The quality plan should reflect the information that is gathered throughout the
project. All of the other areas of the management of the project should complement the
quality plan. Risk is of major importance in the quality plan. Areas of the project that are
high in risk should have a significant influence on the quality plan. The quality planning
function will produce the quality metrics that will be used to measure the quality of the
project in very specific terms.
      It is important that a continuous process improvement plan be developed. This plan
details how the project processes will be measured and how the processes can be analyzed
so that continuous improvements can be made and measured. This could include the
process boundaries, configurations, and metrics as well as targets for improved perfor-
mance.


                                   Quality Assurance
The Guide to the PMBOK defines quality assurance as:

     The application of planned and systematic quality activities to ensure that the proj-
     ect will employ all processes needed to meet all stakeholder expectations and provide
     the confidence that the product of the project will fulfill the requirements of quality.

      Quality audits are performed to review certain important areas of the project. Audits
make it possible to determine what is happening in the project and whether the project
quality is meeting the standards that were determined in the quality plan.
      The quality assurance function includes the means to continuously improve the
quality of future projects as well. Lessons learned from one project are applied to the
quality plans of future projects so that there can be an ever-improving level of quality in
projects completed by the organization.
      Each member of the project team, including each of the stakeholders of the project,
is essential to the quality assurance of the project. In modern thinking on quality it is the
individual person performing work who is really responsible for assuring the quality of
the product.


                                       Cost of Quality
As in all things in project management, there should be a favorable ratio of benefits and
cost to quality (Figure 4-1). This is usually referred to as prevention rather than cure.

The total cost of curing a problem once it has occurred is generally higher than the cost
of preventing the problem in the first place. It is apparent that the potential savings
between the cost of defects and the cost of prevention are great. Generally, many of the
costs of defects are not recognized in an organized way to reflect their true cost. This is
because when some of the costs of these defects are recognized, the project has been
turned over to a maintenance and support function. The project team may have been
dissolved, and the members may be working on other projects.
      As in other projects, a cost-benefit analysis of the proposed methods of implement-
ing quality should be done on each of the proposed methods. According to Edward
Deming, ``Eighty-five percent of the costs of quality is the direct responsibility of manage-
ment.''
      The following is a listing of the considerations for these costs:

      Costs of Prevention
      *   Additional planning
      *   Education and training of project team and stakeholders
      *   Inspection and testing of the internal and external deliverables of the project
      *   Improved designs for quality purposes
      *   Quality staff
      *   Quality audits
      *   Quality plan and execution

Deming's Fourteen Points
Edward Deming is probably best known for his fourteen points on quality (Figure 4-2).
These guidelines were developed during Deming's work with Japanese industries and
serve as a guideline for the practice of practical quality management.


                                       Quality Control
The function of quality control is to monitor specific project results to ensure that the
results match the standards that were set for the project. The quality control function
utilizes a number of techniques to accomplish this. Many of these tools and techniques
are rooted in the concepts of probability and statistics.

      Many times statistical methods are used in project quality control. These techniques
can improve the performance of those involved in quality control by allowing less than
100 percent inspection of all of the products produced.
      As a result of a good quality control program recommended corrective and preven-
tive actions will be generated as well as recommendations for the repair of defects and
inspection methods for the later repaired defect.

Inspection
Inspection is carried out by the observation of attributes or measurements. An item that
is supposed to be a certain size can be measured directly, and the data regarding its
dimensional size can be collected. All items accepted will be within the acceptable allowed
tolerance on the item.
      Items may also be inspected by attribute. In this technique the item to be inspected
is made to fit or not fit into a specially designed gauge or special measuring device. If the
part fits into the ``Go'' gauge and does not fit into the ``No Go'' gauge, then the part is
acceptable. If the part does not fit into the ``Go'' gauge or fits into the ``No Go'' gauge,
the part is considered to be bad. All attribute inspections have a yes or no outcome.
      Attribute sampling has several advantages over measurement methods. In attribute
sampling the inspection is fast and cheap, and there is little room for mistakes on the
part of the inspector. Measurements take a certain amount of skill and concentration. As
such, measurements are prone to human errors stemming from fatigue and boredom.
      For example, suppose a motor shaft has a design tolerance of 1.5 inches and an
allowable tolerance of plus or minus .015 inches for its diameter. This means that an
acceptable part will have to be between 1.515 and 1.485 inches.
      To test this attribute, a gauge is constructed with a hole that has a diameter of
exactly 1.515 inches. This is a ``Go'' gauge. Parts that have a diameter of less than 1.515
inches will fit into this gauge, and those that are larger than 1.515 inches will not fit.
      Another gauge is constructed with a hole of 1.485 inches in diameter. Parts that fit
into this gauge will be unacceptable, since their diameter is less than 1.485 inches. This
is the ``No Go'' gauge.
      The inspection of shafts is quick, easy, and nearly foolproof. A part is taken and first
applied to the ``Go'' gauge. If it passes this gauge, it is immediately put into the ``No
Go'' gauge. If it fails to fit this gauge, it is an acceptable part.


                                   Sampling Inspection
Unless there are unusual requirements for extreme quality, as when death can result from
a defective part, most customers will accept a certain amount of defects. The reason for
this is stated in the law of diminishing returns. As the desire to locate each and every




                         ................. 11151$   $CH4   02-09-05 08:06:52   PS                PAGE 108
 Quality Management                                                                        109



defect is satisfied, it becomes more and more costly to find them. One hundred percent
inspections are expensive and require much time and effort. In 100 percent inspections
there is also the problem of the inspection itself causing damage to some of the parts.
This entire concept is based on the fact that the customer is willing to accept a small
number of defective parts rather than pay the high cost of trying to locate each and every
defect.
      This policy of allowing a few unacceptable parts must be considered carefully. The
ultimate use of the parts must be considered. In particular, it is important that the part
that is defective not create danger to life. There can be no value placed on a human life,
and many court cases have awarded large settlements against companies that attempted
to do so.
      For this reason, statistical sampling was developed. Without going into the statistical
details that support sampling inspection, it can be described. Sampling inspection plans
have been worked out and are available to quality managers to determine the parameters
desired and to set up an inspection plan that will fit the type of work that they are doing.
      In a sampling inspection, the sample size to be taken and inspected from a given lot
size is determined. A sample size of fifteen parts may be taken from a lot of parts. Again,
according to precalculated procedures, the fifteen-piece sample can contain no more than
three unacceptable parts. If fewer than three parts in the sample are unacceptable, the lot
passes, and if more than three parts are unacceptable, then the lot is rejected.

Acceptable Quality Level (AQL)
The rationale behind this technique is that if the acceptable quality level (AQL) was 3
percent and a sample of fifteen parts was taken from a lot of a thousand parts, there
would be a very small chance that some of the bad parts would show up in the sample.
If more than three parts were to show up in the sample, it could be said that the whole
lot had more bad parts than the 3 percent allowed by the AQL.
     Because discovering all of the defective parts can be a very costly process, most
customers and suppliers agree that a certain level of defects is to be allowed in the normal
process. As long as this acceptable quality level is maintained, the lot of parts is acceptable
to the customer. The AQL says that a lot that has fewer than 3 percent bad parts in it is
acceptable.

Buyer's Risk and Seller's Risk
When we perform sampling inspections, there is a risk that the sample will give mislead-
ing information. There are four possible outcomes to this inspection process. The possi-
bilities are:

     1. The lot is good, and the sample inspection says that it is good. This is what we
        want.




                            ................. 11151$   $CH4   02-09-05 08:06:52   PS              PAGE 109

      2. The lot is good, and the sample inspection says that it is not good. This is not
         what we want.
      3. The lot is bad, and the sample inspection says that it is good. This is not what
         we want.
      4. The lot is bad, and the sample inspection says that it is bad. This is what we
         want.

       If the sampling inspection accepts a lot that is good or rejects a lot that is bad, then
the inspection process is working. If the sampling process accepts a lot that is really bad,
this means that a lot that is really unacceptable is shipped as a good lot to the customer.
This is called ``buyer's risk'' (see Figure 4-3). If the sampling process rejects a lot that is
really good, this means that a lot that is really acceptable is rejected. This is called ``seller's
risk.''


                      Other Quality Control Techniques
Flowcharts and Diagrams
Flowcharts can be helpful in understanding the cause and effect relationships between
the process of performing work and the results that are inspected through measurement
or attribute inspection. A flowchart is simply an organized way to look at the steps that
have to be carried out to perform some goal. There are many techniques and styles of
flowcharting.

Cause and Effect Diagrams
The cause and effect diagram, also known as the fishbone diagram because of its appear-
ance, was developed by Kaoru Ishikawa. This is a way of diagramming the flow of work
that is useful in determining the cause and effect of problems that are encountered.
      As can be seen in Figure 4-4, the process is separated logically into branches. Each
of the branches can be dealt with separately. If the work on one branch is excessive, a
separate meeting may be used to investigate it or any other branches requiring input from
more people or more time to consider the branch.
      Like the work breakdown structure, the cause and effect diagram allows for an
orderly consideration of each of the possible causes of a problem and then allows for the
consideration of each effect and the solution that will reduce the problem.

Pareto Charts
Vilfredo Pareto is given credit for developing the concept of 80-20 rule. He was an
economist who found that typically 80 percent of the wealth of a region was concentrated
in 20 percent of the population. This concept describes a number of phenomena that

occur in the real world. In terms of quality, it can be said that 80 percent of the cost of
defects is caused by 20 percent of the problems. In other words, if there were one hundred
possible things that could be considered to be defects in a process, 20 percent, or twenty
of the problems, will account for 80 percent of the cost.
     By identifying these twenty items it is possible to expend the energy of the organiza-
tion where it will do the most good. In quality control, as well as in many areas of project
management, it is important that the always limited effort available in the organization
be concentrated on the problems where the most benefits will result.
     The Pareto chart is a simple way of determining the places where this effort might
be concentrated. The problems in a process are arranged in the order of importance and
are generally arranged by ranking according to the most important factors, such as cost,
time delay, or some other parameter (Table 4-1; Figure 4-5).
     It can be plainly seen that problem ``a'' is the most serious problem and will have
the greatest effect on the process if it is solved. If problem ``a'' is solved, we can redraw
the Pareto chart to show the improvement (Table 4-2; Figure 4-6).

Control Charts
Control charts are used to determine whether the observed variations in a process are due
to normal process variations or whether they are due to the process getting out of control.
Control charts allow the observations to be interpreted in such a way as to allow correc-
tions to the process prior to the process producing bad output.
     In order to accomplish this goal, the known variations must be determined first.
This is done by measuring the dimensions in question on a group of known parts. A lot

is selected that is known to be acceptable. The dimension is measured on each of the
parts, and the mean and standard deviation of the dimension is determined.
      By determining the mean and standard deviation of the group of parts we can define
the probability distribution of this dimension. In the area of quality we are normally
interested in maintaining process control to plus or minus 3 standard deviations. This
means that if we consider the dimension of the part in question and the process is under
control, then 99.7 percent of the parts coming out of the process should fall in the
dimensional range of plus or minus 3 standard deviations from the mean value dimen-
sion. If a part is measured and found to be outside this range of values, we have cause for
concern. This is a concern even though the part dimensions could still be well within the
engineering design tolerance of the part's dimensions.
      The control chart is constructed by marking the middle line as the mean value. The
upper and lower control limits are determined by adding and subtracting three times the
standard deviation of the measurement of the part (Figure 4-7).
      If parts are later measured and found to be greater or less than the upper and lower
control limits specified, then the process is considered to be out of control and to have
an assignable cause. This assignable cause should be investigated to determine what the
problem is and appropriate corrective action should be taken. Normally, the upper and
lower control limits are less than the engineering dimensional part tolerance for this
dimension.
      Frequently, a guideline to the use of the control chart is the ``rule of seven.'' If there

are seven or more points in succession that are either above or below the mean value
there is cause for concern about the process. This is because the probability of there being
seven measurements in a row that are all on the same side of the mean value is very small,
and therefore, it can be concluded that the process is no longer functioning properly.
      For example, suppose a part is designed to have a dimension of 1.000 inches, with
a tolerance of plus or minus .005 inches. A group of parts are made after the process has
been developed and stabilized and been in operation for several hundred parts. These
parts are individually measured for this dimension. The mean and standard deviation for
the group of parts is determined.
      As seen in Figure 4-7, the mean value is found to be 1.0100 inches and the standard
deviation is found to be .0001 inches. The upper control limit can be set at 1.0103
inches, and the lower control limit can be set at 1.0097.
      Notice that the mean value of the process is not necessarily the nominal dimension
on the engineering specification. This is because the process engineer in this situation has
determined to run the process deliberately on the high side of the dimension. By taking
this approach, if the process goes out of control and bad parts are made, there is a
greater chance that the bad parts can be reworked by re-machining them. This is a better
alternative than scrapping parts that are too small.

Run Charts
Run charts are simple diagrams that are used to plot an attribute of a product. These are
similar to control charts except that upper and lower control limits are not used. Periodi-
cally an observation is made of a characteristic attribute. The observation is recorded.
Over time, trends may be seen and a history of the observed characteristic is made. Run
charts are frequently done prior to the calculation of the control limits of a control chart.

Checklists
Checklists are a sample tool that is used to keep from overlooking items of importance.
A checklist is really just an instruction sheet for an inspector to use. The items in the
checklist should be significant items. If a checklist is seen as a superfluous document, it
will not be used.

Kaizen
Kaizen is one of the many quality techniques that come to us from the work of the
Japanese. The Japanese word for continuous improvement is kaizen. Using this method,
the managers as well as the workers and everyone else are continuously on the lookout
for opportunities to improve quality. Thus the quality of a process improves in small
increments on a continuous basis.
     In this kaizen way of doing things, even the processes that are operating without
problems are continuously under scrutiny. A process is observed to be making acceptable

parts, but is seen to be slow, or there is an opportunity for even greater quality than is
required.

Benchmarking
Benchmarking is the process of comparing the performance of a current process to that
of another similar process to determine the differences between them. If a machine can
manufacture two hundred parts an hour and a new machine is compared to the old
machine, the benchmark for the existing process on the old machine is two hundred parts
per hour.


                                               Summary
Quality management is one of the most important aspects of project management. It is
the ``stuff '' that holds a project together. We must have excellent quality in the projects
that we produce. Quality management is the process that ensures that we produce each
of the deliverables of the project. The three areas of quality management that we are
concerned with are quality planning, quality assurance, and quality control.
      The cost of quality is actually the profit of quality. The cost of preventing quality
problems is less than the cure of having to correct the problem once it has occurred. The
savings that are realized in a good quality management plan more than offset the cost of
its implementation.
      Quality control is the implementation of various control techniques. Various inspec-
tion techniques are implemented to prevent defects in processes as well as to prevent the
customer from receiving parts that are defective. The acceptable quality level, or AQL, is
the allowed number of defective parts that can be delivered without the entire shipment
or lot being considered to be bad. This is because trying to produce 100 percent perfect
parts becomes very expensive as the 100 percent mark is neared. Buyer's risk is the risk
that a lot of parts that is unacceptable will be accepted by sampling inspection. Seller's
risk is the possibility that a lot of parts that is truly acceptable will be rejected.
      Sampling inspection is a statistical method of inspecting large numbers of parts. It
is based on the probability that if there is a certain percentage of defects in a large lot, the
probability of finding them can be determined statistically.
      Quality is one of the areas in which a remarkable amount of money can be saved.
This is because we not only save the direct and observable cost of defective goods and
services to our customer, but we save in lost goodwill and future problems that defects
bring about.
      In the area of project management we must be vigilant and hold to good quality
standards at all times, because failure to adhere to good quality practices could end with
the ruination of the organization.

                  Human Resources Management




H
         uman resources management is required to make the most efficient use of the
         project human resources. This includes all of the people involved in the project--
         the stakeholders, sponsors, customers, other departments, the project team, sub-
contractors, and all others.
      Organizational planning involves the organizing of the human resources. These are
the roles, responsibilities, and relationships of the people who are on the project team. As
in all things in project management, human resources management takes place through-
out the project. If at any time the project organization needs to be revised, the human
resources plan will assist in carrying this out.
      On large projects there may be a core team, sometimes called the executive or
leadership team, which is responsible for the planning, controlling, and closing of the
project. On smaller projects a more participative team is used, with all of the members
of the project team participating to get these things done.
      With all of this in mind the jobs that must be done relevant to the project from the
standpoint of human resources are to create a human resources plan, acquire and develop
a project team, and manage that team properly.
      Normally on projects, human resources administration is not the responsibility of
the project team. There is usually some functional department such as a human resources
department that has the responsibility for contracts, employee benefits, and the like.
Project managers and project teams should be aware of the human resources functions
because the trend in companies using project management is to increase the responsibility
of project managers and their teams. The analogy is that projects should be managed like
small businesses where the proprietor of the business has many different responsibilities.

             Project Manager Roles and Responsibilities
It is a long-standing joke in the project management community that if anyone ever asks
you who is responsible for anything in the project, the answer will always be the project
manager. Truly it is easier to specify what the project manager does not do than to discuss
what he or she actually does and is responsible for.
       The nature and scope of the project should dictate the individual roles and responsi-
bilities of the project team. When all of the team assignments and responsibilities have
been decided, all of the functions and responsibilities of the project will have been as-
signed. The responsibility-accountability matrix is useful for determining and tracking
the relationship between a given responsibility and who is responsible for it.

Responsibility-Accountability Matrix
As can be seen in Figure 5-1, the responsibility-accountability matrix is a short notational
form that allows us to easily see the relationship between the individuals on a project

team and their responsibilities. Various levels of the responsibility-accountability matrix
may be developed for various parts and levels of the project. These are quite simple. The
persons involved are listed in the first column on the left and the responsibilities are listed
in a row across the top. For each person-responsibility combination there is an intersect-
ing space. The intersection shows the person and their involvement in the responsibility.
A third dimension can be shown with a legend listing the different ways that a person
can be involved and using symbols at the intersection to show the involvement.
Project Schedule
The project manager, in order to determine when activities are supposed to take place in
the project, uses the project schedule (Figure 5-2). It constitutes the schedule for the
work that has to be done. Of course, people are involved with the work that has to be
done. The project manager in a matrix organization draws the people from the functional
organization.
Staffing Plan
Referring to Figure 5-3, the functional manager must have a staffing plan that allows him
or her to know where the people in the functional organization are committed. If these
commitments are not organized, the utilization of the human resources will be poor. A
staffing plan for the functional manager is similar to the project schedule, except that
instead of showing the schedule for each task in the project, it shows the schedule for
each resource in the functional manager's responsibility.
      It is important that the project manager and the functional manager have a clear
understanding as to who is being moved to the project to perform work for the project
and when they are scheduled to do it. The staffing plan communicates this information
very well, and the employees and both managers as well as other project managers seeking
resources can easily see what is going on.
Training Plan
Sometimes the project work requires skills that are not available. In these situations it
may be necessary for a project to accept a resource who lacks the proper training for the
work. A training plan is necessary to support the training for this type of individual.

Organization Chart
Hierarchical organization charts are the traditional ``Org. Charts'' that we are all used to.
They show the reporting hierarchy from the bottom of the project organization to the
project manager. It is important that these charts be circulated widely so that any misun-
derstandings about who reports to whom can be avoided. The Organizational Breakdown
Structure (OBS) is the hierarchical organization chart of the existing departments and
their responsibilities, while the Resource Breakdown Structure (RBS) is the arrangement of
the project by the types of resources employed by the project.
      For example, if we had a project to build a ship to transport people to Mars, in the
OBS we might have departments responsible for the structure, propulsion, electronics,
navigation, and many more. Each of these units may be located in different places or
even different cities, and all of them may employ one or more skills that are used in other
departments. In the case of the RBS, the resources are organized according to similar
skills organized into categories.


        Strong Matrix, Weak Matrix, and Balanced Matrix
                         Organizations

Strong Matrix
In a strong matrix organization the project manager has greater authority or power than
the functional manager. In this situation, project managers generally get the people they




                           ................. 11151$   $CH5   02-09-05 08:07:05   PS             PAGE 121

want. In fact the project managers in this type of organization get more than they should.
A manager who is assertive will usually get the personnel he or she wants. The functional
manager is not able to overcome the project manager's authority and is not free to assign
people where their talent is best utilized.
     If this type of organization becomes stronger, most if not all of the personnel will
be working on projects, and project managers will be able to draw more highly qualified
people than are really needed for their projects. The surplus personnel are traded between
the project managers themselves, bypassing the functional managers altogether. In this
type of organization the project manager has strong authority.

Weak Matrix
In the weak matrix organization, the project manager does not have as much power as
the functional manager. This usually occurs in organizations that are moving into matrix
management for the first time. The situation occurs something like this: The company's
chief executive officer (CEO) decides that matrix management is the thing for the com-
pany to do. Almost overnight an attempt is made to change the organization from a
functional organization to a matrix management.
      When this happens, there is a reaction from the functional managers. After all, these
are the major human assets in the company. They would not be in a position of authority
if they were not good managers.
      The functional managers see the problem in the new organization. In the past, they
had responsibility for the administration as well as the directing of work in their part of
the organization. Under matrix management they no longer direct some of the work that
their people are doing. The fact that project managers will direct that work is a threat to
the functional managers. The salary that the company is going to pay the project manag-
ers is going to come from someplace. Most likely it is going to come from cuts in func-
tional managers' salary. The functional managers react by convincing the upper
management of the company to allow the project managers only to recommend work to
be done, and to let the functional managers continue to actually direct the work.
      This form of matrix management can be used if there is a transition going on. In
the beginning of the transition to matrix management, the project managers are new and
inexperienced. As they gain experience, they should be given more authority over the
people who report to them. At the same time, the functional managers can be transitioned
out of the organization and promoted into higher and more responsible jobs. As the
functional managers move on, more appropriate administrative managers can replace
them, and direction of the work can be managed by the project manager.

Balanced Matrix
In the balanced matrix organization, the power levels of the functional manager and the
project manager are in balance. By that I mean that the functional manager cannot force




                        ................. 11151$   $CH5   02-09-05 08:07:05   PS              PAGE 122
 Human Resources Management                                                             123



the project manager, and the project manager cannot force the functional manager. The
functional manager makes the decisions about where the people in his or her department
will be assigned, and the project manager works with the functional manager to recruit
the proper person for the project assignment.
      A balancing rule can be applied. By setting a specific interval of time as a require-
ment for moving a person to the project team, balance can be achieved. For example, a
person who is required to work full time on a project for two months is transferred to
the project, while persons who are required to work less than two months remain in their
functional department, and under the supervision of the functional manager. Persons
working longer than two months would be physically moved to the project space and
would return to the functional area when the work is completed. The project manager
authorizes any work to be done in the functional area by generating a work order or some
other device.
      By adjusting the balance point, more or less work can be made to happen in the
functional areas. If more work is being handled on the project, the project manager has
more people reporting to him or her, increasing the project manager's power level. At
one extreme we have a strong matrix, where the length of time required to move a person
to the project team is very short. At the other extreme we have a weak matrix, where the
length of time required to move a person to the project team is very long.

Making Matrix Management Work
Matrix management is not without its problems. The organization is quite complex in
comparison to the functional or pure project types of organization. Since the resources
are shared, people working in this type of organization also share their bosses. This
increases problems in communications, and many more management skills are required
to make it all work.
      These problems are offset by the flexibility that is achieved. The matrix organization
is able to respond quickly and correctly to the needs of the customer in a proper fashion.
The project team has greater focus on the customer's needs. Good project direction
and participative management lead to high motivation and a sense of achievement and
recognition on the project team.
      Moving from a functional organization to a matrix organization may take two to
three years in some organizations. This is necessary because it takes time to move the
functional managers out of their positions and into other productive areas. If movement
from functional organizations to matrix organizations is too fast, the result can be chaos
and the loss of important personnel. The objective must be to create the impression that
people are going to be promoted to other positions and not that their positions are going
to be degraded. The functional managers in the existing organization are the major assets
of the company and must not be lost.

Personnel and Personal Evaluations
Many project managers tend to have trouble getting enough people to work on their
projects in the beginning. Frequently this problem can be helped by looking at key people
who are still assigned to other projects but are close to finishing. Many of these project
managers want to keep their key persons ``just in case'' something goes wrong. However,
these people are often underutilized and their project managers may welcome the oppor-
tunity to have some of their time charged to another project.
      Once a project is in the execution phase some of the work of the project will be
done in the functional departments. This means that the project manager must have
good negotiating skills. The project manager must also be able to negotiate with the
functional manager to arrange assignment of people to the project.
      Project managers may also need skills in the procurement of personnel from outside
the company. Because of the nature of projects there may be unusual skills or unusual
quantities of skills required by the project that are simply not available in the company.
      Today many project teams are virtual teams, with team members located in different
offices, buildings, or even countries. This has been made possible by today's excellent
communications through the Internet, cell phones, videoconferencing, and e-mail. We
thus can have more skilled individuals working on our project teams than we could in
the past. For example, it makes it possible for parents who work at home, mobility-
impaired people, and people living in other countries to be an integral part of any project
team.
      Co-location of project teams becomes more difficult today with the increasing use
of virtual teams. What we mean by co-location is physically moving the members of the
project team to the same location. This improves casual communication between team
members and increases their awareness of what is happening in the project. People work-
ing in virtual teams or just in different offices in the same building have a more difficult
time becoming a true part of the project team. A good project manager must deal with
this fact when forced to work with a virtual project team. Special team building activities
must be employed to create a sense of teamwork on a virtual team.
      On all project teams a formal set of ground rules should be used, which make all of
the team members' expectations clear and avoid misunderstanding during their time
spent on the project. These ground rules can cover items like flex time, voluntary and
mandatory overtime, training and conferences, travel, formal recognition, and rewards.
      It is critically important that functional managers and project managers work to-
gether to evaluate employees. This is a problem, because the project team members may
be assigned to the project for only a short time and may be assigned to several different
projects with several different project managers during the course of the evaluation pe-
riod. Project managers are oriented toward the goals of the project and frequently think
of employee evaluations as administrative work that is the responsibility of the functional
manager.

     One simple method for accomplishing this and solving the problem is to have the
project managers or subproject managers meet individually with people on their project
team and review progress being made toward their project assignments. Something as
simple as a lined tablet can be used for this. The project manager meets with an individual
and makes notes on the tablet. When the meeting is over, a copy of the notes is given to
the individual and a copy is filed away by the project manager.
     When the person leaves the project, the notes are reviewed by both the individual
and the project manager, a summary is written by the project manager with comments
by the individual, and the whole package is copied and sent to the functional manager.
In this way, when the time of appraisal is due, the functional manager has the notes from
the project managers and can make a proper evaluation of the employees.



                                           Motivation

Importance of Motivation
Until modern times there has been little interest in motivation of people in a work
environment. From the beginning of the industrial revolution until the end of World
War II there was some compelling reason for people to work and work hard.

     Industrial Revolution
     In the beginning of the industrial revolution people moved to the cities to find work
that would give them a better standard of living than the farm work that was available to
them. Thus there were many people available for all jobs. If someone did not want to
work the hours required under the conditions given, someone else was happy to take the
job immediately.
     After the rise of unions, the lot of workers improved. In the beginning of the twenti-
eth century, the First World War brought industrial expansion and more jobs, but the
patriotic motivation brought even more workers to the workplace.

     Scientific Management
     The concept of scientific management was implemented by Henry Ford and Fred-
rick Taylor. In this concept the problem of motivation was essentially ignored. A person
was considered to be like a machine. If a person was defective and could not perform the
work required, the person was simply replaced with another person who would do the
work. The idea behind the assembly line is to have short repetitive jobs for people to do.
This results in a rapid slide down the learning curve. If a person has to be replaced,
another can quickly learn the job and become productive.
     Learning Curve Theory. The concept of the learning curve is quite simple. If people




                          ................. 11151$   $CH5   02-09-05 08:07:06   PS            PAGE 125

do a job repeatedly, each time they double the number of times they repeat the job, the
time to do the work is reduced by a constant percentage.
       Figure 5-4 shows a 70 percent improvement learning curve. This means that when
the number of times the job is done is doubled, the cost is reduced to 70 percent. If the
first time the job is done the cost is $1,000, the second time the cost will be $700. The
fourth time the job is done the cost will be $490, and so on. It should be noted that this
is similar to the law of diminishing returns in that, for every doubling of repetitions, the
amount of reduction is less and less.

     Depression Era
     In the 1930s the Depression once again caused more people to look for jobs than
there were jobs for them. Again, people who did not like the work conditions simply
were replaced. When people are trying to satisfy their basic needs, they will work under
harsh conditions.

     World War II
     World War II brought about the patriotic reaction to work. The war engendered
prosperity for those who were not in the armed services. The war effort involved total
mobilization of industry to defeat the Axis countries. This in itself created a sense of
motivation sufficient for people to work their best.

       Post-World War II
       Postwar prosperity created a new challenge in terms of motivating workers. For the
first time in history the basic needs of U.S. citizens were essentially satisfied. There were
enough jobs so that people were generally not afraid of starving or having enough money
to buy clothing and supply other basic needs.
       The problem was that in this prosperity it was difficult to get people to perform the
way that they had during the war. This resulted in high levels of absenteeism, poor
performance, and a general lack of motivation to do good work.
       Companies recognized this problem and began to spend money to try to find solu-
tions to the problem. For this reason much research was done on the problem of motiva-
tion, and a great body of knowledge was accumulated.
       Research in the area of motivation is money well spent. Motivated employees come
to work every day and produce high quality work. Employees who are not motivated have
high absenteeism, produce lower quality work, and actually work a smaller percentage of
the time. Millions of dollars could be saved by reducing absenteeism by only 10 percent.

Motivational Ideas
Because we have a limited amount of space available we will look at only a few of the
most popular and widely accepted ideas on motivation.

      Procedures vs. Motivation
      We begin with the theory of scientific management, the idea that efficiency and
better use of human resources result if clear and specific procedures are used. The idea
behind this is that when people know exactly what they are supposed to do and exactly
when they are supposed to do it, they will be satisfied with their jobs, be more motivated,
and become more efficient. Studies conducted in this area indicated that the creation of
procedures improved performance where nothing else was done to improve the perfor-
mance of employees. The studies also showed that doing things that were motivational
to employees improved performance and efficiency still more.
      Typical of these studies is the graph shown in Figure 5-5, which simplifies a number
of these studies. A large number of companies were studied. Each company was assessed
for the amount of effort that was made to do things that were considered to be motiva-
tional. At the same time an assessment was made of the actual performance of the com-
pany. Performance was measured by looking at measurable criteria such as employee
turnover, dissatisfaction, quality of output, and so on.
      In companies that did little to proceduralize their work and did little to motivate
their employees, the expected performance was low. In companies where an effort was
made to improve procedures but little was done to improve the motivation of the employ-
ees, the performance of the company was considerably higher.
      In companies where an effort was made to improve motivation but little was done

to improve the procedures, the performance of the company was considerably higher as
well. Not only that, but the performance of these companies was considerably higher
than that of the companies that had expended considerable effort creating procedures.
      The highest performance was in companies that did both. A certain amount of
proceduralization in combination with the creation of a motivational environment cre-
ated the highest performing organizations.

      Expectancy Theory
      Expectancy theory focuses on people's ideas about their jobs and their surroundings.
It focuses on the idea that people will do a certain thing in order to receive some sort of
positive outcome. In other words, people will do good work because they see some sort
of reward happening as a direct result. Of course, the difficulty with this is that if people
have an expectancy that some outcome will result when they behave in a certain way and
then it does not happen, there are problems.
      Expectancy theory is a simple concept. It says that if you can create an expectancy
in a person, the expectancy may indeed become fact. If a person is told that he or she is
a poor performer and is no good at doing a job, the person will eventually become no
good at doing the job and become a bad performer. If on the other hand a person is told
that he or she is a high performer and does good work, the person may indeed become a
good worker and a high performer.
      Typical of the studies that were done at this time were studies that were conducted
in elementary schools. In these studies the researchers administered an intelligence-
measuring test at each school. Without looking at the results of the intelligence tests they
randomly selected a small group of students in each class. The teachers and the parents
were told that these students exhibited a high capability to learn and perform well in
school.
      After a period of time the researchers returned to the schools and administered
another intelligence-measuring test. The results of this second test indicated that the
students who had been randomly selected to be in the advanced capability group had
improved their grades considerably. The only reason for this improvement was the ex-
pressed attitude of the teachers, parents, and peers toward the advanced students.
      In practice, in project management, this concept can be applied by treating people
with encouragement, giving them a sense of recognition and achievement, and giving
praise publicly and criticism privately.

     Maslow's Hierarchy of Needs Theory
     The concept of a hierarchy of needs was developed by Abraham Maslow in 1943
(Figure 5-6). Like other concepts, this one is relatively simple. The basic human needs
are arranged in a hierarchy. The lower needs must be satisfied before the higher needs
can be addressed.




                           ................. 11151$   $CH5   02-09-05 08:07:07   PS             PAGE 129

Figure 5-6. Maslow's hierarchy.

                                         RECOGNITION


                                        SOCIALIZATION


                                 SECURITY AND SAFETY


                         FOOD, SHELTER, AND CLOTHING



      In Maslow's hierarchy, the lowest level--the needs for food, shelter, and clothing--
must be relatively satisfied before effort will be made to satisfy the higher needs of safety
and security. Someone who is lacking sufficient amounts of food, shelter, and clothing
will be highly motivated to obtain them. Once a satisfactory level is obtained for these
things, there is a reduced motivation to satisfy them. As one level of needs in the hierarchy
is satisfied, the next level becomes the motivating factor, and so on.
      According to this concept, people are always in some sort of a ``needs'' state. This
needs state goes to higher, loftier needs as the lower needs are met, but it can also be
driven down to the more basic needs if they are reduced.
      Several survival biographies and histories of groups have been written over the years
about people's reactions to hardship and dire situations. Typically in these stories the
group starts out as an agreeable and mutually cooperative group with some goal in mind.
As the hardships increase, the motivation moves from satisfying self-esteem to satisfying
the need for socialization to the more basic needs. As the lower levels of needs become
unsatisfied the individual's motivation becomes more basic and more self-serving. In
World War II prison camps, these basic needs became so motivating that people per-
formed acts that they would never have performed under normal circumstances.
      The dynamic order of needs from lower to higher is to first satisfy the need for food,
shelter, and clothing. These are the basic physiological needs of the individual. Once this
has been accomplished or at least relatively well satisfied, the need for safety and security
becomes the motivating factor. In satisfying this need the individual's immediate need
for the basics has been satisfied, and the individual seeks out the protection of these

 Human Resources Management                                                               131



satisfying factors. A person satisfies his or her need for housing and then wants to ensure
that the housing is secure far into the future.
      The need for socialization is next. Once the security of basic needs has been satisfied,
the person is motivated by the need to have social contact or love. In terms of the
workplace, a motivating atmosphere would be one where the individual is made to feel
welcome and liked by his or her coworkers. Once a person feels accepted and has a
satisfactory amount of love and acceptance, he or she can be motivated by the need for
self-esteem.
      The top of the hierarchy of needs is self-actualization. This need is satisfied by
having the feeling that what you are doing is good for its own sake, and it is not necessary
to have the recognition of a peer or even a manager. The person's own self-interest is
enough to motivate.
      In the 1970s many companies tried to implement this method of motivation. It was
felt that the basic needs of food, shelter, clothing, security, and safety were already satis-
fied and that employee motivation could be achieved by increasing workers' ability to
socialize. Companies attempted to make their employees ``one big happy family.'' Gener-
ally, this was attempted by building golf courses and country clubs and encouraging
company sponsored after-hours activities. In general, these programs failed. People's need
for socialization was already satisfied, and giving them more of these things did not
motivate them further. One side effect of this kind of program was that when these things
were later withdrawn there was a great deal of dissatisfaction, and employees became de-
motivated.

      Hertzberg's Motivation/Hygiene Theory
      When it became apparent that there were some problems with Maslow's explanation
of motivation, the research continued. In fact, the research was continued by Maslow
and his team. One of the team members was Fredrick Hertzberg, who developed the
motivation/hygiene theory.
      The research behind this theory was based on the need to explain some research
where groups of executives and other professionals were interviewed to determine the
things that made them feel good or not good about their work. The concept is that if
there are things that make you feel good about working, then these things should also be
the things that motivate you.
      The factors that are linked with people having a good time when they are working
are called ``motivators'' or ``satisfiers.'' These were identified as a sense of achievement
and a sense of recognition for things done, the work itself, responsibility, advancement,
growth, and so on.
      The factors that were linked with people having a bad time at work were called
``dissatisfiers'' or ``hygiene factors.'' These factors included things like company policies,
relationships with supervisors, salary, relationships with peers, personal factors, status,




                           ................. 11151$   $CH5   02-09-05 08:07:09   PS              PAGE 131

security, and others. These items were considered to be environmental in nature, and
their loss seemed to be associated with bad feelings. Bad feelings were de-motivating.
People did not like to do their job when it caused them to feel bad.
      To summarize Hertzberg's conclusions, when hygiene factors are maintained, dissat-
isfaction is avoided. When the hygiene factors are not maintained, dissatisfaction occurs
and motivation cannot happen. An unhappy person will not respond to things that make
a happy person more motivated. Not only that, but if the same thing is given to people
after they have reached their point of no dissatisfaction they would not improve perfor-
mance. The cost for these types of programs, however, would increase.
      ``Motivators'' were the factors that allowed people to become motivated. By becom-
ing motivated they developed a will to get things done. This was much stronger than the
feelings they had about their work when they were merely dissatisfied. Motivators must
be given to improve productivity once the point of no dissatisfaction is reached. The
motivating factors are recognition and a feeling of satisfaction and an increase in a per-
son's self esteem.
      The organization must carefully maintain the hygiene factors by having a good
personnel policy and good leadership practices. To motivate people a feeling of achieve-
ment and recognition for work done must be created. People must feel responsibility for
their work and feel empowered to do it. This is of course what the principles behind the
human factors in project management are all about.

     Supervisory Style and Delegation
     All of these theories seem to indicate that the most motivational methods that can
be used will center on high maintenance of the hygiene factors that Hertzberg uses in his
explanation. Companies must have good and fair pay policies, good supervision and
leadership, and all of the other environmental factors that make an employee workplace
an environment conducive to doing good work. Without these things the employees will
probably not work to their fullest potential.
     Work can be designed so that it improves a person's sense of achievement and
recognition. People need to be responsible for the work that they do and have the tools
and means at their disposal to complete the work. Employees should feel that they partici-
pate in the process of work assignment.

     Job and Work Design
     Many large organizations in the past simply expected employees to perform the job
for which they were paid. The employees' happiness was of little concern. The concept
was that people were there to do work for the company, and they could be happy on
their own time. The attitude seemed to be, ``Here is a meaningless repetitive job. In
return for doing it we will give you money and other rewards. You have to spend eight




                       ................. 11151$   $CH5   02-09-05 08:07:09   PS              PAGE 132
 Human Resources Management                                                            133



hours a day here doing this work that you do not like so that you can ultimately have
time to yourself and money to spend.''
      Under this system employees became very unhappy and resented the company. This
was evident in an aggressive attitude toward the organization or apathy or lack of interest
in the company at all. The results of this attitude were evident in conflict between com-
pany representatives and employees. Managers came to think that the employees did not
care about the company and its success or failure, and the employees did not think that
the company cared about their well-being.
      For these reasons it is necessary for job design to take place. The purpose of job
design is to change these attitudes toward work. Job design is particularly important to
the project manager, because a project environment is often uncertain and insecure for
the project team, and the proper design of the job of the project team is therefore impor-
tant to the success of the project team and the project.
      Job Enlargement. Job enlargement is done by simply making the job larger. Going
back to the ideas of Henry Ford and Fredrick Taylor, the idea of the assembly-line job
was to have the job as short as possible to minimize training and maximize interchange-
ability of people on the job. The objective was to be able to keep the assembly line going
even though changes in the workers and other problems might occur.
      In an assembly line the work is broken down into very small units, and each person
does a small amount of the total work required. For example, in a new Saab automobile
plant in Sweden, the Saab engineers estimated that a subassembly of the engine could
be manufactured in 12.6 minutes using assembly-line techniques. The engineers also
determined that a single person, working by himself or herself, could make the same
subassembly in 30 minutes. On the assembly line the job of each of the workers was only
1.8 minutes each. By enlarging the job the size of the job went from 1.8 minutes to 30
minutes.
      Although the total effort spent to manufacture the subassembly was larger, Saab felt
that the total life cycle cost of assembling the engine was lower. This was due to a
much higher motivation, lack of boredom, and a feeling of accomplishing something
meaningful. The workers felt good about their job and were much more motivated. This
resulted in lower levels of waste and rework due to poorly assembled engine subassem-
blies. The cost of defects in the engine subassemblies was quite high if the defect caused
serious damage to other parts or if the engine ultimately failed in the field.
      All of the other costs of unmotivated employees also served to offset the additional
time of assembly. Disruptions due to worker absenteeism, tardiness, poor attitude, and
so on served additionally to offset the total cost of the assembly.
      One problem with job enlargement is that in enlarging the job it is possible to take
a small meaningless job and make it into a large meaningless job. It would not be particu-
larly motivating for an assembly-line worker who is responsible for tightening four screws
if his or her job was enlarged to tightening sixteen screws.

134                  Preparing for the Project Management Professional Certification Exam



      Job Enrichment. Job enlargement was improved by the concept of job enrichment.
The crucial difference was that job enrichment programs not only enlarged the job to
make it more meaningful to the worker but also changed the nature of the job itself to
make it more motivating.
      The major difference between an enlarged job and an enriched one is that the
enriched job includes a planning and control task as well as the operating task. Previously,
the planning and control of work was done by someone else, and the operational part of
the work was the only part that was delegated.
      An example of job enrichment is the operation of an automotive maintenance facil-
ity. Without job enrichment the mechanic is given assignments from the manager. When
each assignment is completed the mechanic goes on to the next assignment. The manager
does all of the planning and scheduling work. The manager does the entire interface with
the customer. With job enrichment, the mechanic is required to talk to the customer and
determine what problems need to be addressed in agreement with the customer. The
mechanic might actually be required to schedule the work and promise the customer
when the work will be completed.
      Another important characteristic of job enrichment is that the information flows
from the persons furnishing the input information directly to the persons needing the
information. This is different from the traditional nonenriched job where most informa-
tion is first sent to the supervisor and then retransmitted to those in need of the informa-
tion. In this way a relationship is formed between the person doing the work and the
person benefiting from the work being done.
      In job enrichment there are four motivational effects that occur:

      1. Lack of boredom
      2. Feeling that the work is meaningful
      3. Feeling of being responsible for the consequences of what work is done and how
         it is done
      4. Feeling of competence in accomplishing the task

     In project management, job enrichment is fundamental to the management of the
project. Each of the persons on the project team as well as the stakeholders of the project
are encouraged to make their own individual plans for the work that they do. In fact, the
work that each individual associated with the project does is discovered and self-assigned
in the course of the planning and execution of the project. People working on projects
should design their own tasks, plan them, estimate the cost and time necessary to do
them, and provide feedback to the stakeholder needing the work to be done.
     Quality Circles. Quality circles are ad hoc organizations within the company and the
project team. They are a volunteer group of people who have mutually agreed to address




                        ................. 11151$   $CH5   02-09-05 08:07:11   PS               PAGE 134
 Human Resources Management                                                               135



some sort of problem. They can be composed of anyone in the organization desiring to
address the problem, and membership must be voluntary.
      Quality circles must be supported by the company organization but not managed
by it. Facilities, support, and time to meet and work on issues that the quality circle is
addressing must be given to them.
      Let us say, for example, that there is a problem with a high number of defects in the
paint of an automotive fender. A group of volunteers can form a quality circle to address
the problem. The group might consist of assembly workers, inspectors, quality assurance
engineers, paint engineers, and so on. The company assigns a facilitator to assist the
quality circle in achieving its goal.
      The quality circle meets on company time, discusses the problem, and attempts to
analyze problems and solutions. The facilitator attempts to make resources available to
them and to ensure that they have access to managers who must ultimately approve their
solution to the problem.
      This is in keeping with the aims of job enrichment in that each person on the
quality circle is there voluntarily, is responsible for the planning, execution, and feedback
of what he or she does, has an interest in the results, and feels responsible for the process.



                                                  Power
Power is the ability of one person to influence the behavior of another. In project manage-
ment, understanding power and the use of power can have a great effect on the outcome
of the project.

Forms of Power
Power is not simply the brute force necessary to bend someone to your will. There are
several ways that people can be influenced.

      Coercive Power and Reward Power
      Coercive power is based on the idea in the mind of the person being influenced that
the person having the influence has the ability to inflict punishment or pain. This pain
will be unpleasant, and it will be more unpleasant than doing the task.
      Reward power is based on the idea in the mind of the person being influenced that
the person having the influence has the ability to administer some sort of reward. This
reward will be pleasant, and it will be more pleasant than any unpleasantness associated
with doing the task.
      Coercive and reward power depend on the person being influenced believing that
the thing being requested can actually be done, that the reward or punishment can




                           ................. 11151$   $CH5   02-09-05 08:07:11   PS              PAGE 135
136                   Preparing for the Project Management Professional Certification Exam



actually be given by the influencer, and that the reward or punishment is sufficient to
motivate the person being influenced to do the work.
      For example, if parents want to influence the grades of their child, they might try
to influence the child by offering to buy him or her a car if the child gets straight A's
next year in high school. The child may feel that there is no possible way of achieving
this goal. In this case, the influence will not take place. The child may feel that the
parents will not be able to deliver the reward if the goal is achieved, and again the
influence will not take place. Finally, the child may not care about getting the reward
offered, in which case the influence will not take place.

      Legitimate Power
      Legitimate power is based on the idea in the mind of the person being influenced
that the person having the influence has this influence because of the values of the person
being influenced. In other words, the influenced person believes that the person influenc-
ing has the right to do this through formal authority in the organization.
      For example, in medieval societies, the king was obeyed because everyone believed
he had that authority from God. Although response to this sort of power may have once
been motivated by fear, over time the power is changed into a tradition. The person who
is the influencer has power over others even if he or she lacks the power to punish and
reward any longer.
      When new employees start to work in a firm, the authority and chain of command
in the company are clearly explained them. As long as people wish to work for this
company they agree to respect the legitimate authority of those in positions above them.

      Referent Power
      Referent power is based on the idea in the mind of the person being influenced that
the person having the influence has this influence based on the person being influenced
having a strong desire to identify with the person influencing. A person who leads others
by virtue of his or her charisma has this type of power.
      This is the kind of power exercised by some charismatic religious leaders. In this
type of power people tend to admire certain characteristics of the influencers and follow
them blindly in other areas. These kinds of charismatic leaders influence people by the
force of their personality. People with this kind of influence can cause individuals under
their influence to perform unusual acts. Throughout history there have been many leaders
like this. It generally requires a special personality as well as a special set of circumstances
to create someone with this kind of power.

     Expert Power
     Expert power is based on the idea in the mind of the person being influenced that
the person having the influence has this influence based on special knowledge or ability.
This special knowledge or ability is believed to help the influenced achieve their goals.




                         ................. 11151$   $CH5   02-09-05 08:07:11   PS                  PAGE 136

      In most business situations people are influenced by expert power. This is the belief
that someone can influence others because that person knows more about what he or she
is doing and what everyone else should be doing. This influence is based on evidence of
the person's expertise.

     Representative Power
     Representative power is based on the idea of one or more persons being chosen by
the group from the group and having the power to lead delegated to them voluntarily.
Representative power depends on the group's willingness to delegate this power to one
or more individuals. People's willingness to give representative power to one of their
members may be influenced by all of the other types of power as well.


                                           Leadership
Theory X and Theory Y Managers
Douglas McGregor's theory of X and Y managers says that there are two kinds of manag-
ers: type X and type Y.
      Type X managers think that all people are basically lazy and that unless they are
threatened or in some way forced to do work, they will not do any work. These managers
direct work to be done and do not allow very much participation in any decision making,
because they feel that the participation by the workers would only lead to less work being
done.
      Type Y managers believe that people will do a good job for the sake of doing it.
They believe in participative management and sharing information with the workers.
These managers will also listen to problems that are brought up by their staff.
      Theory X managers are good in situations that are either very favorable or very
unfavorable, while type Y managers are good in normal types of projects where there are
a moderate number of problems. This may explain why many military managers in
combat situations use theory X type management. In a combat situation it is necessary to
have orders carried out without question or debate. In projects that are in extreme diffi-
culty, this type of manager has an advantage.

Conflict Resolution
Conflict occurs when one party to the conflict thinks that the other party to the conflict
has done something to frustrate attainment of a goal or goals. The conflict is said to be
resolved when the two parties have had their frustration lowered to an acceptable level.
      Project teams and their stakeholders, like any other group, have many interdepen-
dent parts that have their own values or interests and goals. Each person in a group
seeks to fulfill his or her own goals as well. In project management, one of the major




                          ................. 11151$   $CH5   02-09-05 08:07:11   PS            PAGE 137
138                   Preparing for the Project Management Professional Certification Exam



accomplishments necessary for the project manager is the resolution of these differences.
Since each member of the group wants to meet his or her own goals, it is sometimes
difficult for each person to fully understand the goals of others in the group. The solution
lies in the ability of the project manager to keep each member's activities from interfering
with and frustrating the other members while allowing all other activities to take place
and move the project toward its goal.
       Many believe that conflict has a beneficial side. The argument is that if the organiza-
tion is dynamic and striving toward difficult goals, there is bound to be conflict. If there
is no conflict, it follows that the organization is not dynamic and striving. This is not
necessarily the case in project management. Disagreements can be settled quickly and
amicably without having conflict. The level of frustration in the disagreeing parties is a
measure of the conflict. I believe that in a well-run project team it is possible to settle
differences without creating frustration.
       There are said to be five ways of resolving conflict:
      1.   Forcing
      2.   Smoothing
      3.   Compromise
      4.   Problem solving
      5.   Withdrawal
    These five conflict-resolving methods have varying results as to the immediate effect
and the long-term effect on the conflict resolution. They also have an effect on the
temperament of the conflicting parties (Figures 5-7 and 5-8).
     Forcing
     One way to resolve a conflict is for one party to force the other to agree. This is the
kind of conflict resolution that happens when one person has power over another and

exercises it. It amounts to the boss saying, ``OK, we have had our discussion, and now I
will make the decision.'' This method of resolving the conflict results in a permanent
solution. The solution, although permanent, might not be the best solution that might
have been found, but it does save time, and right or wrong, the conflict is resolved. This
type of resolution is not good for building teams. People's personal stakes in the decision,
especially if the decision is found to be wrong, are frustrated.

      Smoothing
      Smoothing minimizes the disagreement by making differences seem less important.
This kind of resolution occurs when either one of the persons disagreeing or another
person in the group attempts to make the differences smaller than they seem. If the tactic
is successful, one or both of the conflicting parties will think that the differences are more
minor than they had seemed and will accept either a compromise or the group's accep-
tance of one of the alternatives.
      This type of resolution is generally good for the group relations of the team. All of
the members of the group are made to feel that the conflict was less important than
originally thought. This type of resolution, however, does not lead to permanent solu-
tions. The conflicting parties do not come to an agreement about what was accepted and
what was not. At some time later, when the conflicting parties realize that the importance
of their differences has been minimized, the conflict is likely to reappear and continue.

     Compromise
     Compromise is similar to smoothing. Using this type of conflict resolution, each of
the parties gives up something to reach a common ground. In this resolution the parties
themselves agree to give up on some points but not others. In doing this they reach a
common agreement that has relatively few points of disagreement. Compromise is sort
of a middle-of-the-road kind of solution. Neither side wins or loses. Without a clear




                           ................. 11151$   $CH5   02-09-05 08:07:13   PS                         PAGE 139

winner, neither of the sides in the conflict is enthusiastic about moving forward with the
compromise plan. The effect on team building is neither good nor bad. The destructive-
ness of the conflict is avoided, but the resolution results in something that neither side
supported originally. If compromises are documented, and the parties really make them
into firm agreements and stick to them, they become permanent solutions. Many times,
as in smoothing the problem, the disagreeing parties will continue to disagree and try to
implement the original ideas.

      Problem Solving
      In problem solving, a group is set up to prove one point or another right or wrong.
This method of conflict resolution is based on the idea that all disagreements must have
one correct solution. By having additional work on the disagreement, the facts will even-
tually be uncovered, and it will be clear which of the disagreeing parties is correct. This
is actually the best way to resolve conflict. Once indisputable facts are discovered and
added to the information available about the conflict, it is difficult for any of the partici-
pants to disagree further, and the conflict is resolved. This type of solution produces the
best resolution of the conflict for the team. The resolution of the conflict becomes clear,
and there is no need for further disagreement.

      Withdrawal
      Withdrawal may be the worst way to resolve any conflict. In this type of resolution
one group leaves the argument and retires. This is the same behavior that occurs when a
small child says, ``I don't like the way you are playing this game. I am taking my ball and
going home.'' This does not really solve the conflict; it merely postpones it to another
day.
      This type of resolution has a negative effect on the team. All of the team members
feel badly about the end of the discussion and the withdrawal of one person or group.



                                  Managing Meetings
Managers and project managers spend as much as 70 percent of their time in meetings.
Nearly all managers complain that they spend more time in meetings than they should
and that, for the most part, meetings are a waste of time. If no one likes to go to meetings
and everyone feels that they are a waste of time, why do we have so many meetings?
     The reason that meetings are held is based on the concept that two heads are better
than one, three heads are better than two, and so on. Continuing to add people to a
meeting improves the chances that something can be accomplished in the meeting. The
problem is that as the number of people attending a meeting increases, the effectiveness
of the meeting increases at a diminishing rate. The cost of additional people in a meeting

continues to increase in a linear fashion, and very soon the benefit of additional people
at a meeting is less than the cost of having them there.
       As can be seen in Figure 5-9, as the number of persons who attend a meeting
increases, the effectiveness of the meeting continues to increase, but the amount of in-
crease for each additional person is less as more people attend the meeting. The rationale
for this is simple. Each additional person comes to the meeting with additional knowl-
edge and experience. There is an ever-increasing probability that the knowledge and new
ideas that this additional person brings to the meeting will already be present in someone
else. In addition, as the size of the meeting increases, the interest of some of the partici-
pants may be less than desired. These less interested people may decide to have their own
discussion while the meeting is going on and be effectively lost to the meeting taking
place around them for periods of time. With larger meetings, people who simply do not
participate may not even be noticed.
       Of course, the cost of having these people present increases in a linear fashion. In
Figure 5-9 it can also be seen that the cost begins to exceed the benefits of the meeting
at around ten people. For most meetings, ten people are optimum. In this size group it
is likely that everyone will participate in the meeting, and there will be no side discussions
taking place.
       There are several reasons to hold a meeting. Meetings can be held for the purpose
of giving out information. These types of meetings can violate the ten-person guideline.

This is the type of meeting where a large group of individuals is told about a new com-
pany policy or when some sort of announcement is made. Since there is little participa-
tion in this kind of meeting, the group can be quite large. In fact, by using various kinds
of media such as closed circuit television, very large groups can be reached.
      Most of the meetings that a project manager will have to manage are going to be
discussion, idea-generation, and problem-solving types of meetings. To solve the major
complaints of those attending these meetings--that they are a waste of time and that
they happen too often--the project manager must make the meetings effective.

Managing Meetings Effectively

     Before the Meeting
     Send out a memo giving notice of the meeting. Notifying people of a meeting by
telephone is not the most reliable way to ensure that they will attend. Sending a written
message will increase the possibility that they will attend. Most people are busy and are
bombarded with meeting notices and telephone calls. Many times meetings are called on
short notice at the inconvenience of many of the attendees. This creates a feeling of
imposition on the part of attendees and does not make for a good attitude toward the
meeting. The participants need to feel that they are a necessary, contributing part of the
meeting.
     The written notice of the meeting should contain the time and place for the meet-
ing, the subject to be discussed, the tentative agenda, and the list of those invited. In
addition, any background information that can be supplied to the participants should be
provided.
     Attendees should have time to prepare and know who is attending the meeting.
They should be specifically informed if they are going to be expected to make any presen-
tation or contribute something special to the meeting.

      Beginning the Meeting
      Open the meeting by restating the objectives. It should be clear to all of those
attending the meeting what the purpose and goal of the meeting is.
      Go over the agenda and ask for additions. This is one of the most important aspects
of making a meeting effective. One of the problems with meetings occurs when during
the meeting one of the participants is inspired to change the subject. Before anyone can
stop it, the meeting has headed off in a new direction and is no longer going in the
direction of its stated goals. The problem with this is not that the discussion is not useful
and that the new discussion is not beneficial. The problem is that the purpose of the
meeting is now sidetracked and that some of the people in the meeting are not necessary
for the discussion now taking place.
      The use of an agenda avoids this problem. When a new and nonrelevant discussion




                        ................. 11151$   $CH5   02-09-05 08:07:14   PS                PAGE 142
 Human Resources Management                                                           143



begins, the leader of the meeting can use the agenda to bring things back on track. It is
therefore important for the leader of the meeting to ask for additions or corrections to
the agenda at the beginning of the meeting. Any additions or corrections made at this
time are likely to help achieve the goal of the meeting. Later, when spontaneous discus-
sion ensues, the agenda can be used to guide it back to the purpose of the meeting.
      Have someone record all action items assigned and any conclusions reached. The
results of the meeting need to be recorded, or they will depend on the individual memo-
ries of the participants. In particular, the agreed-upon action items by the participants
must be recorded to ensure that they actually take place.
      The use of recording devices and video cameras generally has a negative effect on
the discussions that take place in meetings. Transcribing tape recordings of meetings is
generally time consuming and less effective than good note taking.
      Distribute the minutes within one day. Each meeting should be followed up by the
distribution of the minutes of the meeting. Like the meeting notes, the information and
the results of the meeting must be distributed to the attendees and other interested
parties. This written record also ensures that everyone's recollections of the meeting are
going to be the same.


                                             Summary
The purpose of human resources management in project management is to make the
most effective use of the human resources involved in the project. As always, the project
manager is responsible for the human resources management of the project.
      Projects work best when the environment around them is organized in a way that is
good for project management. The matrix organization is best for project management,
because it allows for the flexibility necessary when managing companies on a project
basis.
      Project teams must be motivated. Much of recent research on the theories of motiva-
tion applies directly to the management techniques that are fundamental to project man-
agement. These motivating methods favor participative management, responsibility and
accountability, and recognition for work done well. The concepts of job enlargement and
job enhancement fit well within the project management methodology.
      To be an effective project manager, one must have skills in dealing with the normal
conflicts that occur from day to day within the project team and between the project
team and those external to the project team. Understanding the use of power is necessary
for the success of the project.
      Project managers spend much of their life in meetings. It is important that meetings
be efficient and effective. Meeting agendas allow people to properly prepare for meetings
and help participants focus on the subjects that they are supposed to discuss.

                    Communications Management



T
       he project team must have a communication plan that determines which items of
       information need to be communicated to all of the stakeholders of the project. It
       will be determined by who the stakeholders are and to what level they are involved.
It will fulfill the stakeholders' need for information when they need it.
      The communications management plan contains all of the information regarding
the format of the reports, frequency of distribution, and the individual who has the
responsibility for generating the reports and distributing them.


                                       Lessons Learned
The lessons-learned document is a document that captures the good and bad things that
happened in the project. It should also contain a recommendation for how to avoid or
minimize the bad things and enhance the good things. The purpose of the document is
to serve other project managers working on future projects. The lessons-learned docu-
ments are an excellent starting place for risk identification. Databases can be constructed
to classify and store lessons-learned data to simplify the lookup process.
      Some companies feel so strongly about the use of this document that their project
managers are required to read the lessons learned on relevant projects before they can get
approval of the project charter. Project managers are not allowed to close out a project
until the lessons-learned document is completed and accepted.
      The lessons-learned document is supported by issue logs. An issue log is a collection
of objections from the stakeholders. Issues are items that do not necessarily become
activities in the project but must be answered to keep the stakeholders satisfied. Each

issue must be possible to resolve, have a person in charge of it, and have a due date for
resolution.
      Probably the single most important thing in project management is communica-
tions. It is said that if good communications exist in a project, the team will be motivated
and the project will succeed in spite of problems that might kill another project. It is
therefore essential that project managers have a good understanding of communications.
      It is generally agreed among project managers that communications skills are the
most important skills that a project manager can have. These skills are considered to be
more important than organization skills, team building skills, and leadership skills, and
they are certainly considered more important for project managers than technical skills
(Figure 6-1). It is often said that if a project manager has good communications skills
and no other skills at all, the project team will get the project completed successfully in
spite of the project manager.
      According to the Guide to the Project Management Body of Knowledge:

     Communications management in projects is the process required to ensure timely and
     appropriate generation, collection, dissemination, storage, and ultimately disposi-
     tion of project information.

project managers).

                      General Model of Communications
Communicating is the process of delivering a message to another with understanding.
Refer to Figure 6-2, the communications model, as we review the terms to make sure we
are communicating properly.

Thinking
The sender frames the ideas and creates the message that he or she wants to send.

Encoding
The encoding process consists of formatting the message into some transmittable form.
This makes the communication possible. The language, written and spoken words, facial
expressions, body language, and other means of transmitting an idea can be used. Some
of the time a communication we do not wish to send is sent anyway. We can communi-
cate by physically touching someone. We can communicate by making some sort of a
physical gesture such as pointing a finger.

Symbols
All sorts of symbols can be used to communicate. Symbols stand in the place of some-
thing we have experienced initially. A picture of a person is a symbol of that person. A

uniform is a symbol for a policeman. Words are symbols for the objects or ideas they
represent.

Transmitting
This is the process of moving the message from the sender to the receiver. The medium
used might be airwaves, as in the use of the spoken word; electronically, as in e-mail,
telephone, and fax; visual signals; or combinations of these.

Perceiving
The receiver must have recognition that the message is coming. If there is no perception
of the message, then the message is never received. Ultimately, the message must enter
the receiver by means of one of a person's five senses: sight, sound, smell, taste, or touch.

Decoding
The receiver must now take the message and convert it into some form that can be
understood.

Understanding
If there is no understanding, there is no message. The message must have some under-
standable meaning for the receiver.


                         Barriers to Communications
There can be many barriers to communications. Messages can be blocked or distorted,
and as a result, their meaning can be changed considerably.

Distorted Perceptions
Many times the receiver is not in the proper frame of mind to receive the message. This
may be due to many factors, such as the environment, the mood of the receiver, or the
subject matter being delivered. The status of the person sending the message may have
an effect as well. When something is being said by the person working in the next cubicle,
the effectiveness of that communication will be different from a message sent by the
CEO of the company. So we can say that motivation and needs and even experience
affect a person's perception.
      The receiver's perception is also affected by the need to connect the new message to
already received information that is stored in the receiver's memory. We try to connect
new information to old information in order to make it meaningful.

Distrusted Sources
The source of a communication may be wrong about what he or she is communicating.
It can be that the source is really wrong or it may be that we are just convinced that the




                           ................. 11151$   $CH6   02-09-05 08:07:10   PS             PAGE 147
148                  Preparing for the Project Management Professional Certification Exam



source is wrong. When this condition exists in an extreme way, it makes no difference
what is really said. The perception of the message will be similar to what is expected.

Transmission Errors
There are a number of reasons why a message is not properly received, and language is one
of the most common problems. Not only are the different words of different languages a
problem, but the cultural differences between people who speak different languages can
result in errors in communication even if the words and meanings are the same.
      Receiving and sending messages can be done only within the framework of common
experience and understanding. When the experience and understanding are different,
communication is difficult.
      When you deal with people from different cultural backgrounds, care must be taken
with the choice of words that you use. This is not only necessary when dealing with those
who are from a different country than you. There are significant cultural differences
among people from different parts of the same country and even from different neighbor-
hoods within the same city.


                        Improving Communications
The following guidelines will help you improve your communications.

Make the Message Relevant for the Receiver
Good communications come when the receiver is interested and has something at stake
in the message. If the message is relevant, then the receiver is more likely to get a more
complete meaning. We have all been in situations where someone is telling us about
something that is not relevant to us. Our attention wanders off to some other area, and
we actually do not hear anything that is said for a period of time.

Reduce the Message to Its Simplest Terms
When you communicate with someone, keep the message as simple as possible. Many
times the message is complicated with unnecessary details about the rationale and the
justification of a project when the listener is already convinced and just wants to know
what to do.

Organize the Message into a Series of Stages
One of the reasons that verbal communication succeeds over written communication is
the opportunity to keep things simple. The sender can send a simple part of the message
and receive feedback immediately. The sender can send another part of the message and
receive feedback on that too. In this way, the message is kept simple, and the receiver is




                       ................. 11151$   $CH6   02-09-05 08:07:11   PS              PAGE 148
 Communications Management                                                               149



brought to the complete understanding of the full message, one piece at a time. You may
have heard this question: ``How do you eat an elephant?'' The answer is, ``One bite at a
time.'' Of course, if it takes too long, the elephant may spoil, and the message may be
lost.

Repeat the Key Points
Because listening takes place a very small percentage of the time, it is important to repeat
the important points of the message. As we communicate, it is a good idea to go back a
few steps and summarize what has gone before. This allows repetition of some of the
major points and ensures that the receiver is getting all of the important points in the
message.


                  Verbal and Written Communications
Many people think that there is no better way to communicate than through written
messages and that written communications should be used without exception. Today,
with the use of e-mail, this feeling is becoming stronger. It is not unusual to see e-mail
messages being exchanged between people who sit ten feet from one another. Verbal and
written communications each have their place, and it is important that the correct me-
dium be used for each communication.
      Verbal communications are faster than written ones; they allow us to keep the mes-
sage simple and present one thought at a time to the listener. Because verbal communica-
tions are two way, we are able to get feedback from the receiver before going on. If the
feedback coming from the receiver does not confirm that he or she got the message, the
message can be modified and the point made in another way. Questions can be raised by
the receiver to help clarify the point.
      Written communications can be more detailed than verbal ones and can be used to
explain something that is quite complex and requires more explanation than the receiver
can absorb in a short verbal exchange. The written communication can be better orga-
nized than a verbal communication, and if it is properly organized, the receiver is able to
go back and review material already read.
      One of the reasons why so many people use e-mail is the timing issue. E-mail can
be sent quickly when the sender has the time and motivation to send it. It is read and
acted upon when the receiver has the time and motivation to act on it. In many ways
this is much better than communicating by telephone. While the telephone gives instant
communication, the person being called is usually interrupted while doing something
and must change his or her thinking to deal with the person calling on the telephone.
      In my classes I usually do an exercise where a group of five or six people is forced to
communicate with written communications only. They are given a simple problem to




                           ................. 11151$   $CH6   02-09-05 08:07:11   PS             PAGE 149
150                  Preparing for the Project Management Professional Certification Exam



work out that requires input from each of them. They are required to follow strict report-
ing procedures similar to procedures used in most companies. They are given ten minutes
to solve the problem, and fewer than one-tenth of one percent ever solve it. The groups
are then allowed to discuss the problem and do anything that they can to communicate.
When they are allowed to use free and open communications without restrictions, they
all solve the problem in about sixty seconds.


                 Formal and Informal Communications
Formal Communications
Project managers and members of their project teams are frequently required to make
formal presentations to their managers, their customers, and various other stakeholders
in the project. In order to accomplish this, it is necessary for them to have good presenta-
tion skills.
      Today we are fortunate that there is much in the way of computer software for
presentations that makes this formerly expensive chore easy and inexpensive to accom-
plish. One of the most popular software packages is Microsoft PowerPoint. This software
package makes formal presentations easy. Digital photography is now widely available, so
that photographs can be easily inserted into the presentation to make it more meaningful.
Video projection is also widely available, so that the tedious process of making presenta-
tion graphics on transparencies is no longer necessary.
      Distance conferencing is now widely used. Video and audio connections between
conference rooms eliminate the need to have people travel to distant locations to attend
meetings. This not only reduces the cost of travel but significantly saves time that can be
devoted to more direct project work.
      The Internet as well has proven to be a great communication tool for project man-
agement. Project data from various parts of a project located in remote parts of the world
can be easily shared and combined with other project data through the Internet.
      E-mail has already changed the way we communicate. For most of us, the use of
e-mail has changed the way we do business. Unlike telephone calls, which are almost
always an interruption in what we are doing, the e-mail we receive is looked at when we
want to. This allows us to pay close attention to what is being communicated and care-
fully respond to inquiries. Many decisions made quickly during a telephone call may
soon be regretted.

Informal Communications
I have a good friend who is now retired from the U.S. Navy. He was a captain and had
a large command of some 1,200 people. We often have discussions about the Navy way
of doing things.

 Communications Management                                                                 151



      One of the problems in any military organization is the structure of the military
chain of command. The strict chain of command is required because, when fighting a
war, it is critical that legitimate orders be carried out. There is usually no time for discus-
sion, and commanders do not usually have time to explain things to the subordinates
who are to carry out the orders. It is important that each subordinate communicates to
his or her superior officer and not deviate from that order. It would lead to confusion if
an officer would go directly to a subordinate three levels below the officer.
      The problem is that the military are not always engaged in war and fighting. Most
of the time they are engaged in the business of keeping the forces ready to fight. This
part of the military function is more like an everyday business. As we have seen, in a
company having free and open communications is a better way to communicate than
having a strict chain of command. It is not possible to have an organization work two
different ways.
      In the military, the problem is solved by having parties. The U.S. Navy has frequent
cocktail parties. When I attended such parties, I noticed that very few people were drink-
ing. I also observed that very few people were sitting. This was because the party allowed
people to circulate regardless of rank and order in the chain of command. If one person
needed to get information from another, he or she could do it this way without going
through the formality of the chain of command.
      Often in project management there is a need for formal communications. The nor-
mal method of communicating between the project team and the stakeholders should be
open and free, but there are times when formal communications are necessary. When
major milestones in the project are being passed and agreement must be had from all the
stakeholders, formal communications are necessary. When authorized project changes are
made, it is necessary to have formal communications. As the number of persons involved
in a decision is increased, the need for formal communications increases.


                                  Improving Listening
Many times when we listen we do not hear what is being said to us (see Figures 6-3 and
6-4). It is possible to concentrate on what is being said for only a small portion of the
time. There are several things to remember: Don't interrupt, put the speaker at ease,
appear interested, cut out distractions, and periodically sum up what was said.

Don't Interrupt
One of the most disruptive things that can be done while someone is trying to communi-
cate a message is to interrupt the speaker. This stops the speaker's chain of thought and
makes him or her feel that you are not interested in what is being said. The offended
feeling on the part of the sender of the message may be enough to make the person angry

if it is done repeatedly. Eventually, this will reduce the effectiveness of the communica-
tion. There are times when this is used as a tactic. If a meeting is going in a direction
that you do not like, sometimes by repeatedly interrupting you can get the speaker so
upset that the meeting can be postponed, giving you enough time to gather information
to make the meeting go along a proper course.

Put the Speaker at Ease
Many times the speaker in a meeting is nervous and uncomfortable in the speaking role.
To encourage the speaker you can make comments before and during the meeting to




                         ................. 11151$   $CH6   02-09-05 08:07:13   PS                     PAGE 152

make it known that you are looking forward to what he or she has to say and what an
important contribution the speaker will be making to the meeting. During the presenta-
tion, nod your head in agreement and smile at some of the speaker's comments. When
something is said that you agree with, voice your positive comments, if possible. All of
this creates a feeling of confidence and trust in the speaker.
      It is important that project managers have good presentation skills. Project managers
are frequently called upon to make formal and informal presentations to other managers,
clients, stakeholders, and the like. Project managers must be able to convey the informa-
tion in a way that is comprehensible to their audience.

Appear Interested
Creating the impression that you are very interested in what is being said will do a lot to
make the speaker feel at ease with the audience and will also help you retain more of the
information that is being sent by the speaker.

Cut Out Distractions
Listening can be improved greatly by improving the environment where the communica-
tion is taking place. Noisy distracting places severely inhibit communications, while quiet
places with no telephones and a closed door will greatly improve them. Asking all of the
attendees to turn off cellular phones and pagers or at least put them on their vibrating
mode will help to improve the environment.

Periodically Sum Up What Was Said
Listening can be further improved by periodically summarizing what has been said. By
doing this you are essentially repeating what was said, but in a different way. All of the
attendees in the meeting will hear again what was said, and their retention will be higher.
Summarizing also has the side benefit of making the speaker relax.


                                          Networking
Networking is an important concept in communications management. It is important to
understand the relationships between people who are communicating and to realize that
the more people communicate the more complex the communications become.
      Any network is composed of nodes and links between the nodes. Using the network
model can make understanding some aspects of communications much easier. This
method of analysis is also useful in measuring the effectiveness of meetings. A meeting
can be observed, and the communications between individuals can be recorded as simple
lines between them. The more lines of communication there are connecting individuals
at the meeting, the more freely communication is taking place. When there are only a




                          ................. 11151$   $CH6   02-09-05 08:07:13   PS            PAGE 153
154                 Preparing for the Project Management Professional Certification Exam



few lines, it is an indication of the inhibitions of individuals in the meeting. A good
meeting would show lines between each individual in the meeting and every other indi-
vidual in the meeting.

Circular Networks
A circular network shows communications in a circle (Figure 6-5). Communications in
this network require some communications to pass through another communication
node before reaching the intended receiver. As the circle becomes larger, there are more
intervening nodes between the sender and the receiver.

Chain Networks
The chain network is commonly referred to as the chain of command. To move a message
from one end to the other of this network requires that the message pass through all of
the intervening nodes. This is the slowest and most error-prone method of communicat-
ing, since each time the message is transferred, there is a good chance that some of the
information will be lost or changed (see Figure 6-6).

Figure 6-5. Network communications circle.

Figure 6-6. Network communications chain.




      There is a game that is played in communications seminars to illustrate this. A short
article from the local newspaper is given to one person to read. That person is then asked
to leave the room with another person and accurately retell the story (without looking at
the article). The second person tells the story again, in private, to the third person, and
this continues until the fifth person is told the story. When this is completed the fifth
person is asked to tell the story to the rest of the class. The original article is then read to
the class. The two stories will be quite different. The difficulties in communicating using
normal chain of command communications are clear.

The Wheel
The wheel network centralizes communications and gives great power to the individual
at the center (Figure 6-7). The saying goes that ``he who controls the information controls
the world.'' All communications go through the center, and only the center gives infor-
mation to the other nodes in the network.

Free and Open Communications
The network diagram in Figure 6-8 illustrates the free and open communications model.
Each node in the network is able to communicate with every other node in the network.

communications.




This means that information that any member has can be communicated to any other
member of the network.
      This network model does not come without problems. This type of communication
is difficult to control because of all the possible connections. As the number of partici-
pants increases, the number of communication links increases.
      The number of communication links can actually be calculated by the formula:
                                Channels  [N  (N1)] / 2

     For example, if there are five persons on a project team and it is necessary for them
to communicate with each other, how many communications channels are there?
                                Channels  [5  (51)] / 2
                                Channels  20 / 2
                                Channels  10

                     Management by Walking Around
Management by walking around is a concept that actually uses a lot of common sense. It
is particularly effective for managers who are a little self-conscious about talking to peo-
ple. Some of these managers are reluctant to come out of their offices and talk to their
own people. Such reclusive managers don't communicate well.
      It is easier to show how to do management by walking around than to explain
it. The manager practicing the technique of management by walking around makes a
commitment to do this for a half-hour to an hour each day. This may seem like a lot of
time to the manager at first, but the benefits that are derived will save more time than
the time spent doing this.
      The manager leaves his or her office and starts walking around the project team
office space. When a member of the project team is approached, the manager says some-
thing like, ``How was your golf game this week?'' (Of course, the prudent manager would
know that the person actually plays golf.) The manager opens up the conversation with
a casual statement, and the team member begins to talk about his or her latest escapade
on the golf links. Human nature demands that the team member change the conversation
in a short time. Because the team member will not want to excessively talk about his golf
game to the project manager, he soon will switch to discussing the project. When this
happens all of the anxiety that is often present disappears, and free and honest communi-
cation takes place.
      If the manager had taken a different approach to this conversation, the results might
have been different. If the project manager had come to this team member and said,
``Hey John, how are things going on your part of the project?'' John would have first
asked himself things like, ``Why is the boss asking me this?'' ``Something is wrong and I
don't even know about it.'' ``The boss wants to give me another assignment and is trying
to see how busy I am.'' ``My review is due, what can I say?'' All these things go through
a person's mind when he or she is put on the spot. This results in anxiety. The team
member gives a minimal response to the manager, and poor communication is the result.



                               Performance Reviews
One of the problems with matrix management is ensuring that all employees and mem-
bers of the project team have good and fair performance reviews.
     In the early days of matrix management, one of the major difficulties was perfor-
mance reviews. Typically, a person would come to work on a project, work there for a
period of time, and then move back to his or her functional department or move to
another project. The project manager concentrated on the project and the customer and
did not take the time for performance appraisals. When the employee was assigned to the




                           ................. 11151$   $CH6   02-09-05 08:07:15   PS            PAGE 157
158                  Preparing for the Project Management Professional Certification Exam



functional department, he or she experienced less stress and less urgency than when
working on projects. The employee relaxed more and took vacations and sick days when
working in his or her functional area. At the end of the employee's review period, the
functional manager had little to base an appraisal on except the times when the employee
was working in the functional area. As a result the employee was given a satisfactory
appraisal when perhaps his or her project work had been outstanding.
     A simple communications device may be used to eliminate this problem. The proj-
ect manager meets with the person when he or she first joins the project. At this first
meeting the project manager starts a plain sheet of paper and makes comments about the
suggested assignments for the person. At the end of the meeting the project manager
makes a copy of the notes to give to the individual and files the original. In two weeks
another meeting is held to review the progress that has been made since the last meeting.
Again, notes are made and copied and given to the individual. As time goes on, these
notes accumulate and make up a written history of the work the person has done on the
project, his or her successes and failures. When the employee leaves the project, the
project manager makes another copy of these notes and sends them to the person's func-
tional manager. In this way the functional manager has a good set of notes on the per-
formance of the individual.


                                              Summary
When project management is discussed by project managers it is not very long before the
topic of communications comes up. Communications management is the process that
allows for the timely and appropriate generation and dissemination of information.
      The communications model consists of a sender and a receiver. The sender thinks
of what must be communicated, encodes the communication, and transmits it to the
receiver. The receiver perceives the message, decodes it, and understands the meaning of
the message. If there is insufficient meaning in the message, the receiver can communicate
feedback to the sender.
      There are many barriers to communications. These serve to inhibit the communica-
tion from occurring in an optimal way. The barriers can be overcome by using good
communications techniques.
      There are many types of communications and many channels through which com-
munications flow. Verbal and nonverbal communications are appropriate at some times
and not others. It is important that the proper type of communication be used. A method
for communicating that may work well in one situation may not work well in another.
      Formal and informal communications are important in project management. Many
times the project manager is required to make formal presentations to customers and
stakeholders in the project. Good presentation skills are necessary in a good project man-
ager.

      The other half of communication is listening. A good project manager must also
have good listening skills. These can be improved by following good listening habits.
      Network techniques and management by walking around allow for the collection of
good information.
      One of the problems that occurred in project management when matrix manage-
ment was first tried was performance reviews being mishandled by project managers.
Performance reviews of everyone on the project team are extremely important and neces-
sary. These reviews can be as simple as both the manager and the subordinate periodically
adding their comments to a sheet of paper and making copies for one another.

                                                           Risk Management



R
        isk management is one of the most important areas of project management that
        must be considered. Companies that want to compete with one another have
        adopted project management as a method of managing their companies. They
have had to learn how to define and control project scope, schedule, and cost as baselines,
and they have had to learn all of the control elements necessary to make successful
projects. But many of these companies have yet to learn to manage the risks involved in
managing a project.
      A risk is an uncertain event that has a positive or negative effect on at least one
project objective. All risks have causes. For example the cause of a risk may be that it is
necessary to design the wheel of a bicycle in a bicycle design and manufacturing project.
The risk may be that the design of the bicycle wheel takes longer than the time that was
allowed for it. All risks have uncertainty associated with them and all risks have an impact
associated with them. The impacts can affect the project baselines of cost, schedule, and
scope. The risk may also affect activities in multiple areas of the project as well as activities
outside of the project.
      Risks are justified by the benefits that come as a result of taking them. For example,
investors or stockholders in companies take the risk that the company will not be profit-
able and they could lose their investment. On the other hand they could make a profit
and share in the success of the venture. Unless the investors feel that the potential benefits
justify the investment expenditure they will simply put their money into another venture.
The least-risk investment and the one also with the least benefits is investing in United
States Treasury Bills. In project risk there are many things that can go wrong in the course
of the project. The potential benefits should justify the risks that are taken.
      Recall that one of the principles involved in good project management is establishing


                                                     160

 Risk Management                                                                          161



three baselines. The cost, schedule, and scope baselines are essential to managing a proj-
ect. These three constraints on a project serve to define the project and give us the goals
that are to be obtained. The cost baseline of the project must represent all of the cost that
will be incurred in the project. The scope baseline must represent all of the work that has
to be done in the project. The schedule baseline must represent all of the time that it is
going to take to do the project.
      When I discussed scope, I emphasized the importance of discovering and document-
ing all of the work that has to be done in the project. The scope of the project must also
include the work that must be done to handle the work that was not expected to be
necessary. When this work is included in the project plan, it affects the scope and sched-
ule baselines as well.
      All of this work has some probability of occurring. In other words, work that has a
probability of greater than zero but less than 100 percent of occurring is considered to be
a risk. Risks can have a positive or negative effect. They can produce benefits for the
project, or they can produce loss for the project. The Guide to the Project Management
Body of Knowledge (PMBOK) defines a risk event as ``a discrete occurrence that may affect
the project for better or worse.''
      Risks can be divided into known and unknown risks. Known risks are those risks
that can be identified. Unknown risks are those that cannot be identified. Even though
unknown risks are not identified, we can recognize the effect of these unknown risks and
we can plan for them. This planning can be accomplished by looking at expert opinion
and observations of similar projects, evaluating the risks that occurred there, and adjust-
ing schedules and budgets accordingly.



                       When to Do Risk Management
Risk management must be done during the whole life of the project. In the beginning of
the conceptual stage of the project, risks are identified almost without effort as the differ-
ent aspects of the project are discussed. It is important that when these risks are thought
of that they be recorded in a risk management file or folder so that they can be dealt with
later in the project.
      As time goes by and progress is made on the project, the risks need to be reviewed,
and the identification process must be repeated for the discovery of new risks. This must
be an ongoing, continuous process. Risks that are identified early in the project may
change as time goes by. As the project advances, some risks disappear. Other risks that
were not thought of earlier will be discovered. As the possibility of each risk approaches,
it needs to be reevaluated to ensure that the assessment of the risk made earlier is still
valid.

                                        The Risk Process
PMI uses the systems approach to risk management in the Guide to the PMBOK. The
risk process is divided into six major processes:

      1.   Risk management planning
      2.   Risk identification
      3.   Risk assessment
      4.   Risk quantification

The planning approach for risk management contains the elements that are necessary to
properly prepare and set the ground rules that will allow us to manage the risk of the
project. There are several inputs to the risk planning process. The overall project plan is
a major input since it defines the stakeholders, size, complexity, and objectives of the
project. It also defines the roles and responsibilities of the project team members, decision
makers, customers, suppliers, and all of the others who may be involved in the project.
      We also need to have an overall company strategy for managing risk. A company
that is involved in products that put people's lives in danger will be much more concerned
about dealing with these kinds of risk than a company where the risks involve small
financial losses.
      Templates may be used to assist in making up the risk management plan. This
allows much time to be saved by using the already developed content of the plan. Many
projects are similar in nature, and you will be able to borrow heavily from already com-
pleted or planned project risk management plans.

Risk Breakdown Structure
Much like the work breakdown structure that is the basis for so much of good project
management, the Risk Breakdown Structure (RBS) can be considered in much the same
way. Starting at the highest level we have the project risks. From there we have a hierar-
chical structure organized by risk causes. As we move down this structure the description
of the risk causes and the risks themselves becomes more and more detailed. For example,
a project's risks might first be divided into technical risks, business risks, project manage-
ment risks, customer risks, and environmental risks. The RBS should continue until all
of the detailed risks have been detailed enough that they can be acted on and have one
and only one person responsible for them.

                                   Risk Identification
The identification of risks is very important. Each must be described in detail so that it
will not be confused with any other risk or project task that must be done. Each risk
should be given an identification number. During the course of the project, as more
information is gathered about the risk, all of this information can be consolidated about
the particular risk.
      The first component we need to discuss is the identification of the risk event. In the
course of identifying risk events we will call upon the project team, subject matter experts,
the stakeholders, and other project managers. Much of the work already done in the
project will be utilized in the risk management process. Among these items that will be
used are the project charter, the work breakdown structure, project description, project
schedule, cost estimates, budgets, resource availability, resource schedules, procurement
information, and assumptions that have been made and recorded.
      There are many ways to discover and identify risks. I will discuss several of them
here:

     *   Documentation reviews
     *   Brainstorming
     *   Delphi technique
     *   Nominal group technique
     *   Crawford slip
     *   Expert interviews
     *   Root cause identification
     *   Strengths, Weaknesses, Opportunities, and Threats (SWOT) analysis
     *   Checklists
     *   Analogy

Documentation Reviews
Documentation reviews comprise reviewing all of the project materials that have been
generated up to the date of this risk review. This includes reviewing lessons learned and
risk management plans from previous projects; contract obligations; project baselines for
scope, schedule, and budget; resource availabilities; staffing plans; suppliers; and assump-
tions lists.

Brainstorming
Brainstorming is probably the most popular technique for identifying risks. It is useful in
generating any kind of list by mining the ideas of the participants. To use the technique,
a meeting is called to make a comprehensive list of risks. It is important that the purpose
of the meeting be explained clearly to the participants, and it is helpful if they are pre-




                           ................. 11151$   $CH7   02-09-05 08:07:23   PS             PAGE 163

pared when they arrive at the meeting. The meeting should have between ten and fifteen
participants. If there are fewer than ten, there is not enough interaction among the parti-
cipants. If there are more than fifteen people, the meeting tends to be difficult to control
and keep focused. The meeting should take less than two hours.
      For larger projects it may be necessary to hold several meetings. Each meeting should
deal with a separate part of the project and with the risks associated with that project
part. This will keep the number of persons involved to a reasonable size, and the meetings
will be much more productive.
      When the meeting begins, the participants can name risks that they think are impor-
tant for consideration in the project. No discussion of the items listed is allowed at this
time. As participants see ideas listed, they will think of additional ideas. Each new idea
will elicit another idea from someone, and many ideas for possible risks will be listed.

Delphi Technique
The Delphi technique is similar to brainstorming, but the participants do not know one
another. This technique is useful when the participants are some distance away. The
Delphi technique is much more efficient and useful today than it has been in the past
because of the use of e-mail as a medium for conducting the exercise. Because the partici-
pants in this technique are anonymous, there is little to inhibit the flow of ideas. Where
the participants are not anonymous, there is a tendency for one or more persons to
dominate the meeting. If one of the participants is a higher-level manager than the others
in the meeting, many of the meeting participants will be inhibited or try to show off in
front of the upper-level manager. All of this is avoided in the Delphi technique.
      The process begins with the facilitator using a questionnaire to solicit risk ideas
about the project. The responses by the participants are then categorized and clarified by
the facilitator. The categorized, clarified list is then circulated to the participants for
comments or additions. The members of the group may modify their position, but they
must give reasons for doing so. Consensus and a detailed list of the project risks can be
obtained in a few rounds.
      The Delphi technique avoids one of the major drawbacks to brainstorming. Because
the participants are not known to one another, it avoids peer pressure and the risk of
embarrassment from putting forth a silly idea or one that could be ridiculed by others.
This does not come without cost. The facilitator must do much more work for the
Delphi technique than the facilitator in a brainstorming session. For example, the facilita-
tor frequently has to nag the participants, who may procrastinate in returning their re-
sponses.
      There is also some risk involved in using this technique. The facilitator is required
to analyze and categorize the inputs from the participants, which means that he impresses
much of his opinion on the group.

 Risk Management                                                                           165



Nominal Group Technique
In the nominal group technique, the idea is to eliminate some of the problems with other
techniques, particularly the problems associated with persons' inhibitions and reluctance
to participate. In this technique a group size of seven to ten persons is used. The facilitator
instructs the participants to privately and silently each list their ideas on a piece of paper.
When this is completed, the facilitator takes each piece of paper and lists the ideas on a
flip chart or blackboard. At this time no discussion takes place.
      Once all of the ideas are listed on the flip chart, the group discusses each idea.
During the discussion, clarifications or explanations are made. Each member of the group
now ranks the ideas in order of importance, again in secret. The result is an ordered list
of the risks in order of their importance. This process not only identifies risks but also
does a preliminary evaluation of them.
      This process reduces the effect of a high-ranking person in the group but does not
eliminate it, like the Delphi technique. The nominal group technique is faster and re-
quires less effort on the part of the facilitator than the Delphi technique.

Crawford Slip
The Crawford slip process has become popular recently. The Crawford slip process does
not require as strong a facilitator as the other techniques, and it produces a lot of ideas
very quickly. A Crawford slip meeting can take place in less than half an hour.
      The usual number of seven to ten participants is used, but larger groups can be
accommodated, since there is a fairly small amount of interaction among the persons in
the group. The facilitator begins by instructing the group that she will ask ten questions,
one at a time. Each participant must answer each question with a different answer. The
same answer cannot be used for more than one question. The participants are to write
their answer to each question on a separate piece of paper. (Post-it Notes are good for
this purpose.) The facilitator tells the participants that they will have one minute to
answer each question.
      When all the participants are ready, the facilitator begins by asking a question such
as, ``What is the most important risk to this project?'' The participants write down their
answers. After one minute, the facilitator repeats the question. This is repeated ten times.
The effect is that the participants are forced to think of ten separate risks in the project.
Even with duplicates among the members, the number of risks identified is formidable.

Expert Interviews
Experts or people with experience in this type of project or problem can be of great help
in avoiding solving the same problems over and over again. Caution must be exercised
whenever using expert opinions. If an expert is trusted implicitly and his or her advice is
taken without question, the project can head off in the wrong direction under the influ-
ence of one so-called expert.




                            ................. 11151$   $CH7   02-09-05 08:07:23   PS              PAGE 165
166                  Preparing for the Project Management Professional Certification Exam



      The use of experts, particularly those hired from outside the project organization,
can be costly. Care must be taken to ensure that experts are used efficiently and effec-
tively. Before the expert interview is conducted, the input information must be given to
the expert and the goals of the interview must be clearly understood. During the inter-
view, the information from the expert must be recorded. If more than one expert is used,
the output information from the interviews should be consolidated and circulated to the
other experts.

Root Cause Identification
Root cause identification is a process developed by RCA. It helps to identify the what,
how, and particularly the why of something going wrong. It seeks to find the underlying
causes that can be identified and controlled. The RCA process is aimed at identifying the
underlying cause for a problem. Frequently people tend to fix the symptoms of a problem
because they are more apparent. By fixing the root cause of a problem we can avoid the
same problem in the future.
     These root causes are something we can do something about. For example, assume
that a risk that parts will be delivered late becomes a risk event that actually happens. As
we investigate why this happened we find that there was a severe snowstorm at the
vendor's location and that trucks could not move for three days. The root cause of the
problem is not the severe weather. It is not ordering the parts early enough to allow for
severe weather delays.

Strengths, Weaknesses, Opportunities, and Threats (SWOT) Analysis
SWOT analysis takes into consideration the external and internal environment of an
organization. Strengths and weaknesses are usually considered internal environmental
factors while opportunities and threats are usually considered external.
     As can be seen in Figure 7-1, a matrix can be made showing the possible combina-
tions of the internal and external factors. The S-O strategies are the ones that should be
pursued because there is a good fit between the external opportunities and the internal
strengths of the company. With W-O strategies, we must overcome our internal weak-
nesses before we can pursue the opportunity. S-T strategies are strategies where we must
use our strengths to overcome the threats to us. W-T strategies are strategies where we
must find a defensive position to prevent the threats from taking advantage of our weak-
nesses.

Checklists
Checklists have gained in popularity in recent years because of the ease of communicating
through computers and the ease of sharing information through databases. There are
many commercially available databases, and there are many checklists that are generated
locally for specific companies and applications.

     In their basic form, these checklists are simply predetermined lists of risks that are
possible for given projects. In their specific form, they are risks that have occurred in the
particular types of projects that a company has worked on in the past. Frequently, certain
customers and stakeholders have particular risks associated with them that can forewarn
the manager of the new project.

Analogy
The analogous method of identifying risks is quite simple. From the lessons learned and
the risk management plan of other projects that were similar, an analogy can be formed.
By comparing two or more projects, characteristics that are similar for each project can
be seen that will give insight into the risks of the new project.

Diagramming Techniques
Various types of diagramming techniques have been developed that will help in the iden-
tification of risks. Cause-and-effect diagrams are used to organize information and show
how various items relate to one another. There are several possible risks that contribute
to the main risk in question. Each of the contributing risks can be further diagrammed
until there is a complete hierarchy of risks. Once diagrammed, the relationships between
the risks can easily be seen.
      Flowcharts are diagrams that show the sequence of events that take place in a given
process. They also show conditional branching. Each point on the flow diagram can be
used as a possible point for identifying risks. A comparison of risk identification tech-
niques is shown in Table 7-1.
      For other diagramming techniques, see Chapter 4, Quality Management.

Recording of Risks Identified
Once the risks have been identified, they must be recorded. There is nothing worse
than identifying a risk and then not thinking about it again until it happens. Since risk
management must take place many times during the course of the project, there needs to
be a way of organizing and documenting the risks. In the beginning of the project the
risks may only be identified. Later in the project, additional information will be continu-
ously added to the risk events that were identified.
      This does not need to be a complicated documentation method, but there are cer-
tain pieces of information that must be recorded:

     1.   Name of the risk
     2.   Description of the risk
     3.   Date the risk was entered
     4.   Person responsible for managing the risk
     5.   Reference to the work breakdown structure
     6.   Probability that the risk will occur
     7.   Impact of the risk if it occurs
     8.   Severity of the risk
     9.   Mitigation strategies



                                      Risk Assessment
Risk assessment is the stage in our risk management process where the importance of
each risk is evaluated. This evaluation will also serve as the guideline for determining the
risk strategy. Here we use the list of identified risks that were made as inputs. The list of
risks will constantly change as well, since the time of the risk and the progress toward
completion of the project will affect the risks that will be on the list of identified risks.
      It is critical that the risks be evaluated, since, because of risk tolerance of the stake-
holders, some risks will be ignored while others will have rather elaborate monitoring and




                            ................. 11151$   $CH7   02-09-05 08:07:25   PS                          PAGE 169

mitigation plans associated with them. The evaluation or assessment process is necessary
to itemize these risks into a ranking that will place them in the order of importance.
      In the evaluation process we will be concerned with determining the impact and
probability of the risk. From these two factors we can determine the severity of the risk.
The severity of the risk will allow its ranking in order of importance.
Qualitative Risk Analysis
Qualitative analysis is a fast, inexpensive way to organize risks according to their impor-
tance. Since it is fast and inexpensive it also means that not a lot of detailed information
is collected about the risk. This can lead to errors that may rank some risks higher or
lower than they deserve to be. As we have said earlier, we must perform risk analysis
many times during the course of the project. Risks that are identified long before they
can happen need not have a rigorous quantitative analysis since they may never actually
happen. Circumstances can often change to make risks that were menacing become trivial
or nonexistent.
      In analyzing a risk, its probability and impact can be determined in its simplest
form by stating its probability as ``likely'' or ``not likely,'' ``bad impact'' or ``not so bad.''
We can easily raise the level of discrimination by evaluating the probability and impact
of risk as ``high,'' ``medium,'' or ``low.'' This raises the choices of category for a risk from
two to three. We could also assess probability by assigning a number from 1 to 10, where
1 is least probable and has least impact, and 10 is very probable and has high impact. As
our probability or impact discriminator becomes better, the cost and difficulty of assign-
ing numbers becomes higher. Finally, the most discriminating analysis would be the use
of specific probability estimates between zero and one, with accuracy to as many decimal
places as can be estimated. Impacts can then be evaluated in terms of dollars.
      Many versions of the probability and impact matrix have been done. As can be seen
in Figure 7-2, the matrix is formed by assigning a value from 1 to 9 for our assessment
of the risk's probability and another value from 1-9 for the risk's impact. By multiplying
the values together we get a composite number called severity. The matrix gives a value
for severity that can be used to value the importance or severity of the risk. Values of 28
to 81 should be considered high risks. Values from 1 to 9 should be considered low risks,
and values from 10 to 27 should be considered medium risks. Expanding the concept to
the point of being ridiculous, we could have these matrixes done for each risk and for
each type of problem that could develop. Thus we might have separate matrices for cost,
schedule, and scope impact, and so on.
      Risks can additionally be categorized by their immediacy. Risks that are imminent
should have a higher priority than those that are going to happen far in the future. Many
of the risks anticipated far in the future may not take place at all.
Risk Tolerance
Risks that have very high probabilities but very low impacts, as well as risks that have
very high impacts but very low probabilities, are risks that may not be considered as being

important to the project. It is the combination of probability and impact that causes the
risk to be an important consideration to the project.
      Consider a risk of very high impact and very low probability, such as the threat to a
project caused by a category five hurricane occurring when and where the project work is
taking place. This is probably a risk that we would not spend much time and effort
worrying about. Although the problems that would occur if the office building were to
be blown down or flooded during a hurricane would be great, their likelihood is low
enough that we would not worry too much about the risk. Even in New Orleans, where
hurricanes are more likely to occur than many other places, they have disrupted business
only three times in twenty years, and even then damage was minor.
      Let's look at the other extreme of risk: a risk that has a very high probability of
occurring but a very low impact. An example of this kind of risk is one person on the
project team calling in sick during the project. The probability that this will happen at
least one time in the course of the project is close to 100 percent, but the impact is very
small. This is a risk that we are not going to spend much time worrying about.
      The risks we need to worry about are all the ones that have a reasonably high
probability and a reasonably high impact. But what is reasonably high? As in many of the
questions that are raised in project management, the answer is: It depends. In this case it
depends on risk tolerance.
      Risk tolerance is the willingness or the unwillingness of a person or an organization




                            ................. 11151$   $CH7   02-09-05 08:07:27   PS                PAGE 171

to accept risk. Some individuals and some organizations are risk takers, while others are
risk avoiders. One company might be willing to take a large risk of losing a great deal of
money on the chance that an even greater amount of money could be made. Another
company might not be willing to take the risk of losing the money.
       I do this experiment in most of the classes I teach in risk management. I ask all of
the students to stand up. I then offer to make a bet with them. I have a single die that I
will roll. If the rolled die comes up with a 1 or a 2, I win; if it comes up 3, 4, 5, or 6,
then the student wins. The probability of winning is 2 chances in 3, and the probability
of losing is 1 chance in 3.
       I ask the students, ``How many of you would be willing to bet 25 cents on this roll
of the dice?'' Nearly everyone stays standing. Then I ask, ``How many of you would be
willing to bet $2 on this roll of the dice?'' A few sit down.
       Next I ask, ``How many of you would be willing to bet $20 on this roll of the dice?''
More sit down. The next question is, ``How many of you would be willing to bet $200
on this roll of the dice?'' Many sit down.
       The bet is raised until all sit down. There is usually one in the class who just keeps
standing until the bet gets so high that having to pay it off would be impossible.
       The people who sit down in the early stages are the risk avoiders. The people who
sit down last are the risk takers. Even though the probability of winning is 2 out of 3, as
the size of the bet increases people refuse to take the bet. This is because there is still
some chance of losing, and the damage to their financial security is too great to be
tolerated. It is one thing to bet your lunch money and have to skip lunch if you lose, but
it is quite another to bet your house and car and have to do without them if you lose.
       Companies work like individuals in this area of risk tolerance. Companies like Gen-
eral Motors have a relatively low tolerance for accepting risk. Their reluctance to accept
risk was nearly their undoing in the 1970s when they were forced to compete with
Japanese automakers. Other companies are willing to take large risks and even put the
entire company at great risk. Amazon.com is an example of a company that is willing to
risk a great deal to make a lot of money. At this writing Amazon.com, a billion-dollar (in
sales) corporation, has only recently made its first profit in its entire history. Still, inves-
tors think that even though the risks are high, there is a good chance to make a lot of
money on this company.
       As we move into more detail in determining the components of risks to our project,
it is important to realize that the techniques discussed can be used to determine all of the
components of risk. When I discuss an item like expert interviews or Crawford slip, it is
important to realize that these techniques could be used to help determine the probability
and the impact of the risk as well as to identify the risk.

Risk Probability
Since all risks have a probability of greater than zero and less than 100 percent, the
probability of a risk occurring is essential to the assessment of the risk. Any risk event




                         ................. 11151$   $CH7   02-09-05 08:07:27   PS                  PAGE 172

that has a probability of zero cannot occur and need not be considered as a risk. A risk
event that has a probability of 100 percent is not a risk. It has a certainty of occurring and
must be planned for in the project plan. Understanding the fundamentals of probability is
necessary if we are to understand the role of probability in risk analysis.
      Probability is the number that represents the chance that a particular outcome will
occur when the conditions allow it. The probability of one possibility occurring is 1
divided by the number of other possible outcomes. In the rolling of die (half a pair of
dice), there is 1 chance out of 6 that the result will be a 1. The possibilities are 1, 2, 3, 4,
5, or 6. The probability would be expressed as 1/6 or .167 or even 16.7 percent. All of
these terms are commonly used in expressing probability. The outcome of an event is the
result of any event taking place. Outcomes cannot be subdivided into smaller outcomes:
1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6 represent all of the possible outcomes of rolling our die. The term
event means the set of all the possible outcomes that could occur.
      These events of rolling the die are considered to be mutually exclusive. A mutually
exclusive event is one where the occurrence of one of the possibilities eliminates the
possibility of the others. In our rolling of the die, all of the possibilities are mutually
exclusive, since the rolling of a 5 makes it impossible for a 1, 2, 3, 4, or 6 to occur.
      In risk management we frequently have mutually exclusive risks. A risk will occur
or it will not occur. If it occurs then it cannot not occur. The sum of the probabilities of
all the things that can occur in a given set of circumstances will equal 1.0. This is the
sum of all the probabilities of all the possible outcomes. In our rolling of the die, all the
probabilities that exist are that the die will come up with a 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, or 6. Each of
these has a probability of 1/6. The sum of all the probabilities is: 1/6  1/6  1/6 
1/6  1/6  1/6  6/6  1. In decimals, this is: .167  .167  .167  .167 
.167  .167  1.
      In the rolling of a die or in situations where there are only specific outcomes possi-
ble, it is assumed that the die is a fair die, that all of the sides weigh the same, and that
the corners and anything else affecting the roll of the die are equal. If we had a real die,
however, there would be some bias in the die. After rolling the die many times it might
be seen that one number comes up more frequently than another. This would be an
indication of bias in the die.
      The relative frequency definition of probability says that the proportion of past
circumstances in which this outcome has occurred determines the probability of a partic-
ular outcome. This is the type of evaluation that we use most of the time in business
decisions. A business is much better off relying on past experience and observations than
assuming that there is no bias in the relevant circumstances. When the relative frequency
definition of probability can be used, it is extremely valuable. There are two major diffi-
culties associated with this measure, however.
      Let's take the example of a business that operates a theater. The business owner
must determine whether it would be better to offer a comedy or a high drama. The risk




                            ................. 11151$   $CH7   02-09-05 08:07:28   PS               PAGE 173
174                   Preparing for the Project Management Professional Certification Exam



is that if the owner chooses the wrong type of entertainment, the public will not come to
the theater.
      Based on past experience, the theater operator determines that when a comedy was
offered, money was made 80 percent of the time. When a drama was offered, money was
made 60 percent of the time. Based on this past experience, the theater owner should
offer nothing but comedy. But this would be a mistake, because the audience changes
with each situation. In this situation, the audience would become bored with the constant
offering of comedies, and the theater operator would probably lose more money than if
dramas were also presented.
      The other difficulty in risk management decisions using the relative frequency defi-
nition of probability is that there is usually not enough experience in the past to reliably
predict the future. For this reason, subjective probability is used. Subjective probability is
the best estimate that can be made to predict the future outcome based on the conditions
that can be known.
      As in all mathematical areas there are rules that must be followed if we are going to
achieve consistent results. We will need to worry about only a few of these rules.

      The Addition Rule
      The addition rule in probability explains the probability of one or more of several
events occurring. I will start by showing the probability of two events. We can consider
the probability of either event A or event B occurring when they are both mutually
exclusive events.
      Suppose we roll one die again. This time we are interested in two events. Event A is
that the die will come up with an odd number. Event B is that the die will come up with
an even number. Event A is satisfied if there is a 1, 3, or 5. Event B is satisfied if there is
a 2, 4, or 6.
      The probability we are interested in is the probability that either event A or event B
will occur. This means that if the die comes up with a 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, or 6 we will meet the
conditions of the question. The probability of this is 1.0, since there are only six possibili-
ties, and all six are contained in event A or B. Also notice that the probability of event A
is .5 (three out of six possibilities) and the probability of event B is .5 as well.
      So, for mutually exclusive events we can say that the probability of either of them
occurring is the sum of the probabilities of each:
                                       P(A or B)  P(A)  P(B)
      With the same explanation we could extend this to more than two mutually exclu-
sive events. In this example, event A would be to roll a 1 or 2. Event B would be a 3 or
4. Event C would be a 5 or 6. The probability of A or B or C would be the sum of the
probability of A, B, and C:




                         ................. 11151$   $CH7   02-09-05 08:07:28   PS                 PAGE 174
 Risk Management                                                                          175



                          P(A or B or C)  P(A)  P(B)  P(C)

     In fact, we can say that this is true for any number of mutually exclusive events:

                   P(A or B or . . . or N)  P(A)  P(B)  . . .  P(N)

      Well, all this is fine for probabilities that are mutually exclusive, but what about the
situations where the events we are interested in are not mutually exclusive? When the
events are not mutually exclusive, applying the addition rule as stated will produce a
probability that is too high.
      Suppose we are interested in two events with our die again. Event A is the rolling of
an odd number, that is, 1, 3, or 5. Event B is the rolling of a number less than 4, that is,
1, 2, or 3.
      The probability of event A is 3/6. The probability of event B is 3/6. If we apply the
mutually exclusive addition rule the result would be: 3/6  3/6  6/6  1. Since
rolling 4 or 6 are possibilities, the probability of getting an odd number or a number less
than 4 cannot be 1.
      The problem here is that the two events described are not mutually exclusive. It is
possible to have numbers show on the die that satisfy both events at the same time. The
numbers 1 and 3 showing on the die are odd and less than 4. When we look at the
probability of event A, 1, 3, or 5, and event B, 1, 2, or 3, and apply the addition rule, we
get 1, 3, 5, 1, 2, or 3. We can roll only one number in one roll of the die and the numbers
that will satisfy either event A or event B are 1, 2, 3, or 5. We should not count the extra
1 and 3. The probability of event A or B is 4/6, or 2/3.
      Now the addition rule can include events that are not mutually exclusive:

                          P(A or B)  P(A)  P(B)  P(A and B)

      One more example. Suppose we roll a pair of dice, and we want to know the
probability of getting at least one 6.
      By the addition rule we might say that the probability of getting a 6 on the first roll
is 1/6, and the probability of getting a 6 on the second roll is 1/6. The probability of
getting a 6 on the first roll or the second roll is 1/6  1/6  2/6. But this would be
incorrect.
      In Table 7-2, all of the possible combinations of rolling two dice are shown. If we
count the boxes that contain at least one 6 and divide by the number of possible combina-
tions, we should have the probability that we seek.
      Doing this we find that there are thirty-six possible outcomes for rolling a pair of
dice. In the table, eleven of the combinations would produce at least one 6.
      Correctly applying the addition rule, we get the following:

176                   Preparing for the Project Management Professional Certification Exam



                P(at least one 6 in two rolls)  P(6 on the first roll)
                                                P(6 on the second roll)
                                                P(6 on both rolls)
                                     P(6 or 6)  1/6  1/6  1/36
                                             P  11/36

      The Multiplication Rule
      So far we have not explained the term P(A and B) completely. Before we explain this
rule of probability, a few definitions are in order: conditional probability and statistical
independence.
      Conditional probability is the probability of an event given the information that
some other event has occurred. Suppose we are interested in the probability of rolling a
single die and getting a number less than 4. The probability is 1/2.
      Now suppose that I knew that the die had an odd number on it. Does this change
the probability of having a number less than 4? There are two numbers that are less than
4 and odd--1 and 3--and there are three numbers that are odd: 1, 3, and 5. If we know
that the number facing up on the die is odd, we can say that the probability of it being
less than 4 is 2/3, not 1/2. The condition of ``being odd'' has changed the probability.
This is conditional probability. The notation that is used, P(A  B), is read, ``The proba-
bility of event A given event B.''
      In our example, event A was a number less than 4, and event B was an odd number.
Our statement was the probability of having a number less than 4 given that the number
is an odd number.
      Statistical independence says that the probability of event A is the same as the
probability of event A given the probability of event B. If P(A)  P(A  B), then event A
and event B are statistically independent.
      The probability of rolling a 6 on the third roll of a die is 1/6. If a 6 had been rolled
on the second or even the first and second roll of the die, the probability of getting a 6
on the third roll is still 1/6. These events, rolling a die on the first roll, rolling a die on
the second roll, and rolling a die on the third roll are statistically independent.

      6,1            6,2                    6,3                6,4                  6,5   6,6

 Risk Management                                                                           177



     Statistically dependent events are events where the probability of A given B is not
the same as the probability of A alone. The probability of getting a number less than 4
given that the number is odd is different from the probability of getting a number less
than 4. In this case it is 2/3 versus 1/2. Therefore, these events are statistically dependent.
     Finally, getting back to the multiplication rule:
                                    P(A and B)  P(A  B) P(B)

      The probability of getting event A and event B is the probability of event A given
event B multiplied by the probability of event B.
      In the example of the two dice being rolled and finding the probability of getting at
least one 6, we had to subtract the probability of getting a 6 and a 6 on a roll of two dice.
This value can be calculated by seeing that the P(6 on the second die), 1/6, and the P(6
on the first die given that a 6 was rolled on the second die), 1/6:
                              P(A and B)  P(A  B) P(B)
                              P(A and B)  1/6  1/6  1/36

     Notice that event A and event B are also statistically independent. This means that
we could have stated the equation this way:
                                      P(A and B)  P(A) P(B)

     This simplified form of the multiplication rule for statistically independent events is
useful. Suppose we want to know the probability of rolling a 6 on a die three times in a
row. Since the events are statistically independent, the multiplication rule can be applied:
     P(A and B and C)  P(A) P(B) P(C)
     P(6 on the first roll and 6 on the second roll and 6 on the third roll)
      1/6  1/6  1/6  1/216, or .00463

      For example, suppose we are interested in the risk of not having a critical part
delivered for our project. The vendor that we have chosen has a reliability of delivering
parts on time 95 percent of the time. This is an unacceptable risk for the project, and the
project manager decides that the order will be split between two different vendors. The
project manager hopes that at least one of the vendors will deliver on time.
      The probability that vendor A will be late is .05. The probability that vendor B will
be late is .05. Events A and B are statistically independent, since the delivery of one
vendor on time does not influence the probability of the other vendor delivering on time.
The probability of both vendors being late is:
     P(A being late and B being late)  P(A being late)  P(B being late)
     P(A and B)  .05  .05  .0025, or 1/4 of 1 percent

      To summarize, the assessment of the probability of the risk is important for deter-
mining the overall importance of the risk. The rules of probability are important to know
so that there is an understanding about what these values mean and that we have some
guidance in determining the values to use. Most project risks can be considered mutually
exclusive, but not always. Mutually exclusive risks are those where we consider the proba-
bility event as ``the risk will occur or it will not.'' If the risk occurs, then it cannot not
occur. This meets our definition of mutually exclusive.

Risk Impact
The next subject we need to discuss is the next component in risk management, the
evaluation of the impact of the risk. Risk impact is the cost of the risk if it occurs. This,
in its qualitative measure, is the pain level of the risk. Quantitative measures include the
impact of the identified risk in terms of schedule days, effort person-hours, money, and
so on.
      Risk impacts are those things that affect the cost, schedule, or scope of the project.
These impacts can manifest themselves as effects on the level of effort required, labor
rates, duration of tasks, technical feasibility, material suitability, material cost, equipment
availability, and more.
      In determining the impact of a risk it is important to realize that all of the techniques
that we have previously discussed, such as brainstorming or the use of probability analysis,
can be used to determine the impact of a risk. Likewise, the use of the tools discussed
here is not limited to their use in impact analysis. They may yield valuable information
about risks that have not been previously identified.
      In its simplest terms, impact can be described as ``real bad'' or ``not so bad.'' This
separates risks into those that we think have a great impact and those that we think do
not. We could improve this by addressing impacts as ``high,'' ``medium,'' or ``low.'' We
could further improve this evaluation by giving the risk a numerical value from 1 to 10,
or even 1 to 100.

Expected Value
Expected values are a way of combining the probability and the impact of a risk in a
meaningful way. The expected value calculation is simply multiplying the probability, in
terms of zero to one, times the impact, usually measured in terms of dollars or schedule
days. Impact may be measured in any convenient value.
     Since this is a more quantitative result than the usual subjective values of probability
and impact, it is proper to summarize expected values to total project risk. For example,
consider the possibilities of winning money on a lottery ticket. The ticket you buy can
win $2, with a probability of 5 percent. It could also win $100 with a probability of 1/2
percent. Of course, there is a 94.5 percent chance of winning nothing. The ticket costs
$1.00 to play.

      Notice that the three possible outcomes of the event are mutually exclusive. If you
were to win $2, it would not be possible to win $100 or nothing (Table 7-3).
      With expected values we have a way of evaluating the opportunities and risks in-
volved in the project. The expected value is also a good guideline for the amount of
money that might be spent to eliminate the risk.
      Let's say that there is a 10 percent chance of a risk occurring that would have a
$10,000 impact on the project. The expected value of this risk would be $1,000. If it
would be possible to completely avoid this risk by spending $900, it would be considered
a good decision to avoid this risk.
      Another way of looking at the expected value is to think of the project as being done
many hundreds of times (theoretically, that is). For a risk that has a probability of 10
percent, the risk would probably occur in 10 percent of the projects. The average cost of
the risk to all the hundreds of projects would be 10 percent of the total risk impact.
      It is also interesting to look at the best-case and worst-case situations for the project.
This is a simple analytical method that gives us insight into the extreme possibilities that
might occur in the project. This is useful when considering the risk tolerance of the
individuals or groups involved in the decision-making process.
      In the best-case expected value calculation, all of the positive risks are considered to
have happened, while none of the negative risks are considered. In the worst-case expected
value calculation, all of the negative risks are considered to have occurred, while none of
the good risks are considered.
      For example, suppose after analyzing risks of a potential project we find the situation
shown in Table 7-4. Notice that in the calculation of the worst-case and best-case situa-
tions the probability of the risks is not considered. The best case is where everything good
that can happen happens and everything bad that can happen does not happen. The
worst case is where everything bad that can happen happens and everything good that
can happen does not happen.

Decision Trees
In a more complex situation it is difficult to calculate the expected value of the project.
For these more complex situations a technique called decision tree analysis is often used.
In this case a large number of individual outcomes are possible.
      For example, let's say that you have a large uncut diamond of 6 carats. The diamond
cutter says that if the diamond is cut into small stones, the aggregate value of the stones
will be $250,000. If the diamond is cut into one large stone, the value will be $100,000.
The problem associated with cutting the diamond into smaller stones is that there is a 20
percent chance that the diamond will shatter when cut. If the diamond shatters when it
is cut, the aggregate value will be $10,000.
      In making the decision to cut or not cut the diamond, expected values could be
used. There is a 20 percent chance that the diamond will be worth $10,000, and there is
an 80 percent chance that it will be worth $250,000. The expected value of these two
mutually exclusive possibilities is:
                     .8  $250,000  .2  $10,000  $202,000
      If the diamond is not cut, the expected value is $100,000. The obvious choice is to
have the diamond cut into smaller diamonds. The decision tree diagram for this situation
is shown in Figure 7-3. In the decision tree diagram, boxes are used to represent decisions
that can be made, and circles are used to indicate probabilistic events that may occur.

      Suppose we now complicate the process. For a $5,000 fee, the diamond can be sent
to a firm that can study the structure of the diamond with an electron microscope and
microsound echo scanning to improve the chances of cutting the diamond successfully.
According to the firm proposing the study, if they predict that the diamond will not
shatter, then 99 percent of the time, when the diamond is cut, it will not shatter. If the
prediction is that the diamond will shatter, then the diamond will shatter 95 percent of
the time. Let's say that the diamond itself has a 20 percent chance of shattering, as before.
      The decisions to be made are: Should you pay for the prediction, and should you
have the diamond cut?
      The decision that must be made is whether to pay for the inspection. Regardless of
whether the inspection is performed, a decision must still be made as to whether to have
the diamond cut or not. If the decision is made not to go ahead with the inspection, then
the choices are the same, with the same expected values that we had in the simpler
example. Once the inspection is completed, it will predict 20 percent of the time that the
stone will shatter, and it will predict that 80 percent of the time the stone will not. This
is not smoke and mirrors; of all the diamonds cut in recent times, 20 percent of this type
of diamond have shattered. The question is whether this particular diamond will shatter.
That is the point of the inspection.
      In the upper part of Figure 7-4, the decision has been made to purchase the inspec-
tion. Twenty percent of the time the inspection will predict shattering, and 80 percent of
the time the inspection will predict not shattering. Of course, if the inspection predicts
shattering, there is a 5 percent chance that the diamond will not shatter when cut anyway.
If the inspection predicts that the diamond will not shatter, there is a 1 percent chance
that it is wrong and the diamond will shatter anyway.

      So, what decision should be made?
      In the choice to not cut the stone after the lab predicts that it would shatter, the
expected value of the decision is $95,000. This is because deciding to cut the diamond
under these conditions yields an expected value of $14,600: the $10,000 value of the
shattered stone minus the $5,000 fee to the inspection company, or $250,000 less the
$5,000 fee. Ninety-five percent of $5,000 plus 5 percent of $245,000 equals $17,000.
      The decision not to cut the stone yields $95,000, the $100,000 value of the uncut
stone minus the $5,000 fee for the inspection. The decision is made to not have the stone
cut after the inspection predicted shattering of the stone.
      If the inspecting company predicts that the stone will not shatter, you still must
make the decision whether or not to cut the stone. If the decision is made to not cut the
stone, the yield is $95,000, the $100,000 value of the uncut stone minus the $5,000 fee
for the inspection.
      If the decision is made to cut the stone, the expected value is $242,600. If the stone
is not cut, the value is $95,000. If the stone is cut, there is a 1 percent chance that it will
shatter, yielding $5,000. There is a 99 percent chance that the stone will not shatter,
yielding $245,000. The expected value of cutting the stone is:
                    (.99  $245,000)  (.01  $5,000)  242,600

     The decision to cut the stone yields $242,600.
     Moving to the next branching in Figure 7-4, there is a 20 percent chance that
the inspection will predict shattering and an 80 percent chance that it will predict not
shattering.
     The expected value is:
                 (20%  $95,000)  (80%  $242,600)  $213,080

     The last decision is whether to hire the inspection or not. Since the expected value
of not having the inspection yielded a value of $202,000, and the expected value of the
decision to have the inspection done is $213,080, the inspecting company should be
hired.


                                   Risk Quantification
As part of the quantification process in risk management, we need to find a way to
organize the risks so that they can be dealt with in a logical way. There are two things we
need to consider. The first is that the risks need to be put into groups that can then be
managed by individuals who are more familiar with the nature of these risks. The second
is that the risks need to be put into some priority order. This is because no organization
will ever have the funds or manpower to deal with all the risks. At some point the level




                            ................. 11151$   $CH7   02-09-05 08:07:32   PS              PAGE 183

of impact and probability will be such that even the most conservative of risk takers will
take that risk and accept it.
     If we use probabilities between 0 and 1 to estimate the likelihood of our risks, and
we use a quantitative number to assess impact, then we could multiply the two values
and get the expected value for the risk. If the estimates were done consistently, then we
would have a measure to rank them with the highest expected value at the top of the list
and the rest below it in descending order. This is the same as the expected value analysis
we did previously.
     The most qualitative and simple method of evaluating risks can be used in a similar
way. The most basic evaluation for risk could be to say the risk is ``likely'' and ``bad,''
using only the distinctions of ``likely'' and ``unlikely'' for probability and ``bad'' and ``very
bad'' for impact.
     A step toward quantitative measure might be to evaluate the risks as, ``high,'' ``me-
dium,'' and ``low.'' Going further, the risks could be evaluated on a scale of 1 to 10 or 1
to 100. Any other system or a combination of any of these is also appropriate. There is
nothing wrong in saying that a risk has a high probability of occurring and has an impact
of $40,000.
     The ultimate goal of this risk prioritization scheme is to get the risks into some
hierarchical order. Then the resources of the project can be concentrated on the risks at
the top of the list, and effort is spent first on the ones that are the most important.
Depending on the risk tolerance of the organization and the stakeholders, acceptable risks
may be high or low on the list.

Comparative Ranking
Comparative ranking is one tool that can be used to prioritize risks of the same level of
severity. The layout of the diagram in Figure 7-5 compares each risk to every other risk.
In the first comparison, the diagonal box at the top of the diagram, risk A and risk B are
compared to one another. When the comparison is made, only those two risks are com-
pared. If a group is considering the risk, consensus can be reached for each comparison,
or the individual votes of each member of the group can be recorded.
      After all of the comparisons are made, the total votes for each of the risks are
counted, and the risks are ranked according to the highest vote count. It is important to
limit the discussion to the two risks under consideration and not allow discussion of the
other risks at that time.

Sensitivity Analysis
Sensitivity analysis can be performed on many of the aspects of the project, from engi-
neering to economics. The basic idea of sensitivity analysis is to look at the parameters
that affect the situation that we would like to study. By holding all of the parameters
constant and allowing one parameter to have different values we can determine the overall

effect on the situation. For example, if we were concerned about the profit to be made
from a project we could determine the factors affecting profit. These might be parameters
like delivery delays, changes in interest rates, cost overruns, lack of experienced personnel,
and so on.

Grouping the Risks
Risks will frequently need to be grouped. This will be more important on large projects
than on small ones. The general idea is that if it takes more than ten people to meet and
deal with a group of risks, the meeting is too large and will be inefficient. As projects
become larger it is necessary to have a series of risk management meetings, whereas in a
small project, one meeting might do. To facilitate this, you can use techniques similar to
the techniques that were used in the development of the work breakdown structure. In
fact, the WBS itself can be used to organize meetings for risk management.
      Risks should be assigned to the person who is most closely associated with where
the risk will have its largest impact or to the person who has the most familiarity with
the technology of the risk. A risk that takes place during the completion of a particular




                             ................. 11151$   $CH7       02-09-05 08:07:34   PS                PAGE 185
186                  Preparing for the Project Management Professional Certification Exam



task and directly affects only that task should be a concern to the person responsible for
that task. Of course, no task in a project is truly independent of all the others, so for
more severe risks a person in the organization above the person responsible for the task
may be responsible for the risk.
      Oftentimes, in projects where risk is of great concern, the project manager creates
the position of risk manager. This person is responsible for tracking all risks and main-
taining the risk management plan. As projects become larger or tolerance for risk is low,
this approach becomes more necessary.

Affinity Diagramming
Affinity diagramming is a simple tool that can be used to separate risks into groups that
can then be managed separately by different groups of people on the project team. All
you need for this are pads of sticky-back notes, a room with wall space, and cooperative
people.
      Members of the project team are brought together for a meeting. You begin the
process by writing all of the risks on small pieces of paper. Post-it Notes work well for
this purpose.
      The members of the meeting then take their pieces of paper and post them on the
wall. This is done in strict silence. Each person is allowed to move any of the posted
notes. The notes may be moved as often as anyone wishes. Eventually, the notes will
form into groups. When all the movement has stopped, the process is complete. At that
point, one person in the group or the facilitator must document the results. Sticky-back
notes will not stay on the wall for long.


                              Risk Response Planning
The next task that must be done in our risk management system is risk response planning.
At this stage we have discovered all of the risks known to date and have an iterative
process for discovering new risks as the project progresses. We have evaluated the risks
and assessed their impact and probability of occurrence. We have prioritized the risks in
their order of importance. We now must decide what to do about them. This is risk
response planning.
     Risk response planning is the process of developing the procedures and techniques to
enhance opportunities and reduce threats to the project's objectives. In this process it will
be necessary to assign individuals who will be responsible for each risk and generate a
response that can be used for each risk.

Risk Response Strategies
Risk response strategies are the techniques that will be used to reduce the effect or proba-
bility of the identified or even the unidentified risks.




                        ................. 11151$   $CH7   02-09-05 08:07:34   PS                PAGE 186
 Risk Management                                                                          187



     Of course, in the case of opportunities we should want to increase the probability
and increase the impact. The opportunity can be exploited by adding resources to encour-
age and maximize the effect. Opportunities can be shared. In the case where our own
organization is not able to maximize an opportunity, a partnership or other arrangement
with another organization may be made where both organizations benefit in a greater
way than one of them can. By enhancing an opportunity we can maximize the drivers that
positively impact the risks. Both impact drivers and probability drivers may be enhanced.
     In terms of the risk strategy that should be employed, a qualitative or quantitative
evaluation of the severity of the risk will be a guideline as to how much time, money,
and effort should be spent on the strategy to limit the risk.

Avoidance
Risk avoidance means just what it says. The strategy is to avoid the risk completely. The
project plan or the nature of the project is actually changed to make it impossible for the
risk to occur.
      Some risks, such as the risk of not having a clearly defined set of user requirements,
can be avoided by expending the effort to more clearly define the requirements. This may
increase the time and effort previously allowed for this activity, but it will have the result
of eliminating the risk.
      For example, suppose our project is to design a bicycle. Let's say that during the
design phase someone identified a risk of corrosion in the frame of the bicycle. If this
corrosion were severe enough, it could cause a failure in the bicycle frame. This failure
could cause serious injury to the person riding the bicycle at the time of failure.
      The strategy exercised by the project team on this project is to redesign the compo-
nents that are corrosion problems and use a corrosion resistant material such as stainless
steel. This avoids the problem of corrosion in the bicycle frame identified as risky.
      The avoidance strategy cannot completely eliminate the risk. In this example, even
though the bicycle is redesigned in stainless steel, if the bicycle were left outdoors by the
ocean for nineteen years, it might still corrode enough to fail, but the probability becomes
so small that the risk is, for all practical purposes, eliminated.

Transfer
Transferring a risk also eliminates the risk from impacting the project. When we transfer
a risk, we move the impact of the risk to some other party. When risks are transferred to
another party, there is usually some sort of payment involved to induce the third party
to take on the risk.
      Insurance is a method for transferring risk. In terms of risk management, what we
are doing is hiring some third party to take over the impact of the risk. In return for this
we pay a premium. For example, in 1995, PMI held its annual meeting in the city of
New Orleans. Six months prior to this meeting, the PMI Board of Directors held their




                           ................. 11151$   $CH7   02-09-05 08:07:34   PS              PAGE 187
188                   Preparing for the Project Management Professional Certification Exam



quarterly board meeting in New Orleans. The chapter hosted the board for a chapter
meeting, and for the program they invited a panel of disaster and emergency management
people to discuss hurricane effects on the city.
      The discussion at the meeting concerned itself with the possible results of a hurri-
cane hitting New Orleans. The PMI board became somewhat nervous about their meet-
ing, since it would be held in prime hurricane season. PMI recognized that the revenue
from their annual meeting was a significant part of their operating budget, and they could
not afford to take this loss.
      The result of this nervousness was that PMI purchased event insurance for the first
time, paying a premium to an insurance company to take the risk. The insurance com-
pany agreed to pay PMI in the event of some disaster occurring that would force PMI to
cancel their meeting. This was indeed a real risk. Just three years later, a hurricane caused
the last-minute cancellation of a similar meeting by the Petroleum Engineers Association,
after food and other supplies had already been ordered.

Contracting
Another way of transferring risk is to contract the risk to an outside vendor. If this is
done with a firm fixed-price contract, the risk is effectively transferred to the vendor.
Generally, in firm fixed-price contracts the vendor will always raise the price of the service
to compensate for the effect of the risk. Warrantees, performance bonds, and guarantees
are additional methods for transferring risk.

Acceptance
The acceptance of a risk means that the project team has decided not to change the
project in any way to compensate for the risk. The risk will be dealt with if and when it
occurs. One way to think of acceptance is to visualize the list of risks that was made. The
risks were ranked according to the impact they would have on the project. If we imagine
a line going through the list at some point, the items above the line are ones that we will
do something about in our risk strategy, and the items below the line are the risks that
we will accept. The point at which the line is drawn is the point of risk tolerance.
      Passive acceptance is when the project team does nothing at all about the risk. If the
risk actually occurs, the project team will develop a way to work around the risk or to
correct its effects.
      Active acceptance is when the project team develops a plan of action to be taken in
anticipation of the risk occurring. This action will result in a contingency plan. The
contingency plan can be implemented as soon as triggers indicate the possibility of the
risk occurring. In addition to the contingency plan, a fallback plan may be made as well.
A fallback plan is an additional contingency plan to use in the event that the first contin-
gency plan fails.

Mitigation
The strategies that we have discussed have either gotten rid of the risk entirely, transferred
it to someone else, or accepted the risk, either passively or actively. Risk mitigation is an
effort to reduce the probability or impact of the risk to a point where the risk can be
accepted. Adding additional tests, hiring duplicate suppliers, adding more expert person-
nel, designing prototypes, or in other ways changing the conditions under which the risk
can occur are ways of mitigating risk.
      The important difference in risk mitigation is that it reduces the risk to a level where
we can accept it and its consequences. Adding specific work to the project plan employs
the mitigation strategy. This work will always be done regardless of whether the risk
occurs. The mitigation tasks are specific project tasks that are added to the project plan
to reduce the impact or probability of the risk.
      It should be clear that an overall risk strategy should be designed to deal with risks
by accepting them as they are, avoiding them by eliminating them from being possible,
transferring them to another's responsibility, or reducing their impact and/or probability
to a level where they can be accepted.

Budgeting for Risk
In keeping with the principle that project baselines are definite commitments for the
project, the project budget and schedules should be ones that the project is truly expected
to meet. That is, the budget is the budget that is really expected to be spent when the
project is complete, and the schedule should allow for sufficient time to do the project.
This budget and schedule must include the time for managing and overcoming risks. In
Chapter 2, Time Management, we looked at dealing with schedule contingency. Here I
discuss planning for budget contingency.
      Funds that are to be used for mitigation, avoidance, or transfer are budgeted in with
the rest of the committed project work. These are actual tasks that must be done, or they
are funds that will be spent regardless of whether the risk occurs. But how do we budget
for work that must be done only if the risk occurs?
      There are two kinds of risks that must be dealt with, known risks and unknown
risks. Known risks are the risks that were identified in the identification process of risk
management discussed earlier. Unknown risks are the ones that we know will probably
occur on this project, because unknown and unexpected risks have occurred before on
projects of this type.
      Known risks should be handled by the creation of a contingency budget. This money
is not assigned to specific project tasks and is set aside and available to fund the work
that must be done if and when a risk occurs. This budget should require the approval of
the project manager as a means of making certain that the money is truly allocated to
solve risk problems. If this money is made available too easily, it will be spent early in the




                           ................. 11151$   $CH7   02-09-05 08:07:35   PS              PAGE 189
190                  Preparing for the Project Management Professional Certification Exam



project on problems that might have been solved in the normal course of completing the
task.
      Unknown risks must be funded as well. In this case the risks are those that could
not be identified in the risk identification process. An estimate based on past experience
with similar projects can be made. This estimate is used to create a management reserve.
The management reserve is similar to the contingency budget in that it is made available
to fund unknown risks when they occur. In order to prevent the inappropriate use of this
budget, a person at a level above the project manager level must approve the use of these
funds.



                        Risk Monitoring and Control
Risk monitoring and control is the process of keeping track of all the identified risks and
identifying new risks as their presence becomes known and residual risks that occur when
the risk management plans are implemented on individual risks. The effectiveness of the
risk management plan is evaluated on an ongoing basis throughout the project.
      When a risk is apparently going to take place, the contingency plan is put into place.
If there is no contingency plan, then the risk is dealt with on an ad hoc basis using what
is termed a ``workaround.'' A workaround is an unplanned response to a negative risk
event. A corrective action is the act of performing the workaround or the contingency
plan.
      The concern of the project manager and the project team is that risk responses have
been brought to bear on the risk as planned and that the risk response has been effective.
After they have observed the effectiveness of the risk response, additional risks may de-
velop or additional responses may be necessary.
      Risk management is a continuous process that takes place during the entire project
from beginning to end. As the project progresses, the risks that have been identified are
monitored and reassessed as the time that they can take place approaches. Early warning
indicators are monitored to reassess the probability and impact of the risk. As the risk
approaches the risk strategies are reviewed for appropriateness, and additional responses
are planned.
      Risk assessments, reviews, and audits may be performed periodically to review the
probability and potential impact of risks that have been identified and are nearer to their
possible occurrence. Risks that have already taken place can be reviewed and audited to
assess the effectiveness of the risk response.
      As each risk occurs and is dealt with or is avoided, these changes must be docu-
mented. Good documentation ensures that risks of this type will be dealt with in a more
effective way than before, and that the next project manager will benefit from ``lessons
learned.''

                                              Summary
Risk management has become one of the most important aspects of project management.
As companies become better at managing projects, the significance of risk management
becomes more important. Many companies are not yet adept at determining project cost,
schedule, and scope baselines, and they have not yet learned to manage the work that is
actually going to have to get done in the project. Until this is done it does not seem
worthwhile to consider risk management.
      The components of risk identification, probability, and impact must all be consid-
ered in order to determine how to deal with a risk. The combination of impact and
probability determine the severity of the risk. The severity of a risk determines how it
ranks in importance among other risks.
      The six steps in risk management--risk management planning, risk identification,
risk assessment, risk quantification, risk response planning, and risk monitoring and con-
trol--are necessary to manage risk. The steps must be carried out on a continuous basis
throughout the project.
      Companies and individuals have risk tolerance. They either tend to be gamblers and
are willing to take chances to achieve rewards, or they tend to be conservative and less
willing to take chances.
      Various methods can be used for risk identification. All of the techniques useful for
group dynamics are also useful for identifying risks. Risk evaluation must determine the
probability of the risk occurring and the impact that it will have if it does. Risks that are
either very low in probability or very low in impact need not be considered as a serious
threat to the project, even though they may be coupled with high impacts or high proba-
bility, respectively.
      Expected values for risks are useful in determining the quantitative value of a risk in
terms of dollars. The expected value of a risk is the approximate amount of money that
could be spent to eliminate the risk.
      Once it has been determined that a risk should be dealt with, the proper strategy
must be employed. Risks can be avoided by completely eliminating the possibility of the
risk through redesign or restructure of the project. Risks can also be transferred by making
someone outside the project responsible for the risk. Risks can be mitigated by reducing
either their probability or their impact to a level where they become acceptable.
      Contingency reserves are monies set aside for dealing with an identified risk when
it occurs. The contingency reserve is part of the project budget. Management reserves are
monies that are set aside for dealing with unidentified risks when they occur. Manage-
ment reserves are part of the project budget, but not part of the baseline.

Contract and Procurement Management



M
            any times it is the project manager who is on the buying end of the project.
            Most of the time we think of projects as work that we are doing to produce a
            set of deliverables that will be delivered to some organizations. However, often
the project manager is required to hire another project manager to produce goods and
services for his or her organization. When this is done, the roles and responsibilities of
the project managers change somewhat. It is necessary to have assurance that the hired
project manager and his or her team will actually produce what is required.
      Contracts provide us with a way of making agreements that can be depended on.
After considering the need to protect life, property, and freedom, nearly all of the legal
systems of the civilized world are designed to allow business to flow with reasonable ease
and allow people to exchange goods and services in a mutually beneficial way. This is
called commerce.
      Contracts are binding agreements between two or more parties. The terms of a
contract are not only binding but enforceable by our legal system and our courts. If this
were not the case, our entire economy would soon collapse, and commerce would end.
Without the right to property and the enforcement of contracts no one would be a party
to any agreement, because the other parties to the agreement might change their minds.
Because of the legal nature of contracts there is usually a higher level of approval required.
As the value of contracts becomes greater, legal and procurement experts will become
part of the project team. Even in the simplest purchases a purchasing agent must sign the
purchase order as agent for the organization. Traditionally we refer to the seller and the
buyer by several names. A seller may be called contractor, subcontractor, vendor, agency,
or supplier. A buyer we may refer to as client, customer, contractor, prime contractor, or
acquiring organization.
      The contract statement of work is a necessary part of any procurement or contract.

It must be in sufficient detail to allow any of the potential vendors to fully understand
what is required of them and if they are capable of meeting all of the requirements. If the
purchased items are commodities, the statement of work (SOW) is very simple, but if the
items being purchased are very specialized, the SOW can be quite lengthy. The SOW
should include the items that are required that are not necessarily part of the product
delivered. These are items like quality reports, manuals, documentation, and performance
and progress reports.
     This chapter has two parts: Contract Management and Procurement Management.


                            Contract Management
The first thing we need is a definition of a contract. Texts on business law define a
contract as follows:

     A contract is an agreement between competent parties, for consideration, to accom-
     plish some lawful purpose with the terms clearly set forth.

      First of all, the contract is an ``agreement.'' This means that the parties involved
must have a meeting of the minds and decide that they will do the things set forth in the
contract. By this definition no contract can be forced on someone. If there is any kind of
forcing or coercion, there cannot be an enforceable contract. You cannot force someone
at gunpoint to sign a contract to buy aluminum storm windows and expect to hold the
person to the contract.
      The contract must be ``between competent parties.'' This means that the people
who make the agreement must be competent to make the agreement. Persons who are
impaired in any way that makes them unable to make responsible decisions or people
who are not of age cannot make contracts. As a matter of fact, if a minor or another
incompetent party enters into a contract, the contract may be enforceable on the compe-
tent party and not on the incompetent party.
      The contract must be ``for consideration.'' This means that something must be
given for something else. If there is no exchange of anything, then there is no contract.
There would be no point in going to the trouble to create a contract if there is no
exchange. It is important to note that the consideration does not have to be something
that is valuable to everyone. The consideration could easily be something that one person
values and no one else does. The consideration does not need to be tangible either. An
intangible consideration can be involved in any contract.
      The contract must ``accomplish some lawful purpose.'' No contract can legally be
written that violates the law. You cannot contract with someone to steal a car for you.
The contract would be void at its inception.

      In discussing contract management for projects we generally are interested in the
relationship between a buyer and a supplier.

Make or Buy
The decision to make or buy something must be considered. Many times it is less expen-
sive to purchase something from an outside source than it is to make the item inside the
company. Cost is a major consideration for this, but there are many other reasons for
deciding whether to purchase or make an item. If a facility has idle capacity, it may make
sense to produce a part that is normally made by an outside vendor. The excess capacity
is there to be used, and the company is paying for it whether it is used or not. In a make-
or-buy decision, it should be necessary to consider only the variable cost in this situation.
If there is no extra capacity, then the cost of adding the capacity must be considered as
well.
      If an item is needed and it is important that strict control be maintained in its
production, it may be necessary to make the item instead of purchasing it. Similarly,
items that involve trade secrets and innovative products should not be contracted out of
the company.
      Using the flexibility of the purchasing system to stabilize the workforce is desirable.
Many companies have used this strategy to help maintain consistent employment levels
in their companies. A company wishing to do this subcontracts some of the work to
outside companies. When the demand for its product goes down, the company decreases
the amount of work that the outside contractor is doing and maintains the constant level
of work in its own facility. It does not take vendors long to figure this out and adjust
pricing for the product to compensate them for their own stability problems.
      The decision to purchase an item may simply be a matter of a company not having
the ability to produce the item. Skills may be unique for this project and may not be
needed in the future. Buying equipment to produce items that will be needed only for
this project may not be justifiable, and it may be less costly to buy the items in question
or to lease the equipment to produce them.

Contract Life Cycle
The contract life cycle must be managed like the project life cycle. The contracting
process is very similar to the project management processes of initialization, planning,
implementation, and closeout.
      In the contracting process, we consider the steps in a little more detail (Figure 8-1).
The requirement stage of the contracting process can be considered equivalent to the
initialization of the project. The requisition, solicitation, and award stages can be consid-
ered equivalent to the planning process. The contract can be considered equivalent to the
implementation process. Closeout occurs at the close of the contract.

                                                                                     Contract


     Requirement Process
     In the requirement process the needs of the project are identified. As in the require-
ments definition of the project, the requirements of the contract are identified. These
requirements come from a needs assessment, and the needs are further reduced to require-
ments. Before the decision to purchase a good or service is made, a decision must be
made as to whether the item should be purchased or made internally. Requirements are
frequently stated in a document called the statement of work.
     Cost estimates must be produced to help predict what the correct cost of the item
should be. These cost estimates help the person doing the purchasing to determine
whether the potential vendor is quoting a fair and agreeable price.
     As in the project management requirements definition, the process begins with a
determination of needs. These are the items that someone wishes to have delivered. These
needs are reduced by mutual agreement to requirements. The requirements are further
reduced by excluding the requirements that are not justified.

     Requisition Process
     The requisition process consists of reviewing the specifications and statement of
work and identifying qualified suppliers. It is sometimes called solicitation planning.
     During the requisition process, the requirements definition is passed to the purchas-
ing personnel. These may or may not be part of the project team. The specifications and
statement of work are reviewed, but now there is input from the purchasing function.
This input provides cost information that may further reduce the requirement of items
that are now deemed to be impractical.




                          ................. 11151$   $CH8   02-09-05 08:07:26   PS                    PAGE 195
196                  Preparing for the Project Management Professional Certification Exam



     At this time all of the signatures necessary to procure the item are added to the
requisition. Certain signatures are required before the company can be committed to
make an expenditure, and other signatures are necessary to be sure that all necessary
persons are informed about the purchase being made.

     Solicitation Process
     The solicitation process involves obtaining bids or proposals. During this process a
number of vendors are solicited to participate in the process of becoming the chosen
vendor. In the case of commodity purchases it may be necessary to evaluate only the price
of the item being supplied. In the case of unique items it may be necessary to evaluate
many different aspects of the vendor and the product that is proposed. Frequently pro-
curements are advertised in trade news publications to ensure fairness to all vendors.
Oftentimes this is a requirement for any government agency's procurement.
     There are two major forms of solicitation, the request for proposal (RFP) and the
request for quote (RFQ). When the RFQ is used, potential vendors must meet all of the
requirements of the RFQ and must deliver exactly what has been asked for. When the
RFP is used, vendors are at some liberty to meet the functionality described in the RFP.
Because of this flexibility each vendor may propose something different and at a different
price.
     Using the RFQ process makes the vendor decision very simple. Since all vendors are
required to supply exactly what was asked for, the only difference between them is the
price. The buyer must be very careful in preparing the bid specifications because the
vendor will be required to supply what was asked for.
     In the RFP process the specifications are more of a functional nature and do not
define what is to be delivered as much as they define the functions that the items delivered
are supposed to do. While the major part of the work in the RFQ process comes when
the bid specifications are written, the RFP process requires most of the work to be done
during the evaluation of the proposals submitted.
     As an example of how this works, suppose a city government wanted to purchase
500 laptop computers for the city hall staff. They write up the bid specifications for a
Pentium 5 processor, with 60 GB of hard drive space, floppy disk drive, and 15-inch
screen. The procurement process at city hall is rather lengthy. By the time the laptop
computers are delivered, the state-of-the-art laptops have a Pentium 7 processor, 120 GB
hard drive, and no floppy drive at all. Not only that, but to meet the specifications the
vendor would have to special order the computers, making the overall cost higher than
giving the customer something superior to what was asked for. All of this may result in a
forced re-bid, and the process could start over and over again.
     Vendor conferences, also known as bidder conferences or pre-bid conferences, are
used to allow all of the vendors to come to a meeting where they may ask any questions
regarding the bid or proposal. A conference of this type allows potential vendors to ask




                        ................. 11151$   $CH8   02-09-05 08:07:27   PS               PAGE 196

about anything that is unclear about the procurement, and to hear what is being said to
the other vendors so there is no risk of one vendor having information that others do not
possess.
      Qualified Sellers Lists can be developed by the project team or the procurement
department. These lists can be constructed based on publicly available information on
the Internet; in libraries, Dun and Bradstreet reports, and the Thomas Register; and from
various other sources. Potential vendors may also be sent questionnaires to determine
their qualifications and interest in doing business in a particular area.

     Award Process
     During the awarding process, one vendor is selected from the ones solicited. At this
time the contract is written, negotiated, and signed by both parties.
     The writing and signing of the contract can be simple, as in the purchase of a
commodity. In the purchasing of such common items the contract is generally a standard
item that is written on the back of a purchase order. Many times these contracts are
written in very light ink and in very small type.
     In more complex purchases, the contract may have to be negotiated, and specific
terms and conditions for this particular contract must be agreed to. The more detailed
the contract, the more complex this part of the contracting cycle will be.

      Trade-Off Studies
      One of the methods of evaluating potential suppliers is the trade-off study. This is
a useful process in that it gives us a consistent way of evaluating the potential suppliers
and documents each of the reasons why a particular vendor was selected.
      Potential vendors may be eliminated through a screening process. By screening we
mean that we establish definite requirements of performance, and any vendor that does
not at least meet these minimums is automatically disqualified. For example, a vendor
might be required to have a project manager assigned who is a certified PMP.
      As can be seen in Figure 8-2, a trade-off study is begun by listing all of the potential
vendors across the top of the page in columns. The features or the desirable traits of the
object being purchased are written down the first column. Another column is added to
show the relative importance of each of the features. This is called the weight column.
Each of the vendor columns is divided in two: rank and score.
      We begin by listing the features. These are all of the important traits that will be
part of the evaluation process. Features that might be included include total life cycle
cost, price, technical approach, management approach, ability to perform the work, and
understanding of what was asked for. For a complex selection this list could go on for
several pages. Next, the weight factor is determined, and each one of the features is
evaluated for importance. The number here is one of relative importance. A feature that
is given a 6 should be twice as important as a feature given a 3. Next, each potential




                           ................. 11151$   $CH8   02-09-05 08:07:27   PS              PAGE 197

vendor is ranked according to their ability to supply this feature. If more than one vendor
furnishes this feature equally they can receive the same rank, or a scale of 1 to 10 can be
used to evaluate how well each vendor supplies the feature. The rank number for each
vendor for each feature is then multiplied by the weight factor of each of the features and
written in the score column. Summing the score numbers will produce a high score for
one of the vendors. This is the preferred vendor.
      The trade-off study seems to be quite analytical and quantitative, but in reality it is
not. The choosing of the weight factors is very subjective, as is the assignment of ranking
numbers for the potential suppliers. Multiplying them together multiplies the errors as
well. The method, however, has one great advantage to justify its use. The orderly ar-
rangement of the selection criteria and the evaluation of each supplier is plain to see, and
it shows anyone objecting (probably one of the unselected vendors) to the vendor selec-
tion exactly what things were considered.

     Contract Process
     The contract process is the final part of the contracting process. In this process the
contract is actually carried out. The vendor and the purchaser must follow the planning
process, organize the work staff for the work to be done, and control the contract. The
purchaser and the seller must both be responsible for their part of the contract.

Contract Administration
As contracts become more complicated and more valuable the administration of the
contract becomes more and more important. In administering a contract we are the client
of the project, and we should expect that the supplier's project manager will be able to




                        ................. 11151$   $CH8   02-09-05 08:07:28   PS                PAGE 198

furnish us with information regarding the performance of the project team. On large
projects, reports from the project manager should include progress reports on scheduling,
performance reports on scheduling and cost, quality control reports, risk monitoring and
control reports, and change control reports. At times it is desirable that the contract
administrator for the buyer visit the facility where the work is taking place and verify that
the reports do in fact report what is really going on.

Contract Types
In the world of commerce nearly any kind of agreement can be made that will satisfy the
needs of both parties of the contract. Whenever there is a contract, there is always busi-
ness risk. The business risk is that there can be a positive or negative outcome to the
contract, depending on the risks involved and whether they work out favorably or not
(see Figure 8-3).

      Fixed-Price or Lump-Sum Contract
      A fixed-price contract requires that a project be completed for a fixed amount of
money. The seller agrees to sell something to the buyer at a price that has been agreed to
beforehand. The seller agrees to provide the buyer with something that meets the specifi-
cations as agreed, and the buyer agrees to give the seller a fixed amount of money in
return. Strictly speaking, in this kind of contract, the seller must do the work specified
for the agreed upon amount. In the real world, if problems occur that make it impossible
for the seller to perform for the agreed upon price or if the supplier is having severe
financial problems, agreements can be modified.
      In fixed-price contracting, the seller is taking all of the risk of having things go
wrong, but the seller is also setting the price in such a way as to be compensated for

Figure 8-3. Customer and supplier risk.

taking the risk. In fact, in this type of contract it may be that the buyer is paying more
than would have been necessary if the buyer had been willing to take some of the risk.
      In fixed-price contracts there is no need for the buyer to know what the seller is
actually spending on the project. Whether the supplier spends more or less should be of
no interest to the buyer. The buyer should be interested only in the specifications of the
project being met.
      There are several variations on the fixed-price contract.
      Firm Fixed-Price Contract. In a firm fixed-price contract the seller takes all of the
risk. In our discussion on project risk, one of the strategies for handling risk was to deflect
or transfer the risk to another organization. The most risk-free way to transfer the risk is
to use a firm fixed-price contract. Here the contract terms require that the seller supply
the buyer with the agreed-upon goods or services at a firm fixed price. In other words,
the supplier must supply the good or service without being able to recover any of the cost
of doing the work if cost-increasing risks occur during the fulfillment of the contract.
      Frequently, in this type of contract, if the supplier cannot perform for the agreed
upon amount, there is some room for negotiating even after the contract has been agreed
to and signed. The firm fixed-price contract has the most predictable cost of all of the
types of contract.
      Fixed-Price Plus Economic-Adjustment Contract. In this type of contract some of the
risk is kept by the buyer. All of the risks associated with the contract are borne by the
seller except for the condition of changes in the economy. This type of contract can be
used when there are periods of very high inflation. The contract price is adjusted accord-
ing to some formula that depends on an agreed upon economic indicator.
      The economic adjustment is important when there are periods of high inflation and
the length of the contract is long. During the time of the contract, the value of money
may go down considerably and the value of the contract along with it. For example, one
company agrees to purchase a project from another company. The time that it will take
to complete this project is one year. During the time between the agreement and the
delivery of the project, there is high inflation, say 20 percent per year. In our discussion
of cost management in Chapter 3, we looked at the effect of present values and saw that
money that we receive in the future is worth less than the same money received today.
Therefore, it is reasonable that the supplier increase the selling price of the project by 20
percent if the money will be paid at the end of the one-year project.
      However, suppose that inflation rates and interest rates are unstable. In this situation
the seller does not know how much to increase the price in order to be compensated for
the time value of money. Inflation may be 20 percent, or it may be 30 percent. The
supplier wants to figure the selling price based on 30 percent, but the buyer argues that
the inflation rate could be only 20 percent.
      The buyer and supplier agree that they will adjust the selling price up or down
according to some economic formula. In this situation it might be reasonable to adjust




                         ................. 11151$   $CH8   02-09-05 08:07:29   PS                 PAGE 200

the selling price at the end of the project according to the average interest rate over the
period. In the 1970s many contracts were written with economic adjustments based on
the consumer price index. Many other economic indicators can be used for adjusting
prices.
      Fixed-Price Plus Incentive Contract. In a fixed-price plus incentive contract there is
an agreed upon fixed price for the project plus an incentive fee for exceeding the perfor-
mance of the contract. In this type of contract the buyer wishes to create some incentive
for the supplier. The buyer offers to increase the amount to be paid for the completion
of the project if the supplier delivers the project early or if the project performance
exceeds the agreed upon specifications.
      In this situation the risk of meeting the conditions of the project are borne by the
supplier, but the buyer assumes some additional risk. The buyer really wants the project
to be delivered early or with the enhanced features in the incentive part of the contract
but is not able to get the supplier to agree to these terms as part of a fixed-price contract.
If the extra enhancements are actually delivered or if the project is completed early, the
buyer will pay extra. If the project is completed without the enhancements or is com-
pleted in the agreed upon time, the contract terms are met and the incentives are not
paid.
      For example, the Jones Company wants to buy a new machine. Jones can use the
machine as soon as it is delivered to satisfy orders for its product. It contracts with the
Ace Machine Company to deliver the new machine. Ace is only willing to promise a
delivery of six months because of problems that usually occur in this type of project. If
the contract is a fixed-price contract with no incentive fees, the Ace Company will deliver
the machine on time. If there is a fixed-price plus incentive contract, the Ace Company
may be motivated to deliver early. There may be an incentive of $500 per day for early
delivery.
      With this type of contract there is usually a penalty for delivering late or for deliver-
ing a project that does not meet all of the requirements. The Ace Company may be
required to deduct $500 per day for delivering the project late.

      Cost-Plus Contract
      A major distinction is made between contracts that are fixed price and those that
are cost reimbursable. In a cost-reimbursable contract the supplier agrees to perform the
terms of the contract, but the buyer takes on the risk. The buyer agrees to reimburse the
supplier for any work that is done and for any money that is spent. When the contract is
completed, the buyer pays a fixed fee to the supplier for the work that was done. This is
essentially the profit for doing the project.
      Cost-reimbursable contracts are usual when there is a great deal of risk and uncer-
tainty in the project or a significant amount of investment must be made before the final
results of the project can be reached.




                            ................. 11151$   $CH8   02-09-05 08:07:29   PS              PAGE 201

      For example, the U.S. government wants to develop a new tank for the army. The
requirements are not clear, and the design of the tank must be modified to accept the
latest state-of-the-art designs for its components as it is being developed. The approval
and development process may take as long as ten years. There are probably no companies
that would agree to a fixed-price contract for this project, so the government awards a
cost-plus contract instead.
      In a cost-plus type of contract the buyer is actually taking the responsibility for the
risk. If problems develop in the project, the buyer will have to pay for the corrective
action that is necessary. Some of the time this can actually be economical. In projects
with a lot of risk, the supplier usually will estimate the cost of the risks and charge the
buyer enough in the price to adequately compensate for taking the risk. In a cost-
reimbursable contract the actual costs of the risks that occur are the only ones that are
paid for.
      One of the problems in a cost-reimbursable contract is the determination of the
actual cost. There is always the danger that the seller's report of the actual cost to the
buyer may contain costs of some other project. This means that the buyer needs to check
to be sure that misallocation of cost is not occurring. In large federal government projects,
staffs of auditors check on correct cost reporting to ensure that this is not a problem.
Many times the cost of the auditing and tracking system to ensure correct reporting
makes these kinds of contracts difficult to apply unless the projects are large.
      Cost Plus Fixed-Fee Contract. In a cost plus fixed-fee contract the seller is reimbursed
for all of the money that is spent meeting the contract requirements and is also paid a
fixed fee. The fixed fee is essentially the profit for managing the project. Without some
sort of fee in addition to the actual cost of the contract there would be no profit, and the
company would simply be making the money that it spent. No company would know-
ingly take on this kind of contract.
      In a cost plus fixed-fee contract, the supplier has only a small incentive to control
cost and complete the project. Regardless of when the contract is completed and as long
as the specifications are met, the supplier will get only the profit from the fixed fee.
      All of us have had this kind of contract at one time or another. A good example of
what can happen is when I hire my teenage child to mow the lawn. Essentially this is a
cost plus fixed-fee contract. I am responsible for the equipment and gasoline and main-
taining the lawnmower. The labor is supplied by the teenager for a fixed fee. Generally,
the results of this contract are that the lawn will get mowed but may not get mowed
soon.
      Cost Plus Award-Fee Contract. In a cost plus award-fee contract an award system is
set up to compensate the supplier for completing parts of the contract. The award fee
can be determined by many different criteria including the quality of the workmanship,
the correct filling out of reports, and practically any other criteria that are agreed to. As
each of these requirements is met the award fee is determined and given to the supplier.

      Cost Plus Incentive-Fee Contract. In a cost plus incentive-fee contract an incentive
system is set up for the supplier to perform in excess of the agreed upon terms and
specifications of the contract. Similar to a fixed-price plus incentive contract, the cost plus
incentive-fee contract allows the supplier to exceed the specifications and requirements of
the contract. When the project is delivered early or when the design criteria and specifi-
cations have been exceeded, the incentive fee is paid.
      The cost plus incentive-fee contract is the least predictable of all types of contract.
Not only is the variable cost of the work included in the contract but the variable incen-
tive that must be paid to the seller must also be considered.

      Time-and-Material Contract
      This type of contract is a mixture of fixed-price and cost-reimbursable contracts. In
this type of contract the total cost of the contract may vary considerably depending on
the total amount of time and material that is expended. There are, however, some fixed
costs associated with it. For example, the total amount of engineering labor may not be
specified but the cost of the resource per hour may be part of the contract.


                          Procurement Management
Procurement is the act of acquiring goods and services from outside the organization.
The procurement process includes planning for the procurement, solicitation of the
sources for the desired product or services, and defining the requirements, source selec-
tion, administration, and closeout. In a free market economy, the competitiveness of the
product or service that is sought will have a great deal to do with the type of contract
that can be written between the two parties. In other words, we must decide whether or
not to acquire something, when and how to do it, and how much to acquire.

Commodities
Items that are sought that are widely available and for all intents and purposes identical
are considered to be commodities. In the sale of commodities there are many people
offering the same product. In all cases the products are identical for the purpose for which
they are intended. Familiar examples of commodities are corn, wheat, and soybeans, but
electrical components that are made by a number of different firms and are relatively
standardized are also commodities.
      Since there are many suppliers of the same commodity, competition drives the price
to the lowest level. A supplier will not be able to sell a commodity if there is someone
else offering the same thing for a lower price.
      According to the theory of supply and demand, the price of a product rises as the
demand increases. The higher price for the commodity causes other producers to enter




                            ................. 11151$   $CH8   02-09-05 08:07:30   PS              PAGE 203

the market until the supply increases to meet the additional demand. As demand for a
commodity decreases, the price that people are willing to pay for the commodity de-
creases. Producers of the commodity leave the market, and the supply is reduced to a
level that meets the demand. Eventually, in a completely competitive environment, the
supply and demand will reach equilibrium.
      In contracting for commodity items, the details of the contract and the description
of the item being contracted for are relatively standardized. Most of the people in the
business of selling commodity items will standardize on the purchase process. With stan-
dardization it becomes easier to purchase an item from competing vendors and know
that the item will be the same from each vendor.

Unique Products and Services
When we are dealing with unique products and services there will be some risk involved
on the part of the buyer and supplier that will modify the truly competitive environment.
Unlike commodity buying and selling, the uniqueness of a project will make it impossible
to compare the offerings of competitors, and many criteria other than price must be used.
      Projects are frequently this type of purchased item. It is necessary to evaluate many
different criteria among the offerings that are made. There will be differences in quality,
performance, timeliness, and cost for similar projects from different suppliers.
      Perfect competition, as in the commodities' type of purchasing, naturally drives the
price to the lowest level that allows the producers to make an acceptable profit. In an
effort to make a higher profit many companies try to add features to their product that
make it unique. Once uniqueness has been established, it is possible to price the unique
item higher than it would be in a competitive commodity situation.

Forward Buying
Forward buying is the process of buying items in anticipation of their need. As with all
things, it is important to consider the cost and benefits that can result in doing this.
      The advantages of forward buying are that there is some protection against running
out of an item. In the world of production control this is called a ``stock out.'' Frequently,
the vendor will also give a discount for buying larger quantities. The shipping cost will
usually be lower to ship a large number of items in one shipment than to make several
small shipments. This serves to reduce the cost of the product being made.
      On the negative side of forward buying there is the risk that the large number of
parts will become obsolete before they are used, as, for example, in the case of a company
that purchased a large quantity of buggy whips right before the invention of the Ford
automobile. Forward buying requires that the larger inventory of parts be stored in the
facility as well. In most businesses floor space is valuable and better used for operating
the business than for storing parts.

 Contract and Procurement Management                                                   205



Blanket Orders
Blanket orders are a form of forward buying. A blanket order allows the buyer to take a
quantity discount without actually taking delivery on the large quantity. In a blanket
order the buyer agrees to buy all of the material that they need of a certain item from one
or more vendors for a specified period of time. The vendor then agrees to sell the items
at a discount price based on the expected quantity needed over that period of time.
      As the need for the material items occurs, requests to the vendor are filled and
tracked against the blanket order. At the end of the time period, the total quantity
ordered and delivered to the buyer is checked against the blanket order quantity, and a
cash payment is made to the buyer if the quantity has been higher and to the supplier if
the quantity is lower.
      This arrangement has advantages for both parties. The buyer is assured of a reliable
supply of parts because he or she has made a long-term commitment to the vendor. The
buyer gets a quantity discount without having to stock a large inventory of parts.
      The supplier has the advantage of having a committed customer for the duration of
the blanket order. This commitment allows the supplier to plan his or her own operation
with the reliability that the customer will continue to purchase these items for a period
of time. With the confidence that there will be future business the supplier may be able
to invest in equipment and facilities to make these parts for the buyer.

Split Orders
Splitting orders is a process of dividing work between two or more vendors of an item.
The purpose of splitting an order is to reduce the risk that the parts may not be delivered
on time or may not be of acceptable quality. The advantage of this process is that the
probability of one vendor supplying acceptable parts is increased.
      Let's say, for example, that we have two vendors that have a 90 percent probability
of delivering on time. We could increase the probability of having at least one vendor
deliver on time if we give half of the order to each vendor. This is the probability of one
vendor or the other delivering. (This is the ``addition rule'' we discussed in Chapter 7,
Risk Management.) The probability of one or the other vendor delivering on time is the
probability of one vendor delivering plus the probability of the other vendor delivering
given that the first vendor failed to deliver.
      The probability of one vendor delivering is 90 percent. The probability of the sec-
ond vendor delivering given that the first vendor failed to deliver is the probability of
both the first vendor not delivering and the second vendor delivering.
     Probability of A or B delivering  Probability of A delivering (90%)  Probability
     of A not delivering (10%) times the probability of B delivering (90%)
     P (A or B)  .90  (.90  .10)  .99
    We can increase the probability from 90 percent to 99 percent by splitting the order
between the two vendors.




                          ................. 11151$   $CH8   02-09-05 08:07:31   PS            PAGE 205
206                  Preparing for the Project Management Professional Certification Exam



     Splitting the order does not come without a cost. The quantity discount from either
of the vendors will be reduced, since only half the quantity is being purchased from each.
One of the vendors may not have the same quality as the preferred vendor, and this may
add rework to the process.


                                               Summary
Many times a project is not able to produce everything that is needed to complete the
project. When this occurs the project manager becomes the client of another project
manager, and the roles are somewhat reversed from their normal state.
      The project manager now becomes the purchaser. It is important that the project
manager understand the purchasing cycle and the basics of contracting. It is quite easy to
find ourselves with a significant problem with no legal protection. Contracts provide us
with a formal agreement that is binding between the two or more parties involved and is
enforceable by our legal system and the courts.
      There are many reasons why we may not wish to produce something ourselves. This
is known as making a make-or-buy decision. Many factors affect these decisions.
      The contract life cycle is similar to the project life cycle in that requirements are
developed, requisitions are generated, vendors are contacted and solicited, and finally one
is selected and awarded the contract. Once the award is made, the project manager must
manage this contractor just as if the contractor were part of the project team.
      There are many types of contracts. The various types of contracts can be explained
by considering them in light of risk and who accepts the risk. Fixed-price types of con-
tracts have an agreement to pay a fixed price for some specified good or service. Here the
risk is on the side of the seller or supplier. If anything happens that increases the cost of
producing the good or service, the seller or supplier must bear the additional cost without
being able to increase the selling price to the buyer. In cost-plus types of contracts the
buyer is willing to reimburse the seller for any costs that have occurred. The risk of
increased cost due to unforeseen problems is borne by the buyer.
      When purchasing goods and services for projects, there are many different purchas-
ing arrangements that can be made. Forward buying and blanket ordering are methods
that are used to make a mutually beneficial arrangement for both the buyer and the seller
or supplier.

                              Professional Responsibility



T
      he Project Management Institute engaged the Columbia Assessment Service (CAS)
      to study the PMP examination process. This resulted in changes to the PMP exami-
      nation. In fact, the exam was revised considerably as a result of the work that was
done.
      CAS began by analyzing the responsibilities of project management professionals
(PMPs). Then it specified a plan for the testing of PMPs, wrote and rewrote questions
for the exam, and determined the passing score for the test. The Project Management
Professional (PMP) Role Delineation Study was published in 2000 to address the responsi-
bilities of a PMP and the plan for the test. Since the PMP examination is very important
to all of us who are certified as project manager professionals, it is also important that the
examination be one that tests what actually happens in project management. The test
questions must be fair and accurate and draw information from every aspect of project
management.
      Those who participated in the studies and interviews that were part of the process
were not bound to the topics covered in the Guide to the Project Management Body of
Knowledge. For this reason the advisers found that it was necessary to add a sixth domain
to the examination. So in addition to questions on initiating, planning, executing, con-
trolling, and closing, the exam now contains questions on professional responsibility.
These questions will account for 29 questions out of the 200 questions on the exam. This
may seem like a lot, but when you consider that there are a lot of questions that are
common to all of the domains--such as communications techniques, communicating
effectively, coaching, mentoring, personal strengths and weaknesses, instructional meth-
ods and tools, stakeholders' interests, competing needs and objectives, conflict resolution
techniques, and generating alternatives--it is difficult to relate a specific question on the
examination to a particular domain or process area.

208                  Preparing for the Project Management Professional Certification Exam



      In the area of professional responsibility, tasks are defined, along with specific
knowledge areas and skills that are required for each task. The examination questions are
based on this material. The number of questions for each topic is based on surveys
regarding the importance of each task within the project management community.
      The following tasks are the basis for the questions that will be on the PMP examina-
tion. They are from the Project Management Professional (PMP) Role Delineation Study,
published by the Project Management Institute.



                                                   Task 1

      Ensure individual integrity and professionalism by adhering to legal requirements
      and ethical standards in order to protect the community and all stakeholders.

      A project manager must be familiar with the laws that govern the project in the
place where the project is being carried out. The project manager is the person in charge.
In our classes we refer to the project manager as the one person responsible for everything
in the project. If something goes wrong with the project, it is the project manager's
responsibility. The project manager has responsibility for everything that happens on the
project, much as the captain of a ship is responsible for everything that happens on that
ship.
      I recently gave testimony in a lawsuit involving a road-milling machine that acciden-
tally broke a gas line while it was removing several inches of old road surface. The issue
was to decide which of the several insurance companies would pay for the damages
involved resulting from the accident. Since the project manager was responsible for the
project, his insurance company should be the one to pay. The road construction company
had failed to notify the utility companies, as was their responsibility. Had the utility
companies been properly notified that the work was taking place, they might have taken
steps to avert the accident.
      Even though the project manager had specifically instructed the contractor to notify
the utility companies, and even though the contractor said that they had contacted them,
the accident remains the project manager's responsibility.
      It is important that the project manager have a complete and thorough knowledge
of the stakeholders of the project and also of the community that surrounds and mingles
with the project. In a real sense the members of the community around the project are
stakeholders, and there is a responsibility to protect them from any harmful effects of the
project. I am sure that we can all recall the day that the Chernobyl nuclear power plant
accident occurred in the Ukraine. Many thousands of lives were lost as a result of this
disaster.

                                                  Task 2
     Contribute to the project management knowledge base by sharing lessons learned,
     best practices, research, etc. within appropriate communities in order to improve
     the quality of project management services, build the capabilities of colleagues, and
     advance the profession.
      In this task the project manager is expected to contribute to the improvement of
project management knowledge both by increasing the quality and by improving the
methods and techniques of project management. In addition to improving the tools of
the profession the project manager should contribute time and energy to help improve
the capabilities of colleagues.
      By being a member of the Project Management Institute and participating in the
activities of the chapter, the international organization, and the other international orga-
nizations that support project management, you foster the growth and improvement of
project management. By attending conferences and meetings and contributing by the
presentation of a paper at those conferences you can improve the world of project man-
agement. Supporting company training programs and helping to offer training programs
through a local chapter of a project management association will go far to reach these
ends.
      Some project managers offer their time to further the development of research. This
does not mean that you must head up a research study, obtain a grant for thousands of
dollars, or join the faculty of a university. It does mean, however, that you should fill out
questionnaires and surveys when asked, and it does mean that you should respond to
students when asked to assist in their research.
      Many opportunities present themselves to project managers that foster goodwill and
increase the knowledge that others have about project management and what it does. I
was once asked to speak before the annual meeting of Meeting Planners International.
These are the people who plan conventions and conferences in places all over the world.
As it turned out, this group had a great deal of interest in project management. What
better places to practice project management than conventions and conferences? They
have critical schedules, limited budgets, and high visibility. The convention planner has
the opportunity either to upset the plans of thousands of people and lose millions of
dollars for an organization or to make thousands of people feel that their time and money
were well spent. To accomplish these things we need to have good communication skills
and good judgment.

                                                  Task 3
     Enhance individual competence by increasing and applying professional knowledge
     to improve services.

     This area of professional responsibility involves understanding your personal
strengths and weaknesses. For this you will need to have a good knowledge of yourself
and make a plan to improve yourself. As project manager you have the responsibility to
improve your competencies. To do this you must also have knowledge of methods of
personal evaluation. As in modern quality management, it is not the large improvements
to our knowledge that are so important, but it is the small increases in our knowledge
and capability over the years that will truly improve our value to ourselves and others.
     A project manager should do a self-assessment periodically and develop a plan to
reach goals for self-improvement and professional competence.


                                                    Task 4
      Balance stakeholders' interests by recommending approaches that strive for fair reso-
      lution in order to satisfy competing needs and objectives.

      In the development of any project, one of the most important things that we must
do is to accomplish the scope of the project. We have a professional responsibility to
make sure that each of the agreed upon stakeholder's needs is met by the completion of
the project. We must also take the responsibility of making the stakeholder aware that
there may be better and less expensive ways of solving the same problem than how the
stakeholder may have suggested doing it. It is an important responsibility of the project
manager and the project team to consider all reasonable alternatives as possible solutions
to project problems or as possible ways of achieving project goals.
      To be able to do this properly we must be aware of the stakeholder's business and
interests. In Chapter 7, Risk Management, we discussed stakeholder tolerance, which is
the level of risk that the stakeholder is willing to take in the project. It is important that
the project manager be able to assess the risk tolerance of the stakeholder so that the
proper risk management plan can be worked out.
      The stakeholder also must be considered in many other areas of project development
as well as in risk management. The project manager and the project team probably know
more about the current technology that the project will use. The project team then has a
responsibility to keep the stakeholder informed about changes in technology that may
affect the project, even if delays and changes in budget are necessary to use the new
technology.
      In all projects there will be conflicts that arise between participants. In the world of
changing needs and expectations, conflicts will need to be resolved. Knowledge of the
conflict resolution techniques, discussed in Chapter 5, Human Resources Management,
is also the responsibility of the project manager. Negotiating and communications skills
serve the project manager well in this area.

 Professional Responsibility                                                             211




                                                  Task 5

     Interact with team and stakeholders in a professional and cooperative manner by
     respecting personal, ethnic, and cultural differences in order to ensure a collaborative
     project management environment.

      The project manager needs to ensure that the project team functions without preju-
dice. Today, many companies and projects are international in nature. Not many compa-
nies can afford to run their business without concern for foreign competition and
customers. For example, software development contracts are now negotiated in different
countries, and the Internet is making us all into one community.
      We must be very watchful that we consider the cultural and ethnic differences of
our project team and our customers as well. To do this we have to have a thorough
knowledge of communications and make a sincere effort to understand the norms of our
team and stakeholders. This involves choosing the appropriate communication channels
and considering all of the filters and inhibitors that are involved.
      It is easy to make mistakes and appear to be uncooperative. A responsible project
manager must be able to exercise self-control in situations that involve people with differ-
ent ethnic and cultural backgrounds. I teach project management around the world, and
there have been many times when I have had to forget the practices that I'm used to
and adjust my sensibilities and feelings to the surroundings rather than try to make the
surroundings conform to my feelings.
      Communication with people for whom English is not the first language is always
going to present problems, but if you take the time to learn how to say ``good morning,''
``please,'' and ``thank you,'' you will go far in developing good relations. The technique
of speaking louder to someone who does not speak English is not going to improve
understanding.



                        Code of Professional Conduct
It is essential that project management professionals conduct their work in an ethical
and legal manner. Without this, team members, customers, colleagues, employees, and
stakeholders will have no confidence in a project manager's ability to report on progress
or any other aspect of the project. Trust is an element that must be present for any project
to succeed.
      PMI has instituted the Project Management Code of Professional Conduct in order
to encourage self-discipline in the profession. Project managers are required to report
violations of the PMI Code of Professional Conduct. This has the effect of maintaining




                           ................. 11151$   $CH9   02-09-05 08:07:42   PS             PAGE 211

standards of conduct. All certified project management professionals agree to support the
Code.
      Project management professionals are required by the Code to provide truthful
representation of their business in any advertising or public statements regarding cost of
services, description of services, and expected results. They have a responsibility to satisfy
the scope of the project as agreed upon unless the customer initiates changes. All sensitive
information must remain confidential when it is obtained while carrying out professional
activities.
      Project management professionals must also ensure that there are no conflicts of
interest that may interfere with their judgment. This includes not offering or accepting
gifts for personal gain unless they are in conformance with the laws and customs of the
country in which they take place.
      In managing a project, a project manager takes on the responsibility of providing
qualified professional service. No project manager should take on a project for which he
or she is not qualified. Project managers are required to maintain their level of profes-
sional skills for the types of projects that they are managing. Project managers provide
leadership to ensure that the maximum amount of productivity is achieved. Quality, cost,
and time objectives are to be met as agreed upon.
      A project manager must ensure that the workplace is safe, and that all people work-
ing in the area that is the project's responsibility are protected from danger. Suitable
working conditions must be maintained for the project team and any others in the area
of the project's activity.

                        What Is the PMP Exam Like?



T
        he Project Management Institute (PMI) has constantly improved the PMP exami-
        nation since it was first given and will continue to improve the exam as time goes
        on. April 2002 was significant because of the culmination of several factors that
have had an influence on the PMP examination. The Project Management Professional
(PMP) Role Delineation Study was begun in 1999 to help define the roles and responsibili-
ties of project management professionals. From this knowledge, an examination could be
designed that would truly test the prospective candidates and prove that the candidates
for certification could indeed competently practice the profession of project manager. A
good and content-valid examination for project management professionals cannot be
developed unless the roles of project managers and how they are practiced are clearly
understood.
       In order to accomplish this, PMI hired a company experienced in these things,
Columbia Assessment Services (CAS). The initial development and evaluation was com-
pleted by a panel of thirteen members considered to be subject matter experts in the field
of project management. These members represented a variety of fields of practice, indus-
tries, geographic locations, and, of course, both genders. This panel determined that there
would be six project management domains:

     1.   Initiating
     2.   Planning
     3.   Executing
     4.   Controlling
     5.   Closing
     6.   Professional Responsibility

214                  Preparing for the Project Management Professional Certification Exam



      From each of the domains, a number of tasks were created, and for each of these
tasks, the knowledge and skills required were determined. Once this was done project
managers were surveyed from various age groups, education levels, industries, regions of
the world, levels of experience, and earning levels.
      In the survey, the managers were asked to evaluate the importance of the six domains
on a scale of 1 to 5. The domains were evaluated according to importance, criticality,
and frequency of use. The survey results were then used to determine the number of
questions in each of the domain areas that would be in the examination. The results are
shown in Table 10-1.



                      Domain 1: Initiating the Project
Initiating has ten tasks associated with it. The PMP exam will have seventeen questions
from domain 1.

      Tasks
       1. Two questions. ``Determine project goals by identifying and working with proj-
          ect stakeholders in order to meet their requirements, specifications, and/or ex-
          pectations.''
       2. Two questions. ``Determine product or service deliverables by reviewing or gen-
          erating the scope of work, requirements, and/or specifications to meet the stake-
          holder expectations.''

          appropriate practices, tools, and methodologies to ensure required product/
          service delivery.''
       4. One question. ``Document project constraints through coordination with stake-
          holders and review of policies and procedures to ensure compliance.''
       5. Two questions. ``Document assumptions by determining information that must

                     Types of Questions on the Exam
All of the questions on the PMP exam are multiple choice. There are only four choices
for each question, and there are two hundred questions. This means that you will have
an average of only 1.2 minutes per question. This is not a lot of time, but it is usually
enough, if English is your native language, that is. Otherwise, you may have some prob-
lems with the timing of the exam.
      The best approach to the exam is to go through it rapidly, answering all of the
questions that you are certain about. I can remember doing this on the old PMP exam
and realizing that at the end of the process I was not sure of any of the answers. When
you are done with those, go back and answer the questions that you skipped. This will
take advantage of any information that you can learn as a result of answering the ques-
tions you know. If you definitely know the answer to a question, then you also know
that the other answers are wrong for that question. This information may allow you to
answer a question that you skipped earlier. Be sure to answer every question on the exam.
There is no subtraction for wrong answers. Only the right answers are counted.
      The trend in the PMP examination is to use questions that are ``situational'' in
nature. This means that the questions will be more like the word problems you had in
your high school math classes. Situational questions go something like this: If Joe has
four apples and Sally has three oranges, what time will the train from Chicago meet the
train from New York? This is thought to test the candidate PMP more thoroughly in the
competence of project management and less in the area of rote memorization. This has
been accomplished. While the other project management organizations around the world
may be critical of PMI for not using the interview methods that so many other organiza-
tions favor, PMI has achieved the recognition of the International Organization for Stan-
dardization, ISO 9001: 2000 certification for the process of certifying PMPs. This means
that the process that PMI uses does what it is supposed to do, and it does act to select
project management professionals from those who are not qualified.




                        ................. 11151$   CH10   02-09-05 08:07:47   PS                 PAGE 218
 What Is the PMP Exam Like?                                                               219



      PMI uses the Angoff modified technique for constructing the questions. This means
that a large number of PMPs are used in the process. First, PMPs are trained to write
questions for the exam. These questions are then reviewed by committees of PMPs, after
which they are given to an independent professional who reviews the questions again for
construction and ambiguity.
      Once the questions have been reviewed, they are submitted to another group of
PMPs who are asked to rate the questions in terms of whether they think a question tests
a person seeking the PMP certification who is ``minimally qualified.'' Each question is
evaluated this way.
      Although there is a passing grade for the exam, it is not necessarily going to be the
same from year to year. PMI rates the difficulty of each question on the exam. A mixture
of questions of varying difficulty are then selected so that the difficulty of each version of
the exam is about the same. Each question on the exam is given to a group of PMPs who
are asked the question, ``What is the probability that a minimally acceptable candidate
will answer this question correctly?'' The probabilities are summarized, and each question
receives a difficulty rating. So, if you take the exam with one set of questions and then
take it again a year later with a different set of questions, the difficulty rating for the
whole exam should be about the same, even though you have a different set of questions.
The passing grade for each exam should be about the same as well, but this is not
necessarily the case.
      The questions fall into three categories. ``Recall questions'' are similar to what most
of the questions on the PMP exam used to be like. These questions give you a definition
and then different items, one of which is the item whose definition was stated. The
``application questions'' ask you to pick out what a project manager should do under the
situation described. The ``analysis questions'' require you to take the information offered
and, by looking at the relationships among the various pieces of information, come up
with the correct answer.
      You can expect that for most of the questions two of the four answers are easily
discarded, and the remaining two will often be difficult to separate into the right and
wrong answer.



                                     Taking the Exam
The first thing you must do is get a good night's sleep the night before the exam. Don't
eat a lot of sugar the morning of the exam. Eat a good breakfast. Try to do things in the
way that you do them every day. If you are used to drinking coffee, then do not deprive
yourself on the day of the exam.
      Get there in plenty of time to take the exam. If you are using public transportation,
be sure to allow for waiting time for the bus or train. If you are driving, be sure to allow

enough time for traffic delays. You want to be there with enough time to calm yourself
and prepare mentally for what will be a tough four hours. A very good friend of mine
was totally relaxed about the exam. In fact, she was so relaxed that she forgot to go take
it. The proctor phoned her an hour after the exam started and told her that she had not
shown up for the exam. She decided to take the exam and rushed over to the exam site.
Unfortunately, the proctor could not stay, and so she had to take the exam in two-and-
a-half hours instead of four. She passed. But not everyone can do that. Better to be there
early, relax, go over your critical notes, and take the exam in a relaxed manner.
      There is a fifteen minute tutorial before the exam, and there will be some papers to
sign. This activity is not counted as exam time. Take the time to go through the tutorial.
It will stop you from making mistakes with the computer that could lose you valuable
time in the exam. The four-hour exam time is just the time for answering questions on
the exam.
      You are allowed one break during the exam. This break can be up to one hour in
length, and the timing of the exam will stop for the break. Once you are back at the
exam work station, the exam time will continue until the four hours have been completed
or you have finished the exam. When you are finished, the proctor will grade your exam,
and you will be told whether you have passed or not.
      If you are having trouble memorizing formulas and such, my suggestion is to bring
the formulas to the exam written on a card. Before the exam, look over the card and leave
it outside the examination room. You do not want someone to see you inside the room
with something like that. When you get into the exam room, recall the formulas and
write them on the approval scrap paper. This is a good idea if you are a person who has
trouble memorizing things and who when under pressure gets signs and the order of
variables mixed up.



                           Use of Practice Questions
In the last section of the book I have included nearly three hundred practice questions.
Each of these is answered, and the answers are annotated. The questions should give you
a good idea of what the exam will be like. I suggest taking several questions from each
section and trying to answer them in the same amount of time PMI will give you, that
is, 1.2 minutes per question.
      Alternatively, you can take several of the questions and answer them after reviewing
each of the chapters in the book on the subject of the questions. The questions are
organized by the Guide to the PMBOK knowledge areas plus another section for the
professional responsibility questions. The questions are not mixed as they will be on the
actual examination, because I thought it would be more helpful to be able to review at
least some of the questions at the end of each chapter. The questions on the actual exam

will be randomized; if you have just answered a question from the planning domain
about scheduling, the next question may be from any other knowledge area or project
management domain.
      Many people think that the best way to pass the PMP exam is to practice on the
questions from various sources. This has two major problems. One is that the questions
that you are likely to get your hands on are questions that someone other than PMI made
up. These questions will certainly not have the rigorous inspection that PMI has given
the questions on the actual exam. Security around the exam is very tight. None of the
questions that are actually on the exam are likely to come into your hands. Prior to the
changes in the exam effective April 2002, many of the questions on the exam were one-
line type questions. Many of the practice questions you will see are mostly of this type.
Practicing them for the exam will not help you when you take the actual exam. You will
find that the questions on the actual exam are longer and require you to do quite a bit of
analysis and answer the question, ``What would a project manager do in this situation?''
      The second and most important thing is that practicing on the exam questions will
not give you a good knowledge of project management. It will give you only knowledge
of the questions you practice with. PMI has gone to extreme lengths to make the exam
something that will separate project management professionals from those who are not.
This it does very well. It does it well enough that the certification process is itself con-
firmed by the International Organization for Standardization, ISO 9001: 2000. The
exam tests your real knowledge and professionalism. I feel that it actually does a good job
of testing your competence as well.
      The practice questions are a good way to test your knowledge, but I do not think
that they are the only way. A solid understanding of the principles and methods of project
management is extremely important to passing the PMP exam. The use of practice ques-
tions gives you some idea about the style and form of the questions, which is something
you need to know. But using the questions as the principal way of preparing for the exam
is a serious mistake and will generally earn you a failing grade.


                  The Application for PMP Certification
I will not go into all six pages of the application form. Most of the form is straightforward
except for the experience section and possibly the education section. For experience you
are required to have 4,500 hours of project management experience over the last six years.
The same process applies to those who do not have a bachelor's or equivalent degree
from a university, only the number of years is increased to eight and the number of hours
is increased to 7,500. There is, of course, some confusion for people from countries other
than the United States. PMI has included in the application a list of the equivalent
degrees that are issued by various countries. If your country is not listed, then you should
contact PMI and ask about the validity of the degree that you have earned.




                           ................. 11151$   CH10   02-09-05 08:07:48   PS             PAGE 221
222                  Preparing for the Project Management Professional Certification Exam



      As part of the experience requirements, the number of nonoverlapping months of
experience must be 36 months for those with a bachelor's degree and 60 months for
those without it. This requirement needs some explanation.
      Let's take our applicant with the bachelor's degree. The requirement is for 36
months' experience over the last six years. During this time you must have accumulated
4,500 hours of experience. The easiest way to see whether you qualify is to make a bar
chart listing the projects you worked on over the last six years. Show each project bar
starting and ending in the month that it started and ended. Of the 72 months in your
bar chart at least 36 months should have one or more projects occupying the month. If
you go from one end of the time scale to the other, and you can count more than 36
months where there is a project that you worked on, you are qualified. Do not count a
month more than once. That is, if you worked on two projects at the same time in a
given month, you can count the month only one time.
      For example, our candidate works on a project from June to November 2002 and
works on another project from August to December 2002. He can count June, July,
August, September, October, November, and December for a total of seven months of
experience. August, September, October, and November should not be counted two
times even though two projects were being worked on at that time.
      Be careful that the hours of experience you claim match the start and finish dates of
the projects they come from. Do not say you worked on a project for three months and
claim 1,000 hours. Even the best of us would have trouble accumulating 1,000 hours of
experience in thirteen weeks, so be careful not to do this. It should be perfectly clear to
the PMI reviewer that the experience you claim is indeed matched to the projects.
      PMI also requires that you separate the experience into the project management
process areas. There is really no requirement for this, and you could have all your experi-
ence in the project execution area and still qualify. I don't know why PMI requires you
to separate your experience hours into the process areas, but as long as it does, you should
separate them as instructed. Be careful that the totals also equal the number of hours that
you have put on the other pages.
      If you fill out the experience sheets of the application carefully, your application
should be accepted. By no means should you lie on the application. If you do not have
enough experience, then you will have to wait to get your PMP certification.
      The last sheet for each project is an explanation of your experience on the project.
You should list the deliverables that you were responsible for on the project in some
detail. One page should be sufficient for each project. Be sure that the deliverables that
you are explaining match the type and hours of experience that you have put on the
previous page.
      This is the only section of the application that is tedious. You must fill out two
sheets minimum for each project you have worked on. For some of you this could be a
lot of projects. Take the time and be careful. Put yourself in the mind of the reviewer.

Make the whole application consistent, and be sure that all the hours add up to the same
totals. Make sure that your narrative on each project matches and supports the number
of hours you are claiming in each domain.


                        The Education Qualification
There is now a requirement that you receive thirty-five contact hours of project manage-
ment education. This requirement is relatively simple to achieve. These can be classes
that you take at a university, courses taught by training companies or consultants, or
courses from a registered education provider or any PMI component (chapter). They can
even be courses offered by your own company or distance learning courses. This is a
pretty broad classification. The timing of the education has no limits, so you can claim
the hours going back in time as far as you wish.
     The following is PMI's checklist for the PMP application:

     * Name on application matches name on ID (two required)
     * Payment or payment information
     * Experience verification goes back more than three years
     * Experience verification does not go back more than six years
     * Experience verification includes more than 4,500 hours involved with project
       management
     * Experience verification includes 36 months total
     * Deliverables from each project are summarized
     * There are 35 hours of documented project management instruction


                                          Joining PMI
Today the cost of joining PMI and becoming a PMP are very close to the same as
becoming a PMP without joining PMI. The benefits of joining PMI are tremendous for
the money. Beside being able to network with other PMI members and having the many
publications that will be delivered to you, you will be part of an organization of project
management practitioners that has grown to nearly 100,000 worldwide.
     Here is a list of just a few of the benefits that come to you as a PMI member:

     *   Discounts on many items
     *   PMI Knowledge and Wisdom Center
     *   Project management publications
     *   PM Network--monthly

      *   Project Management Journal --quarterly
      *   PMI Today--monthly
      *   PMI bookstore
      *   Networking
      *   PMI conferences
      *   Specific interest groups
      *   PMI chapters
      *   Career hotline for job searches


                                          Recertification
To be qualified for recertification you must accumulate sixty professional development
units (PDUs) over a three-year period. A PDU is equivalent to one hour of contact time
in a class on project management offered by a registered education provider. There are
also many other ways to acquire PDUs. The different ways of acquiring PDUs will take
too much space to review here, but after you have acquired your PMP certification you
will have three years or more to accumulate these PDUs. You are able to earn PDUs for
attending classes, writing a book or an article on project management, presenting a paper
on project management, and many other items outlined in the professional development
section of PMI's Web site at www.pmi.org. The timing of the three years starts on January
1 of the January following your certification, so the first time you requalify, you may
really have more than three years' time to accumulate enough PDUs.

that must be done is to do a justification for the project. Since very little information is
known about the project, the estimates are considered to be rough estimates. The follow-
ing table is the project manager's estimate of the cash flows that will take place over the
next five years.

In a project to install concrete sewer lines there is a lot of uncertainty as to how long the
durations should be for the tasks involved. The project manager has determined that the
team will use the PERT technique to evaluate the project's completion date. The diagram
shows nine activities and the table shows the optimistic, pessimistic, and most likely
estimates that the team has already made.

12. What is the expected value of the number of days to complete the project?
      a.   47.3
      b.   22.0
      c.   32.3
      d.   48

13. It is desirable to make an estimate that has a greater than 95% chance of being
    correct. Which of the following ranges of time for the completion of the project best
    describes this probability of being correct?
      a.   33.31 to 31.36
      b.   34.28 to 30.39
      c.   14.39 to 33.48

16. The project manager decided to improve the predicted completion date for the
    project by doing in parallel several of the activities that were scheduled to be done
    in sequence. This is called:
    a.   Crashing.
    b.   Increasing priorities.

    approved changes, is called:
    a.   The working schedule.
    b.   The target schedule.
    c.   The performance schedule.
    d.   The baseline schedule.

19. Schedules are used in many ways. In a project to build a bridge the project manager
    wants to use a tool that will show the scheduled activities in such a way that it is
    easy to see when each activity starts and finishes and which activities are taking place
    at the same time. Which tool should be used?
    a. PERT chart
    b. Gantt chart

    c. Monte Carlo analysis
    d. Critical path method

25. The main difference between the two types (ADM, arrow diagramming method,
    and PDM, precedence diagramming method) of the critical path method (CPM) of
    scheduling is:
    a. Placement of the activity on the logic diagram line.
    b. Arrow diagramming method (ADM) is a deterministic method, whereas the pre-
       cedence diagramming method (PDM) is a probabilistic method.
    c. Precedence diagramming method (PDM) is a deterministic method, whereas the
       arrow diagramming method (ADM) is a probabilistic method.
    d. Precedence diagramming method (PDM) is a more accurate method.

26. The project schedule is not used to determine:
    a.   The start and finish dates of the activities.
    b.   Occasional changes to the activity listing.
    c.   The total float of the activities.

    d.   Using the arrow diagramming method instead of the precedence diagramming
         method (PDM) of scheduling.

28. The program evaluation and review technique (PERT) method of scheduling differs
    from the critical path method (CPM) because the PERT method:
    a.   Uses weighted averages of activity durations to calculate project duration.
    b.   Uses ``dummy'' activities to represent logic ties.
    c.   Uses ``free float'' instead of ``total float'' in the schedule calculations.
    d.   Uses bar charts instead of logic diagrams to portray the schedule.

29. A project manager is managing a project and is considering the reschedule of an
    activity because one of the project engineers must work on this activity and another
    activity at the same time. Each of the activities is scheduled to have a duration of
    two weeks. One of the activities is on the critical path and the other activity has
    eighteen days of free float. The project manager should:

      d.   Reschedule both activities to take advantage of the float on each.

30. A project manager looks at her schedule and sees that there has been a delay in
    completing a task. It seems practical to move a person from another task who is an
    expert on the work that is behind. There is a choice of using two different persons
    who are working on two different tasks. One person is working on a task that has
    five days of free float and the other is working on a task that has eight days of total
    float and no free float. Which person should be used to help out?
      a.   The person working on the task with free float of five days.
      b.   The person working on the task with total float of eight days.
      c.   Either person can be used.
      d.   A person should be brought in from outside the project.

    from the contingency fund and add the activities necessary to deal with the problems
    associated with the risk. What should he do next?
      a. The schedule should not be changed. Original plans should have allowed for this
         delay.

    c.   The project network diagram, constraints, and durations.
    d.   The work breakdown structure, the scope statement, and historical information
         that supports the applicable activity.

35. A project manager is approached by the major stakeholder in the project and is asked
    to reduce the time for the scheduled completion of the project. The project manager
    reviews the project plans and the progress that has been made on the project. He or
    she decides that the best approach to solving this problem is to fast track the project
    until the new project completion date can be achieved. Which of the following will
    be done by the project manager?
    a. Reduce the project schedule by any means that are possible
    b. Reduce the project schedule by applying any practical means necessary
    c. Reschedule activities that would be done in sequence to activities that can be
       done in parallel
    d. Inform the stakeholder that this will change the project schedule and will require
       additional funds to comply with the request

36. A project manager would like to manage his project in such a way that he will be
    able to identify specific tasks that should be watched and managed more closely than
    others. The project manager should use which method?

    b.   The critical path method
    c.   The GERT method
    d.   The PCDM method

   was undertaken include all activities of the overall management function that deter-
   mines the quality policy, objectives, and responsibilities and implements them by
   means such as quality planning, quality control, quality assurance, and quality im-
   provement, within the quality system. This is called:
   a.   Quality assurance.
   b.   Quality control.
   c.   Quality planning.
   d.   Quality management.

                                                      RISK MANAGEMENT



1. A project manager discovers that there is a part of the project that contains some
   risk. His strategy with this risk is to subcontract the work to an outside supplier by
   using a firm fixed-price contract. Which of the following must the project manager
   do?
   a. The project manager should make certain that the project team does not reveal
      the risk to the supplier until the contract is signed.
   b. The project manager should make every effort to make sure that the supplier is
      made aware of the risk after the contract is signed.
   c. The project manager should make sure that the supplier understands the risk
      before the contract is signed.
   d. The project manager should assign a member of the project team to monitor the
      activity of the supplier to make sure that the supplier deals with the risk properly
      if it occurs.

2. A project manager is faced with making a decision about a risk that the team has
   identified. The risk involves the design of a bicycle. It has been found that the neck
   of the bicycle, where the steering bearing is located and the two supporting bars of
   the frame come together, will corrode in a high salt environment. If this takes place
   the neck may fail and injure the rider. The project team decides that the design of
   the bicycle should be modified by using corrosion resistant materials in the design
   of the neck. This will eliminate the risk from consideration. This technique is called:
   a.   Risk avoidance.
   b.   Risk acceptance.
   c.   Risk rejection.
   d.   Risk deflection.

3. A problem occurs in the design of a grocery cart. In this case it is determined that
   the wheels will wear out much quicker in areas of heavy snow and ice because the
   salt will corrode the wheel bearings. Using sealed bearing wheels will significantly
   increase cost, and it is determined that the carts themselves will be rusty and dam-
   aged at about the same time the wheel bearings begin to fail. By injecting the wheel
   bearings with a high temperature grease the life of the wheel bearings is increased

                  PROFESSIONAL RESPONSIBILITY


1. You are a project manager working on a project to market a new product. The
   deliverables of the project have been established, and the project work has begun. A
   contract to deliver the deliverables has been signed. The customer who has signed
   the contract has telephoned you to request additional work to be done on the proj-
   ect. This work will affect the budget but not the schedule of the project. This project
   has a high priority with your company. What should you do next?
   a. Do what the customer asks you to do and add the additional requirements to the
      original contract.
   b. Refuse the request and send a memo to your management explaining the situa-
      tion.
   c. Respond to the customer's request by explaining the change procedure and ask-
      ing that he or she submit a request for change.
   d. Arrange to meet with the project team to discuss this change.

2. You are the project manager for a high visibility project. The margin on this project
   is low, and it is extremely important that the cost estimates for the work on the
   project be accurate. While reviewing the cost estimates for this project you notice
   that one of the cost estimates for an element in the WBS is 10% higher than two
   previous projects for very similar work. What should you do?
   a. Accept the estimate because you trust all of the people on your project team, and
      they are responsible for estimates.
   b. Reduce the estimate and add the additional budget to the management reserve.
   c. Ask the person responsible for the estimate to explain the difference and bring
      supporting information to you.
   d. Reduce the estimate and add the additional budget to the contingency reserve.

3. You are managing a project in a foreign country. In this country there is a normal
   practice for businesspeople to exchange gifts when very large contracts, such as the
   one you are working on, are signed. The gift is of a greater value than your com-
   pany's policy for gift exchange will allow. You have given a gift of similar value to
   the customer's representative already. What should you do?
   a. Take the gift.

                                                  SCOPE MANAGEMENT



1. Answer: b
   Scope definition is defined by PMI as ``decomposing the major deliverables into smaller,
   more manageable components to provide better control.''

2. Answer: a
   The chart of accounts is the system used to monitor project costs as defined by PMI.

3. Answer: c
   A stakeholder is an individual or organization that is involved in or may be affected by project
   activities.

4. Answer: c
   The actual payback period is between two years and three years. It is the point where the net
   or cumulative cash flows equal zero. This occurs between year 2 and 3 and is 2 and 29/30 of
   a year from the first cash flow. Cumulative cash flow in years are: 1, 500,000; 2,
   290,000; 3, 10,000.

5. Answer: b
   The net cash flow is the total of all the cash flows in and out of the company caused by the
   project. In this example 850,000 in and 900,000 out for a negative 50,000.

6. Answer: b
   Calculating the net present value of the cash flows for the project involves adjusting the future
   cash flows to allow for diminishing value due to the time that we must wait to get them.
   Money received today is more valuable to us than money that is received in the future.

7. Answer: c
   From the Guide to the PMBOK 2000: ``Program. A group of related projects managed in a
   coordinated way. Programs usually include an element of ongoing activity.''

8. Answer: d
   Most of the project money will be spent during the execution phase. At the beginning of
   execution the rate of expenditures rises as people and materials are brought into the project.

      Later the expenditures peak and slow down. By the end of the execution phase expenditures
      are approaching a minimum.

      From the Guide to the PMBOK 2000: ``Project. A temporary endeavor undertaken to create
      a new product or service.''

10. Answer: c
      A statement of work is the description of what the project is about and what will be delivered.
      The project plan is complete and contains the detailed work that the project will do, complete
      with task descriptions and schedule, cost, and scope baselines containing a real schedule and
      budget. An exception report describes items that are not as planned and a Pareto analysis is a
      quality management tool used to prioritize defects according to those most frequently occur-
      ring.

11. Answer: a
      Verifying scope is the process of verifying that the project made or delivered is what was asked
      for.

12. Answer: d
      In management by objectives, the employee and supervisor meet to discuss the objectives of
      the employee over the next review period. At the end of the review period the performance
      of the employee is reviewed relative to the objectives, and adjustments are made. This is
      generally considered a good approach for project managers to use when managing the project
      team. In many cases the review period is as little as two weeks.

13. Answer: c
      Configuration management is the process of making sure that the product meets the design
      criteria in terms of form, fit, and function.

14. Answer: c
      The project charter is one of the first things that must be done in any project. The project
      charter according to the Guide to the PMBOK 2000 is: ``A document issued by senior manage-
      ment that provides the project manager with the authority to apply organizational resources
      to project activities.''

15. Answer: c
      In the work breakdown structure the lowest level of breakdown is the work package. This
      does not mean that work cannot be divided any further. Work packages are usually broken

    down into tasks, and tasks can be further broken down into activities. The point here is that
    the project manager is concerned about things down to the work package level. In a relatively
    large project the project manager would have subproject managers or work package managers
    who would further breakdown the work in their own work breakdown structures.

16. Answer: c
    The current project baseline for scope includes the original scope of the project plus or minus
    any scope changes that have taken place since the baseline for scope was established.

17. Answer: c
    A project charter is a document that formally recognizes the existence of a project. It should
    include, either directly or by reference to other documents, the business need that the project
    was undertaken to address and the product description.

18. Answer: b
    The work breakdown structure represents all the work that must be done in order to complete
    the project. Doing all the work will deliver all the tangible results to the client. In most
    projects there will also be deliverables that will be delivered to other stakeholders. Work that
    is done by contractors and those not on the project team is included in the WBS. The lowest
    level of the WBS is the work package (according to PMI). Work packages can be broken
    down into tasks, and tasks can be broken down into activities.

19. Answer: d
    A program manager is a manager who manages a group of related projects in a coordinated
    way.

20. Answer: b
    A work breakdown structure is a deliverable-oriented grouping of project elements that orga-
    nizes and defines the total scope of the project: Work not in the WBS is outside the scope of
    the project. Although the WBS can and is used for many other project-related things, the
    best answer is b, since it is the most comprehensive answer.

21. Answer: c
    The execution phase of projects will nearly always cost the bulk of the project budget. This
    is because there are more people working on the project, and they are spending more money
    than at other times.

22. Answer: a
    Progress reports should be used even on the smallest of projects. They allow all of the stake-
    holders to judge the performance and progress of the project according to the project plan.

      It is not necessary to use the earned value reporting system. The overhead of using a formal
      reporting system may not be justified on very small projects. Reporting may frequently be
      delegated to someone on the project team or even a member of the project management
      support office.

23. Answer: b
      This is the definition of a project.

24. Answer: c
      The project charter is the first document to be created in the project. It gives the project
      manager the authority to manage the project. It will frequently contain a business case and a
      set of goals and objectives for the project as well.

25. Answer: c
      Balance is the strength or weakness of the project manager to have authority over the people
      who actually do the work in the project. In the projectized organization the project manager
      has complete authority over the people on the project team. In the strong matrix organization
      the project manager has more influence over the people on the project team than the func-
      tional manager. In the weak matrix organization the functional manager has more authority
      to direct the project team members than the project manager. In a balanced matrix organiza-
      tion the project manager and the functional manager are at about the same authority level.

26. Answer: c
      In order for the project to have a 5% probability of being late, there is a 95% probability
      that the project will be delivered on time or earlier. In terms of the PERT calculation this
      means that 2 standard deviations should be added to the expected value date of May 30.
      Since there is a one month difference between the 95% promise date of June 30 and the
      expected value of May 30, the standard deviation must be one-half month. This is a better
      answer than fifteen days because on the basis of a five-day workweek this is close to three
      weeks.

27. Answer: c
      The request for and agreement to a specific date for completion of a particular milestone in
      the project is called a constraint. Constraints for project tasks and activities that do not put
      them on the critical path are not necessarily a problem as long as delays in the schedule do
      not ultimately place them on the critical path. Some process constraints may be predefined
      as constraints. For example, management may specify a target completion date rather than
      allowing it to be determined by the planning process. Constraints are factors that will limit
      the project management team's options. For example, a predefined budget is a constraint that
      is highly likely to limit the team's options regarding scope, staffing, and schedule.

28. Answer: d
    The current budget of the project contains all of the authorized funding for the project
    including additions to the project since the setting of the original baselines. This includes any
    and all authorized work done on the project, including the investigation of work that may be

29. Answer: d
    The project manager will normally break the WBS down to the work package level. Work
    packages can be broken down further into tasks and activities.

30. Answer: b
    It is generally accepted that for most projects, once a project's definitive estimate has been
    completed, the actual project cost will be not more than 5% below the definitive estimate
    and not more than 10% above it.

31. Answer: a
    The change management plan is generally a document or procedure that is normally found
    in the scope management plan.

32. Answer: a
    The client should pay, because the signing of the WBS constituted an agreement between
    the company managing the project and the client. Work that is not specified in the WBS is
    not part of the project scope. In reality this is sometimes not the case. Companies will fre-
    quently do work that is outside of the project scope as defined by the WBS in order to ensure
    the goodwill of the client.

33. Answer: b
    The calculation for net present value is based on the compound interest formula.

    FV  PV ( 1 r )n
    Where FV is future value and PV is present value.
        Solving this for the present value gives:
    PV  FV / (1 r )n
    NPV  50,000  (100,000 / 1.1 )  40,909
    Note that all the negative cash flows occur at the beginning of the year when the machine is
    purchased and that the positive cash flows all occur at the end of one year.

34. Answer: b
      The precedence network diagramming tool is used because it best shows the logical relation-
      ships between the activities in the schedule. The Gantt chart shows the project schedule
      graphically indicating the start and finish for each activity. The milestone chart shows the
      start or completion for specific groups of activities on a summarized chart.

                                                         TIME MANAGEMENT



Answers to the following questions can be found in Chapter 2, ``Time Management,'' unless
otherwise noted.

 1. Answer: b
     Note that activities in a calendar schedule start on the beginning of the time period that they
     start on and end at the end of the time period that they finish on. A two-day activity starts
     on May 5 and ends on May 6, ES and EF.

 2. Answer: b
     The free float or slack is the amount of time that an activity can be delayed before it affects
     the schedule of any other activity. Activity F has free float but activity D does not. Both have
     seven days of float, total float, or plain old float. When calculating schedules and float with
     leads and lags, it is best to look at the next activity with no lead or lag and, after determining
     the dates, change them by the amount of the lead or lag.

3.   Answer: d
     The free float or slack is the amount of time that an activity can be delayed before it affects
     the schedule of any other activity. Activity F has free float but activity D does not. Both have
     seven days of float, total float, or plain old float.

4.   Answer: a
     Critical path is the list of activities that have zero total float. It is dangerous to find the path
     that has the longest sum of the durations. Path A B D F H has a duration of eight days but
     has a sum of the durations of ten days.

5.   Answer: c
     The late start for activity F is May 12. It has a late start that is calculated to be two days
     before the late finish of activity D. With leads and lags it is best to calculate the LS of the
     dependent activity, then the LF of the independent activity, and then adjust the LF of the
     independent activity to consider the FS lead.

6.   Answer: b
     The first work of the project is done on May 1, and the last work of the project is finished
     on May 20.

7.    Answer: c
      There is a lead of two days associated with the finish-start relationship between activities D
      and F. If the relationship were a normal FS relationship, the ES of activity F would be May
      7. A two-day lead means it will start two days earlier, or May 5.

8.    Answer: b
      Since activity F has seven days of float it can be delayed for as much as seven days before it
      has any effect on the project completion.

9.    Answer: a
      The early finish date of activity A is the same as its start date and the start of the project.
      Activities start on the beginning of the time period that work begins and end on the end of
      the time period that work finishes. This activity takes one day beginning in the morning of
      May 1 and finishing in the afternoon of May 1.

10. Answer: c
      The figure is called a precedence diagram. It is recognizable because boxes are used to indicate
      the activities. The arrows in a precedence diagram indicate the logical relationship between
      the activities. The information about the activity is inside or around the box. An activity on
      arrow diagram will use circles to indicate events and the activity information will be put on
      the arrows. The Gantt chart has no logic shown normally (now available on some project
      management software). The length of the Gantt bar is proportional to a time scale showing
      the duration of the activity. Although this diagram is also a network diagram, there are many
      other network diagrams in the world. Precedence diagram is a much better answer.

11. Answer: a
      The finish-finish relationship in a precedence diagram says that the independent activity must
      finish before the dependent activity is permitted to finish. In the schedule, if the turkey took
      five hours to roast and the sweet potatoes took one hour, the turkey would be scheduled to
      start at 1:00 P.M. and the sweet potatoes would be scheduled to start at 5:00 P.M. Both would
      finish at 6:00 P.M.

12. Answer: c
    The expected value of the project is the expected value of each of the tasks that are on the
    critical path, A C E H I. The approximate expected value is the sum of each of these task's
    optimistic, pessimistic, and four times the most likely estimate divided by 6. When calculating
    the length of time that the project takes, it is important that you remember to include only
    the critical path activities. Other activities in the schedule are done in parallel with the critical
    path activities.

13. Answer: b
    The 95% probability of the estimate is the expected value           2 standard deviations of the
    total standard deviation of the critical path items. To total the standard deviation, first square
    the value for each critical path item's standard deviation, add them up, and take the square
    root of the total.

14. Answer: b
    The expected value for activity B is the sum of the optimistic, pessimistic, and four times the
    most likely value, all divided by 6.

15. Answer: c
    The standard deviation for activity B is the difference between the optimistic estimate and
    the pessimistic estimate divided by 6.

16. Answer: d
    Fast tracking a schedule is finding activities that can be done in parallel that were originally
    scheduled to be done in sequence.

17. Answer: a
    Crashing a schedule is improving the project completion date by any means that is economi-
    cal and feasible. In crashing a schedule an effort is made to find the largest schedule reduction
    for the least additional cost.

18. Answer: d
    The baseline schedule as well as the baseline budget and the baseline scope are the original
    project plans plus or minus any approved changes. There are many other terms used to

      describe schedules, but the definition given is the definition of the baseline schedule and
      therefore the best answer.

19. Answer: b
      Bar charts, also called Gantt charts, show activity start and end dates as well as expected
      durations, but do not usually show dependencies. They are relatively easy to read and are
      frequently used in management presentations. In a Gantt chart there is a horizontal time
      scale. Activities are represented as bars above the time scale in such a way that the length of
      the bar is proportional to the elapsed time of the activity. The start of the activity is on the
      left side of the bar and is above the date that it starts. The right-hand side of the bar is located
      over the finish of the activity.

20. Answer: c
      The critical path activities are those activities that have zero float. There are exceptions. When
      activities are forced to be done on specific dates (date constraints), it is possible to create
      negative float. When the project is resource constrained the critical path may change due to
      resource constraints.

21. Answer: c
      Resource leveling is a tool in most project management software and can also be done manu-
      ally. In resource leveling an attempt is made to reduce overutilization of resources to their
      normal utilization.

22. Answer: b
      At the end of two weeks this task is 75% complete. The PV was to be 4 person-weeks, two
      people working full time for two weeks. The EV is therefore 3 person-weeks, .75  4. The
      AC is 2 person-weeks. The cost performance index is the EV / AC. CPI  3 person-weeks /
      2 person-weeks  1.5.

23. Answer: b
      Although total float is assigned to each of the tasks in the sequence, the total float can be
      used by any of them and it can be used only one time by any of them. If the tasks are A B C
      D E and each has one day of float, if A is delayed by one day, the total float at B C D E
      reduces to zero.

24. Answer: c
      Monte Carlo analysis is a simulation technique that assigns durations to tasks in a schedule
      and then calculates the schedule information. It repeats this assignment and calculation many
      times and then reports statistical results, including the percent of time a task is on the critical
      path.

25. Answer: a
    Precedence diagramming method (PDM). This is a method of constructing a project network
    diagram using nodes to represent the activities and connecting them with arrows that show
    the dependencies. This technique is also called activity-on-node (AON) and is the method
    used by nearly all project management software packages.
    Arrow diagramming method (ADM). This is a method of constructing a project network
    diagram using arrows to represent the activities and connecting them at nodes to show the
    dependencies. This technique is also called activity-on-arrow (AOA) and, although less preva-
    lent than PDM, is still the technique of choice in some application areas.

26. Answer: d
    The project schedule includes at least planned start and expected finish dates for each detail
    activity. A schedule update is any modification to the schedule information that is used to
    manage the project. Float is the amount of time that an activity may be delayed from its start
    without delaying the project finish date. Although the project's budget is the time phased
    expenditure of the project funds, it is not the project schedule and therefore the best answer.

27. Answer: d
    Mandatory dependencies are those which are inherent in the nature of the work being done.
    Discretionary dependencies are those which are defined by the project management team.
    They should be used with care (and fully documented) since they may limit later scheduling
    options.
    Resource requirements. The resources assigned to them will significantly influence the dura-
    tion of most activities and the project itself.
    Resource capabilities. The duration of most activities will be significantly influenced by the
    capabilities of the humans and material resources assigned to them.

28. Answer: a
    Critical path method (CPM) calculates a single, deterministic early and late start and finish
    date for each activity based on specified, sequential network logic and a single duration esti-
    mate. Program evaluation and review technique (PERT) uses sequential network logic and a
    weighted average duration estimate to calculate project duration. Although there are surface
    differences, PERT differs from CPM primarily in that it uses the distribution's mean (ex-
    pected value) instead of the most likely estimate originally used in CPM and associates the
    standard deviation of the estimate to allow the range of values and a probability of occurrence
    to be calculated for the project.

29. Answer: b
    The activity that has eighteen days of free float can be rescheduled without having to resched-
    ule any other activity in the project. If this activity is rescheduled to start two weeks later, the
    resource will not be overutilized, and the project will remain on schedule.

30. Answer: a
      The person who is working on the task that has free float of five days can be used on the task
      that is in trouble for five days without affecting the other task schedules in the project. The
      person working on the task that has total float of eight days can be used on the task that is
      in trouble, but since there is zero free float for this task, there will have to be a rescheduling
      of other tasks to allow this.

31. Answer: c
      The logical analysis of the schedule often produces a preliminary schedule that requires more
      resources during certain time periods than are available, or requires changes in resource levels
      that are not manageable. Heuristics such as ``allocate scarce resources to critical path activities
      first'' can be applied to develop a schedule that reflects such constraints. Resource leveling,
      because of the limited availability of the resources, often results in a project duration that is
      longer than the preliminary schedule.

32. Answer: b
      The Guide to the PMBOK defines the lowest level of the work breakdown structure as the
      work package. It goes on to say that the work package is a unit of work that can be assigned
      to a person or organization. It also says that the work package can be broken down into tasks,
      and that tasks can be broken down into activities.

33. Answer: c
      When a risk is identified, budget and schedule time are identified and put into the contin-
      gency reserve. If the risk actually occurs the money is used from the contingency reserve and
      added to the operating budget of the project. The total project budget contains the operating
      project budget or baseline, contingency reserve, and the management reserve. The project
      budget baseline is increased by the amount of the risk although the total project budget stays
      the same. The schedule baseline is changed to reflect the new activities that have to be done.

34. Answer: d
      The Guide to the PMBOK gives the following as inputs to the activity definition:
      * Work breakdown structure
      * Scope statement
      * Historical information
      * Constraints
      * Assumptions

35. Answer: c
      Fast tracking a project means that project tasks and activities are rescheduled from being done
      in sequence to being done in parallel. Crashing a project means doing anything practical that

    can be done to reduce the schedule. Fast tracking involves only doing things in parallel that
    would have otherwise been done in sequence.

36. Answer: b
    The CPM or critical path method is used to determine the activities that have zero float or
    close to zero float. These activities should be managed more carefully than other activities in
    the schedule since other activities not on the critical path will have free float and total float
    that allows their schedules to be more flexible.

37. Answer: c
    PERT stands for program evaluation and review technique. In PERT each of the activities
    has the optimistic, pessimistic, and most likely duration estimated. A weighted average is then
    taken to estimate the expected value of the activity. The weighted average is calculated by
    adding the optimistic, pessimistic, and four times the most likely duration and dividing by 6.
    The standard deviation of the activity can also be calculated by subtracting the optimistic
    duration from the pessimistic duration and dividing by 6.

38. Answer: d
    In the PERT calculation the standard deviation is calculated by squaring the standard devia-
    tion for each of the activities on the critical path of the project, adding them together, and
    then taking the square root. This is the standard deviation of the project. Plus or minus two
    standard deviations from the expected value of the project duration will have a range of values
    such that the project has a 95% probability of actually finishing within the dates calculated.

39. Answer: a
    PERT is a probabilistic method used to determine the estimated project completion based
    on the statistical estimating of the project durations. CPM is a deterministic method using
    specific values for activity and task durations.

40. Answer: c
    The Guide to the PMBOK defines the lowest level of the work breakdown structure as the

    be broken down into activities.

 COST MANAGEMENT



1. Answer: c
   Both the cost and accuracy of parametric models vary widely. They are most likely to be
   reliable when the historical information used to develop the model was accurate, the parame-
   ters used in the model are readily quantifiable, and the model is scalable (i.e., it works as well
   for a very large project as for a very small one).

2. Answer: b
   An analogous estimate is one that is arrived at by taking a project or part of a project that is
   already completed and adjusting the cost on the basis of size.

3. Answer: c
   A bottom-up estimate is a detailed estimate taking into consideration a number of small
   estimates and summarizing them to a total for the project or subproject being estimated. A
   top-down estimate is usually a less accurate method that estimates the cost of the entire
   project by means of parametric, analogous, or some other estimating method.

4. Answer: c
   The management reserve is money that is set aside for dealing with unknown risks. These
   unknown risks cannot be specifically identified. The risks mentioned in the question are
   identified and therefore no money should be put into the management reserve for them.

5. Answer: a
   The contingency reserve is money that is set aside for dealing with known risks. These known
   risks can be specifically identified. The risks mentioned in the question are identified and
   therefore money should be put into the contingency reserve for them. It would not make
   sense to budget for the impact of every risk, since all risks have a probability associated with
   them that means that there is some chance that the impact will not occur; therefore, the
   expected value should be used.

6. Answer: b
   The cost baseline is the time-phased budget for the project. It is usually shown as the PV
   curve on the earned value report and is usually shown as a cumulative value of the project
   budget over time. It will usually have a characteristic ``S'' shape to it. The contingency reserve

    and the management reserve are added to the project budget and baseline when and if they
    are needed to resolve risks that have actually taken place.

 7. Answer: c
    Life cycle costs are those associated with the project during the entire life of the project. These
    costs affect the way we think of the project since a poorly done project may finish below its
    intended budget but result in long-term warranty and repair costs that are greater than the
    money saved.

 8. Answer: c
    The project budget should be increased by $10,000 because the only work actually approved
    at this time is the change notice for the work to be done. If the work done must be undone
    at a later time and additional work is required to do it, another change notice must be
    approved and funding added to the project budget.

 9. Answer: c
    Anything that is done to help bring the project closer to its project plan is called corrective
    action. Updating the budget and revising the cost estimate are possible corrective actions.
    Contingency planning is not used to adjust project performance; it is used to budget money
    for known risks that may occur.

10. Answer: b
    The only reason for changing the project's budget is a change in the project budget baseline.
    This can be brought about by the customer authorizing an addition to the scope of the
    project.

11. Answer: d
    The project is completed when all of the work is done. The EV represents the work that is

    The sum of the years' digits calculation for depreciation is done by summing the digits of each
    of the years of the useful life, 12345678910  55. The digits are
    reversed and divided by the total to get the percent of the value to be taken that year. In the
    third year it would be 8/55.145. The value is the equipment minus the scrap value, or
    $450,000. So we have .145  $450,000  $65,250.

14. Answer: a
      The calculation for the present value is done by consecutively taking the appropriate factor
      from the table and multiplying it by the money flowing for the year. In this example $1,300

      Life cycle costing is a way of including the cost of the project even after delivery to the

16. Answer: b
      The cost performance index is calculated by dividing the EV by AC. CPI  .7 /.9  .777.

17. Answer: a
      The schedule performance index is obtained by dividing the earned value by the planned
      value. SPI  EV / PV; SPI  6,000 / 5,000  1.200.

18. Answer: d
      The BAC or the budget at completion is the sum of the expenditures that are currently
      planned for the project. It is the sum of the EV for each task in the project and will not
      change from week to week unless the budget for any task is changed.

19. Answer: b
      When it is found that work that had been previously credited with its earned value and then
      later it is found that the value of the completed work was not completely delivered, the
      earned value should be reversed from the total earned value. In this case, since the amount of
      undelivered work was identified, only that amount was reversed. If the value missing was not
      identified but the work was shown to be incomplete, the entire earned value of the work
      would be reversed. When the work is finally completed, the earned value is credited to the
      earned value column again.

20. Answer: b
      The cost variance is the earned value minus the actual cost. CV  EV  AC; CV  7,000

22. Answer: c
    The EAC is calculated by dividing the BAC by the CPI for the week being calculated. It is
    the estimated cost of the project that is expected at the end of the project based on what we
    know about cost performance today. EAC  BAC / CPI; EAC  20,000 / .7777  25,740.

23. Answer: b
    The assumption in calculating the EAC by dividing the BAC by the CPI is that the CPI will
    stay the same for the remaining part of the project. The BAC may or may not be different
    by the end of the project but has nothing to do with the CPI and the EAC calculation. The
    BAC will change only if the budget is changed, and this happens only if new work is added
    to or taken from the project baseline. The schedule performance index has nothing to do
    with the EAC calculation.

24. Answer: b
    The estimate to complete is calculated by EAC  EV. It is the difference between the work
    completed, EV, and the estimate of the project at the end of the project. Since the EAC and
    the EV are not choices, we need to look further. The EAC is BAC / CPI. The CPI, EV, and
    the BAC are not offered either. The CPI is EV / AC. Therefore, the three factors needed are
    the BAC, EV, and AC.

25. Answer: c
    The EV should be reduced by the amount of the $4,000 already credited to the earned value
    report for planting the trees. The AC should not be reduced, and since there is no increase
    in budget the PV will not be changed. When the vendor installs the new trees, the $4,000
    will be added to the EV once again.

26. Answer: b
    In learning curve theory, each time a task is done the amount of time and cost involved in
    doing the task decreases. For each doubling of the number of units produced, the cost of
    producing the units decreases by a fixed percentage.

27. Answer: c
    According to learning curve theory, the cost of a unit of production, the software module,
    will decrease by a fixed percentage for each doubling of the units produced. Since from unit
    1 to unit 2 there was a 10% change in cost, the fixed percentage of reduction in cost was
    90%. For unit 4, cost would be 81 person-hours, 90% of 90 person-hours. For unit 8, it
    would be 90% of 81, or 73 person-hours.

    Listings of activities are usually not part of an analogous estimate. In analogous estimates
    large portions of the project are estimated by comparing and scaling similar parts of other
    projects.

29. Answer: c
      The cost baseline is not available when the budget is created, since it is the result of taking
      the completed budget and allocating it over the time of the project. The project budget can
      be calculated without being time phased, but the cost baseline must be time phased.

30. Answer: d
      The programmer will be paid for twenty-six weeks of work. The productivity and utilization
      factors affect the amount of time that someone is paid in comparison to the hours of effort
      required to complete the work. In this case the utilization and productivity are not required
      to calculate the cost: 26 weeks  40 hours per week  $50 per hour  1.3 fringe benefits
       1.5 overhead  $101,400.

31. Answer: b
      To calculate the cost of 100 hours of effort we must adjust for the person's utilization and
      productivity. People of lower productivity take longer to do work and make more mistakes
      but usually cost less since they are usually younger and less experienced. This can often be
      economical. The calculation is 100 hours / .72 / .8  $50 per hour  1.3 fringe benefit 
      1.5 overhead.

32. Answer: b
      Including a contingency budget will set aside money for known, identified risks. This will
      give more control to the project and reduce the problem of known risks using budget that
      was set aside for the work of the project and causing a cost overrun in the project.

33. Answer: c
      The actual payback period is between two years and three years. It is the point where the net
      or cumulative cash flows equal zero. This occurs between year 2 and 3 and is 2 and 29/30 of
      a year from the first cash flow. Cumulative cash flow in years are: 1, 500,000; 2,
      290,000; 3, 10,000.

34. Answer: b
      The net cash flow is the total of all the cash flows in and out of the company caused by the
      project. In this example there was a flow of $850,000 in and $900,000 out for a negative
      $50,000.

35. Answer: b
      Calculating the net present value of the cash flows for the project involves adjusting the future
      cash flows to allow for diminishing value due to the time that we must wait to get them.
      Money received today is more valuable to us than money that will be received in the future.

40. Answer: d

41. Answer: c
    If production were expected to continue for three years, this would mean the production of
    another 36,000 units. This is beyond the breakeven point for the most expensive machine,
    the one representing the $75,000 investment. Beyond the 25,000th unit this is the preferred
    machine to buy.

 QUALITY MANAGEMENT



1. Answer: d
   Project quality management includes the processes required to ensure that the project will
   satisfy the needs for which it was undertaken. It includes ``all activities of the overall manage-
   ment function that determine the quality policy, objectives, and responsibilities and imple-
   ments them by means such as quality planning, quality control, quality assurance, and quality
   improvement, within the quality system.'' (Guide to the PMBOK.)

2. Answer: c
   Projects are typically part of an organization larger than the project--corporations, govern-
   ment agencies, health care institutions, international bodies, professional associations, and
   others.
         Projects are typically authorized as a result of one or more needs. These stimuli may
   also be called problems, opportunities, or business requirements. The central theme of all
   these terms is that management generally must make a decision about how to respond.
         Projects are authorized by upper management, which is responsible for setting strategic
   company goals.

3. Answer: c
   According to Juran and Deming, 85% to 95% of the quality problems that occur in organiza-
   tions are from processes controlled by upper management.

4. Answer: c
   Quality programs save money. Each improvement in quality will yield benefits to the project
   that are in excess of the cost of the implementation and operation.

5. Answer: b
   Experiments are used to determine the impact of the different variables. The design of the
   experiment is a controlled study of the problem. Holding all variables constant and varying
   one of them is sensitivity analysis. The results will show which variable has the most impact

    value, the difference between the highest and lowest value of the dimension in the sampled
    parts.

 7. Answer: c
    This is the Guide to the PMBOK definition for quality. Stated and implied needs are the
    inputs to developing the requirements of the product or output from the project.

 8. Answer: c
    Quality assurance is all the planned and systematic activities implemented within the quality
    system to provide confidence that the project will satisfy the relevant quality standards.

 9. Answer: b
    Quality must be planned into the product, not inspected in. The design and building of the
    product should be such that the quality will be designed or built in rather than expecting the
    inspection of the product to catch the mistakes and defects and rework them into a quality
    product.

10. Answer: c
    Products that are able to perform and function acceptably but are different technically are
    graded into different categories. For example, wood is graded according to the number of
    knots that are present in the wood. The wood performs the function of being structurally
    sound in all grades, but the desirability of knot free wood leads us to higher grades of wood.

11. Answer: c
    A Pareto diagram is a histogram, ordered by frequency of occurrence, that shows how many
    results were generated by type or category of identified cause. By using this tool the manager
    can identify the defects that occurred most often.

12. Answer: c
    This is a check sheet. Check sheets are simple devices that can be used almost anywhere. On
    them you make a mark in the appropriate category. After many marks are made, they can be
    added up to give the number of each defect passing the point.

13. Answer: d.
    Quality management and project management are very concerned about customer satisfac-
    tion.

14. Answer: a
    Common causes are those that are the normal variables produced in the process output when
    the process is operating normally. Special causes are the causes of variability in the process
    when the process is not operating normally.

15. Answer: a.
      Work results, quality checklists, operational definitions, and the management plan are the
      items listed in the Guide to the PMBOK as the inputs to the quality control function.

16. Answer: b
      The averaging of the five parts that are sampled is called the X bar value. In control charts
      the two values that are normally plotted on the control chart are the X bar value and the R
      value, the difference between the highest and lowest value of the dimension in the sampled
      parts.

17. Answer: c
      The diagram the manager is using is a cause and effect diagram, also known as a fishbone
      diagram. These diagrams are often called Ishikawa diagrams as well.

18. Answer: b
      This is an example of variable inspection. If the testing machine had had a light that showed
      green when the parts were acceptable, then it would have been attribute inspection. We don't
      know whether sampling or 100% inspection is taking place.
            A variable is an actual measurement of some characteristic of a part. An attribute is a
      yes or no determination of whether the part is good or bad.

19. Answer: b
      One of the most important things in using control charts is that they not only show when
      the process is out of control but also show when the process is in control and only normal
      variations are taking place. This means that we have a guide that tells us when we should not
      be taking corrective action as well as a guide to tell us when we should take corrective action.

20. Answer: b
      In modern quality management the idea of making small incremental improvements is used
      rather than making up large projects to make giant changes in the operation.

21. Answer: b
      Kaizen means improvement in Japanese. It actually applies to all aspects of life. In terms of
      quality management it means continuing improvement involving everyone, including manag-
      ers and workers alike, from the top to the bottom of the organization.

22. Answer: b
      Cost and delays are reduced, production improves, market share increases, and profits go up.
      Cost to the customer should not go up when quality management is implemented properly.

    The International Standards Organization attempts to ensure consistency in organizations
    that can be relied upon by their customers. To qualify, an organization must meet six require-
    ments regarding the control of documents, control of records, internal audits, control of
    nonconformance, corrective action, and preventive action.

27. Answer: c
    The acceptance costs of quality are the things that must be done to ensure that the quality of
    the product or service is acceptable. This includes the cost associated with inspection and
    reinspection, the cost of the quality plan, quality assurance, and quality management.

28. Answer: a
    The process is not in control. Although the values of X bar are all within the upper and lower
    control limits of the process, there is a trend showing five values in a row all increasing. There
    are several observations on the control chart that can indicate that the process is out of control
    even though the values measured are within the upper and lower control limits.

29. Answer: d
    The Pareto diagram shows a histogram where the defect classes are arranged in the order of

      The sum of the values is 551, which is 55.1 when divided by 10. Since this number is in ten-
      thousandths of an inch, the correct answer is .00551.

      In sampling inspection the ideal operating characteristic curve would correctly pass or reject
      all lots that were below or above the AQL point. Any lot that truly had more than the allowed
      AQL would be rejected, and any lot that had less than or equal to the AQL would be accepted.

35. Answer: a
      When sampling inspection is used, it will discover lots that are above the AQL. These lots
      are then returned for 100% inspection. When the 100% inspection is done, the defective
      parts are removed, and the acceptable ones are sent to the customer. As the number of
      defective parts increases, more lots will have to be inspected 100%. Initially, the quality

    above or below the allowed dimension. It is possible that the average for the rejected parts is
    2.000 inches. The only thing we know for sure is that the part diameters are greater than
    0.000, or they would not exist.

 HUMAN RESOURCES MANAGEMENT



1. Answer: b
   The major advantage of the functional organization over those listed is that the organization
   is quite stable. Project organizations are created and disbanded as the need for them arises.
   Functional organizations are also able to have high levels of expertise in specific skill areas.

      tion--full-time project managers with considerable authority and full-time project adminis-
      trative staff.

13. Answer: c
      Particular attention should be paid to how project team members (individuals or groups) will
      be released when they are no longer needed on the project. Appropriate reassignment proce-
      dures may:
      * Reduce costs by reducing or eliminating the tendency to ``make work'' to fill the time
        between this assignment and the next.
      * Improve morale by reducing or eliminating uncertainty about future employment opportu-
        nities.

14. Answer: d
      The project life cycle defines the beginning and the end of the project. Depending on the
      project life cycle definition, the beginning and ending parts of the project may or may not be
      included in this project. For example, transition at the end of the project to some ongoing
      effort may be part of the project or the ongoing effort.

15. Answer: d
      Projects must often have their own reward and recognition systems since the systems of the
      performing organization may be not appropriate. For example, the willingness to work over-
      time in order to meet an aggressive schedule objective should be rewarded or recognized;
      needing to work overtime as the result of poor planning should not be.

16. Answer: c
      Good listening is an important skill for any manager. One of the ways that you can become
      a skilled listener is by repeating some of the things that are said. Summarizing gives yourself
      and others a repeat of important points and makes the speaker feel more relaxed and in a
      friendly atmosphere.

19. Answer: a
    The project management team must identify the stakeholders, determine what their needs
    and expectations are, and then manage and influence those expectations to ensure a successful
    project. Key stakeholders on every project include:
    * Performing organization--the enterprise whose employees are most directly involved in
      doing the work of the project.
    * Sponsor--the individual or group within the performing organization who provides the
      financial resources, in cash or in kind, for the project.
    * The structure of the performing organization often constrains the availability of resources
      or terms under which they become available to the project. Therefore, commitment of top
      levels of management is important to every aspect of the project.

    The project team kick-off meeting is the first meeting of the project team. It should aim to
    do all of the items mentioned.

21. Answer: b
    Co-location involves placing all, or almost all, of the most active project team members in
    the same physical location to enhance their ability to perform as a team. Co-location is widely
    used on larger projects and can also be effective for smaller projects (e.g., with a ``war room''
    where the team congregates or leaves in-process work items).

    The projectized organization has a very strong project manager because there is little chance
    for the home company organization to be able to correctly judge and make decisions for the

    From the Guide to the PMBOK, project human resource management includes the processes
    required to make the most effective use of the people involved with the project. The following
    are major processes:

      bilities, and reporting relationships.
    * Staff acquisition--getting the human resources needed assigned to and working on the
      project.
    * Team development--developing individual and group skills to enhance project perfor-
      mance.

25. Answer: c
      Team development on a project is often complicated when individual team members are
      accountable to both a functional manager and to the project manager. Effective management
      of this dual reporting relationship is often a critical success factor for the project and is
      generally the responsibility of the project manager.

26. Answer: c
      In a projectized organization, team members are often co-located. Most of the organization's
      resources are involved in project work exclusively for this project, and project managers have
      a great deal of independence and authority. In functional organizations the project manager
      may not exist and therefore little attention is paid to individual projects. In the weak matrix
      organization the project manager is given little authority to get things done and is primarily
      concerned with communication problems with managers who direct the work of people for
      the project.
            In a strong matrix organization the project manager manages the people and usually co-
      locates them at the project's location. This would be the best organization for the situation.

27. Answer: b
      According to McGregor, managers are of two types, theory X and theory Y. Theory X manag-
      ers believe their subordinates to be lazy and irresponsible and will not work unless forced to
      by fear. Theory Y managers think that their people are creative and imaginative and want to
      do good things if only they are given the means to do them.

28. Answer: c
      The functional manager in a balanced matrix organization should be the person responsible
      for the training of the people within his or her organization. It is appropriate for this manager
      to have this responsibility since this manager knows the skills of the people in the functional
      department and knows what training is appropriate for them.

29. Answer: d
      In management by objectives the supervisor and the employee jointly set the objectives for
      the employee over the next time period. The objectives do not necessarily have to be quanti-
      fiable, and the supervisor should not set the objectives for the employee.

30. Answer: b
      In matrix organizations the functional manager is responsible for skills improvement and
      training since the functional manager is the best person to evaluate skills and development
      improvement for the employee. The project manager is more expert in the project work and
      not necessarily the skills of each person on the multifunctional team.

31. Answer: c
    The system that controls the starting of activity on a project is the work authorization system.
    It should be used when it is economical. On large complicated projects the cost of having a
    formal work authorization system may be justified by adding more control. On small projects
    this may not be worthwhile.

32. Answer: d
    These are the process groups that make up the project management processes.

33. Answer: c
    The staffing plan is like the Gantt chart in looks. It has a bar for each person on a time scale,
    showing the length of time and the dates that each person will be working on which specific
    projects.

34. Answer: c
    A project team directory is like a telephone book of the project team. It shows where people
    can be found. This is helpful in matrix organizations because teams are being formed and
    disbanded often, and when they disband, people frequently change their physical locations.

35. Answer: d
    One of the major responsibilities of the functional manager in a matrix organization is to see
    that the right people are in the right place at the right time. Project managers tend to ask for
    the best person for their projects when a lesser skilled person might do the work just as well.

36. Answer: a
    In reward systems it is important that there be a clear connection between the reward and
    the reason that it is being given. Rewards that are distributed to as many people as possible
    lose their motivational effect. To have motivational value, rewards need not be valuable in
    terms of monetary worth. Rewards that are approved by all team members generally end up
    being popularity contests.

37. Answer: b
    When projects are many and resources are few the resources must be shared between projects
    in a sensible way. The matrix management method of organizing allows the sharing of re-
    sources and concentrated focus on different projects.

38. Answer: c
    The disadvantage of using a functional form of organization is that there is considerable
    difficulty for customers to recognize who in the company represents them. This is because as

      the project progresses through the organization of a functionally organized company, the
      person responsible for the project changes.
            Usually communications in a functional organization are good. This is because the
      organization is relatively stable and communications are well established.
            There is no project manager in a functional organization, so there is little problem of
      conflict between project managers and functional managers. If there are project managers,
      they will have little influence in a functional organization.

39. Answer: c
      It is important in reward systems that there be a strong connection between something being
      done that is considered outstanding performance and the reward. Reward systems must be
      explicitly fair to all participants.

40. Answer: c
      A project team organization chart is essential to communicating to others and within the

1. Answer: d
   A communicator can use all three media to communicate.

2. Answer: c
   The project manager has three main reasons for or interests in having good document control:
   effective communications, making sure that all necessary information is distributed and re-
   ceived by all those who need it; ability to reconstruct why certain decisions were made and
   the conditions under which they were made; historical value, so that lessons learned can be
   used in the future on other projects.

3. Answer: d
   From the Guide to the PMBOK 2000:
         ``A communications management plan is a document which provides:
   * A collection and filing structure which details what methods will be used to gather and
     store various types of information. Procedures should also cover collecting and disseminat-
     ing updates and corrections to previously distributed material.
   * A distribution structure which details to whom information (status reports, data, schedule,
     technical documentation, etc.) will be used to distribute various types of information. This
     structure must be compatible with the responsibilities and reporting relationships described
     by the project organization chart.
   * A description of the information to be distributed, including format, content, level of detail,
     and conventions/definitions to be used.
   * Production schedules showing when each type of communication will be produced.
   * Methods for accessing information between scheduled communications.
   * A method for updating and refining the communications management plan as the project
     progresses and develops.''

4. Answer: d

5. Answer: a
   The act of communicating involves an exchange of information between two parties. The
   definition of communications is: An exchange of information between two parties with un-
   derstanding.

 6. Answer: a
      Brainstorming encourages team building if handled properly. Participants feel that they are
      part of the decision making process and have a sense of participation. In the evaluation part
      of brainstorming, the participants' thinking converges to a common agreement.

 7. Answer: c
      The Delphi technique allows participants to be located in different parts of the world. It
      lends itself to using e-mail. In the process, the participants submit their ideas anonymously.
      The facilitator receives the ideas, categorizes them, and returns the list to the participants.

 8. Answer: d
      Clairvoyance would be nice to have in many projects, but it is not practical for general use.

 9. Answer: c
      The situation described is a conflict. As applied to human behavior it is a disagreement
      between individuals, which can vary from a mild disagreement to a win/lose, emotion-packed
      confrontation. There are two basic, but opposing, views of conflict, the traditional and the
      modern. The traditional view sees conflict as being primarily negative. In this view, trouble-
      makers cause conflict and it should be avoided. The manager who views conflict in this way
      avoids admitting that it exists, keeps it under cover, and tries to suppress it. The contemporary
      view sees conflict in a more positive light. According to this view, conflict is inevitable. It is
      a natural result of change and is frequently beneficial to the manager if properly managed. In
      particular, an atmosphere of tension, and hence conflict, is essential in any organization com-
      mitted to developing or working with new ideas, for innovation is simply the process of
      bringing together differing ideas and perspectives into a new and different synthesis.
            In resolving conflict there are several methods: forcing, withdrawal, smoothing, com-
      promise, and problem solving. Of these, problem solving is the best, because the new facts
      allow the two disagreeing parties to resolve their differences with factual information and not
      opinion.

10. Answer: d
      Communication involves at least two people who may have very different backgrounds, expe-
      rience, and education. Many times these individuals come from different cultures, speak
      different languages, and certainly have different drives.

11. Answer: b
      Unless there is reason not to do so, the communication method used to respond to a commu-
      nication should be the same form as the original communication.

12. Answer: c
    The project manager is responsible for the functions of the project team. As such the project
    manager is responsible for the communications that the team must make. The project man-
    ager has a wide range of responsibilities and is responsible for the guidance, motivation,
    output, planning, and control of the project team.

13. Answer: b
    Too many innovative ideas are smothered by negative thinking before they are given any
    chance to prove their worth. It is much easier to think of dozens of reasons why something
    will not work than to figure out how to make it work. People who are prone to this type of
    thinking, particularly if they overdo the ``devil's advocate'' role, will act as communication
    blockers and seriously impede the process of team building. These people announce their
    presence by their typical negative responses when something new is suggested.

14. Answer: d
    The most effective way to communicate is to use several methods of communicating. Each
    method will make some of the message understood, and if all listed were used the level of
    understanding would be the highest.

15. Answer: d
    The project expediter has no directing responsibility for the work that is done on the project.
    This is left to the functional managers in this environment. Project managers have many
    responsibilities, one of which is communications. In comparing the roles of the project man-
    ager and the project expediter, the expediter's primary role is communications.

16. Answer: d
    Past project reviews are not one of the tools and techniques that could be used for perfor-
    mance reporting. Variance analysis, earned value reports, and performance reviews are listed
    in the Guide to the PMBOK as tools and techniques for performance reporting.

17. Answer: a
    The expected project staffing is important to the communications technology since it will be
    necessary for the project staff to be able to use the communications tools effectively.

18. Answer: a
    The administrative closure of the project consists of documenting the results of the project
    to formalize the acceptance of the products of the project. Administrative closure should not
    be delayed until the project is complete. Each major phase of the project should be closed to
    ensure that important information will not be lost. Outputs from administrative closure are
    the project archives, the project closure, and the lessons learned document.

      You can improve your listening ability by doing these things:
      * Show the speaker that you are interested.
      * Demonstrate active, supportive attention.
      * Don't constantly interrupt the speaker.
      * Listen for the concepts and the ideas being presented by the speaker.
      * Don't concentrate exclusively on the facts the speaker is using to support his or her argu-
        ments.
      * Make sure that there is sufficient feedback on both sides to ensure that the points being
        made are clearly understood.

21. Answer: a

22. Answer: c
      Project managers must be good communicators. While this does not mean that they must be
      orators or spellbinders, it does mean three things:
      * They must recognize the importance of the interpersonal communication network with the
        project team, and encourage, not inhibit, informal communication between team members.
      * They must recognize the importance of human relations to the success of communication
        flow and team building. Effective communication will not be achieved if there is not har-
        mony and trust.
      * They must recognize that communication is a two-way street. The project manager does
        not just give orders; the project team must understand, participate, and agree before team-
        work is achieved. Feedback in both directions is necessary for team building and is vital for
        a continuing team effort.

23. Answer: b
      There are seven people in the group, including the project manager. The networking formula
      for the number of lines of communications or connections between seven people is n
      (n1)/2. In this case, [7 (71)] / 2  21.

24. Answer: c
      One of the best techniques for helping to keep a meeting moving in the right direction is to
      frequently summarize what has already happened in the meeting. The project manager should
      not make all the decisions; the team should participate in decision making. Although the
      project manager can introduce new ideas, he or she should not dominate the meeting with
      his or her own ideas.

    stakeholders; who needs what information, when they will need it, and how it will be given
    to them.
           Information distribution--making needed information available to project stakeholders
    in a timely manner.
           Performance reporting--collecting and disseminating performance information. This
    includes status reporting, progress measurement, and forecasting.
           Administrative closure--generating, gathering, and disseminating information to for-

    The technologies or methods used to transfer information back and forth among project
    elements can vary significantly: from brief conversations to extended meetings, from simple
    written documents to immediately accessible online schedules and databases.

    manual filing systems, electronic text databases, project management software, and systems
    that allow access to technical documentation such as engineering drawings.

                                                       RISK MANAGEMENT



1. Answer: c
   In a fixed-price contract the supplier is obligated to deliver the contracted-for item at a fixed
   price. The supplier is aware of the risk and will put an allowance for the risk in the contracted
   price. This often means that the project team will pay the supplier for the cost of the risk
   regardless of whether the risk occurs.

2. Answer: a
   Risk avoidance is eliminating the risk from consideration by doing something that will elimi-
   nate it as a possibility. Risk acceptance is allowing the risk to happen and dealing with it if it
   occurs. Risk deflection or transfer is transferring the risk to someone other than the project
   team, such as an insurance company or outside supplier.

3. Answer: c
   Risk mitigation is the process of reducing a risk to acceptable levels. In risk mitigation the
   risk has either a reduced impact or probability or both. This reduces the risk severity to levels
   below the risk tolerance.

4. Answer: b

   give more control to the project and reduce the problem of known risks using budget that
   was set aside for the work of the project and causing a cost overrun in the project.

5. Answer: d
   The expected value of a risk is the probability of the risk times the impact of the risk summed
   up for all possibilities.

 6. Answer: c
      Management reserve is funds set aside to manage unidentified risks. PMI refers to these as
      the ``unknown unknowns.'' When the management reserve is used, it is moved from the
      management reserve to the cost or schedule baseline.

 7. Answer: a
      Risk triggers, sometimes called risk symptoms, are indications that a risk is about to occur.
      In this example there is a risk that the project will be delayed. There is a warning that this
      will occur because several activities are now overdue for completion. They do not affect the
      project schedule yet, but if this trend continues the project will be late.

 8. Answer: a
      Because of risk in most projects the probability distribution is usually skewed. This is because
      there are more things that will adversely affect schedules than there are that will improve
      them. If the probability distribution of the scheduled completion of the project is indeed
      skewed, then the most likely date for project completion will be earlier than the mean value
      or the expected value.

 9. Answer: d
      The expected value is found by multiplying the probability of the risk by the cost of the
      impact of the risk should it occur. EV  25,000  10%

10. Answer: b
      This is a matter of applying the probability rule of addition. This rule says that the probability
      of either one of two events is equal to the probability of one event plus the probability of the
      second event minus the probability of both of the events occurring.
      P(6 or 6)  P(6)  P(6)  P(6 and 6)
      P(6 and 6)  P(6)  P(6)

11. Answer: c
      A buffered schedule is one where float is deliberately created in the schedule. Buffers are
      deliberately created between tasks on the critical path, and the activities are rescheduled to
      more closely approximate the schedule to the new promise date.

12. Answer: d
      The client's outsourcing method has nothing to do with risk management; all the other
      choices are items that should be included in the risk description.

13. Answer: c
    The lessons learned document from other similar projects can be a great help in determining
    the new risks associated with this project. Many times risks repeat themselves from one project
    to another. This makes the lessons learned document very important for all projects.

14. Answer: c
    The result of the first risk meeting of a project team is to identify as many risks as possible in
    the time allowed.

15. Answer: b
    The Monte Carlo technique is a refinement of PERT. In the PERT process the range of
    values and the probability that they can occur is calculated for the project completion date or
    parts of the project. The Monte Carlo technique allows for shifts that may occur in the critical
    path during possible values of the durations of the activities of the project. It is a simulation
    technique that produces a value called the criticality index, which is the percent of simulations
    that a particular activity is on the critical path. That is, criticality index is the percent of the
    number of simulations that an activity is on the critical path.

16. Answer: c
    The management reserve is time and money used to offset the effect of unknown risks affect-
    ing cost and schedule. These risks can only be approximated since none of them are specifi-
    cally identified. PMI refers to these risks as the known-unknown risks and the identified risks
    as the known-known risks.

17. Answer: a
    The breakeven-point justification technique predicts a point in time where the benefits offset
    the costs involved. It is a simple justification technique that takes into consideration a lot of
    assumptions. Since it predicts the point in time where the benefits exceed the cost, given the
    choice of an expensive and a cheap machine, the cheap machine will usually have high short-
    term benefits, and the expensive machine will have higher long-term benefits.

18. Answer: d
    In critical chain theory the feeder chains are activities that are not on the critical path. These
    tasks are scheduled to be done as late as possible and then buffered so that they start earlier
    than the late schedule dates. Buffer is also added to the critical path of the schedule to improve
    the probability that the project will finish on time. Feeder chain activities as well as critical
    chain activities are not started as early as possible or as late as possible. They are started as
    late as possible minus their buffer.

19. Answer: c
      In the normal probability distribution or any symmetric probability distribution, the most
      likely value of the distribution is the peak of the distribution curve. This is the value that has
      the highest probability of occurring. In a symmetric probability distribution this will be the
      center of the curve as well. There is a 50% probability that the project will finish past the
      most likely date and a 50% chance that the project will finish earlier than that date.

20. Answer: c
      Risks are events that affect a project for better or worse. Positive risks increase the positive
      cash flow or benefits to the project, and negative risks increase the negative cash flow or
      effects of the project.

21. Answer: a
      Fast tracking is changing the project plan to schedule activities that were planned to be done
      in sequence so that they can be done completely or partially in parallel. This will increase
      risk, because more work will be done if a problem is discovered.

22. Answer: b
      In determining the worst-case situation, all of the negative risks are included and none of the
      positive risks are included in the total. This makes the assumption of the worst case as being
      that all of the bad things happen and none of the good things happen.

23. Answer: b
      Insurance transfers (deflects) the problem of the risk to someone else who takes the responsi-
      bility for the loss caused by the risk. In this case an insurance company agreed to compensate
      PMI if this loss occurred.

24. Answer: d
      During project closeout much of the project work has been completed and many of the risks
      have passed the time in which they can occur. The total risk of the project is therefore lowest
      during closeout.

25. Answer: c
      The Monte Carlo technique is a refinement of PERT. In the PERT process the range of
      values and the probability that they can occur are calculated for the project completion date
      or parts of the project. The Monte Carlo technique allows for shifts that may occur in the

26. Answer: b
    If any of the activities are late, the entire project of the three activities will be late. To state
    this as three mutually exclusive events we consider the probability of all three of the events
    occurring on time. This is .9 for each, and the probability of all three occurring is .9.9.9
     .73.

27. Answer: c
    The probability is that at least one of the sellers will deliver the parts on time. This is the
    same as saying either vendor A or B must deliver. This is the addition rule in probability.
    The probability that the first seller will deliver is .9. The probability that the second seller
    will deliver is also .9, but the second seller delivering on time is only of consequence if the
    first seller fails to deliver on time, or .1. The calculation is then .9  (.1.9)  .99.

    In an even distribution any date in the distribution will have the same probability as any
    other date in the distribution.

31. Answer: b
    The Monte Carlo technique is a simulation technique that assigns a value to the duration for
    each activity in the schedule. This assignment can be by user-selected probability distribu-
    tions. Depending on the values of the duration for each activity the critical path may change
    from simulation run to simulation run.

32. Answer: a
    Risk acceptance is doing nothing about the risk until it happens. This is done with risks that
    are below the risk tolerance level.

33. Answer: b
    Risk tolerance is the measure of the client's likelihood to take risks. A client with a low risk
    tolerance will not be willing to take very many or large risks even though they may produce
    considerable opportunities to make large profits.

34. Answer: b
      The Monte Carlo technique is a computer simulation method that selects durations for sched-
      ule events according to a probability distribution on a random basis. For each set of selected
      durations the simulation is run and the schedule and critical path are calculated. The result
      is a probability distribution showing the probability of project completion dates that are
      possible. The criticality index shows the percent of simulations that any activity is on the
      critical path.

35. Answer: b
      Simulations such as the Monte Carlo simulation are frequently used in risk management. It
      is far less expensive to model the real world than to actually do things in the real world.

36. Answer: b
      Risk analysis should be done frequently throughout the project.

37. Answer: d
      The risk option of mitigation means that the impact or the probability is reduced to a level
      below the risk tolerance level. This means that the risk is now acceptable.

38. Answer: b
      Qualitative assessment of risks is often appropriate. When there is little impact from a risk or
      when little is known about the risk parameters it may only be practical to evaluate risks in a
      qualitative way.

39. Answer: c
      This is the definition of sensitivity analysis in the Guide to the PMBOK.

40. Answer: a
      The expected value of the risk is the probability of the risk multiplied by its cost. This is one
      method of ranking risks. Risks can also be ranked qualitatively by assigning them qualitative
      values like ``very risky'' and ``not too risky'' and ranking them in groups.

                 CONTRACTS AND PROCUREMENT



1. Answer: b
   A statement of work is the description of what the project is about and what will be delivered.
   The project plan is complete and contains the detailed work that the project will do, complete
   with task descriptions and schedule, cost, and scope baselines containing a real schedule and
   budget. An exception report describes items that are not as planned.

2. Answer: a
   In a fixed-price contract the supplier is obligated to deliver the contracted-for item at a fixed
   price. The supplier is aware of the risk and will put an allowance for the risk in the contracted
   price. This often means that the project team will pay the supplier for the cost of the risk
   regardless of whether the risk occurs.

3. Answer: c
   The project manager should make every effort to make sure that the supplier is aware of the
   risk before the contract is signed. The project manager is obligated ethically to reveal the
   information to the supplier before the contract is signed.

4. Answer: b
   The make or buy decision is not a contract or purchase order type. Make or buy refers to the
   decision process that is used to decide whether work should be done in our own facility or
   contracted out to a supplier.

5. Answer: c
   The project charter is one of the first things that must be done in any project. The project
   charter according to the Guide to the PMBOK 2000 is: ``A document issued by senior manage-
   ment that provides the project manager with the authority to apply organizational resources
   to project activities.''

6. Answer: d
   Although it is not to the letter of the contract, the buyer is going to have much more trouble
   if the seller cannot make the payroll and cannot complete the contract because their employ-
   ees will not work without pay. The best thing would be to change the contract in some way
   that is mutually beneficial.

 7. Answer: d
      In a blanket order, a long-term order is placed with the seller. The price is based on the goods
      or services that will be sold over the period of the blanket order. The seller has a long-term
      order from the buyer and can invest in the means of production. The buyer has a stable price
      for the period of the blanket order. If the buyer does not buy all the goods or services that
      were promised, the price per unit is adjusted at the end of the contract. Since the inventory
      is delivered as needed, the inventory carrying cost is of no consequence to the buyer.

 8. Answer: c
      Forward buying is the type of purchasing where the amount of goods required for a long
      period of time is purchased and delivered at one time. There is a quantity discount for this
      type of purchase, but it has no effect on capital investment unless it would be to build a place
      to store the goods. It will decrease transportation cost, increase inventory, prevent the risk of
      future price increases, and increase the cost associated with obsolescence.

 9. Answer: d

10. Answer: d
      Cost-reimbursable contracts are frequently called cost-plus contracts.

11. Answer: c
      Work is frequently done after delivery if it is to both the seller's and the buyer's mutual
      benefit. The cost of doing the work is charged back to the seller, thus back charged.

12. Answer: d
      Contract negotiations take place after the vendor has been selected. This is true even in a bid
      situation. The seller and the buyer negotiate over the specific terms and conditions of the
      contract and can even adjust the pricing. Care must be taken here lest the unsuccessful bidders
      protest the adjustments and force a rebid of the contract.

13. Answer: c
      A request for proposal is a device used to solicit seller proposals. In an RFP the seller makes
      proposals as to how the needs of the buyer can be satisfied. The buyer may accept the proposal
      from the seller even if it is more costly than the lowest proposal.

14. Answer: c

      puts the burden of offering the best solution to the problem on the seller, but it creates a

17. Answer: b
    It is better to try to save a contract that is nearly completed than to start all over with another
    vendor. There are problems in this work, and it seems likely that the work is not clearly
    defined.

18. Answer: b
    Existing lists of potential sellers can often be expanded by placing advertisements in general
    circulation publications such as newspapers or in specialty publications such as professional
    journals. Some government jurisdictions require public advertising of certain types of pro-
    curement items; most government jurisdictions require public advertising of subcontracts on
    a government contract.

19. Answer: a
    Of the contracts listed, the cost plus percentage of cost as an award fee is the greatest risk for
    the buyer and the least risk for the contractor performing the work. Not only do costs go up
    if there are problems but the fee increases with additional cost as well. Generally speaking,
    buyers prefer the fixed-price contract, which places more risk on the seller, and sellers prefer
    cost contracts, which place more risk on the buyer.

20. Answer: b
    The concept of warranty is based upon one party's assurance to the other that the goods will
    meet certain standards of quality, including condition, reliability, description, function, or
    performance. This assurance may be expressed or implied. Recognizing the principal function
    of a warranty is to establish a level of quality (and title--not discussed herein); it thus gives a
    source of remedy for loss due to a defect in the quality of the goods. The contract may and
    should establish a level of quality, and if it does, it is an expressed warranty recognized under
    Section 2-313 (1) (a) of the Uniform Commercial Code.

21. Answer: b
      The person or organization responsible for contract administration should provide the seller
      with formal written notice that the contract has been completed. Requirements for formal
      acceptance and closure are usually defined in the contract.

22. Answer: b
      Fixed-price or lump sum contracts--this category of contract involves a fixed total price for
      a well-defined product. To the extent that the product is not well-defined, both the buyer
      and seller are at risk--the buyer may not receive the desired product or the seller may need
      to incur additional costs in order to provide it. Fixed-price contracts may also include incen-
      tives for meeting or exceeding selected project objectives such as schedule targets.

23. Answer: b
      The first thing that should be done is to issue a purchase order to the contractor and find out
      how much the change is going to cost. It is important in managing changes that work on
      changes does not take place until the cost of doing the change is clearly understood.

24. Answer: b
      Security is a consideration in making a make-or-buy decision. In this situation it might be
      very important to know how well the service bureau will be able to protect your designs from
      the competition. Make or buy is a general management technique that can be used to deter-
      mine whether a particular product can be produced cost-effectively by the performing organi-
      zation. Both sides of the analysis include indirect as well as direct costs. For example, the
      ``buy'' side of the analysis should include both the actual out-of-pocket cost to purchase the
      product as well as the indirect costs of managing the purchasing process.
            A make-or-buy analysis must also reflect the perspective of the performing organization
      as well as the immediate needs of the project. For example, purchasing a capital item (any-
      thing from a construction crane to a personal computer) rather than renting it is seldom cost
      effective. However, if the performing organization has an ongoing need for the item, the
      portion of the purchase cost allocated to the project may be less than the cost of the rental.

25. Answer: b
      In the procurement process, the solicitation process is the process whereby potential vendors
      are notified of an impending contract procurement.

26. Answer: c
      This is the formal and legal definition of a contract.

27. Answer: d
      The contract definition includes the requirement for a contract to be agreed to by competent
      parties. The person signing the contract was below the legal age for doing so; therefore, the
      contract is void.

    Commodities are those items that are common and readily available from several suppliers.
    They are interchangeable and can be bought on the basis of price alone, since there is little
    difference between vendors of these products.

1. Answer: c
   There should be a change procedure in the project to handle changes that might be initiated
   by customers. The change procedure should include the cost for managing the change and
   the cost of developing the estimate for the effects of the change.

2. Answer: c
   Estimating is just that, an estimating process. Perhaps it would have been better for the

   At this point the best thing to do is to use all of the information available to create the most
   accurate estimate that is practical.

3. Answer: b
   In this kind of situation it is important that the customs and culture in the foreign country
   be respected. By consulting with your company's management, the gift can usually be ac-
   cepted and disposed of in the proper way.

4. Answer: c
   Unless the employee has signed a nondisclosure agreement with his or her previous company,
   there is no obligation for him or her not to share knowledge that was gained while working
   for the competitor.

5. Answer: a
   The first thing that should be done is to look for tasks in the project where there is an ability
   to reschedule to free resources for this problem. If the problem is severe and additional budget
   and time is needed, it may be necessary to speak to the stakeholders, but the project impacts
   and plan for the correction should come first.

6. Answer: c
   It is usually in the best interest of the project if the project team decides matters of personal
   time themselves unless there are significant reasons for the project team to be on site at certain
   hours or because they are necessary to interact with other people on the team.

 7. Answer: a
    Intellectual property belongs to the author of the property. If you create a presentation based
    on your own work, you have a right to receive credit for it. This is not to say that it is
    necessary to give credit to every person who contributes anything to a presentation or we
    would have a list of credits like a Hollywood movie. One of the options not offered here is
    to speak to the manager first.

 8. Answer: c
    This type of problem occurs frequently. Many times there is a misunderstanding on the part
    of the customer's engineers, and it can be resolved simply by having an informal meeting and
    discussing the problem. Later, if the disagreement persists, the customer should submit a
    request for a change, and a formal investigation can be completed.

 9. Answer: b
    It would be a conflict of interest to own a company that was supplying parts to a project that
    you are managing. Receiving a gift of a small amount or one that is within the limits of your
    company's gift policy is not a conflict of interest. Using sensitive information voluntarily
    given to you is not a conflict of interest.

10. Answer: c
    Probably the best thing to do in this situation would be to divide the money by letting the
    team decide how to divide it. This is participative management.

11. Answer: b
    Unsupported allegations that are brought to you by a third party may often be rumors and
    mistaken facts. It is best to investigate the allegations first, and complete the investigation
    before making any changes.

 APPENDIX: PROBABILITY DISTRIBUTIONS




I
   n the discussion so far, I have tried to sound less like a statistician and more like a
   project management practitioner. The material I have covered here is mainly practical.
   But there are a few more things we should discuss if we are going to use any of the
many statistical packages that are available for project management. Many of these soft-
ware packages require making decisions on the type of distributions to use, so it is impor-
tant to know the differences.
      A probability distribution is a list of all the possibilities that could occur and a
probability associated with each of them.


                               The Even Distribution
The even distribution is perhaps the easiest to understand. In the even distribution, there
is an even chance that any of the possibilities will occur. A good example is the rolling of
a die. If the die is not loaded, there is an equal chance that any of the possible numbers
could come face up. The possibilities are 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, or 6. As you can see from the plot
in Figure A-1, there is an equal chance of rolling a 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, or 6.


                               Binomial Distribution
As we move into more complex distributions, the calculation of the probabilities becomes
more complex. The binomial distribution describes the probabilities of all of the possible
outcomes of a series of experiments, where each experiment is identical in every way and
has only two possible outcomes.
      This particular distribution is of value in project management because there are
many situations in risk management where there are two possible outcomes, success and
failure.
      In order to use the binomial distribution, three conditions must be met:

     1. Each event must have only two possible outcomes.
     2. Each event must be statistically independent of the others. Statistical indepen-
        dence means that the occurrence of one event does not have an effect on the
        probability of any other event.

                                                      357

      3. The probability of the outcome of any event must be the same from event to
         event.

      In the binomial distribution it is possible to calculate the value of the probability
directly. As the distributions become more and more complex, the formulas for making
this calculation are too complex to be done without the use of a computer.
                            P(x)  [n! / (nx)! x!] x(1)nx

      Where: x is the number of occurrences of a particular outcome; P(x) is the probabil-
ity that x will occur; n is the number of events that will be measured;  is the probability
of the outcome occurring in one event; and ! stands for factorial. Factorial means multi-
plying the number by successively smaller integers until 1 is reached: 5! is 5  4  3 
2  1  120.
      For example, suppose a coin is flipped three times. The probability of getting a head
on any flip is .5. What are the probabilities of getting two heads in the three tries?
      The probability of two heads is:
                          P(2)  [3! / (31)! 3!] .52(1.5)1
                          P(2)  (6 / 2)  0.25  0.5  0.375

                                Poisson Distribution
The Poisson distribution is used to describe the probabilities of independent events
spaced over time or some other parameter. This distribution is useful in projects involving
queues on lines and the number of occurrences of an event over a time period.
     Three rules to the Poisson distribution are:
     1. Each occurrence must be statistically independent of the others.
     2. There must be an expected number of events over a period of time.
     3. The probability of more than one occurrence happening at the same time is very
        small.

                           The Normal Distribution
From the illustration in Figure A-2, it can be seen that the normal distribution curve is
bell shaped, with a high point in the middle and an ever-decreasing slope toward horizon-
tal at the ends.
      One of the important things about the normal distribution is that the formula for
calculating it depends on only two factors, the mean value and the standard deviation.
The mean value locates the middle of the curve, or the peak. The standard deviation
shows whether the curve is clustered tightly around the midpoint or whether it is loosely
clustered (Figure A-3).
      It has been found that most physical occurrences will fit a normal curve or some-
thing close to it. This is true of many of the things that we would like to approximate in
project management. The probability distribution of cost and schedule estimates fits this

Figure A-2. Normal distribution curve.

kind of distribution. In the area of scheduling, the PERT method is employed to more
closely predict the completion time for a project. In cost estimating, the normal distribu-
tion is used to predict the range of values that has a given probability of occurring if that
project is actually done.
      In PERT and cost estimating, we want a 95 percent probability of being correct in
our estimate. As in all probability distribution curves, the area under the curve between
the two points we are interested in compared to the total area under the entire curve is
the probability that the actual event will be between the two values. This means that we
can use the normal distribution to determine the probability that the true value of our
project will be between two estimated values.
      For convenience, multiples of the standard deviation are used to mark off these
ranges in values. The mean value of a project cost, for example, plus or minus one ( 1)
standard deviation is 68.3%, 2 standard deviations is 95.5%, and 3 standard devia-
tions is 99.7%. These are values that are used for convenience. Any range of values within
the limits of the distribution could be similarly calculated.
      In the area of statistical quality control, the term ``plus or minus 3 standard devia-
tions'' and the term ``3 sigma'' are frequently heard. Sigma is the Greek letter usually
used to represent standard deviation. In statistical quality control, it is usual to want the
accuracy of the inspection process to have a 99.7% probability of being correct. That is
a 99.7% chance that the lot of parts that is inspected and deemed to be acceptable is
really acceptable and a 99.7% chance that a lot of parts that is said to be unacceptable is
really unacceptable. More is said about statistical quality control in Chapter 4.
      All normal curves have the same percentage of total area between the same multiples
of the standard deviation. Suppose point ``a'' is 1/2 standard deviation above the mean
value. Suppose another point called ``b'' is 2 standard deviations above the mean. The
area or probability of the actual value being between these two values is 28.57%.

      Now suppose the mean value is 100, and the standard deviation is 10. Point ``a''
would be 105, and point ``b'' would be 120. The probability of the actual cost being
between 105 and 120 is 28.57%.
      If the standard deviation is 5 and the mean is 50, point ``a'' would be 52.5 and
point ``b'' would be 60. The probability of the actual cost being between 55 and 60 is
28.57%.
      Most statistical computer programs make these calculations directly. In fact most
inexpensive calculators that have only the most basic statistical functions perform these
calculations.
      In the appendix of most statistics books you will find Z tables. These tables are used
to find the probability or the area under the normal distribution curve for any point on
the horizontal axes and the mean value. To use the tables, standardize the values desired
by dividing them by the standard deviation.
      In the previous example, the standard deviation was 10, the mean value was 100,
and the desired probability was between ``a'' at 105 and ``b'' at 120. To use the table we
must standardize the values:
                      Z  (x  mean value) / standard deviation
                      Z for the ``a'' value  5 / 10  .5
                      Z for the ``b'' value  20 / 10  2.0

     From this we can find the probability in the Z table for .5 and the value for 2.0.
Both of these values are on the same side of the mean, so we must subtract the smaller
one from the larger one to show the area we are concerned with (see Figure A-4):

                                      Beta Distribution
The beta distribution is used frequently in project management since it closely resembles
the phenomena in cost and scheduling. The beta probability distribution is bell shaped
like the normal distribution, but it is not symmetrical (Figure A-5). The rationale behind
this is that the cost or time to complete a task or project can be only a limited amount
under or below expectations but could be an unlimited amount over or above our expec-
tations. If a task were scheduled to be completed in ten days, the task could not be
completed in less than zero days, but there is a possibility that the task could take ten or
twenty or even thirty days. Similarly, if a task were budgeted at $5,000, it could take
many times $5,000 to complete, but it is not likely to take more than $5,000 less than
the budget.
