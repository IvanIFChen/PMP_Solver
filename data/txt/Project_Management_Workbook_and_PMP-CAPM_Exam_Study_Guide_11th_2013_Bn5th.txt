  PROJECT MANAGEMENT OVERVIEW

 Project management is not a new concept. It has been practiced for hundreds, even
 thousands of years. Any undertaking, large or small, requires a goal, a set of objectives,
 a plan, coordination, the management of resources, and the ability to manage change.
 Additionally, every project requires leadership. Project managers work with teams and a
 variety of stakeholders and must develop the skills to balance the expectations and
 demands of each stakeholder.
 Today, project management has become a very formal methodology, and many
 organizations have adopted a "management by projects" approach. Some organizations
 have established Project Management Offices (PMOs) to assist them in developing
 standards for managing projects and processes to ensure that these standards are
 followed. As the project management discipline continues to evolve, organizations around
 the world are experiencing the benefits of project management. These benefits include
 better scheduling of resources, improved estimating, higher quality, early identification of
 issues and problems, and more effective measurement processes to assess success.
 Projects are defined as temporary endeavors with specific start and end dates, and they
 are initiated to provide or produce a unique product or service. Project management is
 the application of knowledge skills, tools, and techniques to project activities to meet
 project objectives. Effective project management is accomplished through the
 application and integration of project management processes that will assist in the
 initiation, planning, execution, monitoring, controlling, and closing of a project. These
 processes also apply to the management of each phase of a project. A project manager
 is assigned to a project and becomes accountable for the success of the project through
 effective management techniques, coordination between functional organizations, and
 the ability to apply the appropriate amount of managerial and cross-organizational
 support and guidance as the project is executed.


Glossary of terms Key project management terms and definitions to review
and remember. The disciple of project management includes a lexicon that is
widely used in most industries and it is beneficial to learn the "language" of the
professional project manager.

Deliverable A tangible, verifiable work output. Project work will generally produce
multiple deliverables that will comprise the final project deliverable.

                                                                                                1
2    CHAPTER ONE


Functional Manager Generally, the manager who "owns" or supervises the resources
that will be assigned to project activities. Functional managers are considered to be the
technical experts and usually provide information about resource requirements, task
duration, schedule development and cost estimates. Project managers engage the
assistance of functional managers (also known as line managers) to develop the project
plan and subsidiary project plans.
Non-Project Driven Generally, these organizations do not have a project methodology
in place, are not organized around the delivery of projects, and are arranged in a
functional, organizational structure. Work is generally associated with manufacturing and
production lines. Projects are established as needed to improve or support functional lines
and activities or organizational changes.

Program A group of related projects managed in a coordinated way to obtain benefits
and control not available from managing them separately. Generally, projects in a program
are interrelated.
Project A temporary endeavor undertaken to create a unique product, service, or result.
A project has a specific objective, defined start and end dates, and funding limitations.
Projects consume resources including human (labor), equipment and materials. A project
is generally multifunctional or cross-organizational in nature.
Project Driven Organization Also known as "project based." In these organizations all
work is characterized through projects. Projects are arranged as separate cost centers and
the sum of all project work is associated with organizational goals and strategic objectives.

Project Management Application of knowledge skills, tools, and techniques to project
activities to meet project requirements. Project management involves the utilization of the
5 major process groups: initiation, project planning, executing, monitoring and controlling,
and closing. These processes are applied to each project phase and enable the project
manager to effectively integrate the 10 project management knowledge areas described in
the Guide to the Project Management Body of Knowledge(R) developed by the Project
Management Institute or PMI(R).
Project Sponsor Generally, described as the person or organization that authorizes the
project and provides the financial resources required to plan, execute, and deliver the
project objectives.
Triple Constraint A framework for evaluating the effects of changes to the competing
project demands of Time (schedule), Cost (budget), and Scope (specifications) usually
depicted as a triangle. Specifically, the Triple constraint emphasizes that a change to any
one side or element will have an effect on the other elements. The Triple Constraint was
considered to display the key factors that define project success. Today, project success is
defined using several success factors including quality, value added, and fitness for use.
These factors may be referred to as competing constraints or competing demands.

Activities, Questions, and Exercises

       documented lessons learned.

This exercise is intended to provide you with a basis and understanding of the major goals
of an enterprisewide project management methodology and process for improvement. The
16 Points to Project Management Maturity are designed to assist an organization in
achieving continuously higher levels of project performance by providing a baseline for
assessing the current level of project management maturity and then developing steps to
enhance existing processes and/or create new processes that will improve overall project
performance.
Exercise: Review Dr. Kerzner's 16 points to project management maturity and
identify the specific benefits associated with each point. Identify actions that
may be taken to introduce, implement, or further enhance the value of each of
the listed points in an organization.

Example:

   1. Adopt a project management methodology and use it consistently.

Action: Provide management with supporting information about how project management
can assist in achieving organizational objectives. Obtain best practices documentation from
companies that are actively using project management processes and methodologies and
provide a summary to executive management.

Kerzner "Quick tips" for the Project Management Institute PMP(R)
and CAPM(R) EXAM

The information in Chapter One is most closely related to the following topics in the
PMBOK(R) Guide: INTRODUCTION, ORGANIZATIONAL INFLUENCES AND PROJECT LIFE
CYCLE, PROJECT INTEGRATION MANAGEMENT

An important item to remember is the Project Management Framework, as described in the
PMBOK(R) Guide -- Fifth Edition, which defines a total of 47 project processes that describe
the activities generally found throughout a project's life cycle. These processes are
organized into ten knowledge areas and comprise the five process groups: Initiating,
Planning, Executing, Monitoring, and Closing.

The 10 knowledge areas of Project Management are: Integration Management, Scope
Management, Time Management, Cost Management, Risk Management, Human
Resources Management, Quality Management, Procurement Management,
Communication Management, and Stakeholder Management. These knowledge
areas and the subprocesses associated with them are connected through the "system" of
project management and are all Integrated, Interrelated, and Interdependent. There are no
independent components of a project and changes to the elements of one knowledge area,
such as Scope Management, as described in the PMBOK(R) Guide, may, in some way,
impact any of the other knowledge areas. Each knowledge area and its detailed
subprocesses are part of the total system of project management.

Important terms to remember

Change Control Board A team or group designated or empowered to review and
determine the value of a change and to approve or deny change requests.

Close Project Utilizing the project management methodology, Project Management
Information System (PMIS), and the expert judgment of the functional managers to
complete the project and perform all final administrative procedures. The processes
required to obtain formal acceptance and completion of project files for reference as
historical information.

Configuration Management Process that will ensure that configuration changes
(changes to features, functions, dimensions, physical characteristics) are managed and
approved to prevent or reduce the risks of additional cost and scope changes, or other
impacts to the project.

Constraints and Assumptions Constraints are the limitations the project manager and
team must operate within. Examples: predetermined schedule and budget, limited
resources. Assumptions in the project management context are items that, for planning
purposes can be believed to be true, real, or certain. Assumptions are not grounded in fact
and should be verified.

Enterprise Environmental Factors Internal and external factors may influence the
project outcome and must be considered by the project manager and team during project
planning and implementation such as the organizational culture, industry standards,
resource availability and capability, risk tolerance, and political environment.

Historical Records Data and information gathered during project planning and
execution and recorded for legal purposes, references, and lessons learned.
                                                        PROJECT MANAGEMENT OVERVIEW       11


Integrated Change Control The 10 knowledge areas are managed in an integrated manner
with an understanding that a change in one area can impact any or all of the other knowledge
areas. Example: A change in the scope of a project may impact the schedule and budget. A
change in quality requirements may impact the budget and the human resource requirements.
It is recommended that the project team considers the impact of the change before
implementing the change by using a predefined change control process. A change control
process generally has three major objectives: Obtain approval for the change, determine if
change has occurred through comparison of the baseline with actual results and, determine
when and how to introduce the change to minimize the impact on ongoing operations.
Monitor and Control Project Work Agreed upon processes for managing work
performance, managing change requests, utilization of earned value techniques,
identifying corrective and preventive actions.

Organizational Process Assets Standard policies and procedures established by an
organization and expected to be followed such as safety procedures, quality assurance
reviews, project health checks. Process assets may also include available planning
templates, financial controls, change control procedures, and risk management processes.
Organizational Strategies How an organization will achieve its goals and objectives. A
formal project management process may be an organizational strategy. Consider how your
project impacts or supports your organization's objectives. Make sure you can link your
project to the organizational goals.
Preliminary Project Scope Statement This document describes the project and the
desired objectives at a very high level. The preliminary scope statement includes the
definition of the project, the products and services to be delivered, major milestones, and
acceptance criteria. A final project scope statement is developed during the PMBOK Guide(R)
"define scope" process.

Progressive Elaboration The process of moving forward incrementally and adding
more detail to the project plan.
Project Charter The initial project document that authorizes the project and the use of
resources. Assignment of the project manager and level of decision making authority of
the project manager is also included in a project charter.
Project Management Information System Any system or group of systems working
together to gather, store, and distribute information about your project. Examples: Time-
reporting system, Accounting System, Project Software.

Project Management Plan All of the actions necessary to integrate and coordinate the
entire project effort including any subsidiary plans that have been established by the
project team. The project plan guides the team during project execution and is expected to
change as the project is progressively elaborated
Project Plan The approved document that provides the baseline for executing and
managing the project.
SMART Objectives Well defined objectives are considered to be Specific, Measurable,
Attainable, Realistic, Time bound

Stakeholders People and or organizations directly involved in or impacted by the
project. Consider who the key stakeholders are and also other stakeholders who may view
your project as a threat or an obstacle to their projects or personal objectives. Determine
who the negative stakeholders are and what risks they may introduce to the successful
completion of your project. Develop strategies for dealing with your project stakeholders
12   CHAPTER ONE


Subsidiary Plans Plans created to support the higher-level project management plan.
An example of a subsidiary plan is the Change Control Plan--the control processes in place
to manage other knowledge areas such as Scope Change Control, Schedule Change
Control, Cost Change Control, etc. The total or Integrated Project Management plan may
include several subsidiary plans depending on the complexity of the project. Other
examples of subsidiary plans: Human Resources Plan, Quality Plan, Safety Plan.
Integrated planning includes many processes, so be prepared to answer questions that
may include several different processes related to a project situation. Become familiar with
all process groups, and make sure you are familiar with the inputs, tools, techniques, and
outputs of each process described in the PMBOK(R) Guide.

PMI(R) emphasizes the importance of planning. Proper planning requires effective
communication among the team and sound leadership from the project manager. The
result of effective and comprehensive planning is a project team that is more completely
informed and has a strong understanding of the larger, integrated purpose and objectives
of the project.

 Additional tips and practice items for the PMP(R) exam are included in each chapter and in
 the section of the workbook entitled PMP(R) Exam and PMBOK Guide(R) Review.

14   CHAPTER ONE


12. The functional manager provides the resources and technical expertise. Challenges
    include: different priorities among project managers and projects, managing the
    demands of multiple project managers, limited resources, unreasonable time frames,
    and internal politics.

13. Establish expectations at the start of the project. Include communications
    requirements, escalation procedures, planning processes and methodology, and clear
    objectives.

14. There are many possible answers and solutions to the causes. This exercise is intended
    to emphasize the importance of identifying potential project problems and encourage
    proactive thinking and action. Any combination of causes may affect the outcome of
    the project.

15. The project manager is considered and integrator and coordinator for all major project
   activities. The project manager is held accountable for successful completion of the
   project. The project manager is a liaison between the project team and the project
   sponsor or executive steering committee. Other roles include: team builder, conflict
   manager, coach, mentor, facilitator, leader, motivator.

16. The project manager can develop better relationships with the functional managers
    through listening and understanding the priorities of the functional managers, their
    work environment, and issues associated with the functional manager's position.

17. Establish expectations clearly and intentionally between the project manager and the
    project sponsor or executive.

18. A project is a temporary endeavor undertaken to create a unique product, service, or
    result.

   PROJECT MANAGEMENT GROWTH:
     CONCEPTS AND DEFINITIONS

 This chapter focuses on the general evolution of project management from the 1940s
 through today's business environment. Formal project management has its roots in the
 1940s particularly in the area of military and complex weapons systems. These projects
 consumed enormous amounts of resources and today we refer to very large
 implementations as "mega projects." In the past four decades project management has
 grown from a means to achieve successful completion of small, intermediate and large
 complex projects or endeavors (sometimes referred to as engagements) to a key element
 in strategic planning. The use of powerful technology based tools, enterprisewide
 methodologies, and processes to control activities, manage people and resources have
 become an accepted part of business management. The project life cycle, systems
 thinking, and the influence of project management processes on an organization's critical
 success factors have had a significant impact on overall organizational performance.


Glossary of terms Key terms and definitions to review and remember

General Systems Management When applied to organizational structure, it is a
management technique designed to cross many organizational disciplines. For example:
finance, manufacturing, engineering, and marketing. Systems management refers to the need
to understand how each component of a system affects the operation of the entire system.

Mature Project Management The implementation of a standard methodology and
accompanying processes that creates a high probability of repeated successes. Maturity in
this context refers to a "culture" of project management where project processes are
embedded in normal business practices.

Product Scope The features and functions that characterize the deliverable. This
includes dimensions, features and physical characteristics; the complexity of the product.

Program A group of related projects managed in a coordinated way to obtain benefits
and control that is not available from managing them individually. Programs may include
elements of related work outside the scope of the discrete projects in the program. Projects
are normally the first-level subdivision of a program. Programs are associated with higher


                                                                                             17
18   CHAPTER TWO


level organizational objectives and benefits realization. Programs generally have a longer
overall duration than a project and in some cases are related to the support of ongoing
organizational activities.
Project Management Methodology A repetitive process, approved by executive
management, and used on all projects within an organization to increase the likelihood of
achieving project success, project management excellence, and maturity.

Project Scope The work that must be accomplished to produce a deliverable that will
meet all specified features and functions. The deliverable can be a product, service, or
other result as defined by the customer.
Stage-Gate Process Stages are a group of activities that can be performed either in
series or parallel based on the magnitude of risks the project team can endure. Gates are
structured decision points at the end of each stage. These decision points are used to
assess project performance and determine if corrective action is necessary.
System A group of elements, either human or nonhuman, that is organized and
arranged in such a way that the elements can act as a whole toward achieving some
common goal or objective.

Activities, Questions, and Exercises

Refer to Chapter Two of Project Management: A Systems Approach to Planning,
Scheduling, and Controlling (11th Edition) for supporting information and assistance in
completing each exercise. The following questions and exercises are associated with the
knowledge area of the PMBOK(R) Guide: The Project Management Framework.

Review each of the following questions or exercises and provide the answers in the space
provided.

1. If you were assigned the task of developing a set of questions to assist an organization
   in determining if there is a need for a formal project management process, what
   questions would you ask?




2. As project management evolved it became apparent to many executives that a formal
   project management process may not provide benefits significant enough to justify the
   expense associated with developing a formal methodology. In many organizations,
   project management was considered as overhead. The driving forces of rapid
   technology changes, the increasing complexity of projects, and the increased demand
   for resources with specialized knowledge all contributed to the need for an effective
   project management methodology. How can a project management methodology
   assist in managing and resolving issues related to these driving forces? What benefits
   are obtained through the use of a project management methodology? What other
   driving forces may influence the decisions associated with establishing a project
   management methodology in an organization?

3. Every organization encounters internal and external obstacles that may impede the
   achievement of success. For each obstacle listed, explain how a properly and
   effectively implemented project management methodology can overcome the obstacle.

 Obstacle                              Project management method, factor, or
                                       approach that may be used to respond to and
                                       overcome the obstacle
 a) Resource shortages


 b) Increasing costs


 c) Poor quality of work


 d) Technology changes


 e) Competition




                       Project success depends on: setting objectives, establishing plans,
                       organizing resources, staffing the team appropriately, establishing
                       controls, and motivating the team. In addition, an understanding of
                       the value expected to be achieved at project completion will impact
                       the perception of project success. Remember the Triple Constraint
                       and the many other competing demands in the project environment.


4. Project management has been shown to significantly improve the overall performance
   of an organization. There are many approaches to managing projects, but providing the
   project manager with total integrative responsibility will result in some very specific
   advantages. Describe these advantages.




5. For each of the following items in the Life Cycle Phases for Project Management
   Maturity provide a recommendation for addressing and resolving the issue that will
   allow an organization to progress toward achieving project management maturity.

   2. ______________________________________________________
   3. ______________________________________________________

9. Critical Success Factors (CSF) identify what is necessary to meet the customer's desired
   performance levels for project deliverables. Another form of success measurement is
   known as Key Performance Indicators (KPI). CSFs and KPIs are used to establish
   expectations and measurements of success for the work that must be performed to
   complete a project. CSF and KPI should be established early in project planning and
   should be communicated to the key stakeholders at project start-up. In the table
   provided is a list of typical KPIs defined during project planning and monitored during
   implementation. In the spaces provided, identify the primary factors that are most
   commonly used to measure project success. What additional success factors and KPIs
   can be used as measurements of success?

 Critical Success Factors and Key Performance Indicators (quantifiable
 gauge that an organization uses to measure its performance in terms of
 meeting its critical success factors). Examples:
 CSF - Use of a project management methodology
 CSF - Establishment of control processes (cost, schedule, quality, etc.)
 CSF - Use of interim or phase metrics--progress, trends, variances
 CSF - Quality of resources assigned versus resources that were planned
 CSF - Client involvement and feedback
 KPI - Call center metrics. Waiting time, calls dropped
 KPI - Quality: Number of defects per 1000, cost per defect repair, cost of product returns,
 number of product returns

Kerzner "Quick tips" for the Project Management Institute PMP(R)
and CAPM(R) EXAM


PROJECT MANAGEMENT

Why do we need project management?
*   To determine roles and responsibilities
*   Identify and establish priorities
*   To establish and manage realistic deadlines and schedules
*   To determine and assign accountability and authority
*   Ensure proper documentation of work activities (determining what documentation is
     needed and to avoid over documentation)
*   Provide a common methodology within an organization that will improve efficiencies in
     resource management
*   Provide effective and timely and appropriate status and communications to each
     stakeholder
*   Manage multiple projects more effectively
*   Reduce rework and redundant work
*   Capture and share lessons learned
Interpersonal skills Interpersonal relationships are key elements to the success of any
project. Project managers must utilize effective communication, the ability to influence
project teams and functional groups to "get things done," leadership, motivation, conflict
management, negotiation, and problem solving to manage teams and achieve project
objectives.

The project environment The project manager must maintain an awareness of the
cultural and social environment, the international and political environment, and the
physical environment when planning and implementing projects. These include such
factors as education, ethnicity, economics, demographics, religion, time zone differences,
regional holidays, and the physical surrounding that may affect how the project is
managed. These elements are associated with the domain of project management known
as "Professional Responsibility." Professional responsibility is embedded in the work
activities and the role of the project manager. (Note: Professional and Social Responsibility
were previously defined by the PMI(R) as the 6th Domain that project managers are held
accountable for. The current Domains are: Initiating, Planning, Executing, Monitoring and
Controlling, and Closing).
26   CHAPTER TWO


Progressive elaboration Proceeding in steps and adding more detail as the project
move forward.
Phases and project life cycles We divide projects into phases to provide better
management control. Project life cycles generally define what technical work will be done
in each phase, when a deliverable is required, who will be involved in each phase, and how
each phase will be controlled. The project life cycle may also be used to define how a
phase and the associated deliverables will be approved.

Cost and staffing At the start of a project cost and staffing are generally low. As the
project progresses, the cost and the required staff will increase through each progressive
phase as a result of the increase in the number of activities. Work activities will peak during
the intermediate phases, and then drop off rapidly as the project reaches closure.
Risk and uncertainty Generally, risk and uncertainty are considered to be at the
greatest level during the start of the project but the certainty of project success
progressively improves through each phase (if proper planning continues and the
appropriate and necessary control processes are in place).
Project-driven organizations These organizations derive their revenue from
performing projects for other organizations through contractual agreements or they are
organizations that have adopted a management by project approach using systems that
have been established for tracking and reporting on multiple, simultaneous projects. Also
referred to as project-based.

Non-project-driven organizations Do not have the management systems in place to
manage and support projects. These organizations may have subunits that operate as
project-based organizations but the absence of project-oriented systems at the enterprise
level and the type of organizational structure in place may make project management more
difficult. Also referred to as non-project-based.

       ORGANIZATIONAL STRUCTURES

 The organizational structure, how departments, business units, resources,
 responsibilities, and job assignments are arranged, are important factors in the project
 planning process and may significantly impact project communication, the authority of
 the project manager, and the process of obtaining project human resources. An
 understanding of organizational structure and the influence of the stakeholders who
 control the functions and activities within an organization are critical factors in the
 project environment.
 Organizational structures vary by company and create unique challenges for the project
 manager. The effectiveness of the project manager and the ability to coordinate
 activities cross-organizationally is directly associated with how an organization is
 structured. Type of functional expertise, management hierarchy, authority levels, and
 conflicts associated with differing priorities and cultures within an organization require
 special handling and, in many cases, strong interpersonal and negotiating skills.


Glossary of terms         Key terms and definitions to review and remember

Accountability     To be answerable for the satisfactory completion of a specific
assignment.
Authority The power granted to individuals (possibly by their positions) that enables
them to make decisions. This is also referred to as legitimate or formal power.
Customer/User The person or organization that will use the final product or service
provided as a result of the project.

Organizations Groups of people and their associated resources and management
personnel who must coordinate their assigned activities in order to meet specific
objectives. Organizations are generally formed around a set of goals and the division of
labor and span of control.
Organizational Structures There are three main types of organizational structure.
   Functional Also known as chimney, smoke stack, or silo structure. In this structure
   there is generally one manager overseeing the work and the type of work that is
   associated with a specific skill or expertise. Examples: accounting, marketing,
   engineering, manufacturing.

                                                                                              31
32     CHAPTER THREE


      Matrix This type of structure is designed to maximize the use of resources by
      assigning resources to multiple functions. This creates an environment where
      employees may report to two or more managers. In this type of structure there will be
      horizontal as well as vertical channels of communication and, in some cases, intense
      negotiation for resources between project managers and functional groups.
      Pure Project or Projectized The organization is arranged by project with each
      project manager assigned total authority and accountability for the project. All project
      staff and personnel report directly to the project manager.

Performing Organization The business unit, enterprise, or entity whose employees are
most directly involved in doing the work of the project.
PMO Project Management Office--an organizational unit established to centralize and
coordinate the management of projects under its domain. A PMO will generally establish
organizational guidelines for managing projects. This includes methodologies, best
practices, policies, procedures, and templates.
Portfolio A collection of projects or programs and other work that are grouped together
to facilitate effective management of that work and those projects and programs to achieve
strategic objectives.

Project Coordinator This position is generally assigned by a higher level manager such
as a division manager, business unit vice president, or the CEO, and reports to that
manager. The position is granted some authority for decision making.
Project Expeditor Generally found in a functional organizational structure. The
expeditor is a type of staff assistant with no actual authority for decision making. This
position attempts to communicate information across functional boundaries.
Responsibility The obligation incurred by individuals in their roles in the formal
organization to effectively perform assignments.

      4. Project manager has high to total authority

      5. Equal authority between project manager and functional manager

      6. Project manager has a moderate to high level of authority

      7. Project coordinator

      8. One clearly defined manager
34    CHAPTER THREE


     9. Staff members grouped by specialty

     10. Project work is done independently

     11. Team members are often co-located

     12. Resources report directly to the project manager

     13. The project manager has no control of the project budget

     14. The project manager has full control of the project budget



                        Project success in a matrix structure is more likely to be achieved
                        if there is strong coordination and effective communication
                        between the functional groups interacting cross-organizationally.
                        This will help to ensure that project goals and objectives are
                        understood at the functional and project level. The project
                        manager works within the organizational culture and attempts to
                        create the integrative environment and cross-organizational
                        relationships that will drive project success.

The Project Management Center of Excellence--A Review

Some organizations have created support groups to develop methodologies, templates,
training programs, standards, and review processes to ensure consistency in the
management of approved projects. These centers of excellence are also referred to as
PMOs or Project Management Offices. PMOs may be created to coordinate activities
associated with large complex projects or to manage several projects in a portfolio. A PMO
may also be referred to as a "project office" or "program office."

The PMO can support an organization by:

* Centralizing coordination and communication across multiple projects
* Developing enterprise wide project management policies, procedures, templates, and
  documenting lessons learned
* Prioritization of projects and effective management of critical resources
* Centralized monitoring and standardized performance reporting for all projects
* Consolidating project progress and performance reporting for executive management
* Providing training, mentoring, and coaching for project managers
* Developing a historical database of lessons learned from exiting and previous projects
* Analyzing overall project risks, opportunities, and the interactions between projects



Kerzner "Quick tips" for the Project Management Institute
PMP(R) EXAM

Remember the three types of organizational structure--Functional, Matrix, and Projectized
(also known as pure project).

There are three types of matrix structures--Weak, Balanced, and Strong. The project
manager has the greatest level of authority in the strong matrix. In the balanced matrix, the
project manager and functional managers share an equal level of authority and there is a
potential for conflict due to a "two boss" reporting structure for the resources assigned to
the project.

Accountability The project manager commits to achieve the project objectives and is
answerable for overall project performance.

Authority Generally associated with position or rank and granted or assigned by senior
or executive management.

Study note:

Basic factors that influence the selection of a project organizational form:

1. Project size and complexity

2. Project length (duration)
                                                                ORGANIZATIONAL STRUCTURES         37


3. Experience with project management organization and methodologies

4. Philosophy and visibility of upper-level management

5. Project location

6. Available resources

7. The unique aspects about the project (the deliverables, new technologies, visibility, type
   of resources to be used, experience of the project manager, stakeholder needs and
   expectations, impact of the project on organizational objectives)

Answers to Questions and Exercises

1. Advantages--Specific manager, budgeting and cost control are easier to manage,
   effective control of technical issues and expertise, flexibility in the use of people
   resources, communications channels are well established, control over personnel,
   continuity of policies and procedures.

     Disadvantages--No specific responsibility for a project, coordination is difficult,
     decisions are based on politics and the influence of the strongest functional group,
     response to customer issues may be slow, tendency toward functional loyalty instead of
     project loyalty, communication through levels is slow and may become distorted.

2. Projectized or Pure Project. The project manager has the greatest level of authority
   and influence over the team. The team is a dedicated resource to the project with no
   other priorities. The project team performance reviews are linked to project success.

3. Functional--1,2,8,9,13, Weak Matrix--3,7, Balanced Matrix--5, Strong Matrix--
   6, Projectized--4,10,11,12,14

4. Advantages--Better utilization of resources, improved coordination between functional
   units, and expertise of functional units is used more efficiently, project manager acts as a
   coordinator and may have some authority.

     Disadvantages--Functional resources must manage multiple priorities and demands,
     resources may become over allocated, schedule conflicts, conflicts between project
     manager and functional manager about task assignments and control of work.

5.

a) Authority--the formal, justified or legitimate right granted to an individual (generally by
   position or rank) to make decisions and exercise available power to achieve a desired
   end. Responsibility--The obligation to effectively perform assigned tasks.
   Accountability--the acknowledgment and assumption of responsibility for actions,
   products, decisions, and policies including the administration, governance and
   implementation within the scope of the role or employment position and encompassing
   the obligation to report, explain and be answerable for resulting consequences.

b) The differences will depend on the type of organizational structure, the political
   environment, and the specific job descriptions associated with each group or entity. In a
   functional structure the project manager has very little or no authority, the functional
   manager has the greatest level. In a projectized structure the project manager has
   significant authority. Steering committees and sponsors generally have executive level
38     CHAPTER THREE


     authority and oversee the entire project environment making decisions associated with
     strategic direction.

6. A stakeholder is defined as any person or organization directly involved in or in some
   way affected either positively or negatively as a result of a project. Examples of
   stakeholders include project manager, sponsor, customer, contractor, supplier, and
   business unit.

7. The culture of an organization and the cultures of specific are associated with norms that
   have been developed over time and may influence the project planning process. Refer to
   the PMBOK(R) Guide--Fifth Edition Organizational Cultures and Styles section 2.1.1

9. Rules and procedures, planning processes, hierarchal referral, direct contact.

10. Resources cannot be easily transferred to other projects, there is usually additional cost
    associated with a projectized structure, and resources are held on the project longer
    than necessary. Motivation is challenging because projects are considered temporary
    and project employees will be concerned about future job opportunities.

11. Power struggles, different priorities causing conflicts, shifting people between projects
    causes delays, reduced ability to gain specialized skills.

12. Project size, project duration, available resources, project location, and experience of
    project personnel.

13. A project usually is managed using an organizational structure developed specifically
    to manage the project. The structure depends on the size of the organization and the
    type and complexity of the project. This structure within a structure can be perceived as
    adding another layer of bureaucracy.

      ORGANIZING AND STAFFING THE
        PROJECT OFFICE AND TEAM

 Achieving the objectives of a project and ensuring customer satisfaction requires a
 project team that is knowledgeable, has the necessary skill set, is fully committed to the
 project, and is managed by a project manager who possesses effective organization,
 communication, and leadership skills. Staffing the project with the appropriate team
 members is often a challenge due to organizational policies, organizational structure,
 and availability of resources. The project manager generally attempts to obtain the most
 highly qualified team members but must often accept competent performers who must
 receive additional training and may require additional supervision, coaching, and
 mentoring. Organizing the project team after selection by establishing a project
 organization chart will facilitate the communications between team members and clearly
 identify roles, responsibilities, and linkages between project team members.


Glossary of terms Key terms and definitions to review and remember

Competency      The skill or ability and capacity required to complete assigned project
activities.

Organization A group of people brought together for a specific purpose or to perform
some type of work within an enterprise.

Organization Chart A method for depicting interrelationships among a group of people
working together toward a common objective.

PMO Project Management Office--an organizational unit established to centralize and
coordinate the management of projects under its domain. It is an organization that
standardizes project related governance processes and establishes enterprise wide project
methodologies.

Project Charter A document issued by the project initiator or sponsor and formally
authorizes the existence of a project within an organization. The charter provides the
project manager with the authority to apply organizational resources to project activities
and define the actual decision making authority of the project manager.

                                                                                             41
42    CHAPTER FOUR


Project Organization Chart A graphic display of project team members and their
reporting relationships with the specific project environment. Detail depends on project
complexity and size of the project team.

Project Role This is the label or specific function assigned to a project team member or
stakeholder. It describes the portion of a project that will be completed, or the function that
will be performed by the individual. Roles and responsibilities of project team members
are often established by developing a Responsibility Assignment Matrix.

Project Team The personnel assigned to the project including the project manager,
functional managers, and in some cases the project sponsor and customer.

Responsibility Assignment Matrix A Responsibility Assignment Matrix (RAM) uses
the Work Breakdown Structure (WBS) and the organizational structure to link project
deliverables to the person assigned as responsible for its successful completion. The RAM
provides a picture of the key stakeholders involved in the project and clearly shows who is
responsible for each major deliverable. Another common form of a responsibility
assignment matrix is the RACI Chart--Responsible, Accountable, Consult, and Inform.

       Project manager's primary function is




                        The staffing process usually involves asking these questions:
                        What people resources are required? What skill levels are needed?
                        What organization will provide the resources? When will the
                        resources be needed? How many resources are needed? When
                        will the resources be available? When should the resources be
                        released?
                        What type of project organizational structure will be best?

    selection of the "right" people for the project team and the use of appropriate
    managerial, motivational, and leadership skills to keep the team focused on project
    objectives and the completion of deliverables. This means managing a variety of
    personality types. Review each type of person that may become part of the project
    team and match the characteristics of each type.

HUMAN RESOURCES MANAGEMENT


The four processes associated with Project Human Resources management
are:

          Develop Human Resource Plan
50   CHAPTER FOUR


         Acquire Project Team

         Develop Project Team

         Manage Project Team

Human resource planning These processes determine project roles, responsibilities,
and reporting relationships in the project environment.

Staffing management plan This is a subset of the project management plan and
describes when and how human resource requirements will be met. The staffing
management plan is developed based on the specific needs of the project. The plan
includes processes for acquisition of team members, a timetable for obtaining or recruiting
team members, the allocation of work among the resources, and the release criteria.
Training requirements, recognition and reward procedures, safety requirements, and
compliance requirements are also generally included in the staffing management plan. The
plan also addresses the impact of the project staffing process on the organization.

Organizational theory This is associated with how different organizational structures
affect the behavior of an organization. Remember the functional, matrix, and projectized
structures and how these structures may affect the project environment.

Acquiring the project team Consider the enterprise environmental factors such as
availability, experience, and cost. There are organizational processes to follow for
recruiting or hiring and roles and responsibilities should be clearly defined to minimize
miscommunication and conflict.

Developing the team After the team has been formed, the project manager must focus
some energy and attention on building the team. A well-managed and motivated team is
more likely to commit to the project objectives than a loosely formed group. Techniques
for team building include: general management skills as well as interpersonal or soft skills,
training, team-building activities such as offsite meetings and events, team ground rules
established early in the project, co-location (when applicable and feasible), recognition and
reward to maintain the motivation.

 Additional tips and practice items for the PMP(R) exam are included in each chapter and in
 the section of the workbook entitled PMP Exam and PMBOK Guide(R) Review.

 Maturity (age)                            Age is not always an indicator of strong
                                           experience. Age is often confused with
                                           experience. Decisions should be made based on
                                           performance and competency.

             MANAGEMENT FUNCTIONS

 General management functions such as planning, organizing, delegating, and
 administration are closely related to the functions of the project managers and, in many
 cases, overlap with the roles and responsibilities of the project manager. It is important for
 the project manager to fully understand the connection between his or her role as the key
 integrator for planning and effective management of the project team while maintaining
 an awareness of organization priorities. To be successful, project managers must be
 aware of the total project environment. This includes the cultural and social environment,
 the international and political environment and the physical environment. This
 understanding combined with general management skills, interpersonal skills, and the
 appropriate application of project management skills, tools and techniques will establish a
 foundation for project success. In addition, success of the project manager depends on an
 understanding of the team's physiological needs, emotional needs, motivational needs
 and the behavior displayed when people perform in groups and in teams.



                          An understanding of the social, cultural, political, and
                          international factors that may affect a project and the project
                          stakeholders is necessary in today's global project environment
                          and is directly related to professional and social
                          responsibility.




Glossary of terms          Key terms and definitions to review and remember

Accountability An obligation or willingness to accept the consequences and results of
project success or failure.

Authority The legal or rightful power to command, act, or direct the activities of others.
The right of an individual to make necessary decisions required to achieve objectives. Also
referred to legitimate or formal power.

Communications        There are different levels of communication and these levels require
specific skills

                                                                                              59
60   CHAPTER FIVE


     Downward communication Usually provides direction to the project team. It is
     generally associated with project job-related information such as delegation of activities,
     schedules, performance evaluation, and feedback to the team or to an individual.
     Downward is a term that is used to show direction of communication but is not meant in
     terms of authority or position power. A better term may be "teamward" communication.
     Lateral communication This is the horizontal flow of information to peers,
     functional groups, contractors, clients, and support personnel. Most of the
     communications activities associated with the project manager position will be the
     lateral type. This is also referred to as cross-organizational communication.

     Upward communication Primarily associated with information of interest to high-
     level or executive management for assessing overall project performance. This type
     of communication includes status about milestones, dashboards, major project
     issues, and items that require escalation. Exception reporting is sometimes used to
     provide project status or feedback about production or customer satisfaction issues
     when a major issue arises.
Controlling A management function or process for measuring progress toward an
objective, evaluating what remains to be done, checking for deviations from a plan,
minimizing deviations and taking the necessary corrective action to achieve objectives.
Measuring the degree to which progress toward objectives is being made, Evaluating and
determining the cause of significant deviations from planned performance, Correcting an
unfavorable trend or taking advantage of an unusually favorable trend.
Directing The implementation and execution of approved plans through others to
achieve or exceed objectives. Directing may involve staffing, training, supervising,
delegating, motivating, counseling, and coordinating resources.

Empirical A source of knowledge or data obtained by experimentation, studying the
experiences of others, or observation.
Leadership Developing a vision and strategy and motivating people to achieve that
vision. The ability to influence and cause people to follow. A style or behavior designed to
integrate both the organizational requirements and one's personal interests into the pursuit
of some objective. (There are many definitions of leadership).
     Autocratic Leadership Strong focus on task completion with very little concern
     for the project team. The leader has a high level of formal authority and makes or
     approves all decisions.

     Laissez-Faire Leadership The leader or project manager assigns all work to the
     project team or workers. The project manager makes occasional appearances but
     remains mostly inactive and not involved in day-to-day management. Generally the
     term means "let them do as they will."
     Democratic or Participative Leadership This leadership style encourages team
     members to communicate with one another and to become involved in decision
     making. Authority is often delegated to the workers or team members.
RAM Responsibility Assignment Matrix. The RAM is used to align major project tasks
with the individuals associated with each task. The RAM assists the project manager and
team in defining clear responsibility for project tasks. The RACI Chart - Responsible,
Accountable, Consult, Inform, is commonly used to document project work assignments

Responsibility The assignment of a specific event or activity and the expectation to
complete that task.
                                                                 MANAGEMENT FUNCTIONS       61

                          General management encompasses planning, organizing, staffing,
                          and controlling the operations of an ongoing enterprise. Project
                          management includes many elements of general management to
                          achieve project objectives




4. Exercise: From the director's chair



     *     As a project manager you will occasionally find yourself in the role of director
           (someone who supervises the actors and directs the action in the production
           of a show). Considering your role as director of a project, review each of the
           following terms and match them with the appropriate explanation.

 Staffing                 Training               Supervising             Delegating




 Motivating                       Counseling                     Coordinating




     A. Giving day-to-day instruction, guidance, and discipline
     B. Seeing that activities are carried out in relation to their importance and with
        minimum conflict
     C. Holding private discussions with another about how he or she might do better work,
        solve a personal problem, or realize his or her ambitions
     D. Seeing that a qualified person is selected for each position
     E. Encouraging others to perform by fulfilling or appealing to their needs
     F. Assigning work, responsibility, and authority so others can make maximum
        utilization of their abilities
     G. Teaching individuals and groups how to fulfill their duties and responsibilities

            Theory X, Theory Y, and Theory Z
            Understanding the effect of managerial styles on a project
            team is extremely important. The style of management
            and the motivational techniques used can significantly
            impact project team performance. Project managers may
            exhibit many styles of management throughout the project
            life cycle. The Theory X manager believes significant
            supervision is required. The Theory Y manager believes
            workers can perform unsupervised. Theory Z refers to a
            collective decision making environment.
                                                              MANAGEMENT FUNCTIONS      63


5. The X, Y, and Z Factor

Theory X and Theory Y are theories about human motivation created and developed by
Douglas McGregor in the 1960's and have been used in the study of human resource
management, organizational behavior, and organizational development. They describe two
very different attitudes about employees and workers regarding the willingness to
complete assignments. McGregor felt that companies followed either one approach or the
other.

Theory Z focused on increasing employee loyalty to the company by providing a job for life
with a strong focus on the well-being of the employee, both on and off the job. According
to Dr. William Ouchi, its leading proponent, Theory Z management tends to promote stable
employment, high productivity, and high employee morale and satisfaction.

   Review each situation and determine which style of management is being
      demonstrated:


    The project manager provides
    opportunity for discussion and
    participation in decision making
    The project manager spends a great deal
    of time observing and supervising the
    project team
    The project team collectively makes
    decisions
    The project manager directs all project
    work
    Strong discipline and punishment are
    used to induce the required work effort
    There is great opportunity for personal
    improvement and advancement
    An informal administrative control
    process is utilized

   A. Theory X
   B. Theory Y
   C. Theory Z

6. Are you motivated? Maslow's Hierarchy of Needs.

Maslow's hierarchy of needs is predetermined in order of importance. It is often depicted
   as a pyramid consisting of five levels:

     Correctly label each level of Maslow's Hierarchy of Needs.




7. More Maslow

     Classify each of the following situations by matching the
     associated level of Maslow's Hierarchy of Needs.




 Situation                                      Level in Maslow's Hierarchy of Needs
 A. A project manager expresses feelings of
    pride and personal accomplishment
 B. A new project team member requests
    frequent rest periods, wants the latest
    labor-saving devices, and expects
    efficient work methods
 C. A project team member expects to be
    rewarded publicly for doing his job well
 D. The project team is concerned about the
    total duration of the project and
    employment at project completion
 E. The project environment provides an
    opportunity to work with a team,
    interact with co-workers, and improve
    the ability to network with other teams
                                                               MANAGEMENT FUNCTIONS       65


8.      PM Quick Check:

a) True or false? Abraham Maslow developed the X and Y management theories.
     True _____
     False _____

b) Maslow postulated that once a need is satisfied, it loses its motivational importance and
is replaced by a different need.

     True _____

     False _____

Herzberg's Motivator-Hygiene Theory

Frederick Herzberg viewed motivation from a different perspective than Maslow. He
believed that certain factors, if present, can result in dissatisfaction among employees and
are referred to as hygiene factors. The work environment is associated with hygiene factors
but the existence of a good work environment does not necessarily result in a motivated
work force. In addition to a pleasant work environment, the manager must include
motivating factors that will encourage employees or project teams to expand their
potential and increase their interest in achieving project objectives.

9. Review the list of factors and place them in the appropriate columns.


 Hygiene Factor                                Motivator




     A. Compensation (pay)
     B. Sense of responsibility
     C. Opportunity for advancement
     D. Level of supervision
     E. Opportunity for personal growth
     F. Peer relationships
     G. Company policies and administrative procedures
     H. Challenging work
     I. Reward and recognition
     J. Working conditions
     K. Variety in the work
     L. A more autonomous environment
66     CHAPTER FIVE




                          The project manager who fails to build and maintain alliances and
                          positive relationships with team members and key stakeholders
                          will soon find opposition or indifference to project requirements
                          and objectives.


  Motivating Techniques: Items that will improve the project manager - team
member relationship
      * Assigning work that is challenging
      * Defining and communicating clear expectations about project work and performance
      * Providing appropriate feedback and proper criticism
      * Giving honest performance appraisals
      * Developing a team attitude toward completion of objectives
      * Providing the proper level of direction and support

10.       PM Quick Check: True or false?

      A. In Maslow's hierarchy of needs, the first level of the hierarchy is associated with
         hygiene factors such as good working conditions and appropriate
         levels of supervision.
         ______ True
         ______ False


      B. Theory Z managers are authoritarian in style, distrust their employees, and spend
         great amounts of time observing and directing the work that is being performed.
         ______ True
       ______ False
11. Authority and Power

           A project manager's authority is a combination of his or her power and influence.
      Authority is generally associated with rank or position and granted or delegated by
      higher level management or one's superiors. Power comes from credibility, expertise,
      and sound judgment. Failure to establish a project manager's authority may result in:

      * Poor communications
      * Misleading information
      * Antagonism
      * Poor working relationships with upper management, peers, and associates
      * Surprises from the customer or the project team


                          Common sources of power and authority problems:
                          Poorly documented or no formal authority
                          Dual accountability of personnel
                          Two bosses/project managers
                          Organizational encouragement of individualism
                          Shifting of personal loyalties from vertical to horizontal lines
                          Ability to influence or administer rewards and punishment
                                                                 MANAGEMENT FUNCTIONS        67


   Complete the following statement:

12. Power and Interpersonal Influences

   Project managers are frequently required to obtain performance results and achieve
   project objectives by influencing others to perform activities that they would not
   normally become involved in; therefore an understanding of interpersonal influences
   and types of power is critical for a project manager to be successful.

   Match each type of interpersonal influence with the correct description.

    Type of influence                             Description
    1. Legitimate power
    2. Reward power
    3. Penalty power
    4. Expert power
    5. Referent power

   A. A person has the ability or is enabled to offer salary increases, promotions, bonuses,
      and future work assignments.
   B. Officially empowered by rank or position in the organization (also known as position
      power).
   C. A person has strong ties to another person of much greater authority and influence.
      The ability to influence other people due to the challenges and attractiveness of a
      project.
   D. Ability to coerce people through actions that are perceived as resulting in unpleasant
      or undesirable results. Use of disciplinary actions or the threat of disciplinary action.
   E. Ability to influence others through special knowledge, experience, or demonstrated
      ability.

   Motivating employees so that they feel secure during a project may be difficult
    especially since a project is a finite life cycle. Describe methods that can produce a
    greater feeling of security among team members in a project environment

13. Power-Up

   What type of power or interpersonal influence is being used in
   each of the following situations? A. Formal, B. Reward, C.
   Penalty, D. Expert, E. Referent.

   1. As stated by the project sponsor in the project charter, I am the project manager and
      the team will be expected to take direction from me on any matter that is related to
      the project.
68    CHAPTER FIVE


     2. The project manager is a close friend of the CEO and they live next door to each
        other. It would be a good idea to do what she asks.



     3. I have two tickets to tomorrow night's playoff game. They are yours if you complete
        this assignment today.


     4. Either you complete the work assigned to you by the end of the week or the bonus
        associated with this project will be cancelled.


     5. The speaker is worth listening to. He has a lot of experience and has written several
        books on the subject.


14. Team Development

     Project managers must develop an environment that encourages teamwork and mutual
     support. The goal of every team member should be the successful completion of the
     project deliverables by working together and through effective integration of all project
     components. Sometimes barriers to team development are experienced. The project
     manager, as the leader of the team, must work toward the resolution of these barriers
     to achieve objectives.

     For each of the following potential barriers to team development, provide a possible
     approach or solution that may be taken by a project manager to overcome the barrier:


 Barrier                                         Recommended Solution or Action
 Different priorities and interests
 Role conflicts
 Project objectives and expectations are not
 clear
 Dynamic project environment--Scope
 changes, new or frequently changing
 objectives
 Competition over team leadership
 Lack of a defined team structure
 Selection of team personnel
 Credibility of the project manager
 Lack of team member commitment to the
 project
 Poor project communications
 Lack of sponsor, senior management, or
 executive-level support
                                                              MANAGEMENT FUNCTIONS           69


15. Leadership

       Project managers are expected to manage the project by integrating all of the
   components of the project, communicating information, negotiating for resources and
   maintaining control of overall project performance. For many project managers this
   means working with a team of people that may not report directly to the project
   manager. To accomplish the objectives of the project, the project manager must be
   perceived by the project team as a strong leader. This includes the development and
   communication of clear and complete project as well as individual expectations.




                       Project leadership is the ability to get things done well through
                       others. It is the ability to attract followers by providing a clear
                       destination, inspiring high performance, and motivating team
                       members to succeed. The effective leader attracts people
                       through sincerity and commitment and then motivates the team
                       to perform at a level higher than each team member believed
                       they were capable of.



   Roles of the leader and roles of the manager:
   Review each of the following roles and align them with either the leader or the
   manager using the table on the next page. Some roles may be shared by leaders and
   managers.

   A. Plan and budget
   B. Motivate and support
   C. Organize work groups
   D. Inspire team spirit
   E. Staff the project
   F. Establish a vision
   G. Align the team members
   H. Control the work flow
   I. Short-term view
   J. Winning team respect
   K. Establishing loyalty
   L. Enabling a group to perform as a team
   M. Tactical approach
   N. Excellent communicator
   O. Directs work
   P. Sees risks only as threats
   Q. Rewarding performance
   R. Explaining and selling an idea
   S. Setting objectives
   T. Focus on the bottom line
   U. Encouraging innovation
   V. Enabling the team
   W. Telling how and when
   X. Sees risks as opportunities
   Y. Long-range view

17. Communications

      Project managers must ensure that the right information gets to the right people at the
      right time and in a cost-effective manner. Effective communication is essential for
      project success and a process for communicating information should be established in
      the early stages of the project.
                                                             MANAGEMENT FUNCTIONS         71



                      Effective communication may include:
                      * An exchange of information
                      * An act or instance of transmitting information
                      * A verbal or written message
                      * A process by which meanings are exchanged between
                        individuals through a common system of symbols
                      * A feedback loop to ensure mutual understanding


Communications Breakdowns

Many project managers experience barriers that impede communications or distort
information. These barriers can disrupt project plans, create conflict, and ultimately
affect the outcome of the project. It is the responsibility of the project manager to
create an environment in which project communications requirements have been
aligned properly with the stakeholders involved. Many barriers can be overcome or
prevented by clearly stating objectives, establishing roles and responsibilities, and
identifying the specific requirements of the stakeholders involved in the project.

A. What are the four basic elements of the communications process?




B. How much time does a project manager typically spend communicating while
   managing a project?


  50%
  25%
  90%
  40%

C. In the space provided create a list of activities a project manager may perform that
   require some form of communication.




                      Typical communications barriers:
                      Sender credibility
                      Personality and interests
                      Attitude and emotion
                      Position or rank
                      Existing relationships
                      Selective listening
                      Lack of feedback
                      Evaluative tendency
                      Assumptions about the sender
72     CHAPTER FIVE


Communications Channels--A Formula Worth Remembering
      If you have ever wondered just how many channels of
      communication exist within a project team, try the formula
      N(N - 1) / 2 where N equals the number of people on the project
      team or N = X (X - 1) / 2 where X is the number of people on the
      team and N equals the number of channels. It is important to
      remember that communications channels in the team network
      are two- way and the project manager should be aware of the
      complexity of the network and the potential for communications
      breakdowns to occur.

18.       PM Quick Check: If the number of team members increases from 6 to 12, what is
      the increase in the number of communications channels?

       Current team member count = 6
       6 new members are added.
       The number of communications channels has increased by:



                         The communications environment is affected by:
                         Logistics and geographic issues
                         Personal contact
                         Virtual or extended teams
                         Technology--telephone, electronic data transfer
                         External factors--politics, economic climate, regulatory agencies
                         Internal factors--power games, withholding information, indirect
                         communications, blocking, or selective listening

      Project managers can expect to attend many meetings during the project life cycle and
      may be required to lead many of them. Meetings are actually projects within the
      project and, depending on the type of meeting and the intended audience, could
      require a significant amount of planning. Exercise: Create a list of activities that would
      be required to schedule a meeting and a list of guidelines that should be followed to
      ensure the meeting is a success.

Kerzner "Quick tips" for the Project Management Institute PMP(R)
and CAPM(R) EXAM


HUMAN RESOURCES MANAGEMENT AND COMMUNICATIONS
MANAGEMENT

Project management is related to many of the functions of general management--
planning, organizing, staffing, executing, and controlling.

The communications model refers to the importance of the region of experience of the
sender and the receiver, the encoding of the message and the decoding process, and the
potential distortion of the message as it passes through the personality and perception
screens. A feedback loop is necessary to ensure that the message is delivered and
understood to the satisfaction of the sender and receiver.

Feedback is critical for effective communication verify a complete understanding of the
message.

The communications channel formula is N(N - 1)/2 where N is the number of people on the
team. The result of this calculation provides the number of communications channels
within a team.

Project Communication can be formal, informal, verbal, or written.

Approximately 80% of communications is nonverbal. Maintain an awareness of body
language and other nonverbal forms of communication.

Listening is one of the most important factors in effective communication.

Communications barriers will be encountered during the project life cycle. Project
managers must maintain an awareness of potential barriers and develop methods to
prevent them or resolve them to minimize the potential negative impact on the project.

Every meeting should be considered to be a project. Meetings should be planned
appropriately to minimize unproductive time and should always include an agenda. Avoid
unnecessary meetings and establish meeting guidelines to ensure greatest productivity
and accomplishment of meeting objectives.

Project managers assume both leadership and managerial roles during project planning
and implementation.

Managerial styles--It is important to explain the differences between Theory X, Theory Y,
and Theory Z management styles.

Maslow focused on the Hierarchy of Needs--Physiological, Safety, Social, Esteem, Self-
Actualization

Herzberg focused on hygiene factors and motivating factors. Hygiene factors include work
environment, level of supervision, and compensation. Motivating factors include the
chance for advancement, rewards, challenging work, and bonuses.

Personal Influences and Power--There are 5 basic types of power: Reward power, penalty
power, expert power, formal/legitimate power, referent power

   MANAGEMENT OF YOUR TIME AND
            STRESS

 Time management includes more than activity duration estimates and developing a
 project schedule. The demands of the project manager assignment require an organized
 and disciplined approach to managing personal time. This is due to the often turbulent
 environment associated with managing a project. There are countless meetings to attend,
 email and text messages to respond to, daily conflicts to resolve, crises to handle, and
 change requests to analyze. With these factors in mind, effective time management
 becomes critically important to a project manager's success and well-being.

 Time is viewed by many project managers as a constraint and constraints often result in
 a sense of being rushed or short of time. The perceived improper use of time, the feeling
 that time is moving too fast, or the failure to manage time effectively can introduce a
 significant amount of stress into the daily activities of the project manager. It is,
 therefore, necessary for the project manager to find ways to use time as a resource
 instead of a constraint and to focus on how to manage and, if possible, reduce the
 factors that may result in stress.



                       Time management requires a well-thought-out and consistent
                       approach to one's daily activities. Here are some
                       recommendations for the project environment: Prioritize the
                       issues that require your attention, screen out the issues you
                       should not be involved in, determine your level of involvement in
                       the issues you accept, and do not assume responsibility for a
                       functional manager's issues.

                          Rules and actions for time management:
                          * Conduct a time analysis (create a daily time log to identify
                            your typical activities)
                          * Plan solid blocks of time for important things
                          * Classify your activities--important, urgent, not urgent, not
                            important, project related, administrative
                          * Establish priorities
                          * Establish opportunity cost for activities
                          * Train or condition your system (organization)--your boss,
                            subordinate, peers to respect your priorities and your
                            approach to your responsibilities
                          * Practice delegation

                          * Focus more on opportunities, less on problems


   Project management Quick Quote: "I have to implement plans I didn't design,
but if the project fails, I'm responsible." Become involved in planning decisions
whenever possible and always look for opportunities to gain the buy-in of your
team members by including them in the decision process.

3. Managing Stress
   Project managers may encounter several issues that could result in high levels of stress.
   These issues include but are not limited to: responsibility without authority, a need to be
   in control, a necessity for perfection, deadlines, role ambiguity, and conflicts with or
   among functional groups, span of control, crossing organizational boundaries, keeping
   up with fast-paced information. It is important for project managers to maintain
   awareness about stress and how it can impact job performance and personal health.

  Stressed out: Match the following behaviors with the stress symptom.


 Stress Symptom                        Behavior
 A. The hurry pattern                  1. Caffeinated drinks, late-night work assignments,
                                          making time to get it done
 B. Schedule addiction                 2. Avoiding big problems, dealing with short-term
                                          issues only, waiting until being forced to act
 C. Call-waiting syndrome              3. Low tolerance for waiting, complaining when
                                          service is too slow, red lights take forever, hang
                                          up if put on hold for more than a few seconds
 D. No sleep spiral                    4. Must stay connected because "they need me"
 E. Unfit for the task                 5. Often sick, headaches, upset stomach, stiff neck,
                                          low endurance
 F. Ostrich option                     6. Irritable, quick to react harshly to reasonable

                                          family
86    CHAPTER SIX



 Time management issues can be related to risk management. Many
 of the time robbers listed in this chapter can also be considered
 potential risks or sources of risk. Effective risk management
 includes identification of potential risk situations, prioritization of
 risks, determining the appropriate response, and monitoring and
 control of project risks. Remember that each knowledge area is
 inter-related. Effective planning requires an understanding of how
 each knowledge area is related to other knowledge areas. Risk
 management and time management are connected in many ways.
 Risk is a measure of uncertainty and usually results in a need for a
 contingency or other type of backup plan.




                         Priorities may change day-to-day. It is a good practice not to
                         postpone what your team can do today.


    Time management techniques: Things to do that will help improve your use
of time
     * Delegate
     * Follow a schedule
     * Decide fast whenever possible
     * Learn to say no
     * Start now
     * Do the tough part first
     * Travel light
     * Work at travel stops and while you are waiting
     * Refuse to do unimportant work
     * Look ahead
     * Ask yourself: Is this trip necessary?
     * Ask yourself: Is this meeting necessary?
     * Understand and manage your energy cycle
     * Rest when you need it
4.       PM Quick Check: True or false?

     A. The greater the number of hours worked, the greater the productive output of an
         individual.
       ______ True
       ______ False

     B. It is always up to the project manager to get it done. If the functional manager can't
        do it, do it yourself.
       ______ True
       ______ False

     C. You can always find the time later to take care of important matters.
       _______ True
       _______ False

   More quick quotes:

For a long time I admired people in a hurry, until I realized that they were merely under
stress. What I fear most about stress is not that it kills, but that it prevents one from
savoring life.
--Jean-Louis Servan-Schreiber, The Art of Time

Rule number 1 is, don't sweat the small stuff. Rule number 2 is, it's all small stuff.
--Dr. Robert S. Elliott, University of Nebraska cardiologist

Lost time is never found again.
--Benjamin Franklin, Poor Richard's Almanac

"The bad news is time flies. The good news is you're the pilot."
--Michael Altshuler

"Many people seem to think that success in one area can compensate for failure in other
areas. But can it really? True effectiveness requires balance."
--Stephen Covey

"One worthwhile task carried to a successful conclusion is worth half-a-hundred half-
finished tasks."
--Malcolm S. Forbes



                        Most people spend far too much time reacting to events, and too
                        little time doing things that are really important. Make sure you
                        know the difference.


    Stress relievers. There is no simple solution for managing and overcoming stress.
Stress reduction depends on the individual and the situation or environment. It is
important to identify ways for reducing stress to keep you focused more effectively on the
project objectives.

Ideas for stress relief: exercise, satisfaction through accomplishment of tasks, meaningful
use of time, taking time to do something enjoyable like working on a hobby, take a walk, or
use relaxation techniques several times a day.

5. List some fun or enjoyable activities that you can do to help keep stress under control:

 Fun or enjoyable                Fun activities that take        Fun activities that take
 activities that take only       a few hours                     half a day or longer

Quick tips for managing stress

Perform a personal SWOT analysis (Strengths, Weaknesses, Opportunities, and Threats)

A SWOT analysis is typically used to identify risks and opportunities and is an effective tool
in the strategic planning process. The concepts of the SWOT analysis can be applied to you
own personal life and or job situation

Identify your personal strengths--Identify what do you do best with respect to people, your
job, and other activities you perform. Identify the things you are respected for. Identify
your support network including family, co-workers, friends, professional associates.

Identify weak areas--Define your limitations, areas where you feel you are not strong,
where you feel people may criticize you. Determine if these weaknesses and criticisms are
fair.

Identify opportunities that are available to you--Make a list of opportunities that may be
waiting for your action. Determine how your strengths can be used to capitalize on
opportunities. What tools can be used to help you with the opportunities?

Determine the consequences of not dealing with your weaknesses. What damage can
these threats cause? Identify actions you can take to address and minimize or reduce the
threats you have identified.


Learn to see the difference between urgent and important

The important tasks are those that lead you to your goals, and give you most of the long
term progress and reward. Those tasks are very often not urgent. Many urgent tasks are
not really important. People tend to work on non-urgent, non-important tasks that give the
appearance of accomplishing many things but amount to very little. Focus on important
items that may not be urgent and those items that are important and urgent. Examples -
an urgent and important task may be a report to an executive that is due in two days. A
non-urgent, but important task may be to schedule a training session for a new technology
that will be introduced in the next year.


Writing a "to do" list is a simple technique that can increase your productivity by 20
percent or more, It also helps to clear your mind and save you energy and stress.

Time Management

Time management is about your personal use of available time and your own productivity
along with the appropriate planning and management of the project schedule. Review the
processes of time management in the PMBOK(R) GuideFifth edition: Plan Schedule
Development, Define Activities, Sequence Activities, Estimate Activity Resources, Estimate
Activity Durations, Develop Schedule, Control Schedule.
90   CHAPTER SIX


Remember that time management is integrated with other knowledge areas. Effective time
management includes risk assessment, contingency planning, team productivity and
performance, the scope of the project, the WBS, the level of quality required, the skill of the
resources, and many other planning items.

Stress can lead to burnout and burnout leads to lost productivity. The project manager
must maintain an awareness of stress-related symptoms that may appear during project
implementation. Lowering the stress of the project team as well as a project manager's
own stress is part of the project manager's responsibility. Consider the importance of
managing the balance between work and personal life.

Use a time planner or calendar regularly to manage schedules and avoid conflicts.

Use the WBS to break large assignments or tasks into their component parts. Breaking
large items into smaller more manageable components will assist in improving the
reliability of estimates and increase the ability to control work more effectively.

Take the time upfront during the project start-up to organize and plan the project.

Use the input of the project team to prioritize tasks. In most cases the team members will
have a significant amount of practical experience in determining activities estimates and
identifying the most effective sequencing of activities.

Start with the "big picture" and ensure that vision, goals, and objectives have been clearly
defined.

Remain flexible to changes. Change can be expected on just about any project. Instead of
resisting change, analyze it and determine if it is beneficial or if it is required.


Additional tips and practice items for the PMP(R) exam are included in each chapter and in
the section of the workbook entitled PMP(R) Exam and PMBOK(R) Guide Review.

                                CONFLICTS

 Conflicts will be encountered in most, if not all, phases of the project life cycle. They
 may occur at any level, between functional groups and among any of the project
 stakeholders. Conflicts arise when discussing resource requirements, schedules, activity
 durations, contract terms, and levels of quality. Project managers often assume the role
 of conflict manager and may be required to respond to a wide range of issues. This role
 is just one of the many roles a project manager may assume during the project.
 The ability to handle conflict requires an understanding of why conflicts occur, the
 sources of the conflict, and the specific needs of the stakeholders involved. In many
 cases conflict begins with poorly defined objectives and unclear roles and
 responsibilities. Another major root cause of conflict is communication. Many conflicts
 can be prevented and others reduced in intensity if the parties involved focused on the
 very basic concepts of effective communication.



                       Project Objectives: To avoid conflict, project objectives should
                       be based on the following criteria: specific, not overly complex,
                       measurable, tangible, verifiable, realistic, attainable, established
                       within resource constraints, and consistent with organizational
                       plans, policies, and procedures. These criteria are often summed
                       up using the word SMART--SPECIFIC, MEASURABLE,
                       ATTAINABLE, REALISTIC, and TIME BASED. Team members who
                       have been given a clear picture of the project at the start will
                       connect more quickly, and the probability of serious conflict is
                       often reduced significantly.



Glossary of terms         Key terms and definitions to review and remember

Collaboration Any cooperative effort between persons or organizations to achieve
common goals.
Compromise Determine a solution where each side leaves with some degree of satisfaction.
Generally, a give-and-take process where neither side achieves 100% of its objectives.

96   CHAPTER SEVEN


Conflict Conflict is a natural disagreement resulting from individuals or groups that
differ in attitudes, beliefs, values or needs. It can also originate from past rivalries and
personality differences. Other causes of conflict include trying to negotiate before the
timing is right, misunderstanding of information, different priorities, confusion about roles
and responsibilities.

Conflict Escalation The escalation of a conflict to make it more destructive, more
confrontational, or otherwise uncomfortable. Not to be confused with escalation of issues
to higher levels of management, which is necessary in many cases to resolve a conflict.

Conflict Management The variety of ways by which people handle grievances, clashes,
or the perceptions of right and wrong. It may include common techniques such as
avoidance, withdrawal, compromise, forcing, and collaboration.

Conflict Resolution The use of conflict analysis, negotiation, facilitation, mediation,
arbitration, or judicial settlement to resolve an issue. The act of arbitrating differences of
belief or opinion about a given state of conditions or circumstances. A process of resolving
a dispute or disagreement.

Forcing Imposing a decision or resolution without opportunity for suggestions or feedback

Needs Things that are essential to our well-being or to achieve an objective. Conflicts
arise when we ignore others' needs, our own needs or the group's needs. Needs are
different than desires or wants and focusing on needs generally provides a path to more
expedient conflict resolution.

Smoothing Removing short-range erratic variations, eliminating jagged edges. In
conflict management it is the attempt to give the appearance that progress is being made
or that the conflict is not as severe as originally perceived. Smoothing also refers to
avoiding discussion of any issues that may result in disagreement or conflict. Smoothing
does not necessarily resolve a conflict but may provide a short period of calmness.
Smoothing encourages dialogue and is used to make people feel comfortable by saying,
"we've agreed on two points thus far, and we can certainly find some agreement on the
remaining three points." Smoothing actually tries to "smooth out" the emotional arena
where conflicts take place such that people are willing to remain at the bargaining table.

Values Values are beliefs or principles we consider to be very important. Serious
conflicts arise when people hold incompatible values or when values are not clear.
Conflicts also arise when one party refuses to accept the fact that the other party holds
something as a value rather than a preference. Values may include such items as
timeliness, teamwork, quality, safety, respect, integrity, trust, truthfulness, courage.

Withdrawing Avoiding or stepping away from a conflict

                         Importance of Objectives in Conflict Management
                         The specific objectives of the project must be communicated to all
                         stakeholders. Failure to provide clearly defined objectives will
                         result in different interpretations at all levels of management and
                         across all organizations involved in the project.

                         Conflict is not always negative. It can lead to positive outcomes
                         when effectively managed. Healthy conflict can lead to.

1.       PM Quick Check:

     A. There are generally three types of objectives associated with a project. List the three
        primary types of project objectives: (Hint - think of the big picture, the intermediate
        levels, and the detailed outputs as the project progresses).

       1.
       2.
       3.



                         There are four main types of conflict - Man vs. Man, Man vs.
                         Society, Man vs. Nature, and Man vs, Self. In the project
                         environment these four types can emerge in many forms.
                         Consider these types and compare them with the conflicts you
                         have engaged in. You will see the similarities. Take time to
                         develop strategies for more effective handling of conflict. Consider
                         the root causes, the investment in time to resolve, and the
                         potential value of the outcome. (Note: it is acknowledged that
                         gender should be equally represented. The conflict types apply to
                         both genders).

     B. Well-written objectives are generally associated with five main criteria. These criteria
        are often described using a common word as an acrostic (each letter represents the
        start of another message). What is the word and what are the criteria? (Example -
        TEAM = Together We Accomplish More)
98     CHAPTER SEVEN




                          In some cases, objectives may start out very general in nature
                          and are refined or re-established as the project evolves and
                          progresses. This may be associated with the term progressive
                          elaboration which is defined as moving forward in increments,
                          adding more detail as you go.
                          The abbreviation MBO - Management by Objectives was
                          commonly used in many organizations as a means to emphasize
                          the need to establish clear direction and to have the ability to
                          compare results with the desired outcome.

2. Which of the following tools or techniques is specifically used to clearly define the roles
   and responsibilities of the project team members by aligning responsibility with project
   activities and tasks and thereby minimizing the potential for conflict between functional
   groups? Circle the correct answer.

     A. WBS
     B. RAM
     C. Activity List
3. Exercise: Reasons for Conflict. List at least 10 common sources of conflict. For
   additional learning value, provide possible solutions for, or preventive measures that
   can be taken to avoid or minimize the conflict.

 Sources of Conflict                            Bonus Section--Solutions




                        Experienced project managers realize that conflicts are inevitable,
                        but that good procedures or techniques can help resolve them.
                        Once a conflict occurs the project manager must:

                        * Study the problem and collect all available information

                        * Develop a situational approach or methodology

                        * Set the appropriate atmosphere or climate
                                                                                 CONFLICTS      99


4.       PM Quick Check:

     Conflict is a risk factor that always produces a negative result.

     True_____ False______

     Conflict always results in an unpleasant work environment and leads to more serious
       issues that cannot be resolved.

     True _____ False______

     The most effective method for resolving conflicts is to compromise.

     True _____ False______

5. Exercise: What would you do?

     Conflicts can occur with anyone over anything. How would you manage the following
       conflicts?

     A. Two functional managers on your team appear to be having personality clashes and
        almost always assume opposite points of view during decision-making discussions.
        They are both from the same functional organization.




     B. The manufacturing department reports that it cannot produce the end product
        according to engineering specifications.




6. Conflict is not always associated with negative results and damage. Explain why conflict
   may be beneficial to a project team.




     PM
     Knowledge               Many executives feel that the best way of resolving conflicts is
     Note                    by establishing priorities.

7. Fill in the blank:

      The connection between the organizational goals and project priorities is established by
      the ________________ and the project manager.

      A. Project Team
      B. Customer
      C. Sponsor
      D. Stockholders

8. Project Conflict Intensity

      During the project life cycle, a project team will go through several stages of team
      development. As the project life cycle progresses the level of conflict generally
      decreases in its intensity. In some cases the conflict intensity resulting from personality
      clashes can increase significantly to the point where it becomes a sensitive issue.
      Likewise, issues such as cost changes, schedule changes, availability of qualified
      resources when promised can also cause increased levels of conflict as the project
      progresses. The project manager must address these challenges through leadership
      and facilitation. Considering the progressive changes in the relationship of team
      members, name the five stages of team development and explain how conflict intensity
      changes in each phase.

11.The Conflict Meeting
      During the project life cycle, it may become necessary for the project manager to
      schedule a conflict or confrontation meeting between conflicting parties to find a
      solution. Review the steps in the process and match them with the correct description
      or explanation.

       Conflict Management in Practice - Applying techniques

Conflict Analysis Exercise: Use this approach to identify, understand, and
resolve conflicts.

Consider each question and develop strategies and approaches that will result in
a positive outcome or reduce the intensity of the conflict. .

*   Who are the groups involved?
*   Why are they involved?
*   How are they organized?
*   Are the groups capable of working together?
*   What is the history between the groups?
*   How did the conflict develop?
*   What are the main issues? What are the secondary issues?
104    CHAPTER SEVEN


*   How can negative issues be reframed into more positive statements?
*   How negotiable are the positions that have been taken?
*   What are the common issues?
*   What values and interests have been challenged?
*   What external constraints or other influences must be considered?
*   What past positive experiences can be used to influence cooperation?
*   What is the timeline or urgency of the conflict and the need for a solution?
*   How would an outside negotiator be received?
*   Is an external negotiator needed?



                         Identifying conflicts as early as possible in the project life cycle is
                         important. This will allow corrective action to be taken as quickly
                         as possible and generally with less effort. The longer we wait, the
                         greater the chance that the conflict intensity will increase to the
                         point where fewer options are available for its resolution.



Conflict Analysis Table - Use this table to assist in assessing conflicts that may be
 experienced during the project life cycle. Consider how the conflict originated, who is
 involved and their specific needs as well as their motivators.

Kerzner "Quick tips" for the Project Management Institute PMP(R)
and CAPM(R) EXAM


Human Resources Management and Communications Management

Remember the five types of conflict-handling modes -- Withdrawing, Smoothing,
Compromise, Forcing, and Collaboration.

There are many sources or causes of conflict. The most frequent causes are different views
about: schedules, project priorities (especially in a matrix environment), use of resources,
technical opinions, administrative procedures, budget, cost estimates, and personality
differences. .

Remember the five phases of team development -- Forming, Storming, Norming,
Performing, and Adjourning.

There are basically five types of power and influence that are associated with conflict and
the management of conflict: expert power, reward power, penalty power, legitimate or
formal power, and referent power.

Managerial styles: The application of Theory X, Theory Y, and Theory Z styles of
management may impact the level of intensity of conflicts and the frequency of
occurrence. Styles will vary and project managers may actually utilize different styles
depending upon the circumstances.

Effective and well planned Negotiation techniques are key factors in conflict management.

A well prepared project communication plan and a project management information
system may assist in the prevention of conflict.

Clearly defined and communicated objectives are a key element in reducing and
preventing conflict.

 Additional tips and practice items for the PMP(R) exam are included in each chapter and in
 the section of the workbook entitled PMP(R) Exam and PMBOK Guide(R) Review.

 Team Development Phase                     Conflict Intensity
 Forming                                    Low but will increase during this phase
 Storming                                   Highest -- Team members deal with
                                            uncertainty, roles, responsibilities
 Norming                                    Decreasing as work is performed
 Performing                                 Lowest -- Conflict is not eliminated but in this
                                            phase the team is working well together and can
                                            resolve most conflicts without project manager
                                            intervention
 Adjourning                                 Conflict is generally minimal in this phase
                                            and the team is focused more on the break-
                                            up of the team. There is some regret in this
                                            phase and it's a time for the project manager
                                            to offer support, acknowledgment, and
                                            encouragement about the futures

                         SPECIAL TOPICS

There are several situations and topics that require a project manager's attention. The
project manager's main focus of attention is the successful completion of the project but
the type of project, the diversity of the project team, the types of personal interfaces, and
the overall project environment may require the project manager to address and
manage many if not all of the following items:

             * Performance measurement

             * Compensation and rewards

             * Managing small projects

             * Managing mega projects

             * Morality, ethics, and the corporate culture

             * Internal partnerships

             * External partnerships

             * Training and education

             * Integrated project teams

             * Virtual Teams

             * Innovation Projects

             * Agile project management

Each of these items may be included in the project manager's job description or
assigned as a responsibility during project planning and implementation. The project
manager is expected to adapt to the project environment and develop strategies and
tactics to manage sometimes highly complex or demanding situations.

                          Benefits of performance measurement and appraisal
                          systems:
                           - Ensures that the right people with the right skills are assigned
                          to the appropriate positions.
                           - Identifies areas and issues that require attention before they
                          become unmanageable
                           - Appraisals provide an objective approach to measure levels
                          of individual and team accomplishment and to determine
                          appropriate compensation or corrective action.
                           - Identifies team and individual employee training
                          requirements.
                           - Provides project managers with the data needed to determine
                          if employees have potential for advancement or can assume
                          additional work assignments and responsibility.


Glossary of terms          Key terms and definitions to review and remember

Competency The ability of an individual to do a job properly.The ability to transfer and
apply skills and knowledge to situations and environments. The knowledge and skill and
the application of that knowledge and skill to the standard of performance required in
employment.

Conflict of Interest A situation where an individual is placed in a compromising
position where the individual can gain something of personal value or enrichment based
on the decisions made.

Expectation A result that is considered most likely to happen. A belief that is centered
on the future. Project managers develop a set of expectations for the project team early in
the project life cycle and revisit those expectations periodically. The defined expectations
provide the basis for preparing performance appraisals.

Mega Project A large undertaking with multiple components and technologies that
requires a significant amount of resources over a long period of time and at substantial
cost and risk.

Performance Appraisal A method by which the ability of an employee to complete job
assignments (generally in terms of quality, quantity, cost and time) and other assigned
responsibilities is evaluated and reported to the employee through feedback. Performance

                         The employee performance appraisal process allows the project
                         manager to identify, evaluate, and prepare developmental
                         actions to improve poor performance and to motivate an
                         employee to continue to reach for higher levels of performance.



1. Measuring Project Team Performance.

                        When properly prepared , the appraisal will provide particular
                        measures of job performance that assess the level and
                        magnitude at which the individual has contributed to the
                        success of the project including managerial performance and
                        team performance components.


  Study notes: Common challenges or issues that may be encountered by a project
manager in a small company or when working on small projects:

   * The project manager may have to assume several responsibilities and act as a
     functional manager and a project manager
   * The project manager may have to manage multiple projects
   * There may be limited resources, especially in a matrix environment
   * There is a significant need for strong interpersonal skills
   * There are generally shorter lines of communication
   * In small companies there is usually no PMO
   * In small companies there is a greater risk to the total company if the project fails
   * There may be greater financial constraints and tight control of funding in small
     organizations
   * Upper management may be more likely to interfere with or become directly involved
     in day-to-day project activities
   * Estimating activities are usually required to be more precise in smaller companies

   Study notes: Professional and Social Responsibility, Morality, Ethics, and
Corporate Culture

Professional responsibility is generally the mastery of a special body of advanced
knowledge that bears directly on the well-being of others. The special moral
responsibilities and requirements of a chosen field constrain professionals to apply their
knowledge in ways that benefit that community. Project managers must maintain
sensitivity to cultural, ethical, political, and geographical factors when planning a project
                                                                        SPECIAL TOPICS   117


and managing a team. There are factors both internally and externally that may create
significant challenges for the project manager and impact how decisions are made.

Internally driven adversity--being asked by your management to take action that is in the
interest of your company but violates your own moral and ethical beliefs:

   * You are asked to lie to the customer in a proposal in order to win a contract
   * You are asked to withhold bad news from your management
   * You are asked to withhold bad news from the customer
   * You are ordered by management to violate ethical accounting practices to make
     your numbers look good to senior management
   * You are instructed to ship a potentially defective unit to a customer to meet
     production quotas
   * You are asked to cover up acts of embezzlement or charge the wrong account codes
   * You are asked to violate the confidentiality of a private personal decision by a team
     member

Externally driven adversity--you are asked by your customer to take action that may be in
the customer's best interest but violates your own moral and ethical beliefs:

   * You are asked to destroy information that could be damaging to the customer during
     legal action taken against the customer
   * You are asked to lie to consumers to help maintain the customer's public image
   * You are asked to release unreliable information that could be potentially damaging
     to a customer's competitor

Tasks associated with Project Management Professional and Social
Responsibility

   *   Ensure individual integrity and professionalism
   *   Contribute to the project management knowledge base
   *   Enhance individual competence
   *   Balance stakeholder interests



                       Cultural difference should be considered when determining
                       recognition and rewards




14. What would you do? Review each situation and select a response that most closely
    represents your viewpoint.

   A. An assistant project manager had the opportunity to be promoted and manage a
      new large project that was about to begin. She needed the project manager's
      permission to accept the new assignment, but if she left, the project manager
      would have to perform her work in addition to his own for about three months.
        a) Deny the promotion due to the work load
        b) Delay the promotion until a suitable replacement can be found and trained
        c) Approve the promotion and develop a transition process for the assistant project
           manager
        d) Convince the assistant project manager that the promotion is not really a good
           opportunity
118    CHAPTER EIGHT


      B. In the first month of a twelve-month project the project manager discovers that the
         end date was too optimistic and cannot be met.

         a) Hold the information and wait for a miracle to happen
         b) Change the scope statement to reduce the work required
         c) Advise the customer and the sponsor about the issue and provide alternatives
         d) Continue with the project as planned and arrange for a new project manager to
            take over as soon as possible

15.      PM Quick Check: Review each statement and select the best word or
      phrase in parentheses that completes the statement most appropriately.

      1. A good project manager will explain the individual and team performance appraisal
         process (before/immediately after) the first major milestone.
      2. Proper (financial compensation/rewards to improve morale and stimulate) is / are
         the greatest motivator(s) for project teams.
      3. The first step in job classification and creating job descriptions is to (define job
         titles/establish base pay).
      4. Traditionally, the purpose of the performance appraisal is to (provide justification
         for salary treatment/prepare for future goal setting).
      5. The performance of the project manager is measured through (technical
         implementation and task performance/business results and managerial ability).
      6. Companies that promote morality and ethics usually create (internal adversity/a
         supportive working environment).

16. Internal and External Partnerships

      Project managers depend on functional groups to provide resources that are
      competent and to provide support to accomplish project objectives. Establishing
      partnerships with internal and external organizations and developing good working
      relationships will assist the project manager in obtaining the best available resources
      and creating a willingness to cooperate. Describe actions a project manager may take
      to establish partnerships with internal functional groups or external organizations such
      as subcontractors and customers.

17. Training and Education

   Project managers must continually assess the needs of their project teams as well as
   their own personal needs for continued self-development. There are three general
   opportunities for training to occur: on-the-job training, formal education, and
   knowledge transfer.

   To ensure that project objectives are achieved, what activities should a project
   manager perform to assess the capabilities of each team member and to determine the
   training needs of the project team?

19. Virtual teams

    In today's project environment the project manager can expect to manage project
    teams that are dispersed geographically due to the nature of the project. These
    dispersed teams, also known as virtual teams present unique challenges to the project
    manager. Consider each of the following virtual team situations and develop a
    potential solution. There may be several potential solutions to each situation.

Situation                                      Solution

Time zone differences make it difficult to
   organize team conference calls

Team members have different perceptions
   of the project scope

Cultural differences are creating conflicts
    among some team members

Technology differences make it difficult to
   keep team members updated and
   informed




20. What are the basic measures used in the development of team incentive plans?

21. Ethics and professional conduct are critically important in the project environment. In
    order to ensure awareness of these factors The Project Management Institute(R)
    developed a Code of Ethics and Professional Conduct which is divided into four
    sections. What are the four sections?

22. Acting in a professional manner is an expectation established by many organizations
    and it is common for an organization to conduct mandatory annual reviews of its
    policies regarding profession conduct. Provide examples of the items that may be
    discussed during these reviews.

23. Organizations establish relationships with suppliers to ensure the appropriate level of
    quality, reasonable price for services, and reliability. What are the three most common
    types of external partnerships established by an organization?

24. A project manager may be required to establish a specific team of people to develop a
    complex or highly integrated product or service. These special teams are referred as
    Integrated Product Teams or IPTs. What skills or characteristics would you seek when
    forming an integrated product team?

25. In today's project environment, virtual teams (also known as distributed teams) present
    unique challenges for the project manager. What are the typical characteristics of the
    virtual team and what factors are important to ensure the team works effectively?

26. Project management continues to evolve and in the last 12 years agile project
    management has been growing in popularity especially in the software development
    field. What are the major differences between agile project management and what is

Kerzner "Quick tips" for the Project Management Institute PMP(R)
and CAPM(R) EXAM

Maintain awareness that professional responsibility is embedded in each knowledge area
of the PMBOK(R) Guide.

Review the PMI(R) Code of Ethics and Professional Conduct for information about ethics,
guidelines, and requirements that professional project managers are expected to honor.
The purpose of the Code is to instill confidence in the project management profession and
to help an individual become a better practitioner.

The PMI(R) Code of Ethics and Professional Conduct focuses on: Responsibility, Respect,
Fairness, and Honesty

Your personal integrity is the key factor in professional responsibility.

Performance appraisals, just like project reviews, should be conducted at specific intervals
to measure progress and identify areas for improvement.

Become familiar with your company's policies regarding diversity, culture, and ethics.

Review performance measurement criteria and expectations with your project team at the
start of the project. Communicate objectives early and provide feedback on a regular basis.

Review project constraints and assumptions during project status meetings and scheduled
performance reviews.

Creating internal partnerships with functional managers is an effective way of ensuring
that project objectives will be accomplished. Maintain an awareness of functional manager
priorities and constraints and establish positive working relationships.

                                                support, involve the sponsor as needed

17. Obtain information about the competency level of the team members, review past
    performance, obtain appraisal information from functional managers, interview team
    members to determine abilities, ask for input about training needs, and assess work
    output early in the project.

18. The Integrated project team (IPT) includes the supplier's project team, the client's
    project team, and the required consultants and industry specialists required to achieve
    project objectives. The IPT brings together the designers, construction resources,
    maintenance resources, and other entities that will exchange information or provide
    deliverables in support of the project's product.

Situation                                        Solution

Time zone differences make it difficult to       Alternate meetings time to balance the
   organize team conference calls                    needs of the team members

Team members have different perceptions          Schedule a project kick off meeting (in
   of the project scope                             person if possible) to review project
                                                    objectives and project scope of work.

Cultural differences are creating conflicts      Review the various cultures associated with
    among some team members                         the team, investigate areas of potential
                                                    conflict. Set expectations based on the
                                                    needs of the project and the client. Seek
                                                    additional support and advice from
                                                    resources who are trained in this area.
                                                    Research the conflicts to gain an
                                                    understanding before taking action.

Technology differences make it difficult to      Establish technology standards at the start
   keep team members updated and                     of the project. Look for common
   informed                                          applications. Research technology that
                                                     is available with the organization. Create
                                                     standards for communicating
                                                     information



20. Project milestones, project completion, value added.

         THE VARIABLES FOR SUCCESS
Project success for many executives, managers, project managers, and project teams
refers to the elements of the Triple Constraint--Time (Schedule), Cost (Budget), and Scope
(Quality and Performance Specifications). Success is actually more than completing the
project within the triple constraint. Success depends on a systems approach to the project
where all project elements, planning components, and deliverables of the project are
coordinated in an inter-related manner and managed with an understanding that failure in
one area will most likely have an effect on many other areas of the project. Today, the
competing demands associated with project success have grown in complexity and go
well beyond the familiar Triple Constraints. They reach deeply into the values of the
supplier organization and the buyer organization. Safety, aesthetics, risk sensitivity, and
the values of society impact the perception of success.
Establishing and communicating success criteria are two of the key responsibilities of
the project manager. During the planning process, the project manager provides the
team with the information needed to prepare the project plan and establish the controls
to keep the project on track to achieve client satisfaction and project success. Common
variables for project success include:
  * Setting expectations early and intentionally
  * Planning--including the relationships with the triple constraint and other competing
    demands
  * Predicting project success--through analysis and performance measurement
  * Project management effectiveness
Project success, in many ways, depends on the actions of three key stakeholder groups:
the project manager and team, the project sponsor or parent organization, and the
customer or client organization--the group that will ultimately receive the final project
deliverable. Assuring project success requires the following actions:
  *   Select the "right" people for the project team
  *   Develop commitment and a sense of "urgency" to complete the project successfully
  *   Establish the appropriate level of project manager authority and management support
  *   Establish a good relationship with client, sponsor, and team members (incl.
      functional managers)
  *   Create a positive public image about the project
  *   Establish a participative relationship with team members for decision making and
      problem solving
  *   Develop realistic project objectives for cost, schedule, and performance (SMART objectives)
  *   Anticipate problems and establishing risk management plans and back-up strategies
  *   Create an appropriate team structure that is flexible, supportive, and has minimal
      managerial levels to enhance communication
  *   Maintain an awareness of project team needs and establishing a strategy for motivation
  *   Maintain focus on the project objectives and the final end product
  *   Establish a change control process and communicating the importance of managing
      change
  *   Develop a strategy for rewarding and recognizing the project team


                                                                                             127
128   CHAPTER NINE




                       A project cannot be successful unless it is recognized as a project
                       by upper level management. The project charter is a means to
                       establish the "official" existence of the project. Without upper
                       management support the project manager will not be able to
                       obtain the resources required to achieve project objectives. Project
                       success is also associated with the value that is achieved at project
                       completion. In some cases, true project value may not be realized
                       until many years after the project is completed.


Glossary of terms Key project management terms and definitions to
                             review and remember

Best Practice Something that works well on a repetitive basis. Something that leads to
a competitive advantage. Something that provides value to both the buyer and seller. A
process, technique, or action that has been proven to produce superior results consistently
and can be applied enterprise-wide.

Deliverable A tangible, verifiable work output. Projects are generally expected to
produce several deliverables that will be integrated to achieve the final aggregated or
summary deliverable. Project management deliverables include the project plan,
subsidiary plans, work breakdown structure, and status reports.
Expectation Something that is considered reasonable, due, necessary, or obligated.
The project manager and team set expectations early in the project life cycle. Expectations
may be focused on timeliness, quality, communication, level of precision, and reliability.
Functional Manager Generally a subject matter expert or technical expert from a
specific functional group such as engineering, design, or other technological areas who
may control or manage resources required to meet project objectives. The Functional
manager is a person with management authority over a specific organizational unit that
performs a specialized function or produces a product.

Lessons Learned Information obtained through experience that may be shared to
improve performance, increase opportunity, or prevent occurrence of negative events,
results, or activities.
Project Sponsor The person or organization that has authorized the project and
provides the funding to support the project. (Note: Some organizations feel that it is best
for the ultimate sponsor to be associated with an area or internal entity that does not have
a direct vested interest in the project. This allows for impartial decisions to be made, such
as termination for failing to provide the expected value or to reassign resources to a
higher priority project.
Stakeholder Any person or organization directly involved in or impacted either
positively or negatively as a result of the project.

Triple Constraint The triple constraint consists of three major project elements,
Schedule, Cost, and Performance Specifications (scope and quality), usually depicted as a
triangle and indicating the commonly defined competing demands associated with project
success. The triple constraint emphasizes the relationship between each of the elements
and the impact of a change to any of the elements or sides of the triangle. Traditionally,
most project trade-off decisions were based on the relationships with the triple constraint:
                                                              THE VARIABLES FOR SUCCESS   129



   Cost/Budget The estimated cost to deliver the product or service
   Schedule      The estimated time line for the project

   Scope/performance Specifications           Also refers to quality
Value An amount, as of goods, services, or money, considered to be a fair and suitable
equivalent for something else; a fair price or return. Monetary or material worth. Worth in
usefulness or importance to the possessor; utility or merit, In the project management
environment the perception of value is associated with the views of the project
stakeholders and their specific definitions of value. Value may be seen in terms of
achieving the objectives defined for the project, or it may also be defined in terms of
return on investment, level of customer satisfaction, and benefits that may be realized in
the future, well after the project has been completed.,

                        After completion and acceptance of deliverables, many projects
                        require a period of time (one to two months or more) after the
                        work is completed for administrative reporting, final cost
                        summary, and hand-off to the receiving organization. An
                        acceptance period may be established within the contractual
                        terms and conditions of the project.


4. Major Causes of Project Failure

  Project managers concentrate on the successful completion of a project but should
  maintain an awareness of why projects may fail. There are several reasons for project
  failure but the most common are:

  * Selection of a concept that is not applicable or does not have a sound basis
  * Forcing a change at an inappropriate time
  * Selecting the wrong person as project manager--assigning a person who possesses
    significant technical skills but does not have sufficient managerial and interpersonal skills
  * Executive or upper management is not supportive of the project--lack of support from
    management will, in most cases, create significant roadblocks and eventually result in
    project cancellation
  * Inadequately defined tasks--a system for planning that includes task definition,
    development of a schedule, estimated costs, and control processes is required or the
    project team will experience considerable amounts of rework, delays, and additional costs
  * Management techniques--a tendency to do more than what is required, failure to
    build teamwork, lack of motivation, over supervision, and poor communications skills
    will contribute to project failure
  * Unplanned project termination--This may be caused by a change in strategic
    direction, loss of funding, uncontrolled costs, poor quality, lack of team commitment,
    or contract default

Exercise: For each of the potential reasons for project failure provide a possible
solution or recommended preventive action.

  Reason for Failure                                     Preventive action
  1. Concept is not applicable or is unsound


  2. Forcing a change at the wrong time


  3. Selecting the wrong person as project
     manager
  4. Management is not supportive of the project


  5. Inadequately defined tasks


  6. Ineffective management techniques
132    CHAPTER NINE




  Reason for Failure                                  Preventive action
  7. Unplanned project termination:
     a) change in strategic direction
     b) loss of funding
     c) uncontrolled costs and other variances
     d) poor communication


5. Project Management Effectiveness

  Project success and a successful career path are dependent upon the project manager's
  ability to establish and maintain good working relationships with management as well
  as the project team. Clear expectations between the project manager and all key project
  stakeholders must be established early in the project planning process. There are four
  key variables in measuring the effectiveness of the project manager in dealing with
  stakeholders: Credibility, Priority, Accessibility, and Visibility.

Exercise: Review the list of characteristics and match them with the key
variable of management effectiveness.


  Project Management                             Characteristic of effectiveness
  Effectiveness--Key Variables
  Credibility


  Prioritization


  Accessibility


  Visibility




  a) sound decision maker
  b) "selling" the importance of the project and connecting it with organizational goals
  c) experience from a variety of assignments
  d) making a positive impression when presenting the project to upper management
  e) emphasizing facts over opinions
  f) ensuring that others receive appropriate credit for work performed
  g) obtain testimonial support for the project from functional groups, customers, and
     other managers
  h) ability to communicate as needed with stakeholders
  i) become personally known by managers in several departments including upper
     management
  j) create an environment where managers and customers desire your involvement
  k) conduct timely informational meetings
  l) use available publicity media appropriately
  m) create a common understanding about the project through presentations and
     emphasize project successes
                                                              THE VARIABLES FOR SUCCESS    133




 Generally, a project manager is expected to:
 Assume total accountability for project success or failure, provide
 timely and accurate project reports and information, minimize
 disruption of organizational operations during project execution,
 manage interpersonal issues among project team members,
 maintain a self-starting attitude and approach, and grow in
 experience with each assignment.


6. Managing Expectations

  Project success is dependent not only on the abilities of the project manager but also on
  a set of clearly defined expectations that have been established between the project
  manager and the project sponsor or executive, between the project manager and project
  team members, and between the project manager and the customer.

  The following items are typical expectations that are established during the beginning
  stages of the project life cycle. Review each item and determine if it is an expectation set
  between the project manager and project sponsor/upper management or between the
  project manager and project team.

  Expectation              Project team   Sponsor/executive             Project manager
                           expectation of expectation of the            expectation of

 Lessons can be learned during any phase of a project. To make
 them useful they should be documented and shared with other
 project managers and project teams within your organization.
 Sharing lessons learned is associated with the Professional and
 Social Responsibility domain of Project Management. Transfer of
 knowledge, increasing the project management historical data
 base of your organization, and enhancing the processes you work
 with are all associated with task 2 of the Project Management
 Professional Role Delineation Study published by the Project
 Management Institute.

7.          The Importance of Lessons Learned

         PM Quick Check: True or false?

a. Lessons learned should only be reviewed and documented after the project has been
   completed.
     _____ True
     _____ False

b. Project success will be assured if the project team maintains control of the scope,
   schedule, and cost of the project.
     _____ True
     _____ False

8. Best Practices

     Most organizations, especially those which are considered "project based," have
     experienced the advantages of documenting and sharing lessons learned. Examples of
     lessons learned include:
     *    Establishing project life cycle phases
     *    Standard methodology for planning
     *    Use of templates for planning, scheduling, control, and risk management
     *    Control of customer and contractor-generated changes
     *    Use of earned value measurement

     It is important to note that what is considered a best practice in one organization may
     not work effectively in another organization. The project manager and project team may
     be required to adapt industry best practices to meet their organization's specific needs.

     Describe at least one best practice for each of the following items that would be useful to
     share with project team members and other project managers:



Project Scope




Stakeholders




Standards

  9. Explain what is meant by "Critical Success Factors and provide examples that would
  typically be used in the project environment.

  10. Consider the following: You are assigned to a PMO and have been requested to
  develop a template that will define the criteria for establishing a "Best Practice" for your
  organization. What criteria would you use?



                           Best practices are those actions or activities undertaken by the
                           company or individuals that lead to a sustained competitive
                           advantage in project management.




Kerzner "Quick tips" for the Project Management Institute PMP(R)
and CAPM(R) EXAM


The topic "Variables for Success" is most closely related to the following knowledge areas
in the PMBOK(R) Guide: Understanding the Project Environment, Interpersonal Skills,
Project Life Cycle and Organization, Project Management Processes, Integration
Management

The most common factors used to determine project success are the elements of the Triple
Constraint--Time, Cost, and Scope (Scope is also associated with quality and performance
specification).

Project success is not based solely on managing the triple constraint. Customer
satisfaction, minimizing substantial changes, team satisfaction, and minimizing the impact
of the project on business operations are also key factors.

There are five major process groups that are integrated in the planning of a project:
Initiating, Planning, Executing, Monitoring and Controlling, and Closing.

The project manager works in collaboration with the project team to determine what
processes are appropriate and at what level of effort to achieve project success.

Utilize lessons learned and project failures to identify problem areas and develop
preventive measures.
                                                                 THE VARIABLES FOR SUCCESS   137



Preventive measures are generally less costly than repair, rework, and failure.

A project review at the end of a phase or at the completion of a milestone will assist in
identifying areas for improvement and increasing the probability for overall project
success.

Review stakeholder needs to ensure that project performance is on track with expectations.

Review project planning assumptions and constraints on a regular basis. Validate
assumptions and maintain an awareness of how constraints may impact project
performance.


 Additional tips and practice items for the PMP(R) exam are included in each chapter and in
 the section of the workbook entitled PMP(R) Exam and PMBOK Guide(R) Review.

          WORKING WITH EXECUTIVES

Project managers are tasked with many responsibilities during the life cycle of a project.
Establishing a positive relationship with executives and continually interfacing with them as
the project is planned and implemented are major factors in achieving project success and
securing additional project assignments. The role of the executive in the process of
managing projects varies significantly from one organization to another but generally the
project executive is referred to as the project sponsor. The project sponsor is involved in the
project selection process and governance processes (determining which projects are
approved for implementation and those projects that should be denied or terminated) and
provides or authorizes the necessary funding and resources to achieve project objectives.
The project sponsor's role includes providing guidance about: project objectives and their
alignment organizational strategy, setting priorities, creating or approving the project
organizational structure, initial upfront planning and conflict resolution related to resources,
budget, and prioritization. In the early stages of the project the project sponsor will oversee
the planning process and provide support to the project manager in several activities:
      * Establishing the appropriate project objectives
      * Aligning the project with strategic organizational goals and approving the
      project charter
      * Providing information about organizational environmental factors and political
      issues that may impact the project
      * Justification and prioritization of the project within the performing organization
      * Providing guidance regarding organizational policies and procedures
      * Establishing the appropriate level of executive management--client contact and
      support

                       When establishing a relationship with the project sponsor, the
                       project manager should become familiar with what are described in
                       the PMBOK(R) Guide--Fifth Edition as organizational process assets
                       (policies, procedures, and standards) and enterprise environmental
                       factors (organizational culture and political climate as examples).
                       Knowledge of these items may assist in defining expectations,
                       developing more complete and reliable plans, and developing
                       strategies for managing project issues that may require sponsor
                       involvement.


                                                                                              143
144   CHAPTER TEN


During the initiation of a project or during the project kick off meeting the project sponsor
assumes an active role in setting objectives and providing guidance to the project manager.
In this early stage of planning the project sponsor works with the project manager and
establishes project priorities in both business and technical terms. During the execution of
the project the sponsor provides support on an as-needed basis and takes a more passive
role. Day-to-day activities are managed by the project manager and the sponsor becomes
involved when necessary to assist in resolving issues that are beyond the authority level of
the project manager. To avoid the possibility of micromanagement (also known as executive
meddling) the project manager must establish clear expectations with the sponsor at the
start of the project and communicate effectively with the sponsor throughout the project life
cycle by providing project progress, status, and forecast reports regularly. Today's project
environment demands more fluid information flows and project organizations have turned to
the use of project dashboards as more efficient method for providing project information.
Dashboards allow for customization to address the needs of specific stakeholders.

Glossary of terms          Key terms and definitions to review and remember

Enterprise Environmental Factors Factors that have been established over time or
influence an organization's general operating practices. These factors include the
organization's recognized culture, government or industry standards, existing human
resources and capabilities, infrastructure, the political environment, and organization risk
tolerances,
Exit Champion/Sponsor: This is an individual or committee at the senior-most levels of
management that periodically performs a health check on projects to make sure that the
project is performing at an acceptable level and should either continue or terminate. Project
sponsors generally do everything possible to support the project manager and to make sure
that the project meets objectives and remains aligned with organizational strategies to
ensure it will continue. The champion determines whether or not the resources can better
serve the company elsewhere, whether the enterprise environmental factors have changed,
whether the assumptions are still valid and whether the perceived value will be realized at
project completion. Champions validate the continuation or termination of the project and
generally have the authority to override the decisions of the project sponsor.
Objective A planned or intended outcome. (Refer to the Acronym SMART)

Organizational Process Assets Formal and informal processes established and in
use within an organization. These may include standard policies for safety, product quality,
communications requirements, financial controls, change control, risk management, and
project closure procedures.
Project Sponsor The person or organization that has authorized the project and
provides the funding to support the project.
Scope Creep Unauthorized or uncontrolled changes to the project scope. Scope creep
sometimes occurs when a project team member or project manager attempts to exceed
customer expectations by providing additional work or product features that are not
included in the approved scope of work.

SWOT Analysis A strategic planning method used to evaluate the Strengths,
Weaknesses, Opportunities, and Threats involved in a project or in a business venture. It
involves specifying the objective of the business venture or project and identifying the
internal and external factors that are favorable and unfavorable to achieving that objective.
The SWOT analysis is discussed in the PMBOK(R) Guide--Fifth edition Chapter 11 and in the
Kerzner textbook in chapter 17.

    policies and communicates
    information about
    organizational process
    assets
 8. Becomes involved in
    solving major project
    related problems


3. Managing the Micromanager

  Multiple choice: The most effective method for managing a project sponsor or executive
  who closely manages, observes, and influences day-to-day project manager activities is:

  a) Provide the sponsor with large amounts of administrative work to prevent the
     sponsor from becoming involved in the project activities.
  b) Ask for role clarification and establish expectations for providing project information
     and managing project activities.
  c) Invite the project sponsor to every project status meeting and have all team members
     provide status reports directly to the project sponsor.
                                                                   WORKING WITH EXECUTIVES      147




                         The project sponsor works with the project manager to establish
                         objectives, set priorities, create the project organization,
                         communicate organizational policies, establish client-executive
                         contact, obtain key staffing, establish monitoring and control
                         processes for use during execution, and develop processes for
                         escalation and conflict resolution.


4. Red, Green, and Yellow

  Project-based organizations often refer to project status using what is known as the
  "traffic light" reporting process or red, yellow, and green status condition.


 Green light or green status                     Work is progressing as planned. No major
                                                 issues. Sponsor involvement is not required.
 Yellow light or yellow status                   A potential problem exists. The sponsor is
                                                 informed but sponsor action is not required
                                                 at this time.
 Red light or red status                         A problem exists that may affect the project
                                                 scope, schedule, or budget. Sponsor
                                                 involvement and action is required.

Categorize the status of each of the following situations as green, yellow, or red light.

 Situation                                         Status Type (Green, Yellow, Red)
 1. A task that is not on the critical path is
    delayed. There is sufficient slack to
    manage the delay.
 2. A critical resource may not be available
    at the scheduled time. Negotiations are
    underway to resolve the issues.
 3. A report shows project performance
    regarding scope and schedule, and
    budget is within acceptable variance
    thresholds.
 4. The customer insists on a major
    requirements change well after
    acceptance had been obtained and
    production is in advanced stages.
 5. The project manager discovers that a
    major component of the scope of work
    is missing in the project plan due to an
    oversight by the customer.
 6. The client has issued a change request
    that could delay the completion of a
    contractual milestone.
148   CHAPTER TEN



 Situation                                     Status Type (Green, Yellow, Red)
 7. A functional manager advises the
    project manager that overtime may be
    needed to complete a task on time. A
    contingency had been included in the
    cost estimate for the task.



 The Status Reporting Process.
 Generally there are three types of status reporting--progress
 reports (what has been accomplished), status reports (the current
 state of the project), and forecasts (what is expected to occur).
 Project managers must identify specifically what information the
 project sponsor expects to receive and when.




                       Today, new roles for the project executive are developing
                       including:
                       Establishing a Center for Excellence in project management,
                       Establishing a project office or centralized project management
                       function, Creating a project management career path, Creating a
                       mentorship program for newly appointed project managers,
                       Creating an organization committed to benchmarking the best
                       practices in project, management in other organizations, Providing
                       strategic information for risk management and business intelligence


5. Managing Scope Creep

  Multiple Choice: To avoid scope creep which of the following would be the most
     appropriate action to take?:

  a) Issue an authorization to change the scope each time the
     customer submits a requirements change request.
  b) Ignore all change requests and review them at the completion of the project to
     determine if a new project should be initiated.
  c) Conduct periodic project reviews with the project sponsor to compare project
     baselines with actual work.
  d) Prepare, sign, and deliver to the sponsor a statement that specifically commits to the
     sponsor that there will be no changes to the project plan once it has been approved.

  6. Why is a SWOT analysis important to the strategic planning process?



  7. What conditions would cause a project executive or sponsor to become directly
    involved in the day to day activities of a project?
                                                             WORKING WITH EXECUTIVES       149



8. Describe the characteristics of a "mature" project management organization.




9. The project sponsor role is often misunderstood. It is important to ensure that the
   project manager and team members are aware of the multiple roles and
   responsibilities of the sponsor. Describe the key roles generally associated with the
   project sponsor.


10. Stakeholder identification, stakeholder mapping, and developing strategies for
  managing different stakeholders are important elements in managing project
  requirements and dealing effectively with change. Stakeholder influence and interest
  in a project are also important. What tool or technique can be used to determine the
  relative interest and influence a stakeholder may have regarding a project?


11. What are the generally accepted strategies for the following stakeholder
  categories?


a) Low power or influence, low interest or concern


b) High power or influence, low interest of concern


c) Low power or influence, high interest or concern


d) High power or influence, high interest or concern


                       Occasionally a project manager may disagree with a project
                       sponsor regarding decisions about the project. Disagreements
                       may occur due to the project sponsor's lack of understanding
                       about technical issues, the project sponsor's workload or span of
                       control which may limit available time to support the project, or
                       the communications gaps that may be formed in the
                       organization's hierarchal structure. To avoid disagreements the
                       project sponsor and project manager must establish clear
                       expectations about roles and responsibilities and define how the
                       project is related to organizational strategic goals and objectives.

                       Organizational politics is another area that a project manager
                       should become familiar with. The project sponsor is often the first
                       line of defense to protect the project from external influences.
                       Gain an understanding of the political environment and the
                       potential effects on the project and discuss possible strategies
                       with the project sponsor.

Kerzner "Quick tips" for the Project Management Institute PMP(R)
and CAPM(R) EXAM


The topic "Working with Executives" is most closely related to the following areas in the
PMBOK(R) Guide: Human Resources Management, Communications Management, Project
Scope Management, and Integration Management.

The project sponsor is generally considered to be the person, group, or organization that
provides the financial resources for the project.

Project sponsors may be executives within an organization or they may be an entire
steering committee or group of decision makers. Project managers are usually selected by
the project sponsor during the approval of the project charter.

Project managers should set expectations with the project sponsor at the start of the
project and revisit those expectations frequently during the project life cycle.

Executives and project sponsors generally require higher level summary information about
project status and progress. Milestone charts and high-level summary Gantt charts are
usually appropriate methods of communicating status to executives and sponsors.

Project management is related to many of the functions of general management--
planning, organizing, staffing, executing, and controlling.

Before escalating a problem to a project sponsor, the project manager should verify that
resolution actually requires sponsor intervention.

When escalating an issue to a project sponsor it is important for the project manager to
provide possible solutions or alternatives for the sponsor to review.

The project sponsor is considered to be a key stakeholder. The project managers must be
familiar with the process of managing stakeholders, which requires an understanding of
communications requirements and the ability to resolve issues that may cause stakeholder
dissatisfaction or conflict. Balancing stakeholder needs is also associated with professional
and social responsibility.


 Additional tips and practice items for the PMP(R) exam are included in each chapter and in
 the section of the workbook entitled PMP(R) Exam and PMBOK(R) Guide Review.

                                PLANNING

Planning can best be described as the functions associated with developing and
communicating the enterprise objectives and then establishing the policies, procedures,
programs and activities necessary to achieve them. Planning in the project environment
may be described as establishing a predetermined course of action within a forecasted
environment. From the project management perspective the project manager is the key
to successful project planning and is responsible for identifying, coordinating and
integrating the functions and activities required to deliver the desired project results.
Ideally, to maximize the output of the planning process, the project manager is assigned
to the project at the conceptual stage and remains committed as the leader until project
completion. Planning requires a systematic, yet flexible approach that will address
unique activities, involve the entire project team, and emphasize the need for integration
of all plan components. Project planning involves multifunctional input and discipline
through controls and reviews. It is an iterative process that will continue throughout the
life of the project.

A major objective of project planning is to define completely (or as completely as
possible) all work required to produce the desired result.



                        In the project environment:
                        If a task is well understood prior to being performed, much of
                        the specific work activities can be planned.
                        If a task is not understood, then during the actual task execution
                        more knowledge will be gained that, in turn, may lead to
                        changes in resource allocation, schedules, and priorities.
                        The more uncertain the task, the greater the amount of
                        information that must be processed in order to assure effective
                        performance of the project team members assigned to the task.
                        Planning involves making choices, deciding about trade-offs,
                        and managing interdependencies among the project
                        management knowledge areas: Scope Management, Time
                        Management, Cost Management, Quality Management, Human
                        Resources Management, Communications Management, Risk
                        Management, Procurement Management, and Stakeholder
                        Management.



                                                                                        155

Project Management "Quotable quotes"

"Failure to plan means planning to fail." Popular belief attributes this quote to Ben Franklin
and Winston Churchill

"The primary benefit of not planning is that failure will then come as a complete surprise
rather than being preceded by periods of worry and depression."

"In preparing for battle I have always found that plans are useless, but planning is
indispensable."--Dwight D. Eisenhower


Planning--The Basic Six

There are four basic reasons for project planning:

*   To eliminate or reduce uncertainty
*   To improve efficiency of the operation
*   To obtain a better understanding of objectives
*   To provide a basis for monitoring and controlling work

The following items provide additional rationale for planning:

*   To make sure that the project's objectives and deliverables are aligned with corporate
    or strategic objectives
* To provide some degree of assuredness that the perceived value can be obtained at
  project completion

For more information on the importance of "value" in project management, see Kerzner, H.,
  and Saladis, F., Value-Driven Project Management, co-published by John Wiley
  Publishers, Hoboken, New Jersey and the International Institute for Learning, New York
  City, New York, 2009.

Planning is a continuous process and often requires several iterations before a finalized plan
is developed. It is intended to assist the project managers and project team, including the
project sponsor, in making decisions with a focus on producing the desired outcome of the
project. Effective planning will improve the efficiency of the team and increase the
probability of meeting objectives. It is important to note that a project plan, created by the
project team and based their combined experience, lessons learned, expert judgment, and
an effective agreed upon methodology, , will generally produce the specified deliverables
with minimal scope changes. It is also important to note that the plan should be expected to
change during execution. The main value of the plan is that it provides the initial guidance
required to organize resources and establishes direction and purpose for the project team.

Planning is also defined in terms of strategic, tactical, and operational perspectives.
Strategic planning generally refers to a longer term view of three to five years and focuses
on an organization's direction. Tactical planning may include a one- to two-year view and
focuses on the steps necessary to achieve the strategic goals. Operational planning
addresses a shorter term view generally associated with a six months to one year. When
planning a project the project manager and team should consider the relationship of the
project objectives to the higher level strategic objectives of the organization. A connection
between project objectives and strategic objectives will, in most cases, generate sustained
upper management support.
                                                                                 PLANNING    157



General planning includes:

*    Setting objectives
*    Relationship to a higher level program or business operation
*    A schedule
*    A budget
*    Forecasting--a projection and estimate of the desired results and other factors that may
     impact objectives
*    An organization--the duties and responsibilities associated with achieving objectives
*    Policy--guidelines for decision making
*    Procedures--the method for carrying out policies and plans
*    Standards--guidelines for acceptable performance

The Project Planning and Control System
Planning is actually a system that includes a process for setting objectives, developing
work descriptions, developing a network diagram to identify dependencies, scheduling
tasks, defining activities at the appropriate levels of detail, budgeting based on task
identification and resource requirements, tracking performance and reporting progress,
providing feedback, managing change and making decisions, and eventually closing out
the project.

    Glossary of terms       Key terms and definitions to review and remember

Assumptions For planning purposes, items that are believed to be true, real, or certain.
Assumptions are not grounded in fact and carry with them some element of risk.

Configuration Management A process to manage authorized changes to products
through surveillance. Configuration management ensures that changes to physical and
functional characteristics of the products or deliverables of the project are reviewed and
approved. Configuration management also includes the establishment of an archived audit
trail of all changes, approved and not approved, as well as updates and a history of all
baseline changes.

Constraints Limitations that may affect planning such as contractual dates, project
funding, resource availability. The existence of the constraints, and the prioritization of the
constraints can change over the life of a project.

Objective An aim or desired end of an action. Something toward which effort is applied.
A purpose to be attained. Generally, objectives are described in specific terms, can be
measured, and are attainable and action oriented, realistic, and bound by time. Reminder -
Objectives should be SMART.

Plan A formal and approved document that defines how the project will be implemented.
It guides project execution, documents planning assumptions, facilitates communication
among stakeholders, and provides a baseline for measuring project performance. The
project plan is expected to change through the project life cycle. The amount of change
depends upon the complexity of the project, the changing needs of the client, the level of
risk and uncertainty, the economic and technical environment, and the completeness of the
planning process.

Portfolio          A collection of projects or programs and other work that are grouped
together to facilitate effective management of that work to meet strategic business
objectives.
158   CHAPTER ELEVEN



Procedure A series of steps followed in a definite order to accomplish a desired
objective or result.
Process A set of interrelated actions and activities designed to bring about a specific result.
Program A group of projects managed in a coordinated way to obtain benefits and
control not available from managing them individually.
Progressive Elaboration        Continually moving forward in increments, adding greater
levels of detail.
Project A temporary endeavor (has a start and finish date) undertaken to create a unique
product or service, and most likely involving multifunctional disciplines.
Project Charter The document that formally authorizes the existence of the project and
the use of organizational resources perform project activities. Usually issued or approved
by the project sponsor or project initiator.
Project Life Cycle Generally, the project life cycle is a collection of sequential project
phases that define the work and duration of the project. (However, in some cases, based
upon the assessment of risk, project life cycle phases can overlap. This technique is known
as Fast Tracking)
Project Phase A discrete component or element of a project that includes specific work
activities to be completed in a scheduled time frame. Project phases are bound by specific start
and end dates often referred to as milestones. The project life cycle is composed of a series of
project phases the number of which are determined by the control needs of the organization.
Project Scope The work that must be performed to deliver the product, service, or
desired result of the project.
Rolling Wave Planning Rolling wave planning is the process of planning for a project in
a progressive manner where work to be accomplished in the near term is planned in detail
and work that is planned for the future is planned at a higher level and elaborated later as
the project continues through the life cycle. Rolling wave planning is also used when
downstream work cannot be clearly defined at the low levels of the WBS until certain
upstream information such as test results can be evaluated.
Scope    The sum of the products and services to be provided as a project.
Scope Statement Description of the major deliverables, project objectives, and project
assumptions. The scope statement provides a basis for making future decisions about the
project. The scope statement is developed to answer the questions: What must be
accomplished? Why is it necessary? Who will perform the work? When must the work be
accomplished? Where will the work be performed? How will the work be accomplished?
Standard A document established by consensus that provides for common and
repeated use. Generally considered as rules or guidelines to be followed in an
organization.
Statement of Work A narrative description of work to be done under contract. The
statement of work provides the contractor with specific information and the details about
the work that must be performed and the deliverables to be produced.
Subsidiary Plan A subset of the project management plan. Subsidiary plans are
documents that provide detailed guidance about specific planning elements that support
the project management plan and are developed based on the needs of the project.
Examples of subsidiary plans: Scope Management Plan, Cost Management Plan, Risk
Management Plan, Communications Plan.
                                                                            PLANNING      159



Work Breakdown Structure A deliverable-oriented hierarchal decomposition of the
work to be executed by the project team. The WBS organizes and defines the total scope of
the project and is used to provide a basis for more detailed planning including the
estimating of activity durations, cost of activities, and resource requirements.

Work Breakdown Structure Dictionary A document that describes the
components of the work breakdown structure in detail

response. Project managers are aware that many issues they face on a daily basis may
have several possible solutions. These exercises are designed to encourage you to think
about alternatives before taking action and to select the option that would produce the
greatest benefit or most effectively resolve a situation.

 1. The Logic of Planning

   To be truly effective, planning requires a team and multifunctional approach and must
   include:

   * Agreement about the purpose and objectives of the project
   * Agreement about the level of involvement and influence of stakeholders associated
     with the project
   * Input from all key stakeholders
   * Visible and active management support
   * Assignment and acceptance of individual responsibilities within the project team and
     among key stakeholders
   * Coordination and integration of all work activities (including the possible impact on
     operations)
   * Commitment of the team to the organization's or project goals and objectives
   * Effective Lateral or cross-organizational communication

      a. Assumptions should be validated regularly throughout the project life cycle.
        _____ True
        _____ False

      b. The project manager should develop all of the detailed plans for the functional
         managers to prevent omissions and inconsistency.
        ______ True
        ______ False
                                                                               PLANNING    161

   e. What are the nine major components of the planning stage of a project according to
       Dr. H. Kerzner?




                             At the project level, planning must include: Recognition
                             and resolution of group conflict on goals, assignment
                             and acceptance of group responsibilities, increased
                             motivation and commitment to organizational goals,
                             vertical and lateral communications, coordination of activities
                             between groups

 3. Life Cycle Phases

   An effective approach to planning is to divide the project into specific phases and
   creating a project life cycle. Applying a project life cycle approach provides consistency
   within an organization by defining key phase deliverables and also establishes a
   greater ability to plan and control the activities in each phase. Analyzing the results or
   accomplishments of each phase assists the project manager and sponsor in
   determining if the project should continue on to the succeeding phase. These "end of
   phase" reviews are commonly referred to as phase exits, stage gates, or go and no-go
   decision points. End of phase reviews assist in determining the "health" of a project
   and can prevent an organization from continuing with a project that will not meet
   financial goals, achieve the desired value, or use resources that could
   be deployed more effectively and beneficially on other projects.



Some key points about project life cycles and project phases

* All projects go through a life cycle that includes specific and describable phases
* Each phase is initiated, planned, executed, monitored, controlled, and
  brought to closure
* Phases generally have specific deliverables or intended accomplishments that, upon
  completion, provide the starting point for the next phase
* The costs at the start of the project life cycle are low and increase throughout the project
* Transitions from one phase to another provide an ideal time to conduct reviews to
  compare performance with baselines

       *Phases can overlap to compress the total project schedule if the risks are
       considered acceptable. This technique is referred to as "fast tracking."
162    CHAPTER ELEVEN



Commonly used life cycle phases:

*   Conceptual
*   Feasibility
*   Preliminary planning
*   Detailed planning
*   Execution
*   Testing and commissioning
Or Approval, Design. Build, Test, Deploy, Close

a) Complete the following statement
The benefits of developing and using a standard project life cycle are:
b) What factors should be considered when deciding if a project should continue into the
   next phase of the project life cycle?




          PM Quick Check:

              The purpose of a feasibility study is to:

a) Determine the total cost of the project and establish a baseline budget.
b) Provide technical data and alternatives to the concept and form a basis on which to
   decide whether to undertake the project.
c) Determine the return on investment before initiating the project.

Projects are divided into phases for which of the following reasons?

      a) To improve the ability to control project activities and resources and manage
         deliverables more effectively
      b) To establish gates for project reviews

      c) To provide consistency for managing projects within an enterprise



                            Providing interim deliverables on projects that may have long
                            life cycles will give the customer and sponsor a sense that work
                            is being accomplished. Interim deliverables may indicate a
                            series of successes that can assist in maintaining team focus
                            and commitment toward the project. Interim deliverables are
                            associated with the phases of the project



4. Project Manager and Functional Manager Roles

      The responsibilities of the project manager and the functional managers assigned to the
      project are specific and unique. Match each of the following roles with either the project
      manager or the functional manager.
                                                                             PLANNING   163




 Responsibility                 Project Manager               Functional Manager
 Set project goals and
 objectives
 Develop detailed task
 descriptions
 Communicate/Establish
 major milestones
 Set high-level requirements
 Provide detailed schedules
 Identify areas of risk,
 uncertainty, and conflict
 Establish ground rules and
 provide assumptions
 Define project constraints
 Provide summary status
 reports for the sponsor


5. Project Planning: The Importance of Objectives

   Planning starts with an understanding of the objectives of the project. The sponsor, the
   project manager, and the project team should all have the same understanding about
   what must be accomplished. There may be several levels of objectives depending on
   the complexity of the project but all objectives should be interrelated and support the
   overall goals and acceptance criteria of the project.

   The commonly accepted criteria for project objectives are expressed in the
   word "SMART."

   Fill in the blanks with the correct description of each letter of the word
   SMART as it relates to writing objectives:

   S ____________
   M ____________
   A ____________
   R ____________
   T ____________
164    CHAPTER ELEVEN



Problems with Objectives

Review each of the problems that are generally associated with developing and
documenting objectives. Explain the reason or root cause of the problem and provide a
possible solution or action to prevent the problem from occurring.

 Problem                            Error/Cause                     Recommended Solution
 1. Objectives are not
    agreeable to all
    stakeholders
 2. Project objectives are too
    rigid in a project subject
    to changing priorities
 3. Objectives are not
    adequately quantified
 4. Objectives are not
    documented clearly
 5. Objectives are too
    complex
 6. Objectives are too
    numerous
 7. Performance and
    behavior of the team is
    less than the established
    expectation




 A high level set of project objectives are stated in the Project
 Charter (PMBOK(R) Guide Integration Management) and further
 defined and finalized in the Project Scope Statement (PMBOK(R)
 Guide Scope Management).



 6. The Statement of Work (SOW)

      The statement of work is generally defined as the narrative
      description of the work to be performed under contract. It provides
      the potential contractor or bidder with specific information about the
      work that must be performed and provides a basis for the contractor to
      decide if their organization can perform the work. In some organizations the
      statement of work may become the actual signed contract after negotiation. The
      statement of work is not a plan should not be confused with the scope, project scope,
      or project scope statement documents. (See the glossary for definitions.)

      What's wrong with this statement of work?

      The contractor agrees to conduct approximately 15 individual tests of the product
      before it is released to the client for evaluation. The tests will require supervision by the
      client to ensure that appropriate procedures are utilized during the tests. Test results
                                                                              PLANNING      165



  should be provided to the client shortly after the tests are completed. The client will
  review the test results and provide feedback before acceptance.




         Proposal Preparation - Project planning begins after the proposal process has
         been completed. It is strongly recommended that the project manager becomes
         involved in the proposal process. This will provide a strong foundation for
         project planning and a clear understanding of risks, obstacles, and project
         opportunities.




                        Common causes of misinterpretations of the statement
                        of work:
                        Mixing tasks, specifications, approvals, and special instructions
                        Using imprecise language (nearly, approximately)
                        No pattern, structure, or chronological order
                        Wide variation in size of tasks and details
                        Failing to obtain a "third-party review"


7. Milestone Schedules

  In the early stages of project planning before project details are identified, some project
  scheduling constraints or requirements may be defined in association with contractual
  agreements. These specific dates or milestones include:

  * The project start date
  * The project end date
  * Other milestones such as phase completions or a requirement for a completion of a
    deliverable
  * Reports or data items
  * Certifications and approvals
  * A point where future work is restrained

  PM Quick Check: A milestone can best be described as:

  a) A significant event in the project schedule
  b) An activity in the project that consumes a large amount of project
     resources and time
  c) The activities included in the close of a phase or the project
166    CHAPTER ELEVEN




8. The Project Charter

      The project charter is the document that formally authorizes a project. This means that
      the project manager, usually assigned at the time of the approval of the charter, is
      authorized to apply organizational resources to project activities. The charter is initiated
      and approved, generally, by a project initiator or sponsor external to the organization
      that will plan and implement the project.

Match the following reasons why a project would be chartered by an
organization with the appropriate example:

Reason                                Example

____ 1.Market demand                  a) authorizing a project to meet safety regulations
____ 2.Business need                  b) a requirement from a client to build a new location to
                                         manage expansion
____ 3.A customer request             c) a requirement to create a new product to increase
                                         revenue
____ 4.A technological advance        d) refurbish a public park in the local community
____ 5.A legal requirement            e) a new project to produce a faster and more portable
                                         handheld computer
____ 6.A social need                  f) building a fuel-efficient car in response to increasing
                                         fuel costs and consumer concerns

                      All projects should support the organization's strategic goals and
                      business plans. The strategic goals and business plans should be
                      a major factor in the project selection process.




9. The Project Scope Statement
  The project scope statement is a definition of the project and what must be
  accomplished. It describes in detail the project deliverables and the work required to
  achieve those deliverables. In some organizations a preliminary scope statement is
  developed that addresses the characteristics, boundaries, and constraints of the
  project including the deliverables, products, services, and the methods by which the
  scope will be controlled, verified, and accepted. The final scope statement may include
  the following items:
  *   Project and product objectives
  *   Service requirement and product characteristics
  *   Product acceptance criteria
  *   Constraints and assumptions
  *   Schedule milestones
  *   Initial defined risks
  *   A high level or order of magnitude cost estimate
  *   Configuration management requirements
  *   Approval requirements

  The content and detail of the scope statement will vary by organization but the general
  intent of the scope statement is to provide the project stakeholders, especially the
  project team, with the information necessary to plan the project in more detail. The
  project scope statement is developed by answering the basic questions: Who? What?
  When? Where? Why? How? How much? And how many?

       PM Quick Check:

      management (sponsor) during the planning process?

10. Decomposition and the Work Breakdown Structure
      The work breakdown structure (WBS) is a deliverable-oriented
      grouping of project tasks and activities shown in a hierarchal
      arrangement and in descending levels of detail. The WBS displays
      the complexity of the project and defines the total scope of the project.
      The purpose of the WBS is to subdivide the project into smaller, more manageable
      parts and to provide the appropriate level of detail for further planning. The lowest
      levels of the branches of the WBS are referred to as work packages. The work packages
      contain the specific activities that must be performed by the project team or assigned
      resources. These activities are defined at a detail to meet the needs of the project,
      estimated in terms of duration and resource requirements, scheduled, their costs
      estimated, and their progress monitored and controlled.

      Making the grade! A PMP(R) exam tip!

       The work package is a deliverable at the lowest level of the
       WBS where work is to be controlled. The activities in the work
       package must be performed to produce the deliverable. Work
       packages are generally associated with a cost account to track
       the actual costs of the work performed.

      The process of breaking the project down into smaller, more manageable parts is known as
      decomposition. This process continues until the appropriate level of detail for planning
      purposes has been achieved. A common practice is to create a WBS template from a similar
      project to save time and accelerate the planning process. In some cases, where tasks are
      scheduled to be completed much later in the project, decomposition may not be possible. In
      these cases a technique referred to as "rolling wave" planning may be used. In this process,
      the details are added progressively throughout the project, generally phase by phase.


                           The work breakdown structure is considered to be the
                           "cornerstone of project planning." It provides the basis for time
                           estimates, cost estimates, risk identification and analysis, and
                           project control. The WBS is also useful for communicating
                           information about the project and building teamwork by including
                           all functional managers associated with the project in the
                           development of the WBS.


WBS Format

The WBS can be developed using several methods. A common approach is to display the
WBS in a diagram that resembles an organizational structure. The diagram starts at the
highest level, referred to as the project level, and is then broken down into smaller and
smaller components and grouped in phases or by deliverables. Another approach is to
create an indented format. This format starts with the project name and as each lower level
is added, the levels are indented to display the grouping arrangement. Each indentation
represents a successively lower level detail of the WBS. Special note: A WBS is not a list of
tasks. It is a purposely designed grouping of tasks and activities. The lowest level
deliverable in a branch of a WBS is referred to as a work package. Within the work package
                                                                               PLANNING   169



are the activities that will be assigned to resources who will perform the work required to
produce the deliverable.

WBS Indentation Example

1.0    Project Name
       1.1 Major project deliverable or subsystem
               1.1.1 Task 1
                       1.1.1.1 Subtask 1
                       1.1.1.2 Subtask 2
               1.1.2 Task 2
                       1.1.2.1 Subtask 1
                       1.1.2.2 Subtask 2
                               1.1.2.2.1 Work Package 1

                          The WBS dictionary is used to provide clarity and
                          additional detail to elements of the WBS and may include
                          a code of account identifier.
                                                                                 PLANNING    171



11. Project Selection and Planning: The Role of the Executive

   Before a project is chartered it must be reviewed by the appropriate organization decision
   makers (executives), who will determine if the project should be undertaken. These
   selection methods may include an analysis of return on investment, payback period,
   breakeven analysis, net present value, or internal rate of return. These methods are referred
   to as benefit selection methods. Mathematical models such as decision trees may also be
   used to determine which projects should be selected. The project executive or executive
   steering committee generally establishes the selection criteria for projects. Feasibility
   studies may be required to determine if the organization has the capability to perform the
   project work and a benefit to cost analysis may be required to determine if the project
   should be selected based on economic measures and return on the investment. In some
   cases, due to technological issues, competition, compliance requirements, or government
   regulations, the generally accepted selection process and criteria may not apply.



   a) Identify five items senior executives consider during the project selection process:

   __________________________________________________________________________________
   __________________________________________________________________________________
   __________________________________________________________________________________

   b) During project planning and execution the project manager is expected to provide
   the project executive with information about the project. What information is typically
   provided to the project executive or sponsor?

   __________________________________________________________________________________
   __________________________________________________________________________________
   __________________________________________________________________________________

   c) What is the role of the project executive or sponsor during the project planning
   process?

      scope among all project stakeholders

      True ______

      False _____

12. Why Projects and Plans Fail

      a) Projects fail for any number of reasons. Many failures can be prevented if the
      appropriate level of planning is applied. For each of the following reasons of failure,
      provide a possible solution or preventive measure.

 Reason for Failure                                          Recommended Action or Solution
  1. Corporate goals are not understood at the lower
     or organizational levels or functional units
  2. Plans are too complex and require too much in
     too little time
  3. Financial estimates are significantly inaccurate
  4. Plans are based on insufficient data
  5. Planning is performed by a planning group
  6. No one knows the ultimate objective of the
     project
  7. Staffing requirements are not clearly understood
  8. The project personnel lack the required skills
  9. The project team is not working toward the
     same specifications
 10. The project team is constantly being shuffled in
     and out of the project
                                                                              PLANNING   173



b) Projects are sometimes cancelled. The termination of the project can occur in any
    project phase. What are the typical reasons that a project may be cancelled by
    executive management?


c) What are performance measurement baselines (PMBs) and why are they important?


13. Management Control and Configuration Control

   After the project has been planned and the plans have been approved by the key
   stakeholders, a monitoring and control process should be utilized to prevent
   unauthorized work from being performed, scope creep from developing, and variances
   to the baselines from exceeding established thresholds. Project control is concerned
   with:

   *   Comparing actual project performance to the planned baselines
   *   Assessing performance to determine if corrective action is necessary
   *   Identifying, tracking, and responding to risks
   *   Providing status to key stakeholders
   *   Providing updated cost and schedule forecasts
   *   Managing changes through a specified process

   A project methodology and a system for storing project information (Project
   Management Information System or PMIS) provide the project manager and team with
   useful information to assist in maintaining control and providing information to
   stakeholders. Upper management or the project sponsor may establish guidelines
   regarding control to meet organizational requirements or conform to established
   policies.

   Configuration management is a form of change control. It is a process or technique that
   manages changes to the features, functions, or physical characteristics of the
   deliverables of the project or the final product. A configuration control board (CCB) or
   committee reviews requested changes to determine if a change should be approved
   and to prevent unwanted or unnecessary changes from taking place.

Managing Configuration Changes

If you were a member of a configuration control board, what questions would you ask
before determining whether a change should be approved or not?
174       CHAPTER ELEVEN



14. Project Phase-Outs, Transfer, and Closing

      Projects have a definite end date (at least by definition), and therefore, transfer of
      project deliverables to the customer or intended user and close out of the project
      should be planned. The closeout of the project is actually a project in itself and a very
      important phase of the project. Projects are generally closed based on the following
      reasons:

      Completion of all project objectives

      Achieving the desired value

      *    Achieving agreed upon contractual terms and conditions
      *    Preparing for the transition to the operational phase of the project's product
      *    Analysis and documentation of overall project performance
      *    Identification of possible follow-on business

      The project is no longer associated with organizational goals, will not achieve its
        targeted value, or has reached a point where it is no longer perceived as financially
        beneficial

      What activities should be included in the close out or transfer of the project deliverable
      to the operational environment? Make a list of activities that should be included in the
      close out phase.

Kerzner "Quick tips" for the Project Management Institute PMP(R)
and CAPM(R) EXAM


The topic "Planning" is related to all of the knowledge areas of the PMBOK(R) Guide.
Planning involves the integration of all project knowledge areas. Specific references about
this chapter are mainly located in the knowledge areas: Project Integration Management
and Project Scope Management.

The PMP(R) Exam will include many questions that are arranged in the form of scenarios. A
suggested study strategy is to apply the principles, tools, and techniques described in this
chapter to actual projects. Experience in using the tools and techniques will assist in
improving your understanding about a concept and how the tools and techniques can
assist in achieving desired results.
                                                                                    PLANNING    175



Remember the differences between the definitions of project scope statement, statement
of work, and scope of the project.

The charter authorizes the existence of the project and usually names/assigns the project
manager. The charter is not a plan and is much less detailed than the scope statement. The
charter authorizes the project manager to use organizational resources to complete project
objectives. It is an input to scope planning.

The WBS is a key part of total project planning and provides a basis for estimating costs
activity durations, resource- requirements, and for identifying project risks. It is not a list; it
is a grouping of tasks and activities and facilitates project planning. The WBS is often
referred to as the "cornerstone of project planning."

Configuration Control Directly connected with change control, this process is used to
effectively manage, review, and approve recommended or requested changes to the
products and deliverables of the project. Configuration management is generally
associated with the management of the features, functions, and physical characteristics of
products.

Scope Planning This process defines the objectives of the project and answers the
specific planning questions: who, what, when, where, why, how, and how much. The
process of Define Scope produces the Project Scope Statement.

Scope Definition This process, now referred to as Define Scope uses the inputs of
project charter, requirements documentation, and organizational process assets to
produce the Scope Statement. Expert judgment, product analysis, alternatives
identification, and facilitated workshops are tools and techniques of the define scope
process.

Project Scope Management Scope management in the 5th edition of the PMBOK
Guide includes the following processes: Plan Scope Management, Collect requirements,
Define Scope, Create WBS, Validate Scope, and Control Scope


 Additional tips and practice items for the PMP(R) exam are included in each chapter of the
 11th edition and in the section of the workbook entitled PMP(R) Exam and PMBOK
 Guide(R) Review.

progress during project execution, Ensure accurate information on the accomplishment of
the deliverables and requirements, Establish performance measurement criteria

  NETWORK SCHEDULING TECHNIQUES

 The project scope statement and Work Breakdown Structure (WBS) provide the project
 manager and team with the foundation for further planning. The scope statement and WBS
 answer the what, when, where, why type of questions, but additional planning is required.
 The tasks and activities of the project must be arranged in the appropriate sequence to meet
 schedule requirements, mandatory dependencies, resource constraints, and other factors
 that affect the total or integrated project plan. Network scheduling is actually a continuation
 of the project planning process and allows the project team to determine the best approach
 to managing and controlling project activities. The process of network scheduling provides
 an opportunity to display the dependencies of project activities, where there is flexibility,
 known as float or slack, the critical path and opportunities for rearranging activities to ensure
 the most efficient use of resources and available time. Network scheduling requires input
 from the entire project team and may require several iterations before the network is finalized
 and approved.




                        The WBS is generally considered to be the "cornerstone of project
                        planning" and provides the basis for network scheduling and the
                        development of network diagrams. The project team collaborates to
                        identify the project components, major tasks and work package
                        activities and develops the WBS to clearly display the project and its
                        complexity. Network scheduling generally follows the development
                        of the WBS. The activities defined in the WBS are placed in a logical
                        sequence using the input of the project team to display the
                        predecessor and successor relationships between the activities of the
                        project.



The major advantage of network scheduling is the ability to display dependencies. Gantt
charts, milestone charts, and the WBS are useful for planning and control but are not
intended to display activity logical relationships. Today's project software will show the
relationships between activities but these relationships are often obscured if the project has a
large number of activities. The analysis associated with network scheduling also provides
valuable information for total integrated planning, time studies, improved schedule
development, resource management, and re-planning.

                                                                                               183
184   CHAPTER TWELVE


Glossary of terms           Key terms and definitions to review and remember

Activity An element of work performed during the course of a project. Each project activity
generally has a defined duration, an estimated cost, and specific resource requirements.
Activities are components of the work package.

Activity-on-Node Commonly referred to as Precedence Diagram Method. The activity is
depicted as the node or box. Each activity in the diagram is connected using arrows to
indicate dependencies and logic relationships. This technique utilizes four logical
relationships--Finish to Start, Start to Start, Finish to Finish, and Start to Finish.

Arrow Diagram Method (ADM) A network diagramming technique in which activities are
represented by arrows. Activities are connected at points called nodes to illustrate the
sequence in which activities are expected to be performed. This is also known as Activity-on-
Arrow (AOA). This technique utilizes one logical relationship--Finish to Start and Dummy
Activities to display other logic relationships.

Backward Pass A process in the critical path method that uses the completion date of the
project as the starting point and moving back through each path of the network to calculate
the late finish and late start dates for project activities.

Baseline The original approved plan. The three main project baselines are the scope
baseline, schedule baseline, and budget or cost baseline. The baseline provides the
benchmark for comparing actual results with planned results. The difference between the
actual result and the planned result is referred to as variance.

Crashing A technique of schedule compression where the total project duration is reduced
by identifying activities that can be reduced in duration by adding additional resources and
cost. Crashing focuses on seeking opportunities for compressing the project schedule by
targeting activities that will provide the greatest duration reduction at the lowest cost without
significantly increasing the risk. Crashing generally is applied to the critical path where there
is minimal flexibility and, in most cases no slack or float.

Critical Activity An activity on a critical path.

Critical Path The longest path through a network that determines the earliest completion
date of the project. The critical path is usually defined as the path through a network where
the activities have zero float or slack. It is important to note that the critical path is not
necessarily the path with the greatest overall risk. Secondary or tertiary paths may have
greater risk.

Critical Path Method (CPM) A network analysis technique used to determine the early
start, early finish, late start, and late finish dates for activities on the various logical paths of a
network. Early dates are calculated using a forward pass; late dates are calculated using a
backward pass. The critical path is identified during this process.

Dummy Activity An activity of zero duration used to show a logical relationship. Dummy
activities are used in the arrow diagramming method (activity on the arrow) when special
logical relationships are required and must be displayed Dummy activities are shown
graphically as a dashed or dotted line headed by an arrow and connecting two nodes.
Dummy activities may be a factor in calculating the critical path.

Duration The number of work periods required to complete an activity or other project
element. Duration is generally estimated by the functional manager responsible for the activity.
                                                           NETWORK SCHEDULING TECHNIQUES      185


Effort The number of labor units required to complete an activity or other project element.
Effort is associated with skill level, resource competency, and number of resources available.
Effort is related to the determination of activity duration.
Fast Tracking Compressing the project schedule by overlapping activities that would
normally be done in sequence. Risk must be considered when utilizing fast tracking.

Float The amount of time that an activity may be delayed from its early start without
delaying the project finish date. (Also referred to as slack.)
Forward Pass The calculation of the early start and early finish dates for activities in a
network diagram. The forward path begins at the start milestone and follows each path in the
network to the project end milestone. The longest path through the network is identified
when the forward pass process is complete.
Free Float The amount of time an activity can be delayed without delaying the early start
of any immediately succeeding activities.

Hammock A group of related activities aggregated to a summary level. Also known as a
summary activity.
Lag A modification of a logical relationship that places a delay between the predecessor
and successor activity. Example: After concrete is poured (the activity is complete), there is a
waiting period to allow the concrete to cure. This may take several days. The next succeeding
activity cannot start until the curing time is satisfied. The curing time or elapsed time is
known as lag.
Lead A modification of a logical relationship that allows an acceleration of the successor
task. Example: Task B depends on the completion of task A. The team determines that task B
can start two days before the end of task A. The lead for task B is two days.

Level of Effort (LOE) A support type activity that does not readily lend itself to
measurement of discrete accomplishment. Level of effort is considered when determining the
duration of an activity. Example: The level of effort for an expert to perform an activity would
be much less than the level of effort of a newly trained employee. A project manager provides
a supporting effort to achieve project objectives. The level of effort is a factor in determining
the duration of an activity. Example: An activity may be scheduled for a duration of one day (8
hours) but may require three resources to complete the work. The effort is considered to be 3
person days or 24 hours of effort.
Master Schedule A summary level schedule that identifies the major activities and
milestones associated with a project.
Milestone A significant event in the project. Examples: end of a phase, end of the project.
Milestones do not consume resources and do not have duration. A milestone is a point in
time.

Precedence Diagram Method (PDM) A network diagramming technique in which
activities are represented by nodes. Activities are linked by precedence relationships to show
the sequence in which the activities are to be performed. There are four logical relationships
in the PDM--finish to start, finish to finish, start to start, start to finish.
Program Evaluation and Review Technique (PERT) An event-oriented network
analysis technique used to estimate project duration when there is a high degree of
uncertainty with the individual activity duration estimates. This technique is associated with
the formula: (O + 4m + P) / 6. The sum of the optimistic time plus four times the most likely
time, plus the pessimistic time divided by six. This is referred to as the PERT weighted
average formula.
186   CHAPTER TWELVE


Project Network Diagram          Any schematic display of the logical relationships of project
activities.

Resource Breakdown Structure Hierarchal structure of the identified resources by
resource category and resource type.

Rolling Wave Planning A technique in which more details are added as the project
progresses. It is a form of progressive elaboration and addresses the issue that information
about some project activities may not be available. This practice is called rolling wave
planning because the planning wave stays ahead of the work being executed.

Slack Generally considered to have the same meaning as float. The amount of flexibility an
activity has in relation to the project end date.

Total Float The amount of time that a scheduled activity may be delayed from its early
start date without delaying the project finish date.


Time Management Processes--A Brief Review
The following processes are generally associated with the knowledge area Project Time
Management. Network scheduling is directly associated with the Time Management process
of activity sequencing and is an essential element of the integrated planning process.

The PMBOK(R)-- Fifth Edition includes the following Project Time Management processes:

Plan Schedule Management - establishing the processes and procedures for planning,
developing, and controlling the project schedule

Define Activities - further developing the WBS at the work package level to identify specific
actions that must be taken to complete project deliverables

Sequence Activities - identifying the specific logical relationships of project activities.
Identifying predecessor and successor relationships

Estimate Activity Resources - determining the appropriate resource types and quantities
required to complete project activities

Estimate Activity Duration - determining the number of work periods required to complete
project activities

Develop Schedule - analyzing project resources, activity sequences, activity durations, and
project constraints to determine the project schedule

Control Schedule - monitoring the project schedule to identify variances, managing project
changes and updating the project schedule as required

Define activities

* The process of identifying and documenting the specific activities that must be performed
  to produce the various project deliverables identified in the WBS. This is a continuation of
  the process of decomposition. The activities are defined to the detail that will allow project
  objectives to be met.
                                                            NETWORK SCHEDULING TECHNIQUES      187


* Input includes: Schedule Management Plan, Scope Baseline, Enterprise Environmental
  Factors, and Organizational Process Assets. Other inputs may include: WBS, Project Scope
  Statement, WBS Dictionary, Historical Information, Constraints, Assumptions, and the
  Project Management Plan.

* Tools and techniques:

  * Decomposition: Involves subdividing project elements into smaller, more manageable
    components

  requested changes (to the WBS and scope statement), supporting details including updated
  assumptions and constraints, and updates to the WBS.

Sequence Activities

* The process of identifying and documenting activity dependencies and relationships.

  * There are three common types of dependencies:
    * Mandatory--also known as hard logic. Tasks must be completed in a specific
      sequence due to physical necessity.
    * Discretionary--also known as soft logic (discretionary dependencies are associated
      with best practices)
    * External--dependency associated with another project or other item outside of the
      project and generally affecting the critical path.

* Input includes: Schedule Management Plan, Activity List, Activity Attributes, Milestone
  List, Project Scope Statement, Enterprise Environmental Factors, and Organizational
  Process Assets. Other inputs may include: Approved Changes, Product Description,
  Identified Dependencies, Constraints, and Assumptions.

* Tools and techniques: Precedence Diagramming Method (Activity-on-node),
  Dependency Determination, Applying Leads and Lags, Schedule Network Templates. Other
  techniques include: Arrow Diagramming Method (Activity-on-Arrow), conditional
  diagramming methods such as GERT - Graphical Evaluation Review Technique.

* Output: Project Schedule Network Diagram, Project Document Updates. Other outputs
  may include: Activity List Updates, Activity Attribute Updates, and Requested Changes (the
  sequencing activity may generate a need to change an activity or refine the schedule).

Estimate Activity Resources

* The process of estimating the type and number of resources required to complete each
  identified activity.

* Outputs: Activity Resource Requirements, Activity Attribute Updates, Resource
  Breakdown Structure, Project Document Updates.

* Resources that are commonly associated with the estimating process include:
  * Equipment
  * Materials
  * Supplies
  * Money
  * People (skill levels, competency, availability)

Estimate Activity Duration

* The process of estimating schedule activity durations using information from the scope
  statement, identified resource types, number of resources available, calendars, ramp-up
  time (the effect of non-contiguous work assignments).

* Input includes: Schedule Management Plan, Activity List, Activity Attributes, Enterprise
  Environmental Factors, Organizational Process Assets, Project Scope Statement, Activity
  Resource Requirements, Resource Calendar, Risk Register.

* Tools and techniques: Expert Judgment, Analogous Estimating, Parametric Estimating,
  Three-Point Estimates, Group Decision Making Techniques, Reserve Analysis.

  * Three-point estimates are based on determining the optimistic, most likely, and
    pessimistic durations of an activity. The weighted average estimate or estimated time is
    calculated by the formula:
    (O + 4m + P)/6. The sum of the optimistic estimate plus four times the most likely estimate
    plus the pessimistic estimate divided by six.
  * Analogous estimating uses actual duration figures from similar activities or projects.
    Also referred to as a top-down type of estimating. This type of estimating is generally
    used early in a project. Estimates are refined as more project data is obtained.
  * Parametric estimating calculates duration estimates by using mathematical algorithms
    such as multiplying the quantity of work in work periods by the cost rate of a resource.
    This type of estimate works best for standardized and often repetitive activities. This is
    also a top-down type of estimating. Example: Multiplying the cost per square foot by the
    desired number of square feet of living space will produce a parametric estimate of the
    cost of building a home.

* Outputs: Activity Duration Estimates, Project Document Updates.

Develop Schedule

* An iterative process to determine planned start and end dates for project activities. Schedule
  development involves the combined input of the project team and includes negotiation,
  agreement about contingencies, Availability of Critical Resources, and Contractual Agreements.

Activities, Questions, and Exercises

Refer to Chapter Twelve of Project Management: A Systems Approach to Planning,
Scheduling, and Controlling (11th Edition) for supporting information and assistance in
completing each exercise.
The following questions and exercises are most closely associated with the knowledge areas
of the PMBOK(R) Guide: Project Time Management. It is important to remember that although
each knowledge area is presented separately in the PMBOK(R) Guide for learning purposes,
many processes are performed concurrently and all process are associated with Project
Integration Management. The 5 major process groups - Initiating, Planning, Executing,
Monitoring & Controlling, and Closing assist in the integration of all sub processes
associated with planning and managing a project.
Review each of the following questions or exercises and provide the answers in the space
provided. Some questions and situations will have more than one appropriate answer or
response. Project managers are aware that many issues they face on a daily basis may have
several possible solutions. These exercises are designed to encourage you to think about
alternatives before taking action.


Activity Planning--From WBS to Project Network Diagram
After the project has been defined by developing a work breakdown structure, the next step in
the planning process is to perform the steps required to develop the project schedule. This
process includes identifying activities, determining resource requirements, estimating activity
durations, sequencing, and managing within project constraints.

1.      PM Quick Check: Defining Activities

     Complete the following statements:
190    CHAPTER TWELVE


      A. The process of activity definition is an extension of the development of the
         __________________.

      B. After the major project deliverables have been defined, the lower level project
         deliverables and activities are included in the ________________.

2. Activity Definition--Inputs, Tools and Techniques, and Outputs

      Review the list of items and determine if each item is an
      input, a tool or technique, or an output. Place each item
      in the correct column:

      i) Milestone list

      3. Sequencing Activities and Network Diagrams

      The next process following activity definition involves arranging the activities from the
      activity list into a specific sequence based on dependencies identified by the project team.
      Some activities depend on input from another activity before they can begin or are
      constrained by time, resources, or other factors. The sequencing process identifies all
      relationships between activities and ensures that there are no "hanging activities." A
      hanging activity is one that does not have clearly defined relationships and is not
      completely connected to the network.

         Precedence Diagramming Method--Study Note

         The Precedence Diagramming Method (PDM) is used to display project activities using
         nodes that are linked together using one or more types of logical relationships. The
         logical relationships are shown using arrows to connect the nodes. PDM uses four
                                                            NETWORK SCHEDULING TECHNIQUES         191


         types of logical relationships--finish to start (the most common relationship), finish
         finishing, start to start, and start to finish.

3a. What are the major advantages of using Network Scheduling techniques?



3b. Exercise: Create a network diagram using the PDM and the information in the table:
    (Hint: A common practice in the development of network diagrams is to use Post-It TM
    notes or other similar products that allow the team to move activities around until they
    are satisfied that the diagram correctly displays the project network. Establishing a start
    and an end milestone will assist in making sure there are no "hangers" and will provide a
    means to ensure that the network is complete.

 A                                               Start
 B                                               A
 C                                               A
 D                                               B
 E                                               C
 F                                               D
 G                                               E,F
 end                                             G




                           The PDM is the most common method used today to display a
                           project network. The PDM uses nodes that represent activities.
                           They are connected by arrows that represent logical relationships
                           or dependencies.



         Arrow Diagramming Method--Study Note

         The Arrow Diagramming Method (ADM) is similar to the PDM, except that when using
         ADM, all dependencies are shown as finish to start. The activity is on the arrow
         instead of the node and durations are shown on the arrows. ADM is also known as
         Activity-on-Arrow (AOA). A dummy activity may be used in the ADM to show a logic
         relationship. Dummy activities do not show duration. They are used to indicate a
         relationship.

In normal distribution, measurements are assessed by the number of standard
   deviations that appear from the mean. In normal distribution the following
   information is important to remember:

         *   68.3% of the data points fall within one standard deviation from the
             mean

        *   95.5% of the data points fall with two standard deviations from the
            mean
        *   99.7% of the data points fall within three standard deviations from the
            mean
     Basic formula for standard deviation
     (pessimistic value minus the optimistic value) divided by 6 or (P - O) / 6
     Note: This is a short formula generally accepted for calculating standard deviation.
Mean -the average of all data points
Median - the midpoint of a frequency distribution. Example: In the series 1,2,3,4,5,6,7, the
  median is 4
Mode - the most frequent data point value. Example - 1,1,1,2,2,2,2,3,4,4,5,6, the mode is the
  number 2
Range - The difference between the highest value data point and the lowest value data point.
   Example: 10, 20, 40, 50, 70. 80, 100 the ranges = 100 - 10 or 90

Study Notes
Activity duration estimating is used to determine the number of work periods required to
complete a schedule activity. Duration is determined by analyzing several factors including
the number of resources required, the competency of the resources, and the availability of the
resources. Work periods may be represented in several ways including days, weeks, or hours
based on the preference of the project team and stakeholders. The process of activity duration
estimate may follow activity definition, but in many cases the estimates are provided
concurrently.
A PERT Chart is a type of network diagram that uses probabilistic estimates to determine the
project duration. PERT is the abbreviation for Program Evaluation Review Technique. Network
diagrams are commonly referred to as PERT Charts, but a PERT Chart is actually a network
diagram that is constructed using the critical path method (CPM) and a weighted average
formula. The formula is expressed as
194    CHAPTER TWELVE


                                               a + 4m + b
                                                    6

where: a = optimistic, b = pessimistic, and m = most likely. The standard deviation may be
calculated using the formula:
                                                  b-a
                                                   6

This formula will provide an acceptable value for the standard deviation. Calculating the standard
deviation provides a basis for establishing a confidence level for each activity on the critical path.
Using a normal distribution, it is known that there is a 68% probability of completing the activity on
the project within one standard deviation from the mean, 95% within two standard deviations, and
99.73% within three standard deviations.
A GERT Chart or Graphic Evaluation Review Technique is a diagram that allows looping,
branching, and multiple end points. A PERT Chart does not allow feedback loops and
conditional branching.
Types of dependencies. There are three basic types of dependencies:

      * Mandatory dependencies or hard logic. This type of dependency is inherent in the
        nature of the work. They often involve physical limitations. The work must be
        performed in a specific order. Example: Install walls before adding the roof.
      * Discretionary or soft logic. Generally, the dependency is determined by the project
        manager or team and is associated with best practices. "It is best to do it this way."
      * External dependencies are those that are associated with factors that are outside of the
        project but may impact the critical path.
 5. Forward Pass
      The forward pass is used to determine the earliest start and earliest finish dates of each
      activity on the network diagram. The process begins with the first activity on the network
      (usually a milestone) and continues from left to right, analyzing each path, and adding activity
      duration to the start time of the activity. During the process, at any point where two or more
      activities converge on another activity the higher value of the early finish is used to determine
      the early start of the succeeding activity. This process continues through each path in the
      network to determine the total duration of the project and the critical path.

      Exercise: Using the information provided in the following table, create a network
      diagram using the precedence diagram method and determine the duration of the project
      and the critical path.

6. Backward Pass

     The backward pass is used to determine the latest start and latest finish of each activity. In
     diagrams where all relationships are Finish to Start, the difference between the latest
     finish and the earliest finish will determine the float or slack for the activity. There is
     generally no float or slack on the critical path. The backward pass is performed on the
     network diagram from the end milestone and proceeding back through the network to the
     starting point. At points of convergence the smaller number is used to determine the
     latest finish of a preceding task.

     Referring to the diagram developed in exercise 6, perform a backward pass to determine
     the late start and late finish of each activity.

     A. Identify the activities that have float or slack.

7.       PM Quick Check:

     1. Activities with zero time duration when using the arrow diagramming method are
        referred to as:

        a) critical activities
        b) noncritical activities
        c) events
        d) dummy activities
196    CHAPTER TWELVE


      2. In the Precedence Diagramming Method, the most common logical relationship is

        a) start to finish
        b) finish to start
        c) finish to finish
        d) start to start

 8. Crashing the Schedule

      During the project scheduling process or during actual execution of the project, it may
      become necessary to shorten the duration of the project. Crashing generally means to
      reduce duration by using additional resources or overtime. Review the information in the
      table. Determine which activities should be crashed. (Hint: Determine the critical path
      first.)

What is the critical path? What is the cost to crash the schedule to 23 weeks?

9. Lead and Lag

      During project planning it may be necessary to adjust the project schedule to include lag
      time, a delay of the succeeding activity or lead time, an acceleration of a succeeding
      activity. A common example of lag time is the elapsed time after the activity of pouring
      concrete. The concrete must cure for a period of time. Lag is built into the network to
      allow for the curing time. An example of lead time is to indicate that a succeeding activity
      may start after 70% of a preceding activity has been completed.

      In the following diagram, if the early start of activity A is 10 days, what is the
      early finish time for activity C?

11.      PM Quick Check: The critical path is the

      a) Shortest path through the network diagram.
      b) Longest path through the project network that determines the earliest time the project
         can be completed.
      c) Path with the greatest number of resources assigned.

12.You have received the following information from a project team member: the estimated
pessimistic duration to complete an activity is 45 days, the optimistic time is 15 days and the
most likely time is 25 days. What will you post as the duration for this activity using normal
distribution?

13. Using the same information from the previous question calculate the standard deviation
using the short formula

14. Using normal distribution, what is the probability of completing the activity referred to in
questions 12 and 13 within 21.67 days and 31.67 days?

15. What is the probability of completing the activity in 31.67 days or less? ____________

Making the grade! An exam tip for you to review.


 The PMP(R) Exam will test your knowledge of the forward pass,
 backward pass process. Practice the critical path method often and
 remember the rules: use the greater number when performing the
 forward pass at points of convergence and the smaller number at
 points of convergence in the backward pass process.
 Remember the PERT weighted average formula and the formula
 for standard deviation.




Kerzner "Quick tips" for the Project Management Institute PMP(R)
and CAPM(R) EXAM


The topic "Network Scheduling Techniques" is most closely related to the following areas in
the PMBOK(R) Guide: PROJECT TIME MANAGEMENT

Review the inputs, tools and techniques, and outputs of the time management processes:
Activity Definition, Activity Sequencing, Activity Resource Estimating, Activity Duration
Estimating, Schedule Development, and Schedule Control.

The PMP(R) exam will test your ability to recognize and understand two types of network
diagrams: the precedence diagramming method (PDM) and the arrow diagramming method
(ADM). Make sure you know the differences between them. PDM has four possible logical
relationships:
                                                              NETWORK SCHEDULING TECHNIQUES   199


* Finish-to-start (the most common dependency type)--The successor activity's start
  depends on the completion of the successor activity.

* Finish-to-finish--The completion of the successor activity depends on the completion of
  the predecessor activity.

* Start-to-start--The start of the successor activity depends on the start of the predecessor
  activity.

* Start-to-finish--The completion of the successor activity depends on the start of the
  predecessor activity.

ADM uses only the finish-to-start relationship and may use dummy activities to complete the
logic relationships.

Become familiar with different types of scheduling charts: Gantt, milestone, and schedule
networks.

Be prepared to explain the critical path method and how to determine critical path.

Understand the difference between the schedule compression techniques of crashing, fast
tracking, and managing slack.

Understand how to calculate the activity durations using PERT.

Practice forward pass and backward pass calculations to determine where float or slack exist.

Know how to calculate early start, early finish, late start, and late finish.


 Additional tips and practice items for the PMP(R) exam are included in each chapter and in
 the section of the workbook entitled PMP(R) Exam and PMBOK(R) Guide Review.

                      PROJECT GRAPHICS

 There are several forms of project graphics commonly used by project managers to
 provide information to project stakeholders or communicate status about the project.
 Graphics include drawings, illustrations, photographs, and charts. Dashboards have also
 become a popular method for providing project status. Common project graphics
 include the Bar chart or Gantt Chart, network diagram, PERT Chart, Precedence
 Diagrams, learning curve charts, quality control charts, and S-Curves to illustrate project
 financial data such as earned value. Project graphics are used to enhance
 communications when reporting project status and are directly related to the PMBOK(R)

                        Project graphical displays make project information easy to review
                        and understand and are the prime means for tracking project cost,
                        schedule, and performance. Properly used, project graphics will
                        assist the project team in managing the project more effectively by
                        clearly identifying variances and areas where attention or
                        corrective action is required.


Glossary of terms          Key terms and definitions to review and remember

Control Chart A tool used to determine whether a manufacturing or business process is
in a state of statistical control or not. Generally includes a center line or process average,
an upper control limit and lower control limit. Data points are plotted on the control chart
and then analyzed to determine where process problems may exist.

Flow Chart A pictorial summary that uses symbols and words to illustrate the steps,
sequence, and relationships of the various operations in the performance of a function or
process. Flow charts typically include decision points, conditional branches, and feedback
loops. The flow chart is a form of Graphic Evaluation Review Technique (GERT).

Gantt Chart A bar chart that depicts the activities of a project as bars or "blocks" over
time. The beginning and end of the bar or block correspond to the beginning and end date
of the activity. A scheduling tool used to display the status of project activities. A graphical


                                                                                            205

representation of a project that shows each task as a horizontal bar whose length is
proportional to its time of completion. Named after Henry Gantt, Gantt charts are most
commonly used to exhibit project or program progress. They do not effectively illustrate
dependencies although today's project software provides the capability to display
dependencies on a Gantt chart. The greatest advantage of a Gantt or bar chart is that it is
easy to read and understand and can be changed easily and quickly.

GERT Chart Graphic Evaluation and Review Technique. This type of chart allows for
feedback loops and conditional branches. It may include decision points or possible
alternative paths depending on specific conditions. See Flow Chart
Graphics Visual elements that supplement typed information to make printed messages
more clear or interesting. Graphics are basically pictures and drawings. They may be
created by computer or drawn by a graphic artist. Graphics are frequently created by the
project team to support project documentation and ensure that the information provided is
clearly understood.

Histogram In statistics, a graphical display of tabulated frequencies, shown as bars
Ishikawa Diagram Also known as Fishbone and Cause and effect diagram. Assists in
determining the root causes of a stated problem.
Network Diagram In the precedence Diagram Method it is a graphical diagram that
uses boxes to represent project activities and lines to show the relationship between
activities. Generally, the sequence is shown from left to right, and the logical relationships
between activities are shown with arrows or lines. The PERT Chart is a form of network
diagram.

Pareto Diagram A chart used to graphically summarize and display the relative
importance of the differences between groups of data. Generally shown as a bar chart that
indicates from left to right the largest cause of failure or frequency of occurrence of a cause
associated with a problem or quality issue to the lowest level or frequency of failure or
occurrence. The Pareto diagram is used to prioritize items that require attention. He 80/20
rule is associated with the Pareto Diagram. 80% of the problems are associated with 20% of
the causes
PERT Chart Program Evaluation Review Technique. A diagram that depicts project tasks
and their interrelationships. Developed by the U.S. Navy in the 1950s, it is designed to
schedule, organize, and coordinate activities within a project. The PERT Chart uses
probabilistic estimates to determine project duration based on optimistic, most likely, and
pessimistic estimates.

   11. A histogram is "a representation of a frequency distribution by means of bars
         whose widths represent class intervals and whose areas are proportional to the
         corresponding frequencies." Create a histogram using the following data:
         Data set - {3, 11, 12, 19, 22, 23, 24, 25, 27, 29, 35, 36, 37, 45, 49}, 50, 52, 55, 58

                       The project status dashboard is usually a one page diagram or
                       chart that provides the viewer with a quick review of the status of
                       a project. Typically the dashboard will show schedule status,
                       budget status, and earned value performance information.



 Remember the different types of project graphics and their
 advantages and disadvantages. The Gantt Chart primarily shows
 progress; the network diagram primarily shows sequence and
 dependencies.




Kerzner "Quick tips" for the Project Management Institute PMP(R)
and CAPM(R) EXAM


The topic "Project Graphics" is most closely related to the following areas in the PMBOK(R)
Guide: Project Time Management and Project Communications Management

Project graphics can enhance project communications by providing additional clarity to
project documentation.

Identify the needs of the project stakeholders before preparing project charts and
diagrams. The needs of project executives and sponsors are, in most cases, different from
functional manager or customer needs. Project sponsors and executives typically expect to
receive summary information about the condition of a project. Sponsors may be
executives within an organization or they may be steering committees or groups of
decision makers. Project managers are usually selected by the project sponsor or project
executive.

Remember that each type of project graphic has a different intended purpose. Multiple
graphics are often used to ensure that all information is provided in an understandable
format.


 Additional tips and practice items for the PMP(R) exam are included in each chapter and in
 the section of the workbook entitled PMP(R) Exam and PMBOK(R) Guide Review.

            PRICING AND ESTIMATING

There are many activities associated with the planning of a project. Estimating the likely
costs of all resources and work effort required to complete the project is a significant
part of the planning process. There are several common techniques available for use in
estimating project costs, activity duration, and project completion date and the project
manager may use a combination of these techniques throughout the life cycle of the
project. These techniques vary in application but the objective of the estimating process
is to determine, within a desired degree of reliability, the total cost to produce a product
or project deliverable. The difficulty of estimating costs varies widely depending on the
type of project, the experience level of the project team, the number and type of
resources to be used, and whether or not similar projects have been completed that can
be used for comparison and analogy. Estimating is basically producing a guess or an
approximation of project costs or time durations and includes a risk assessment and in
most cases an added contingency to address uncertainty.

Pricing is generally the process of determining the appropriate amount to bill or charge
a client, customer, or receiver of a product or service. Pricing is considered to be a
business decision and is associated with profitability, relationship with clients, the
general target market and what the market will bear, availability of the product, difficulty
to produce, availability of materials, competition, and risk factors.

It is important to emphasize that one of the most crucial inputs in the pricing decision is
the cost estimate of the proposed project baseline. Pricing actually begins before the
proposal development process. It starts with customer requirements, well understood
subtasks, and in many cases a top down estimate that is further refined during the
planning process.

There are three major types of estimates that may be used during project planning as
the project is executed--Analogous, Parametric, and Bottom up or grass roots
estimating. The reliability of each of these types must be considered and additional
more detailed and rigorous estimating may be required.

Generally, estimates are more reliable when they are developed by the functional
organizations or specific resources that have been assigned responsibility for an activity.
The experience and lessons learned from functional groups increase the reliability of an
estimate and will in most cases improve the quality of the overall planning process.


                                                                                          215
216    CHAPTER FOURTEEN




                          Estimates are not based on luck. They are well-thought-out
                          decisions based on the best available information, expert
                          judgment, best practices, and some type of model that is based on
                          previously collected and validated data.



    Glossary of terms Key terms and definitions to review and remember

Analogous Estimate Preparing an estimate by comparing projects that may be similar
to some degree. This type of estimate is considered to be a top down estimate and has a
low degree of accuracy. Analogous estimates are in most cases refined to improve
accuracy over time.

Bottom-up Estimating A technique that uses well-defined project information,
generally from a WBS, to develop an estimate with a high degree of accuracy.

Cost Baseline The approved total estimated cost of the project. The cost baseline is the
output of the cost-budgeting process. The cost baseline is a time-phased budget that is
used as a basis for measuring and controlling project costs through each phase of the
project life cycle.

Cost Budgeting The aggregation of all project costs to produce the project cost baseline.

Cost Estimating Relationships The output of cost models. Typical Cost Estimating
Relationships include:

*    Mathematical equations based on regression analysis
*    Cost-quantity relationships such as learning curves
*    Cost to cost relationships
*    Cost-non-cost relationships based on physical characteristics, technical parameters, or
     performance characteristics. There may be some relationships and interfaces that will
     not incur additional cost and will not affect the estimating process. Examples: Internal
     transfer of documents, use of support resources that are not billed back to the project.

Estimating The process of calculating the likely cost of a project. It may be a formal or
informal process. The act of determining the likely cost of construction works on behalf of
either clients or contractors. Determining the probable cost of future work.

Estimating Groups These are people or departments that estimate the cost of new work
without soliciting input from the functional managers. The success of this group is based
upon the quality of the estimating data base

Estimating Teams On some projects, the initial group of people assigned to the project
are functional subject matter experts with knowledge of functional estimating standards.
Once the estimating team completes their tasks, they may be replaced by other functional
employees who will be doing the actual work.

Feasibility Study A process to determine if a business idea is capable of being
achieved by an organization. A study of the applicability or ability to develop and deliver a
proposed action or plan.
                                                                  PRICING AND ESTIMATING 217


Forward Pricing Rates These are long term forecasts on the salary of the workers two
or three years ahead. This is for estimating on long term projects. Forward pricing rates are
also used on overhead costs and material costs.

Fully Loaded or Fully Burdened Rate The total cost of a resource including salary
and all overhead costs such as benefits. The total of all costs associated with maintaining a
resource. Many organizations establish reference tables that provide the fully burdened
rates of its employees for use in project cost estimating.

Management Reserve (as related to pricing) This is a sum of money or a percent of
the estimated cost that is added into the cost baseline for possible inaccuracies in the
estimating process. Generally the management reserve is held in an account separate from
the project budget and is released after careful analysis of the project performance data
and forecast information.

Parametric Estimating A process of estimating that utilizes mathematical models to
determine an approximate outcome. An example would be the use of a standard cost per
unit multiplied by the number of units required. Example: house construction may use a
standard cost per square foot of living space multiplied by the desired amount of living
space. This method is also referred to as a top down estimate.

Pricing The process of applying prices to purchases and sales orders based on several
factors: fixed amount, quantity, promotion or sales campaign, specific vendor quote.
Pricing is the process of determining the correct amount to bill or charge for a product or
service. Pricing includes the cost of developing and building or fabrication of a product,
investment risks, and fair profit margin.

Regression Analysis A method for determining the association between a dependent
variable and one or more independent variables. The statistical technique of finding a
straight line that approximates the information in a group of data points. A statistical
method to estimate any trend that might exist among important factors.

Sunk Cost This is a cost incurred in the past that will not be affected by any future
decision. Sunk costs are not considered when making decisions about whether to continue
with a project or terminate the project. This is a cost that has been incurred and cannot be
recovered.

Top Down Estimating This is an estimating process at the top one or two levels of the
WBS. Estimating can be done quickly but the accuracy of the estimates may be risky unless
the company has a good estimating data base

                          The reliability of estimating types is a key factor in the planning
                          process. The type of project, especially where new technology is
                          involved or where a new product is being developed, may require
                          several adjustments to the prepared estimates as the project
                          proceeds through progressive elaboration.



 1. Project Estimating Types

      Review each of the following estimating types and match the
      descriptions and/or characteristics.


        Estimating Method        Generic Type       WBS Relationship         Accuracy
        Parametric

      +10%

 2.       PM Quick Check:

      A. Which of the following will provide the project team and project manager with the
         most useful information to develop a well-prepared and definitive project cost
         estimate?

          a) The Project Charter
          b) The Preliminary Scope Statement
          c) The WBS
          d) The Statement of Work

      B. The ROM or rough order of magnitude estimating type is associated with which of
         the following estimating methods?

          a) Engineering or grass roots
          b) Parametric
          c) Analogous
          d) Definitive

      C. Reliability of estimates is a critical factor in the project planning process. To ensure
         greatest reliability of activity estimates they should be developed by:
                                                                   PRICING AND ESTIMATING 219


       a) The project sponsor
       b) The project manager
       c) The functional manager
       d) The customer



                       The WBS is considered the cornerstone of project planning and in
                       addition to displaying the project tasks, activities and project
                       complexity is used by the project team to increase the probability
                       of producing reliable cost estimates and activity duration
                       estimates. It will also assist the risk assessment process!




 3. Explain how the WBS is used by the project manager and project team to develop a
    reliable bottom-up estimate.




 4. What is the difference between a "sunk cost" and an "opportunity cost"?




 5. Direct Costs and Indirect Costs

   Review the list of project costs and identify each item as a direct cost or an indirect
      cost.


 Direct Cost                                    Indirect Cost




Project Costs:
A. Project manager travel expenses
B. Project team labor rates
C. Equipment costs
D. Taxes
E. Maintenance and janitorial services
220   CHAPTER FOURTEEN


F. Reward and recognition of the project team
G. Company benefits
H. Materials
I. Accounting services
J. Utilities


                          Variable costs and fixed costs should be considered when planning
                          the project budget. Variable costs are costs that may change during
                          the project life cycle including material costs, supplies, and salaries.
                          Maintain an awareness of the use of "bargained for" resources that
                          may be associated with contractual salary or wage increases during
                          the project life cycle. These are also associated with collective
                          bargaining units. Fixed costs generally do not change and may be
                          associated with nonrecurring or recurring activities. Fixed costs may
                          include rentals, one-time setup, or leases.



 6.       PM Quick Check:

      A. Using the technique of analogous estimating is also
         associated with the technique known as:

         a) Scope decomposition
         b) Scope definition
         c) Feasibility analysis
         d) Expert judgment

      B. Before developing the project cost estimates for resources the project manager
         should consider the following organizational expense items: building maintenance,
         fringe benefits, group insurance, office supplies, clerical support, postage, retirement
         plans, sick leave, vacation pay. These items are generally associated with:

         a) Contractor direct costs
         b) Overhead rates or costs
         c) Variable costs
         d) External costs

 7. Developing a Cost Estimate

      There is generally a sequence of steps taken to determine the estimated cost of a
      project deliverable. Review the following list place each step in the appropriate
      sequence to display the complete process.

     A. Sunk costs are used as a major factor in the decision to
        approve the continuation of a project into the next phase.
        True _______ False _______




                        In some cases the customer may wish to audit the cost proposal
                        before it is approved. The project manager should prepare
                        supporting data about cost estimates for reference during audits.

                      Life cycle cost analysis is the systematic analytical process of evaluating
                      various alternative courses of action early in the project with the
                      objective of choosing the best way to employ scarce resources and
                      lower the cost of the total life cycle of the product or the project.

    Study Notes:

Economic Project Selection Methods

* Payback Period--The time required to recover or pay back an initial investment.
  Payback does not take into consideration the time value of money. Example: A project
  requires an initial investment of $10,000. The project team estimates recovery of the
  initial investment in two years. The payback period is two years. If this is acceptable to
  the organization decision makers, the project may be approved.

* Discounted Cash Flow (DCF)--Determining the present value of potential future
  earnings of an investment. The yield of the investment is calculated in terms of the present
  value. Example: If an investment yields $1,000 one year from now and the cost of money is
  10%, the value in today's dollars would be $909. This is determined by the formula for
224   CHAPTER FOURTEEN


  present value: PV = FV/(1 + r)n where PV = Present Value, FV = Future Value, r = the rate or
  cost of money, and n = the number of years. The future value of an investment is
  determined by the formula FV = PV (1 + r)n.

* Breakeven Analysis--The point at which the cash outflow and the cash inflow meet.
  The cash outflows are projected along with the cash inflows. The date where the two
  curves intersect is the breakeven point. If the breakeven point is acceptable to the
  organization, the project will be approved.

* Net Present Value (NPV)--Net Present Value is determined by calculating the present
  values for the cash flows for each year of the project. The sum of the present values is
  determined and the Net Present Value is calculated by subtracting the initial investment
  from the sum of the present values. Generally a Net Present Value equal to or greater
  than zero would indicate an acceptable project.

* Internal Rate of Return (IRR)--A sophisticated capital-budgeting process involving a
  series of trial and error or iterative calculations to determine at what interest rate or cost of
  capital rate would result in a Net Present Value of zero. This requires several calculations at
  increasing cost of capital rates to determine the actual Internal Rate of Return.

* Depreciation--The reduction in the balance sheet of a company asset to reflect its loss
  of value through age and wear. The decline in the value of a capital asset. Depreciation
  represents a cost of ownership and the consumption of an asset's useful life. Generally
  deductible for tax purposes.

13.       PM Quick Check:

      A. What is the future value of $5,000 invested at 10% interest for 3 years?


      B. What is the Present Value of a project that will yield $100,000 two years from now if
         the cost of capital is 15%?


      C. What is the Net Present Value of the following project? The discount rate is 5%. The
         initial investment is $10,000 and the project has a 5-year duration.

 Year                             Cash Inflows                     Present Value
 1                                $1,000

14. A Problem to Consider: Estimating Person Days
   Companies usually estimate work based upon man-months (person months). If the
   work must be estimated in person-weeks, the person-month is then converted to
   person-weeks. The problem is in the determination of how many person-hours per
   month are actually available for actual direct labor work.
   Your company has received a request for proposal (RFP) from one of your customers
   and management has decided to submit a bid. Only one department in your company
   will be required to perform the work and the department manager estimates that 3,000
   hours of direct labor will be required.
   Your first step is to calculate the number of hours available in a typical person-month.
   The Human Resources Department provides you with the following yearly history for
   the average employee in the company:
   * Vacation (3 weeks)
   * Sick days (4 days)
   * Paid holidays (10 days)
   * Jury duty (1 day)

      A. How many direct labor hours are available per month per person?

       2,080 hours available per year
        -120 for vacation
         -32 for sick days
         -80 for paid holidays
          -8 for jury duty


       1,840 hours per year or 153 per month

     B. If only one employee can be assigned to the project, what will be the duration of
        the effort, in months?

        3,000 hrs/(153 hrs per month) = 19.6 months
        (This assumes only one person)
     C. If the customer wants the job completed within one year, how many employees
        should be assigned?
        3,000 hrs/(1,840 hrs/person) = 1.6 people




Kerzner "Quick tips" for the Project Management Institute PMP(R)
and CAPM(R) EXAM


The subjects in this chapter are most closely associated with the knowledge areas of the
PMBOK(R) Guide: Project Cost Management and Project Time Management.
226   CHAPTER FOURTEEN


Remember the three types of estimating methods--Analogous, Parametric, and Grass
Roots or Bottom-up estimating.

Analogy, or Analogous, and Parametric estimating are considered top down estimating
techniques. The parametric estimate may become very reliable over time based on
repetitive type of work.

Pricing is a business decision and is determined after project costs have been estimated
and validated.

The cost baseline is the aggregate of all cost estimates and is provided to the sponsor for
review and approval.

The cost baseline is allocated across each phase of the project to create a time phased
budget that allows the project costs to be monitored as the project progresses through
each phase.

Sunk costs are those costs that have been incurred and are generally not considered when
making decisions about the future of the project.

Opportunity cost is generally considered the loss of revenue that is experienced when one
project is selected over another or when funds are held for one project that could have
been used to generate revenue in another area or on another more favorable project.

Remember to consider overhead and indirect costs when developing a project budget.

Life-cycle costing includes all costs from R&D to salvage. Project costing is generally
associated with the costs to deliver the project and do not include operations,
maintenance, and salvage.

 Additional tips and practice items for the PMP(R) exam are included in each chapter and in
 the section of the workbook entitled PMP Exam and PMBOK Guide(R) Review.

                           COST CONTROL
 Project cost control includes the monitoring of project activities, the tracking and
 recording of project data, and the corrective actions taken to return project performance
 to acceptable levels when variances have gone beyond established parameters. Cost
 control processes should be introduced to the project team at the start of the project or
 at the kickoff meeting and should be performed by all project personnel who incur costs.
 Generally, cost control includes cost estimating, cost accounting, managing project cash
 flow, and other activities and tactics that may affect the financial aspects of the project.
 The project budget prepared by the project manager and project team includes the
 estimated cost of all project deliverables and the activities required to produce them
 plus any overhead costs, indirect costs, and contingencies that have been included to
 address potential project risk events. The project manager is held accountable for the
 successful management and control of project costs and must be prepared to act quickly
 when project costs begin to approach established thresholds. Continuous monitoring,
 analysis of variances, and identification of alternatives that may be utilized to correct
 variances are one of many project manager responsibilities.

 The project manager's main objective regarding cost control is to maximize the probability
 of completing the project within the approved budget by keeping actual costs at or below
 planned levels, to minimize the use of available contingency reserves, to maximize
 company profits, or to minimize overall expenses (depending on the type of project).

 It is important for the project manager to understand that cost management is directly
 related to schedule management and scope management. These three elements are
 associated with the Triple Constraint and awareness of the interrelationship between
 these elements is an essential factor to achieving overall project success.


Study Notes: Some key activities of cost control:

* Awareness of factors that may cause changes to the cost baseline
* Obtaining approval of changes that will affect the cost baseline
* Managing changes through a change control process to prevent
  additional cost-related issues from occurring or to minimize the
  impact on other projects or company operations
* Monitoring cost performance on a regular basis through project reviews
* Recording and documenting all project changes that impact the cost baseline
* Preventing incorrect or inappropriate changes
* Informing project stakeholders of approved changes




                                                                                           233
234   CHAPTER FIFTEEN


* Taking corrective action to resolve identified cost overruns
Cost control also includes the use of effective risk management techniques that address
the opportunities as well as the potential negative events that may be experienced during
project execution.



                        Any cost control system is only as good as the original plan
                        against which performance will be measured. Effective planning
                        and the use of reliable sources of estimates are key factors in
                        managing project costs.



Glossary of terms         Key terms and definitions to review and remember

Actual Cost (AC) Amount expended (in terms of direct labor or direct cost) of work that
has been completed within a given time period. Also known as ACWP, or Actual Cost of
Work Performed.

Actual Cost of Work Performed (ACWP) Amount expended (in terms of direct labor
or direct cost) on work that has been completed within a given time period. Also known as
AC, or Actual Cost.

Baseline The original approved plan for a project. There are three major baselines
associated with a project--The Scope baseline, the Schedule baseline, and the cost
baseline or project budget.

Benefit-cost ratio (BCR) An indicator, used in the formal discipline of cost-benefit
analysis, that attempts to summarize the overall value for money of a project or proposal.
A BCR is the ratio of the benefits of a project or proposal, expressed in monetary terms,
relative to its costs, also expressed in monetary terms. All benefits and costs should be
expressed in discounted present values.

Budget at Completion (BAC) The sum of the total budgets for a project. Sum of the
budgets for each phase of a project.

Budgeted Cost of Work Performed (BCWP) Amount budgeted or planned to be
expended for work that has been completed. Also known as Earned Value.

Budgeted Cost of Work Scheduled (BCWS) The budgeted amount of work that has
been scheduled to be completed at the time of measurement. Also known as Planned Value.

Contingency The planned allotment of time and cost for unforeseeable elements that
may be associated with project planning. A planned reaction or response established to
address an event that may or may not happen.

Contract Cost The summation of the cost baseline and the management reserve.

Contract price The summation of the contract cost and the profit anticipated.

Corrective Action Changes made to bring expected future performance of the project in
line with the plan. Actions taken to return project performance to the planned level or
performance or to an acceptable level.

Cost Baseline The summation of the distributed (or time-phased) budget and the
undistributed budget.
                                                                           COST CONTROL     235


Cost Control The process of controlling the cost of a project within a predetermined
sum throughout its various stages or phases.

Cost Performance Index The cost efficiency ratio of earned value to actual costs.
Expressed as the formula CPI = BCWP/ACWP or CPI = EV/AC. It is often used to predict the
magnitude of a possible cost overrun using the formula BAC/CPI = projected cost at completion
or EAC.

Cost Variance Any difference between the budgeted cost of an activity and the actual cost
of that activity. In earned value BCWP - ACWP or EV - AC = CV (Cost variance).Special note:
CV and SV (cost variance and schedule variance) can be expressed in hours, $$, %, or all
three. The reason is that, for example, CV in $$ can be unfavorable while CV in hours can be
favorable. In other words, you are spending more money that you thought but you are using
fewer hours. This is normally indicative of having people assigned that are at a higher pay
grade than you budgeted for. They are more expensive but can get the job done in less time.

Distributed or Time Phased Budget The sum of money that is released using the
work authorization forms (usually associated with the allocation of project funds to each
project phase).

Earned Value (EV) A measure of the physical work accomplished considering the
original approved cost estimate or authorized budget for this work. The sum of the
approved cost estimates (may include overhead allocation) for activities (or portions of
activities) completed during a given period (usually measured to a specific point in time).
Also known as Budgeted Cost of Work Performed or BCWP.

Earned Value Management A method for integrating scope, schedule, and resources,
and for measuring project performance. It compares the amount of work that was planned
with the work that was actually completed or "earned" with the units of cost expended
(actually spent) to determine if cost and schedule performance are in line with the project
plan. Also expressed as BCWP or EV.

Effort The number of labor units required to complete an activity or other project
element. Usually expressed as staff hours, staff days, or staff weeks.

Estimate An assessment of the likely quantitative result. Usually applied to project costs
and durations and should always include some indication of accuracy such as plus or
minus a percent.

Estimate at Completion (EAC) The expected total cost of an activity, a group of
activities, or the project when the defined scope of work has been completed.

Estimate to Complete (ETC) The expected remaining costs to complete an activity, a
group of activities, or the project.

Management Reserve (as related to pricing) This is a sum of money or a percent of
the estimated cost that is added into the cost baseline for possible inaccuracies in the
estimating process. Generally the management reserve is held in an account separate from
the project budget and is released after careful analysis of the project performance data and
forecast information. The management reserve is not considered part of the cost baseline
because you do not plan on spending this money unless the situation dictates this as an
action.

Planned Value (PV) The physical work scheduled plus the authorized budget to
accomplish the scheduled work. Also known as BCWS, or Budgeted Cost of Work Scheduled.
236   CHAPTER FIFTEEN


Schedule Performance Index (SPI) The schedule efficiency ratio or earned value
accomplished against the planned value. The SPI describes what portion of the planned
schedule was actually accomplished. SPI = BCWP/BCWS or EV/PV.

Schedule Variance Any difference between the scheduled completion of an activity
and the actual completion of the activity. In earned value, BCWP - BCWS or EV - PV.

Scope Creep The uncontrolled and unauthorized changes to the project scope. Usually
results in greater cost, lower quality, and unfavorable performance variances.

Undistributed budget A sum of money that you intend to spend but hasn't been
allocated yet to the work breakdown structure elements or possibly to work authorization
forms.

Variance Any deviation from the plan.

Work Breakdown Structure (WBS) A deliverable-oriented grouping of project
elements that organizes and defines the total scope of the project. Each descending level
represents an increasingly detailed definition of the project work.

Work Package       A deliverable at the lowest level of the work breakdown structure.

Study Notes: EVM Formulas--A brief review and study tool

Special attention: PMI(R) refers to Earned Value (BCWP) as EV, Planned Value (BCWS) as
PV, and Actual Cost (ACWP) as AC.

Formulas to remember:

CV or Cost Variance =                    BCWP - ACWP              or EV - AC
SV or Schedule Variance =                BCWP - BCWS              or EV - PV
CPI or Cost Performance Index =          BCWP/ACWP                or EV/AC
SPI or Schedule Performance Index =      BCWP/BCWS                or EV/PV
CV % or Cost Variance Percent =          CV/BCWP                  or CV/EV
SV % or Schedule Variance Percent =      SV/BCWS                  or SV/PV

EAC or Estimate at Completion = ACWP + ETC or AC + ETC where ETC is the Estimate to
Complete. This formula is used when the original estimates appear to be questionable or
are no longer relevant due to changes in the project. (ETC refers to work that has not been
performed and is therefore an estimate of cost.)

EAC = AC (cumulative) + BAC - EV (cumulative where BAC is the Budget at Completion,
this formula is used when the variances experienced are atypical and similar variances are
not expected to occur as work proceeds.

EAC = AC (cumulative) + (BAC -EV Cumulative) divided by CPI (Cost Performance Index).
This formula is used when variance experiences are typical and will continue to be
observed as the project continues.

VAC or Variance at Completion =     BAC - EAC
Project Cost at Completion =   BAC/CPI (also referred to as EAC)

Cost - Benefit Ratio             The total saving or realized benefits in dollars (converted
to present value) divided by the initial cost. Example: A program that cost $54,000 to
develop and deliver resulted in a $430,000 saving the first year. 430,000 / 54,000 = 7.96.
                                                                          COST CONTROL   237


For every dollar spent on this investment there was a return of 7.96 dollars. This would be
considered to be a very beneficial investment.

 WBS                   Work Breakdown Structure


                       The WBS is a key input in the cost management process. The WBS
                       provides a basis for estimating the resources required, the
                       duration of each activity, and for managing changes to the project
                       plan. Project plans can be expected to change through the project
                       life cycle but a well-planned project will generally have minimal
                       scope changes. Ensure that the entire project team is involved in
                       the development of the WBS. This will assist in developing a more
                       complete project plan and improve how the team performs
                       together. The WBS also allows the team to determine
                       responsibility for each major task when it is associated with the
                       Responsibility Assignment Matrix (RAM).

Activities, Questions, and Exercises


Refer to Chapter 15 of Project Management: A Systems Approach to Planning, Scheduling,
and Controlling (11th Edition) for supporting information. Review each of the following
questions or exercises and provide the answers in the space provided.

The following questions and exercises are associated with the knowledge areas of the
PMBOK(R) Guide: Project Cost Management and Integrated Change Control.


                        The estimating process is the key to cost management. Make sure
                        that your estimates have been obtained from reliable sources.
                        Generally, estimates should be provided by the functional
                        managers or subject matter experts that will perform the work.
                        Remember that estimates are actually guesses or approximations
                        and many factors can impact the accuracy of an estimate. Risk
                        should always be considered when developing estimates.

2. The 50-50 Rule
   Using the 50-50 Rule and the figure below, determine the value for PV, EV, and BAC.




      PV = ______     EV =______     BAC = ______

3. EVMS Problem: A customer (homeowner) hires a contractor to tile five identical rooms
   in his home. The customer purchased the tiles and the contractor will be reimbursed for
   labor only. Because the tiles are difficult to work with, the contractor assumes two days
   per room at eight hours per day and at $100 per hour. The planned cost is $8,000 but
   overtime will also be paid, if necessary, at the same rate of $100 per hour.

      The first room was completed in three days because of difficulty in workmanship and
      getting an understanding of how to use these special tiles. This included two hours of
      overtime. The second room was completed in two days. Using EVMS, what
      information would be presented to the homeowner at the end of the first week?

      a)   PV = 5 x 800 = $4,000
      b)   EV = 4 x 800 = $3,200
      c)   AC = 42 x 100 = $4,200
      d)   BAC = $8,000
      e)   SV = EV - PV = -$800
      f)   CV = EV - AC = -$1,000
      g)   EAC = (AC/EV) x BAC = $10,500
      h)   VAC = BAC - EAC = -$2,500
      i)   ETC = EAC - BAC = $6,300
      j)   Percent complete = EV/BAC = 40%
      k)   SPI = EV/PV = 0.8
      l)   CPI = EV/AC = 0.76

      Now it is your turn. Having tiled the floors, you now hire a contractor to wallpaper all of
      the walls in each of the five rooms. Once again, you purchase the wallpaper and will
      reimburse the contractor just for labor. The contractor works at $100 per hour and
      estimates eight hours of work per room, for a total of five days.

      At the end of the first week, working eight hours per day, the contractor completed only
      three rooms. The EVMS status is:
      a) PV = _____
                                                                         COST CONTROL   241



   b) EV = _____
   c) AC = _____
   d) BAC = _____
   e) SV = _____
   f) CV = _____
   g) EAC = _____
   h) VAC = _____
   i) ETC = _____
   j) Percent complete = _____
   k) SPI = _____
   l) CPI = _____

7. Understanding the Cost Breakdown
   In the figure below, the project manager released $10 million to the functional areas to
   do the job. This was the released budget but the project manager also had, as part of
   the contract, $6 million for an undistributed budget that had not been planned out yet.
   The contract also has a $2 million profit included as well as a management reserve of
   $1 million. Using the figure, answer the following questions:
                                                                             COST CONTROL   245


     a) The dollar value of the cost baseline is: __________________

Kerzner "Quick tips" for the Project Management Institute PMP(R)
and CAPM(R) EXAM


The subjects in this chapter are most closely associated with the areas of the PMBOK(R)
Guide: Project Cost Management, Project Time Management, and Project Scope
Management.

Remember the basic earned value formulas and practice them on your actual projects. Use
the technique to assess your project. Review the technique with your project teams and
explain how the process applies to your project.

Remember that PMI(R) uses the Acronyms PV, AC, and EV. Many organizations continue to
use the traditional acronyms BCWS, ACWP, and BCWP. Learn to use them interchangeably.

Earned Value Analysis is closely connected to communications management. The
information calculated through earned value analysis is used to provide project
stakeholders with useful information about a project's performance in the form of S
Curves, charts, and status reports.

Cost control is a subset of Integrated Change Control.

Cost control is a subsystem of the Management Cost and Control System (MCCS).

Cost management is associated with cost estimating, cost accounting, direct costs, indirect
costs, overhead, and many internal and external environmental factors.

Cost estimating should generally be performed by the functional groups or experts who
will actually do the work.

Many projects require adjustments to the estimates as the project is progressively
elaborated.
                                                                           COST CONTROL       247


Practice developing S Curve charts to analyze project performance.

Project performance should be monitored on a regular basis.

Corrective action should be taken after alternatives have been identified. Select the best,
most cost efficient trade-off.

Remember the relationships of the Triple Constraint.


Additional tips and practice items for the PMP(R) exam are included in each chapter and in
the section of the workbook entitled PMP(R) Exam and PMBOK(R) Guide Review.

                  TRADE-OFF ANALYSIS

Ideally, a project manager would like to complete a project on time, within budget,
according to scope and quality requirements and achieve customer satisfaction. In a
perfect project environment, this would be relatively easy to achieve if a well-thought-
out plan was in place and the team was ready to handle any possible change or risk
event that might possibly occur. In actual practice projects seldom progress exactly as
planned. Customers request changes, the environment doesn't cooperate, people make
mistakes, estimates are too optimistic, items are omitted or overlooked, conflicts occur,
and team members are changed more frequently than we would like (churn or turnover
of project teams can create rework, impede progress, and create conflicts). This "true"
project environment drives the project manager and team to continually assess the
project and, working within the identified and generally inflexible, constraints, trade-offs
(the giving up of one item to satisfy another need) must be considered. Project
managers must be willing to analyze situations and decide on actions in a give-and-take
project environment. Today we refer to these trade-off factors as competing demands.
These demands may include safety, aesthetics, social acceptance, and values expressed
by the client or the performing organization.


The time, cost, performance triangle, known as the Triple Constraint, was considered to
be the "magic combination" that provided the basis for project trade-off decisions and
kept the project manager continuously pursuing a balance of these elements to achieve
project success. We have defined project success in previous chapters and it is always a
good idea to fully understand how success is defined by all key stakeholders.




                                                                                          253
254   CHAPTER SIXTEEN




                        Although time, cost, and scope (or performance specifications)
                        provide a basic platform for success criteria, it is important to note
                        that there are many other factors that must be considered in the
                        quest to achieve customer satisfaction. Don't forget:

                        * Ensuring that the product is used
                        * The project should not interfere with normal business operations
                        * The project team sees personal value in completing the project
                        * Making sure the customer will want your organization to
                          manage future projects
                        * The project should be perceived as supporting organizational
                          strategic objectives
                        * Ensuring that value and benefits are achieved




Glossary of terms         Key terms and definitions to review and remember

Competing Trade-offs Basically more of one output requires less of another or less of
one requires more of another. Example: A reduction in the schedule duration without
changing the scope of work will require an increase in cost to accommodate the use of
more resources or overtime. Physical limitations may affect the viability of trade-off
possibilities. These are also known as competing demands.

Complementary Trade-offs          Multiple outputs that can be achieved independently.

Constraint A limitation. Examples of constraints: must start no later than, must finish
no later than, fund limits, resource availability.

Trade-off A management decision to reduce one item in favor of another. A situation
that requires a decision to give up one thing to obtain something else. An exchange that
occurs as a compromise. A decision that implies that the decision maker fully
comprehends both the positive (upside) and the negative (downside) of a particular choice.

Trade-off Analysis A method to improve the quality of decisions by making the
decision process more explicit, rational, and efficient. Generally a political process that can
be structured in a systematic way to improve reliability and validity of the decision.

Triple Constraint The three major baselines of a project that are interrelated. The triple
constraint implies that any change to one of these elements will generally have an impact
on one or both of the other elements. Usually depicted as a triangle.

and Controlling (11th Edition) for supporting information. Review each of the following
questions or exercises and provide the answers in the space provided.
                                                                     TRADE-OFF ANALYSIS    255




The following questions and exercises are associated with the knowledge areas of the
PMBOK(R) Guide: all knowledge areas, particularly Scope Management, Time Management,
Cost Management, Quality Management, and Risk Management.



                        There are two major elements of the trade-off analysis process:
                        * Identifying and displaying how alternatives perform or affect a
                          situation or defined criteria
                        * Assisting stakeholders in articulating and applying their personal
                          values to a problem in a rational way to achieve mutual
                          agreement and a decision



       Study notes: There are some generally accepted approaches in the trade-off
       analysis process:



Trade- off analysis is a systemic approach to managing the competing demands of time,
cost and performance (scope or specifications). Information from cost reviews, schedule
reports, and other forms of project reviews is compared to the original plan. This
information can be used to support the following generally accepted activities associated
with making trade-off decisions.

1. Engage the project team in a process oriented approach that will lead to consensus

2. Utilizing mathematical models and optimization calculations to determine the best
    available plan of action

3. Including key stakeholders in the process to gain support

4. Recognizing potential conflicts and determining their possible effects on the project

5. Reviewing and prioritizing project objectives

6. Analyzing the project environment and status of the project

7. Identifying alternative courses of action

8. Analyzing and selecting the best alternative

9. Obtaining approval to revise the project plan

   Trade-off decisions may be difficult for stakeholders to reach agreement about.. There
   are several factors that impact the decision process:

   * Projects may be very complex with numerous system relationships
   * The inherent uncertainty of many project environments
   * The different opinions and perspectives of the project team and stakeholders
   * Objectives may be unclear or conflicting
   * Different priorities among functional groups

People make trade-off decisions every day. Consider the process of purchasing a new car.
What are the trade-offs that would be considered?
256    CHAPTER SIXTEEN



Trade-off examples:

      Price                     Sound system
      Safety                    Security system
      Maintenance costs         Domestic or foreign
      Warranties                Fuel efficiency
      Size                      Resale value
      Reliability               Durability
      Ease of use               Aesthetics
      Serviceability

In the business environment trade-offs may be associated with: planning versus
operations, projects versus daily activities and long-term programs, use of critical
resources, funding one project over another, quality versus productivity, speed over
accuracy. Other examples include Cost / benefit comparison, performance, response time,
quality, schedule delays, scope reduction, choice of materials, choice of tools, choice of
suppliers and resources.

Trade-off decisions require a method of measurement to effectively assess quantity- and
quality-related issues and the impact to a project of one decision over another. Having
specific metrics in place will also help to determine the actual impact of a decision after it
has been implemented. Trade-off decisions may include several stakeholders including the
project manager, sponsor, and the customer. Stakeholder bias and level of influence may
significantly affect a trade-off decision.

When conducting trade-off analysis the project manager and other decision makers will
assess the incremental cost of the trade-off, determine how it will reduce the problem or
improve a situation, whether or not an alternative is worth doing, and rank alternatives
from best to worst.

1.       PM Quick Check:
      Explain the significance of the Triple Constraint and why it is depicted as a triangle.
      Why are the three sides the same length? Is it possible that one constraint may be
      more important or have greater risk?




2. Making the Trade

      You are the project manager for a project that is showing a schedule slippage, but the
      budget is under-running for the work that has been performed. What are the possible
      actions you may take to correct the schedule slippage? There are several possible
      answers.
                                                                               TRADE-OFF ANALYSIS       257



        3. The customer for your project insists on adding requirements that will increase the
           project scope. You are 50% complete with the project when the customer introduces a
           significant change in the configuration of a major deliverable. What actions may be
           taken to address this situation and what are the possible trade-offs that could be
           negotiated?




                                Decisions about trade-offs are generally based on the constraints
                                of the project. It is not always possible to sacrifice cost, time, or
                                performance without affecting the others.



        4. Constraints Alive!
             Every project is unique but projects often experience similar problems. What typical
             constraints may be encountered by a project team?




        5.      PM Quick Check:

        Properly written objectives will help reduce the need for trade-off decisions. A well-written
        objective is characterized by the word ______________________.



                                   There is generally a three-step process or methodology in
                                   trade-off analysis:
                                   1. Recognize and understand the conflict or issue. Make sure it
                                      actually requires attention.
                                   2. Review the project objectives as seen by the participants.
                                      An understanding of objectives and priorities will determine

                                      results, customer perception.



        6. The project you are assigned to is over budget and behind
           schedule due to an unforeseen risk event. There is a contract
           clause that protects you from penalties but the customer is
           pressuring you to deliver on time. From the list provided, select
           the best options to consider.

Kerzner "Quick tips" for the Project Management Institute PMP(R)
and CAPM(R) EXAM


The subjects in this chapter are most closely associated with the areas of the PMBOK(R)
Guide: Project Integration Management, Project Scope Management, Project Time
Management, Project Cost Management.

Trade-off analysis requires the project manager to communicate the issues as well as the
potential impacts of a decision to the project stakeholders.

Effective planning will reduce the need to conduct trade-off analysis activities.

Ensure that an effective change control process is in place. Trade-offs will generally affect
several areas.

The systems approach to managing projects emphasizes the importance of understanding
that a change in one area, even if it is a very small change, can affect the entire project.

Make sure that objectives are clearly written and communicated to the stakeholders.
Remember--objectives should be "SMART" (Specific Measurable, Attainable, Realistic
Time Based).

Before making decisions about trade-offs, ask questions to determine why the trade-off
decision is required and obtain information about the causes of the problem or the need for the
trade-off. Consider the risks and potential consequences associated with trade-off decisions.
260   CHAPTER SIXTEEN



Document corrective action and the rationale behind trade-offs and record in a lessons-
learned file or historical database.

The Triple Constraint provides a basis for understanding the effects of trade-off decisions
related to schedule, cost, and scope. Changing the value of one element of the triple
constraint will require some type of trade-off or adjustment to at least one other element

Trade -off analysis involves asking the questions "How much must I give up to get more of
what I want most?"How much must I give up, and from where? "How much and what must
I give up?

Remember - Trade off analysis goes well beyond the factors of the familiar Triple
Constraint. Consider factors such as employee wellbeing, safety, additional add on
business, political stability, ethics, and social needs.

Additional tips and practice items for the PMP(R) exam are included in each chapter and in
the section of the workbook entitled PMP(R) Exam and PMBOK(R) Guide Review.



Answers to Questions and Exercises

1. The Triple Constraint generally refers to the relationship of three project baselines--
   Schedule, Cost, and Quality or performance specifications.

2. The first step would be to determine the severity of the slippage. It may be early in the
   project and the slippages may not be on the critical path. Overtime could be used or
   additional resources brought. The best approach is not to jump to conclusions or
   solutions. Obtain information about causes and then make a decision when you have
   all of the available data.

3. Start by ensuring that the change control process is followed. Identify and discuss the
   risks associated with the change request. Alternatives include: negotiating for more
   time and more resources, recommending the initiation of a new project after the
   completion of the current project.

4. Resource availability, imposed start and end dates, skill of the resources, contractual
   milestones, available funding.

5. SMART

7. Costs would most likely be sacrificed in a, c, d, e, f, g.

8. There are many possible responses. Also consider the tradeoffs associated with each
    decision/.

    How can we get the project done faster? Add more resources, reduce the project scope,
       bring in better more qualified resources.

    How can we complete the project at a lower cost? Reduce scope, use less expensive
       resources, and eliminate defects and poor quality

    How can you reduce the amount of overtime you are using? Add more resources, add
       better trained and more efficient resources,

    How can we improve quality? Provide training, conduct audits, use better materials,
       and use trained resources

                     RISK MANAGEMENT

Risk is a measure of uncertainty. In the project management environment risk is generally
considered to be a measure of the probability and consequence associated with a specific
event or occurrence such as not achieving a defined project objective or missing a
milestone. Risk is also associated with potential opportunities that may enhance a project
outcome as well as threats that may create serious project related problems during the
planning and execution of a project. Risk is often viewed from a negative perspective and
the focus of the project manager and team is on the harmful, undesired consequences,
and expected losses that may occur. It is important to note that risk is also associated with
the potential for beneficial results that may be experienced from project decisions. Risk
management includes the processes associated with planning for risks, identification of
risks, prioritization of risks through analysis, responding to the risks, and monitoring and
controlling the project to prepare for new risks. The processes for risk management as
described in the PMBOK(R) Guide--Fifth edition are:
* Plan Risk Management
* Identify Risks
* Perform Qualitative Risk Analysis
* Perform Quantitative Risk Analysis
* Plan Risk Responses
* Control Risks
Risk management is an ongoing process that should be implemented in every phase of
a project. The project team should become actively involved in risk management and
adopt a "preventive" or proactive approach to managing risk. Project teams should
include risk management plans in the early stages of the project and continue to
emphasize the importance of regular risk reviews and assessments. An ideal point for a
risk review is at the completion of a phase where lessons learned may be discussed and
decisions about the next phase can be considered.
Project teams may develop well-written plans for guidance in execution but it is
important to remember that plans are based on estimates, expert judgment, analogies,
and lessons learned. Planning may reduce the probability of the occurrence of risk
events and prepare the team to manage an event if it should occur but the project
environment contains many uncertainties and therefore continuous emphasis on risk
management is of considerable importance to the project manager and all stakeholders.

264   CHAPTER SEVENTEEN


                       Risk has two primary components--Probability and Impact. Project
                       Risk is associated with the uncertainty of possible events or
                       conditions that, if they occur, may have a positive or negative
                       impact on the project or the objectives of the project. Project Risks
                       (potential occurrences) may have more than one cause and may
                       result in the experience of more than one consequence. It is
                       important to remember that there are different risks for each phase
                       of a project and some risks may occur again. Continued emphasis
                       about the importance of managing project risk and the need to have
                       a plan in place to address the uncertainties associated with a project
                       will increase the probability of successful project completion.

Utility The ability of a stakeholder to accept and manage risk as the intensity and
consequence of risk rises. The utility of a risk averter rises at a decreasing rate as risk
increases. The utility of a risk seeker increases as risk increases

Workaround A temporary response to an unplanned event.


Activities, Questions, and Exercises


Refer to Chapter 17 of Project Management: A Systems Approach to Planning, Scheduling,
and Controlling (11th Edition) for supporting information. Review each of the following
questions or exercises and provide the answers in the space provided.
The following questions and exercises are associated with the knowledge areas of the
PMBOK(R) Guide: Project Risk Management.




                           Proper Risk Management is proactive rather than reactive. The
                           project manager should instill risk management awareness and
                           risk management practices within the project team at the project
                           kickoff. Every team member should maintain awareness about
                           risk and participate in risk management planning.

    1.        PM Quick Check: Complete the following statement by placing the appropriate
         letter in the space provided.

         The process of qualitative analysis is _______________________________, while
         quantitative risk analysis is________________________________________.

         A. a rapid and cost effective method of prioritizing identified risks
         B. a method to determine the reliability of project risk data
         C. used to develop risk-related decisions using mathematical analysis and simulations
            that present possible outcomes of risk events
         D. used to create a watch list of low-priority risks




                            A very effective tool for identifying project risks is the Work
                            Breakdown Structure. The WBS displays the project activities and
                            the complexity of the project and can be used by the project team
                            to identify and then prioritize risks associated with each major
                            deliverable or at the work package level. The Work Breakdown
                            Structure can be used to create a Risk Breakdown structure which
                            will enable the team to categorize project risks.
                                                                          RISK MANAGEMENT     269




2. A Decision Tree Problem

   An author decides to write a workbook about how to pass the PMP(R) exam on the first
   try. Historical data indicates that, if the market is strong, gross sales will be $1 million.
   If the market is weak, the gross sales will be only $50,000. There is a 70% chance of a
   strong market and a 30% chance of a weak market.

   The author must decide whether to use a reputable publisher for the book or whether
   to self-publish the book himself. If he self-publishes the book, all of the sales receipts
   go to the author. But if he uses an external publisher, the publisher pays a 10% royalty
   on sales.

   The decision tree for the problem is shown below. Usually, decision trees are prepared
   from right to left rather than left to right. In the diagram below, the boxes on the right
   represent the revenue that comes to the author, whether it be royalties or gross sales.




   Now working from right to left, we can fill in the next row of boxes, which indicates the
   expected value of using the publisher as opposed to self-publishing:

   Expected value (publisher) = 70% x $100,000 + 30% x $5,000 = $71,500

   Expected value (self-publish) = 70% x $1M + 30% x $50,000 = $715,000

   This is shown in the following figure:
270    CHAPTER SEVENTEEN




      At this point, it certainly looks like you are better off self-publishing. But suppose your
      cost of self-publishing (i.e., materials, printing, marketing, advertising, etc.) is $600,000.
      This is an expense that must be subtracted from your revenue of $715,000. The result is
      shown in the figure below:




      In the box on the left, you see the two options at this point: $70,500 income if you go
      with the publisher and $115,000 if you self-publish. Therefore, $115,000 will go in the
      box on the left and, based upon probability theory, the best decision is to self-publish.
      While mathematically this might appear as the right decision, there is still another
      consideration. What happens if the author self-publishes and the market is weak? The
      author will receive $50,000 but may have expenses in the hundreds of thousands of
      dollars. The author can then lose a considerable sum of money. So, even though the
      solution says to self-publish, there is still a concern over the author's tolerance for risk.
                                                                       RISK MANAGEMENT       271


2b. Decision Tree Analysis. You are considering the decision to purchase a machine for
    internal production or to subcontract the work to an external source. The following
    information has been provided by your financial managers:
   Cost to purchase the machine--$35,000
   Cost to subcontract the work--$5,000
   Probability of a good market = 70%
   Probability of a poor market = 30%
   Reward if the prediction occurs:
   In the purchase machine decision good market scenario--$80,000;
   in the poor market scenario--$30,000
   In the Subcontract decision good market scenario--$50,000; in the poor market
   scenario--$15,000

   1. What is the expected value of the decision to purchase the machine? ______________
   2. What is the expected value of the decision to subcontract the machine? ____________

                    Project managers must be capable of managing in an uncertain
                    environment. The project environment will change continuously
                    and a proactive approach to risk management will help to minimize
                    surprises and prepare the project team to respond effectively to risk
                    situations. Remember, risk management is not a one-time event. It
                    is applied through the entire life cycle of the project.

8. Cool Tool!
      Here's an effective tool for the project manager's toolbox: The project plan is actually an
      integrated plan that includes elements of all ten knowledge areas of the PMBOK(R) Guide.
      Create a checklist for managing risk by listing all ten knowledge areas and then, working
      with the project team, identify the risks that may be encountered in each knowledge area.
      This technique will help the project team develop a broader understanding of the project
      and further illustrate how a project actually works as a system.

Kerzner "Quick tips" for the Project Management Institute PMP(R)
and CAPM(R) EXAM


The subjects in this chapter are most closely associated with the area of the PMBOK(R)
Guide: Project Risk Management.

Risk management should be practiced throughout the life cycle of the project.

Maintain an awareness of the risk tolerances of the organization, executive management,
the customer, and the project team. A risk-averse organization will attempt to minimize any
exposure to potential risk events.

Identify sources of risk. Use brainstorming, Delphi technique or nominal group technique
to identify potential risk situations.

Risks may be categorized to assist the team in identifying risks and also in preparing to
respond to risks. An effective method for categorizing risks is to use the knowledge areas
of the PMBOK(R) Guide as a basis.

Risk response is generally associated with four types of action: Avoidance, Transfer,
Mitigation, and Acceptance.

There are two types of acceptance when responding to risk--passive or no action until the
event occurs and active--planning a contingency to be ready if an event occurs.

As risks occur it is helpful to document the causes of the risk event and the rationale
behind the corrective action that will be taken. The documentation can be placed in
historical files and shared as lessons learned.

Remember: Risk will continue to appear throughout the project life cycle. Risk reviews and
audits should be scheduled on a regular basis and risk management should be included in
your project status meeting agendas.

Remember that the sum of the probabilities of each branch in the chance mode of a
decision tree will always add up to 100%.


 Additional tips and practice items for the PMP(R) exam are included in each chapter and in
 the section of the workbook entitled PMP(R) Exam and PMBOK(R) Guide Review.

16. You are the project manager for the development of a new product. The following

   finishing on time and a 40% chance of finishing over budget. What is the probability
   that the project will finish on time and within budget?

      chance of being over budget = 60 % of being within budget.

17. Consider the following project information provided by a functional manager:
   Optimistic time for completion of the project is 12 weeks. Pessimistic time is 40 weeks.
   Most likely time is 25 weeks.

          Using the weighted average formula, what is the probability that the project will be
           completed between 14.33 weeks and 33.01 weeks?

      Mean = 23.67 (optimistic + 4 times the most likely + pessimistic) / 6

      Standard deviation = 4.67 (pessimistic - optimistic) / 6

      Probability of completing the project between 14.33 weeks and 33.01 weeks = 95%

      Mean of 23.67 minus 2 standard deviations = 14.33. The mean plus two standard
      deviations = 33.01. In normal distribution the probability of achieving a result with two
      standard deviations is 95%.

                       LEARNING CURVES
Learning curves were first introduced in 1936 by T.P. Wright. Wright described a theory for
obtaining estimates based on repetitive production of airplane assemblies. The concept of
learning curves has since been used for estimating all types of projects and programs from
manufacturing to the space shuttle program. Learning curves are also known as progress
functions. The theory of learning curves is based on the concept that repeating the same
process or operation many times results in a reduction in the time and effort required to
complete the process. Most people experience learning curves when they try a new product for
the first time, when a new software application is used, or a new tool. The first time the process
or operation is tried may take a considerable amount of time if it had never been performed
before. The more the process, operation, or tool is used or performed the better the operator
becomes at working with it. This reduces overall effort and decreases the actual time to
complete the operation. The learning curve theory as written by T.P. Wright states that the
direct labor hours necessary to complete a unit of production will decrease by a constant
percentage each time production quantity is doubled. If the rate of improvement is 20%
between doubled quantities, then the learning percent would be 80% (100 - 20 + 80). Learning
curves are used to emphasize time but the principle can be related to cost also. (Information
adapted from the National Aeronautics and Space Administration--Cost Estimating Processes.)
Learning curves are most useful for estimating projects or operations that involve
developing and estimating large quantities of deliverables or units. Determining the cost
of producing the first unit may be relatively easy to calculate but the challenge is to
determine the cost of the 100th, 1,000th, or 10,000th unit. The learning curve process is
used to determine those costs and becomes a useful estimating tool.
Learning curve analysis is primarily used in situations that provide an opportunity for
improvement or reduction in labor hours per unit.


                        Learning curves stipulate that manufacturing man-hours
                        (specifically, direct labor) will decline each time a company
                        doubles its output. There are three basic conclusions about the
                        learning curve theory:
                        * The time required to perform a task decreases as the task is repeated
                        * The amount of improvement decreases as more units are produced
                        * The rate of improvement has sufficient consistency to allow its
                          use as a prediction tool




                                                                                               281
282   CHAPTER EIGHTEEN


Glossary of terms           Key terms and definitions to review and remember

Cumulative Average Hours The average hours expended per unit for all units
produced through any given unit. When illustrated on a graph by a line drawn through
each successive unit, the values for a cumulative average curve.

Cumulative Total Hours The total hours expended for all units produced through any
given unit. The data plotted on a graph with each point connected by a line form a
cumulative total curve.

Slope of the Curve A percentage figure that represents the steepness (constant rate of
improvement) of the curve. Using the unit curve theory, this percentage represents the
value (example, hours or cost) at a doubled production quantity in relation to the previous
quantity. For example, with an experience curve having an 80% slope, the value of unit two
is 80% of the value of unit one. The value of unit four is 80% of the value of unit two. The
value of unit 1,000 is 80% of the value of unit 500.

Unit One The first unit or product actually completed during a production run.

Unit Hours The total direct labor hours expended to complete any specific unit. When a
line is drawn on a graph through the values for each successive unit, the values form a unit
curve.


Project Estimating Using Learning Curves

Learning curves stipulate that the more often you perform a task, the less time (and
money) is needed. This concept is very important to companies that have labor-intensive
product lines with large volume production. Learning curves allow a company to take
advantage of economies of scale and prevent new competitors from entering into the
marketplace.

Learning curves have the following properties:

      * The time required to perform a task decreases as the task is repeated
      * Manufacturing man-hours will decrease by a fixed percentage each time
        production is doubled
      * The rate of improvement has sufficient consistency to allow its use as a
        prediction tool


The following figure shows a typical learning when plotted in Cartesian coordinates:
                                                                       LEARNING CURVES    283




As the number of units produced increases, the time required for each unit decreases.
Most companies use hours on the Y-axis rather than cost because cost can change
resulting from salary, overhead and raw material price increases.

Most companies plot learning curves on log-log paper rather than in Cartesian coordinates.
When this is done, the curve will appear as a straight line as shown in the following figure.




If the figure represents an 80% learning curve, then each time production doubles, the rate
of learning will be at the same 80%. As an example, if the 100th unit produced required 300
hours, then the 200th unit produced would be 80% times 300 hours, or 240 hours. The
400th unit produced would then be 80% of the time needed for the 200th unit, or (80% x
240 hours), which equals 192 hours.
284       CHAPTER EIGHTEEN


Learning curves are more appropriate for labor-intensive product lines rather than
automated product lines because people can learn whereas capital equipment does not
learn. An 80% learning curve is better than a 90% learning curve.

Learning curves can undergo improvements. In other words, there are activities that can
help us go from an 85% learning curve to an 80% learning curve. Some of these activities
include:

      * Training and educating the workers
      * Making improvements in the way the work is performed
      * Installing new production processes
      * Hiring more skilled labor
      * Using higher quality raw materials that are easier to use
      * Redesigning the product so that difficult manufacturing steps can be
        eliminated or minimized
      * Offering workers incentives or disincentives to work better and smarter

There are also factors that can prevent improvements to a learning curve. These include:

      *People refuse to learn better ways of doing their job
      *People are not motivated
      *People have no faith in the learning curve concept
      *People will not work better or smarter without incentives
      *People are expected to work in the way that violates health and safety
       protocols
The figure below shows what happens when the learning curve improves. This is often
called "toe down" learning.
                                                                      LEARNING CURVES    285


Learning curves work best if there is no break in the learning process. This means no long-
term shutdown in the manufacturing process. For example, if the manufacturing process
must be shut down for several months, perhaps because of large inventories and fewer
customers, the learning curve will not start up at the same point because the workers may
need to be re-educated on how to do the job. This is often referred to as a "toe up"
learning curve as show in the following figure.




Learning cannot continue forever. Sometimes learning becomes "pegged" at a specific
level as shown in the figure below. The pegged level becomes the standard for estimating
the time and cost of producing a unit.

manufacturing company.

A company manufactures products on a 75% learning curve. The company has already
produced 100 units, which had a total cost of $14,932 according to the table.



      A. What is the average cost per unit for the first 100 units?

            $14,932 / 100 = $149.32 per unit



      B. How much did it cost to produce the 100th unit?

            From the table, the 100th unit was $92



  C.        According to learning curve theory, if production doubles to 200 units, the 200th
            unit should require only 75% of the 100th unit. Is that correct?

            75% x $92 = $69, which matches the entry in the above table
                                                                LEARNING CURVES   287


D.      If you have already produced 100 units and you have a customer that wants
to purchase another 100 units, what is your average cost per unit for that customer
for the next 100 units (i.e. units 101-200)?

($22,751 - $14,932) / 100 = $78.19 per unit



E.      Sometimes, companies prefer to use hours rather than dollars. Assume in
the above table that the second and third columns represent hours rather than
dollars. If the company has 1500 hours of manufacturing available per month to go
from 101 to 200 units of production, how many months will be required?

(22,751 hours - 14,932 hours) = 7,819 hours

7,819 hours / 1500 hours/month = 5.2 months



F.      Whenever hours are used, we need to know the fully burdened employee
labor rate to convert to dollars. Assume that the employees are fully burdened at
$110 per hour and, using part E above, the company wishes to make a profit of 10%
on the sale of units 101-200. Also, assume that 160 hours of management and
supervision are need each month in addition to the manufacturing hours, and these
hours are also billed at $110. (Disregard any costs for raw materials since this
information is not provided.)



Manufacturing hours (from Part E) =                     7,819 hours

Support hours = (5.2 months x 160 hours per month) =      832 hours

                                                         =========

                                                         8,651 hours



8,651 hours x $110 per hour = $951,610

10% profit =                    95,161

                           =======

                            $1,046,771



G.      Learning curves can also be used to price out products. As an example, using
the table at the beginning of the problem, assume that the last two columns are costs
rather than hours. Your company has produced 400 units thus far, and next year
expects to sell 200 units according to marketing data. If these numbers are correct,
and management wants to keep the price fixed for the entire year, using the learning
curve for pricing what should be the fixed selling price of the product assuming a
10% profit margin is desired? This is an example of mid-point pricing.
288   CHAPTER EIGHTEEN




        The cost for the 400th unit is $52 per unit.



        The cost for the 600th unit is $44 per unit.



        Using midpoint pricing, the selling price = ($52 + $44) / 2 = $48



        Adding in a 10% profit, $48 x (1.10) = $52.80



One more problem.

You have already produced 200 units, and a new customer appears wanting to purchase
600 units. If your material cost is fixed at $60 per unit, a fully burdened hour is $110 and the
above table represents labor hours only, how much should you charge the customer if you
wish to make a 10% profit? (i.e. total cost) Also assume 1500 hours of manufacturing labor
available per month and management support is 160 hours per month for the duration of
the project.



Answer:     Manufacturing labor hours for 600 units (unit 201 - 800) =

            (52,212 - 22,751) = 29,461 hours



            Support hours = (29,461/1500) x 160 = 3,142 hours



            Labor cost = (29,461 + 3,142) x $110       =    $3,586,330



            Total material cost = 600 units x $60       =    $    36,000

                                                             $3,622,330



10% profit =                                                     362,233

                                                            ========

                                                             $3,984,563
                                                                       LEARNING CURVES   289


Now, let's add a small twist to this problem. Assume that learning is pegged when the
500th unit is produced. In other words, for all units produced after the 500th unit is
manufactured, the hours needed for production of each unit will be at the hours needed for
the 500th unit. How much time is required to produce units 201 - 800?

Units 201 - 500 require: 39,442 hours - 22,751 hours = 16,691 hours

From the table, the 500th unit (the pegged point) = 47 hours

Units 501 - 800 require: 300 units x 47 hours/unit = 14,100 hours.

Therefore, total hours = 16,691 + 14,100 = 30,791 hours

   A company manufactures products on a 75% learning curve. The company has already
   produced 100 units, which had a total cost of $14,932 according to the table. Questions
   and solutions have been provided for review purposes.



   A. What is the average cost per unit for the first 100 units?
      $14,932/100 = $149.32 per unit
   B. How much did it cost to produce the 100th unit?
      From the table, the 100th unit is $92
   C. According to learning curve theory, if production doubles to 200 units, the 200th unit
      should require only 75% of the 100th unit. Is that correct?
      70% x 92 = $69, which matches the entry in the above table
290   CHAPTER EIGHTEEN


      D. If you have already produced 100 units and you have a customer that wants to
         purchase another 100 units, what is your average cost per unit for that customer?
         ($22,751 - $14,932)/100 = $78.19 per unit

      Now it is your turn.

You have already produced 200 units, and a new customer appears wanting to purchase
  600 units. If your material cost is fixed at $60 per unit and the above table represents
  labor hours only, and you wish to make a 10% profit, how much should you charge the
  customer? (i.e., total cost)

Key point--The steeper the curve, the easier the learning.

Example of learning curve in action: It may cost $100 million to build the first copy of a
new airplane, $80 million to build the second, $64 million to make the fourth, $51 million to
make the eighth, and so on. The planes actually become less expensive to build as the
workers and the company learn how to build them more efficiently. As the work is
repeated, the workers become faster at completing tasks and they make fewer mistakes
while reducing the amount of scrap and wasted material. (From Gary H. Anthes, The
Learning Curve: A Quick Study in "Computer World," July 2, 2001.)

The very basic concept of the learning curve is that practice improves performance.

Learning Curve Limitations

* The learning curve does not continue forever. The percentage decline in hours/dollars
  diminishes over time
* The learning curve knowledge gained on one product may not be extendable to other
  products unless there exist shared experiences
* Cost data may not be readily available in order to construct a meaningful learning curve.
  Other problems can occur if overhead costs are included with the direct labor cost, or if
  the accounting codes cannot separate work packages sufficiently in order to identify
  those elements that truly demonstrate experience effects
* Quantity discounts can distort the costs and the perceived benefits of learning curves

* Inflation must be expressed in constant dollars. Otherwise, the gains realized from
  experience may be neutralized
* Learning curves are most useful on long-term horizons (years). On short-term horizons,
  benefits perceived may not be the result of the learning curves
                                                                       LEARNING CURVES    291


* External influences, such as limitations on materials, patents, or even government
  regulations, can restrict the benefits of learning curves
* Constant annual production may have a limiting experience effect after a few years
  (example--no growth)




Kerzner "Quick tips" for the Project Management Institute PMP(R)
and CAPM(R) EXAM


The subjects in this chapter are most closely associated with the areas of the PMBOK(R)
Guide: Project Time Management and Project Cost Management.

The basic principles of learning curves are:

1. The time required to perform a task decreases as the task is repeated.

2. The amount of improvement decreases as more units are produced.

3. The rate of improvement has sufficient consistency to allow its use as a prediction tool.

The learning curve theory is based on the principle that practice improves performance.

The consistency of improvement in the learning curve has been found to exist in a constant
percentage reduction in time required over successively doubled quantities or units
produced.

The constant percentage by which costs of doubled quantities decrease is called the rate of
learning.


 Additional tips and practice items for the PMP(R) exam are included in each chapter and in
 the section of the workbook entitled PMP(R) Exam and PMBOK(R) Guide Review.



Answers to Questions and Exercises

1. Average labor cost for 600 units (unit 201-800) = ($52,212 - $22,751)/600 = $49.10 per
   unit
   Total labor for these 600 units = 600 x $49.10 = $29,461
   Total material cost = 600 units x $60         = $36,000

             CONTRACT MANAGEMENT

 Determining what items or resources must be obtained or acquired to successfully
 complete project deliverables and then negotiating the contracts that will guide the
 buyer and seller through the execution process can be very challenging regardless of
 the size or complexity of a project. In the contract and procurement environment there
 are two views, the buyer and the seller. These two views are often opposing and require
 effective negotiation to achieve mutually agreeable terms and conditions.

 The Project Contract Management process includes the activities that will be used to
 determine what to purchase, how to purchase materials or resources, the preparation of
 documents that will be used in the process including requests for proposal (RFPs)
 selecting the appropriate suppliers, completing the contract and managing the contract,
 and closing or terminating the contract.

 Contracts create legal obligations for the buyer and seller. These obligations include
 risks that must be considered before contractual terms are agreed upon. The risks for
 the buyer may be different than those of the seller depending on the type of contract
 that has been developed. Contract types are selected based on the needs of the buyer,
 the amount of detailed information that is available about the project, the deliverables
 that must be produced, the environmental factors that may affect the project, and the
 ability of the supplier to meet the needs of the buyer. A significant amount of
 negotiating may take place before a contract is agreed upon. The time and effort
 associated with contract negotiations and the impact of those negotiations on critical
 time frames must also be considered.



Major Contract Elements

1. Intention to enter into a legal relationship. Contracts are generally considered legal
   relationships and are presumed to include agreements about business, commerce, or
   other factors that are intended to be legally binding.

2. Contracts include an offer and an acceptance. The offer is a response to a need
   and the acceptance is based on the specific details of the offer.

3. Consideration. Consideration is something of value, usually money that will be
   exchanged for the service or product provided.



                                                                                            293
294    CHAPTER NINETEEN



4. Capacity. The parties involved in the contract must have the actual capacity to fully
   understand and carry out the terms and conditions of the contract. A minor would be
   considered to lack the "capacity" to enter into a contract.

5. Genuine consent. Consent must be given without pressure or misrepresentation. The
   nature of the contract must be fully understood. If the behavior of the seller is such that
   a contract is agreed upon that has been misrepresented or forced due to the behavior of
   the seller, the contract may be subject to be voided.

6. Legality of objects. The contract must meet certain requirements for actual trade.
   There cannot be any terms that may actually be in violation of conditions established in
   the geographic area where the agreement has been negotiated. Restraints of trade must
   be considered before the contract terms and conditions are agreed upon.

                          In general, companies provide services or products based on the
                          invitations for competitive bids issued by clients. One of the most
                          important factors in preparing proposals and estimating the cost
                          and profit of a project is the type of contract expected. There are
                          contract types that may reduce the risk to the buyer and there are
                          contract types that reduce the risk to the seller. Determining
                          contract type will depend on the specific needs of each party
                          involved in the negotiating process.



Procurement Strategies

There are two basic procurement strategies:

* Corporate procurement--the relationship of specific procurement actions to the
  corporate strategy. This is generally associated with a centralized procurement process
  to ensure the greatest benefit to an organization through control and economies of scale.

* Project procurement strategy--the relationship of specific procurement actions to the
  operating environment of the project. This strategy is focused at the project level and is
  focused on speed of acquisition and meeting the specific needs of the project.

Procurement planning generally involves the following decisions or objectives:

*   Procure all goods and services from a single source
*   Procure all goods and services from multiple sources
*   Procure only a small portion of goods and services
*   Procure none of the goods and services (all production will take place internally)
*   Procure goods and services from a sole source--only one supplier is available and there
    is no choice but to use that supplier

Procurement management also includes the "make-or-buy" decision process, the rent-or-
lease decision, the selection of suppliers, negotiation of the contract terms, selection of
contract type, and the administration of the contract throughout the project life cycle. At
project closeout the contract is reviewed to determine if all terms and conditions including
all agreed upon deliverables have been produced and are accepted.
                                                                CONTRACT MANAGEMENT        295



Glossary of terms         Key terms and definitions to review and remember

Acceptance Unconditional agreement to an offer. The agreement creates the contract
as solid and binding on both sides. Prior to signing, any party is free to withdraw.

Arbitration An independent third party used to settle disputes out of court. The
arbitrator must be agreed upon by both sides. Contracts can have clauses nominating
arbitrators in advance in case the need arises.

Bidder Conference A meeting during which information is shared by the buyer to all
sellers who have an interest in presenting a bid or proposal.

Collective agreement Term for agreements made between employees and employers.
Usually involves trade unions. These are often covered by more than one organization and
can be seen as contracts but are not governed by contract law.

Condition A term of fundamental importance to the contract, the breach of which may
cause the contract to be terminated.

Consideration In a contract each side benefits in some way, they give each other some
consideration. This would usually be a price paid by one in exchange for goods supplied
by the other. But anything of value to the other party can be used.

Contract Any legally enforceable promise or set of promises made by one party to
another. An oral or written agreement between two or more parties which is enforceable
by law.

Design Specification The specific details in terms of physical characteristics that
describe, define, and specify what is to be done. The risk of performance is on the buyer.

Force Majeure Exemption from penalties due to nonfulfillment of contractual
obligations resulting from conditions beyond the control of the parties involved.
Examples--earthquake, floods, war.

Functional Specification A subset of performance specification. The specific end use
of the product. What actions or functions it is intended to do when placed into use.

Indemnity Generally, a payment or compensation for damages done. Protection against
future loss. An obligation of one party to reimburse another party for losses which have
occurred or which may occur.

Liquidated Damages A sum, usually a fixed amount per day, to be paid as damages to
an owner by a contractor due to failure to complete the specified work within the
timeframe stipulated in the contract.

Make or Buy The decision to make a product or produce a service internally or purchase
the required item from an external supplier.

Performance Specification The measurable capabilities the product must achieve in
terms of operational characteristics. The risk of performance is on the contractor.

Privity Mutual relationship to the same rights of property or contract relationship. The
doctrine of privity provides that a contract cannot confer rights or impose obligations
arising under it on any person or agent except the parties to the contract.
296   CHAPTER NINETEEN



Procurement      The acquisition of goods or services.

Screening System Process to determine if a seller has the minimum qualifications to
participate in the bidding process

Severability If any provision of the terms of use shall be deemed unlawful, void, or for
any reason unenforceable, then that provision shall be deemed severable from the
remaining terms of use and shall not affect the validity and enforceability of any remaining
provisions.

Single Source One and only one seller out of a group of qualified sellers. A seller /
contractor is selected by a buyer to provide all procured goods and services. Consider the
risks associated with this decision.

Sole Source A seller is the only available source of a particular item that must be
procured.

Waiver Voluntary relinquishment or surrender of some right or privilege.

Warranty A statement, either written, expressed, or implied, providing assurance that
some specified provision in a contract is true. A protection plan against major repairs and
breakdowns.


PMBOK(R) Guide--Fifth Edition


Project Procurement Management Processes

The major processes of Project Procurement Management are:

Plan procurements Documenting project procurement decisions. This process is
concerned with determining what products or services must be acquired from outside the
organization and what will be produced internally.

Conduct Procurements the processes associated with obtaining seller responses,
selecting sellers and awarding contracts

Control Procurements The processes associated with managing procurement
relationships, monitoring contract performance, and making changes and corrections.

Close Procurements the processes associated with terminating contracts, finalizing
open claims, updating records and closing completed procurements.


Activities, Questions, and Exercises


Refer to Chapter 19 of Project Management: A Systems Approach to Planning, Scheduling,
and Controlling (11th Edition) for supporting information. Review each of the following
questions or exercises and provide the answers in the space provided.
The following questions and exercises are associated with the knowledge areas of the
PMBOK(R) Guide: Project Procurement Management and Project Risk Management.
                                                               CONTRACT MANAGEMENT      297




                      The objective of the award cycle in contract negotiations is to
                      reach agreement on a contract that will result in reasonable
                      contractor risk and provide the contractor with the greatest
                      incentive for efficient and effective economic performance.




 1. Make-or-Buy Decision.

   Review the list of factors that influence the make-or-buy decision and place them in the
   appropriate column.


 The Make Decision                            The Buy Decision




Factors:
   A. Less costly
   B. Easy integration of operations
   C. Utilize skills of suppliers
   D. Utilize existing capacity that may be idle

   H. Avoid unreliable supplier base
   I. Maintain design/production secrecy
   J. Augment existing labor force
   K. Maintain multiple qualified vendor sources
   L. Stabilize existing workforce
   M. Indirect control

 2. To Rent or Lease--That Is the Question
298    CHAPTER NINETEEN



The lease/rent decision is a financial endeavor that requires some analysis before
making a decision. Consider the following situation:

You have the option to rent a piece of equipment for $200 per day. You can also
   lease the equipment for $70 per day plus a one-time cost of $8,000. You need
   the equipment for 75 days. Should you rent or lease?

      A. Rent _______ Lease _______
      B. What is the break-even point in days? _______




                           Before accepting the terms of a contract, many organizations
                           conduct a detailed risk assessment using a third party that is not
                           directly connected to the negotiations. This provides a more
                           objective approach to the assessment and may identify significant
                           risks that were not noticed during the negotiations process.



 3. To ensure that no contractor has more knowledge about a request for a proposal, the
      buyer schedules a ________________ to provide an opportunity for all potential
      contractors to ask questions about the proposal and provide the same information to
      all interested parties.

      a) Seller audit
      b) Bidder's conference
      c) Phase review
      d) Request for bid

      Study notes:

The procurement process may include the use of several different documents:

* The Request for Information (RFI)--A document used to obtain information from
  potential providers before a formal request for proposal is issued. A document issued by
  a buyer to find providers or check that service levels of existing providers will meet the
  needs of the buyer.
* The Request for Quotation (RFQ)--A request for a final price quotation for a precise set
  of requirements.
* The Request for Proposal (RFP)--The formal mechanism or document by which a
  company conveys its business requirements to potential contractors/suppliers. An open
  invitation to potential suppliers to provide a proposal to meet the needs of the buyer.

Negotiation

The primary goal of negotiation should be to achieve a deal that both parties involved will
agree to and that will accomplish the objectives established by both sides. Negotiation
may require compromising, accommodating, and adjusting of demands before agreement
can be reached. In some cases it will be necessary to identify common ground from which
negotiations can begin.
                                                                    CONTRACT MANAGEMENT     299



Study notes: Tactics for negotiation:
* Ask open-ended questions--why? who? when?
* Probing--Ask questions that will help identify the other party's underlying needs.
  Example--I am not sure I understand why this point is so important to you. Can you
  explain your issues and concerns to help me understand?
* Control the documentation--Take notes or minutes to capture the information discussed.
  This will help keep the results of the negotiation accurate and fair.
* Develop alternatives (BATNA)--What other steps may be taken to satisfy specific needs?
  BATNA means Best Alternative to Negotiated Agreement. When the original negotiations
  toward an agreement are not successful, alternatives are introduced that may have a
  better chance of reaching agreement.
* Awareness of hygiene factors--Location selection for negotiations, type of table (round
  or rectangular), time of day, size of the room, room set-up, who sits facing the window.
* Set objectives for the minimum that will be accepted or the maximum that will be offered.
* Do not offer your minimum or maximum objectives at the start of negotiations. These
  are your objectives and will help to measure your success.


                          Negotiations should be planned for. The activities associated with
                          negotiations include:
                          * Developing objectives--what is the minimum that will be accepted?
                            What is the maximum that will be offered?
                          * Evaluate the other party--strengths, weaknesses
                          * Define your strategy and tactics
                          * Gather all the facts you can
                          * Perform a complete price/cost analysis (Do your homework!)
                          * Arrange the "hygiene factors" to accommodate the negotiations

 7. Calculating Project Costs
      Review each of the following examples and determine the final price paid by the buyer.
      In some cases, a buyer and seller may negotiate an incentive type project that will
      benefit both sides if the conditions are met. Incentive contracts may be developed to
      speed up completion of a project or reduce buyer costs.
      Example: Cost Plus Incentive Fee Contract

      Target Cost           $100,000
      Target Fee            $20,000
      Target Price          $120,000
      Sharing Ratio 70/30 (70% to buyer, 30% to seller)
      Actual Cost           $90,000
                                                               CONTRACT MANAGEMENT       301



  Additional fee = $100,000 - $90,000 (target cost - actual cost) = $10,000 x .30 = $3,000
  Total fee paid = $20,000 (agreed upon fee) plus $3,000 incentive = $23,000
  Total project price = $23,000 + $90,000 = $113,000

8. More Contractions! Cost Plus Incentive Fee Contract (CPIF)

  In the CPIF contract, the seller receives a bonus for performing the work below a target
  cost. As an example, consider the data below provided for a CPIF contract:

  Target cost                $200,000
  Target fee                 $14,000
302    CHAPTER NINETEEN



      Sharing ratio                80/20
      Profit ceiling               $18,000
      Profit floor                 $4,000

      In this example, the seller has agreed upon a target cost of $200,000 and a target fee of
      $14,000. If the seller performs the work at a lower cost than the $200,000, then the
      seller will receive additional profit up to a maximum profit of $18,000. If the seller
      performs the work for more than the target cost of $200,000, then the seller will receive
      less profit, but at least the minimum of $4,000.

      The sharing ratio represents the amount of the overrun or underrun shared by each
      party. The first number represents the buyer and the second number represents the
      seller. If the work is performed below the target cost the buyer keeps 80% of the
      underrun and the seller keeps 20% of the underrun as extra profit up to a maximum
      profit of $18,000. If the contract is overrun, the buyer pays 80% of the overrun and the
      seller pays 20%, which is subtracted from the target profit as long as the profit is no
      less than $4,000. This is shown in the figure below:




      Consider the following example where the work is performed at $190,000.

      Cost saving is $10,000.

      Seller keeps 20% x 10,000 = $2,000 in extra profit.

      Seller's total profit is therefore $16,000.

      Seller will be reimbursed actual cost plus profit, which equals $206,000.

      Now let's assume the seller spent $240,000 performing the work.

      Cost overrun is $40,000.
                                                                 CONTRACT MANAGEMENT        303



  Buyer pays 80% or $32,000.

  Seller pays 20% of $40,000 or $8,000, which is subtracted from profits, resulting in a
  total profit of $6,000.

  Seller will be reimbursed actual cost plus profit, or $246,000.

  Now it's your turn. For each of the four situations below, and using the same
  data from the above problem, calculate the amount of money reimbursed to
  the seller if the seller's actual cost was:

  a.   $260,000
  b.   $230,000
  c.   $180,000
  d.   $140,000

9. An Incentive to Learn! Fixed Price Incentive Fee Contract (FPIF)

  The fixed price incentive fee contract is very similar to the CPIF contract with the
  exception that instead of having the floor and ceiling on the profits, there is a ceiling on
  the final price paid by the seller. Using the data below:

  Target cost: $200,000
  Target fee: $14,000
  Sharing ratio: 80/20
  Price ceiling: $250,000

  The price ceiling is the point of total assumption, or the maximum amount that the
  buyer will reimburse the seller. At the point of total assumption, the contract becomes
  a firm fixed price contract and the seller incurs all cost overrun from that point forth
  with no sharing.

  Let's use the two examples from the above problem where the actual costs were
  $190,000 and $240,000. The problem progresses the same way and we calculate the
  contract price, which was $206,000 and $246,000, respectively. In both cases, since the
  contract price did not exceed the price ceiling of $250,000, the seller will receive the full
  value of the price. If the price were $255,000, the seller would be reimbursed only
  $250,000.

  It is possible that the actual cost can be so large that all of the profit will be lost.
  However, negative profit cannot exist. The most the seller can lose in profit is the target
  profit.

  Now it's your turn. Assume that each of the four choices below is the seller's
  actual cost for performing the work. How much will the seller receive from
  the buyer at the completion of the contract?

  a.   $300,000
  b.   $260,000
  c.   $250,000
  d.   $240,000
304    CHAPTER NINETEEN



10. Relative Contract Risk

      Each type of contract has some degree of risk that is shared between the buyer and the
      seller. Consider the following nine contract types:

      a) Cost Plus Incentive Fee (CPIF)
      b) Cost Plus Award Fee (CPAF)
      c) Firm Fixed Price (FFP)
      d) Cost Plus Percentage of Cost (CPPC)
      e) Cost Sharing (CS)
      f) Cost Only (C)
      g) Firm Fixed Price with Economic Adjustment (FFE)
      h) Fixed Price Incentive Fee (FPIF)
      i) Cost Plus Fixed Fee ( CPFF)

      In the figure below, label each of the nine triangles, which represent each contract type,
      as to how the risk is shared between the buyer and seller.




11. Procurement Options

      There are four basic options available for procurement:

      A. Procure all goods/services from a single source
      B. Procure all goods/services from multiple sources
      C. Procure only a small portion of the goods/services
      D. Procure none of the goods/services
                                                                CONTRACT MANAGEMENT       305



   For each of the situations below, select the most likely option that would be selected:
   1. You have the capability to produce a product. If the marketplace likes your product
      and demand increases sharply, the demand will most likely exceed your
      manufacturing capability. To minimize future risks, you decide to select one supplier
      as a backup and give them a small portion of the production contract. In this case,
      you would most likely be using option ______.
   2. The demand for your product has exceeded expectations and you have decided to
      outsource all of the work. To minimize your dependency (i.e., risk) with using one
      contractor who might eventually "hold you hostage," you would most likely select
      option _____.
   3. You have performed a make-buy analysis and discovered that it is more economical for
      you to manufacture the product yourself. The most likely option would be option _____.
   4. Your company maintains a list of preferred suppliers all of whom could individually
      satisfy your production requirements. However, one supplier has continuously tried
      to keep costs down for the benefit of both you and the supplier. The most likely
      option would be option _____.
   5. Your company had decided to manufacture all of the goods in-house. However, you
      have just won a large contract which may necessitate that the remaining portion of
      the production be outsourced so that manufacturing capability will exist for the new
      project. The most likely option selected would be option _____.

12. Make Versus Buy
   During procurement planning, the project manager must decide whether to produce
   the goods/services internally to buy the goods/services externally. For each of the
   statements below, select whether the most likely option would be to make it or buy it:
    1. Some suppliers can do it cheaper than you can.        Make: _____ Buy: _____
    2. Management wants to stabilize the workforce.          Make: _____ Buy: _____
    3. Your needs are one-of-a-kind and low volume.          Make: _____ Buy: _____
    4. You prefer direct control over quality and cost.      Make: _____ Buy: _____
    5. The product has proprietary knowledge in it.          Make: _____ Buy: _____
    6. Your in-house capacity is limited.                    Make: _____ Buy: _____
    7. You want to augment the existing labor force.         Make: _____ Buy: _____
    8. The preferred suppliers have superior skills.         Make: _____ Buy: _____
    9. You want indirect control to minimize risks.          Make: _____ Buy: _____
   10. The supplier base is unreliable.                      Make: _____ Buy: _____
13. Rent Versus Lease
   Your company has a need for some specialized equipment that can be leased or rented.
   If you rent the equipment, the cost is $100 per day. If you prefer to lease the equipment,
   which is usually for a longer period of time, the cost is $2,000 (nonrefundable payment)
   plus $50 per day. What is the breakeven point where renting and leasing are the same?
   Let X = the breakeven number of days
   Renting = $100X
   Leasing = $2,000 + $50X
   Therefore, $100X = $2,000 + $50X
306    CHAPTER NINETEEN



      Solving for X, we find that X = 40 days. Therefore, if you plan on using the equipment
      for less than 40 days, the cost-effective decision is to rent. For more than 40 days of
      use, the correct decision is to lease.
      Now it's your turn. A company needs some equipment for 120 days to meet
      contractual requirements. The rental cost is $200 per day and the leasing
      cost is $10,000 plus $75 per day. Should the company rent or lease?

Kerzner "Quick tips" for the Project Management Institute PMP(R)
and CAPM(R) EXAM


The subjects in this chapter are most closely associated with the areas of the PMBOK(R)
Guide: Project Procurement Management.

A contract is a legally binding and enforceable agreement.

A contract may be created either by verbal or written agreement or by implication by the
conduct or actions of the parties involved.

Remember--The major elements of a contract are: offer, acceptance, consideration,
capacity, legal form.

Contracts should be reviewed and validated to ensure that the conditions and objectives
within the contract will meet the objectives of the organizations involved.
310   CHAPTER NINETEEN



Contracts should be read thoroughly and carefully to make sure that the basic terms are
clearly stated and fully understood.

There are several types of contracts. The Firm Fixed Price Contract places the greatest
amount of risk on the seller. The Cost Plus Type contracts place the greatest amount of risk
on the buyer.

Incentive contracts are negotiated to achieve mutually agreed upon benefits between the
buyer and seller. Sharing ratios are established to calculate the actual incentives. Incentive
Type contracts are designed to accelerate project completion or keep costs as low as
possible.

Make-or-buy decisions should be carefully analyzed to obtain the greatest benefits
regarding cost, control, and quality.

A letter of intent or letter contract may be used to begin work before the final contract
terms and conditions have been officially approved and accepted.

A constructive change is a change that causes the contractor to perform work differently
than initially required due to the action or inaction of the customer or other parties. An
example of a constructive change would be late or unsuitable customer-furnished
property.

 Additional tips and practice items for the PMP(R) exam are included in each chapter and in
 the section of the workbook entitled PMP Exam and PMBOK Guide(R) Review.

               QUALITY MANAGEMENT

The key to managing quality is to maintain a continuous awareness that quality is
defined by the customer. Quality is a continuously improving process where lessons
learned are used to enhance future products and services in order to retain existing
customers, win back lost customers, and win new customers. The quality process
includes planning for quality, organizing for quality, executing the work, monitoring the
work, solving problems by identifying causes of poor quality, re-planning, and
establishing preventive measures to reduce defects and poor quality.

There are several approaches and principles to achieving quality. These include:

* Determining the cost of quality

* Zero defect programs

* Total Quality Management (TQM)

* Reliability engineering

These principles and others have been established by organizations worldwide and are
being implemented for the basic reason that quality is of strategic importance to a
company. Quality is linked to profitability, it is a competitive weapon, it is an integral
part of strategic planning, and it requires an organization-wide commitment. Every
employee in any organization is responsible for quality.




                        Organizations generally agree that quality cannot be accurately
                        defined by the organization. Quality is defined by the customer.
                        Quality is associated with products and services that meet or
                        exceed the need and expectations of the customer at a cost that
                        represents outstanding value.

318   CHAPTER TWENTY



Assignable Cause A specific or special cause that requires investigation. Data points
that are plotted outside of the upper and lower control limits of a control chart are
reviewed to determine the assignable cause.

Attribute Sampling a process in which the deliverable is assessed to determine if it
either conforms or does not conform to specific acceptance criteria.

Availability The probability that the product, when used under given conditions, will
perform satisfactorily when called upon.

Control Chart A graphic technique for identifying whether an operation or process is in
or out of control and tracking the performance of that operation or process against
calculated control and warning limits. The dispersion of data points on the chart is used to
determine whether the process is performing within prescribed limits and whether
variations taking place (plotted and documented) are random or systematic (from an
assignable or special cause).

Cost of Quality The total cost incurred to prevent errors, appraise and inspect products,
repair defects, and resolve nonconformance issues. Cost of quality includes: the cost of
conformance--prevention and inspection, and the cost of non-conformance - internal and
external failure

Grade A category assigned to products or services having the same functional use but
different technical characteristics. Example - a software application is considered high
quality (no defects) but low grade (limited features and functions).

ISO 9000 A series of international standards that provides quality management
guidance and identifies quality system elements. ISO 9001 is a voluntary international
standard for quality management systems. The requirements for ISO 9001:2000 and ISO
9001:2008 are designed to be generic in nature so that they can be applied across all
industries by both the public and private sectors.

Kaizen Continuous incremental improvement of an activity to eliminate waste. Japanese
process of continuous improvement using problem solving and analysis techniques. A
quality improvement process that involves all managers and employees.

Maintainability The ability of the product to be retained in or restored to a performance
level when prescribed maintenance is performed.

Operability The degree to which a product can be operated safely.

Pareto Diagram A chart used to graphically summarize and display the relative
importance of the differences between groups of data. A bar chart that displays frequency
of cause of failure from left to right--greatest frequency to least frequent.

Produce-ability The ability to produce the product with available technology and
workers and at an acceptable cost.

Quality An essential and distinguishing attribute of something or someone. A degree or
grade of excellence or worth. The totality of features and characteristics of a product or
service that bear on its ability to satisfy stated or implied needs.

Quality Policy The overall intentions and direction of an organization regarding quality
as formally expressed by top management. The general practical intention and direction of
a company toward quality.
                                                                    QUALITY MANAGEMENT         319



Reliability The probability of the product performing without failure under given
conditions and for a set period of time.

Rule of Seven The rule of seven states that seven data points are required to indicate a
trend or that seven data points are on one side of the mean indicating a run.

Salability The balance between quality and cost.

Sampling The selection of a subset of individual items from within a statistical
population to estimate characteristics of the whole population. Two advantages of
sampling are that the cost is lower and data collection is faster.

Social Acceptability The degree of conflict between the product or process and the
values of society.

TQM Total Quality Management. A policy that includes all levels of employees in an
organization and involves training, awareness, and overall acceptance of the quality
mission and principles of the organization.

Variable Sampling A process in which a product is measured on a continuous scale to
determine the level of conformity.

Activities, Questions, and Exercises

Refer to Chapter 20 of Project Management: A Systems Approach to Planning, Scheduling,
and Controlling (11th Edition) for supporting information. Review each of the following
questions or exercises and provide the answers in the space provided.
The following questions and exercises are associated with the knowledge areas of the
PMBOK(R) Guide: Project Quality Management.




                        Quality management is approached from many different
                        perspectives. What works well in one organization may not work
                        in another. It is important for an organization to establish a clear
                        quality policy that can be communicated and instilled as part of
                        the company culture.




 1. The Shewhart Chart, adapted by W. Edwards Deming as a basis for managing quality,
    is associated with which of the following processes:

   a) Initiate Plan, Execute, Control, Close
   b) Plan, Do, Check, Act
   c) Prevention, Inspection, Internal failure, External failure
   d) Execute, Analyze, Respond, Monitor

 2. Deming postulated that 85% of all quality problems required:

   a) Employee action
   b) Statistical analysis
320    CHAPTER TWENTY



      c) Management initiative and action
      d) The use of control charts

 5. Quality Control Charts

      Consider the data shown below which will be used to construct a quality control chart.

      Data Point(N)     X            (X - X )2
           1           2.00              0
           2           2.01            .0001
           3           2.02            .0004
           4           1.99            .0001
           5           1.99            .0001
           6           1.98            .0004
           7           1.99            .0001
           8           2.01            .0001
           9           2.01            .0001
         10            2.00              0
                      20.00          0.0014

      X = 20.00/10 data points = 2.00

       = ([X - X]2 /[N -1]) = 0.01
                                                                    QUALITY MANAGEMENT     321



Now let's apply this to a problem. Assume one of your customers wants this product and
has given you a specification where the upper specification limit is at 2.05 and the lower
specification limit is at 1.95. If you establish your process limits at X  3, then the upper
control limit is 2.03 and the lower control limit is 1.97. This is shown in the figure below:
322   CHAPTER TWENTY



In this figure, the process is said to be "in control" because all of the data points fall within
the upper and lower control limits. However, had the upper and lower specification limits
been set to 2.015 and 1.985 respectively, the process would be "out of control" because of
two of the points.

This example is for teaching purposes only. In most companies, 10 data points may not be
a sufficient quantity to analyze the data in a control chart format.

Now it's your turn. Shown below are three control charts which represent special or
assignable cause variability. For each of the control charts, select from the first group the
reason why the process is out of control. Then, from the second group, select the cause or
causes for the process to be out of control.

Group I:        1. A "Run"
                2. A point outside of the control limits
                3. "Hugging" the control limits

Group II:       1.   Operator made a mistake
                2.   Process may be out of alignment; shift in centerline
                3.   Faulty raw material
                4.   Operator pushed the wrong button
                5.   Worn-out tooling

   Quality Study Notes: Quality management is often about statistics and analysis. It is
important to become familiar with the terminology of statistical analysis.

* Population--the universe of environment that will be analyzed
* Variable sampling--a process in which products are evaluated on a continuous scale that
  allows for some deviation from the standard as long as it falls within set parameters
* Attribute sampling--a process that determines acceptance or rejection of a product.
  There is no flexibility and decisions are either pass/fail or conform/does not conform
* Producer's Risk--known as Alpha risk. The risk to a producer that a good lot will be
  rejected
* Consumer's Risk--known as Beta risk. The risk that a consumer may accept a bad lot
* Normal Distribution--associated with the bell-shaped curve, it represents a theoretical
  frequency distribution of measurements. The normal distribution curve, according to
  statistics, indicates that there is a probability of 68.26% that the results will fall within one
  standard deviation from the mean, 95.46% within two standard deviations and 99.73%
  within three standard deviations from the mean. The normal distribution curve provides
  a probability confidence factor.

Kerzner "Quick-tips" for the Project Management Institute PMP(R)
and CAPM(R) EXAM


The subjects in this chapter are most closely associated with the areas of the PMBOK(R)
Guide: Project Quality Management.

Project Quality Management includes three major processes as described by the PMBOK(R)
Guide--Fifth Edition

Plan Quality - Defining quality requirements and then documenting how the project will
achieve compliance

Perform Quality Assurance - Auditing quality requirements and results from quality control
measurements to ensure appropriate levels of quality are achieved and standards are in
use

Perform Quality Control -The process of monitoring and recording results of executing
quality activities to assess performance and recommend necessary changes.

Remember that the customer defines quality.

The project manager has ultimate responsibility for quality in the project environment.

Prevention over inspection is the main goal of a quality process.

Cost of Quality includes the Cost of Conformance and the Cost of Nonconformance.

        The cost of conformance includes prevention and appraisal

        The cost of nonconformance includes internal and external failure

Quality policies and procedures will vary greatly from one company to another. A general
awareness of quality principles and tools and techniques is important for the PMP(R) exam.

Remember the differences between Quality Assurance (process) and Quality Control
(action based on measurements).

Quality is a continuous process of improvement.

The Shewhart Chart, adapted by Deming, displays the process of Plan, Do, Check, Act.

Crosby believes that zero defects can be achieved and that the cost of quality is associated
with non-conformance

Juran was focused on Fitness for use, conformance to specifications, safety, and the legal
aspects of quality - warranties, liabilities
                                                                  QUALITY MANAGEMENT     329



Taguchi developed the Design of Experiments process. He believed that quality should be
designed in, not inspected in. As results move further from target, it becomes more costly
to return to the target.

Control charts will assist in the identification of assignable causes. The main components
of a control chart are the mean or process average, the upper control limit (UCL and lower
control limit (LCL). Control charts will identify trends, runs, processes in control, and
processes out off control.

Remember the various Quality Control tools--Control charts, Pareto diagrams, check
sheets, cause-and-effect diagrams, scatter diagrams, attribute sampling, variable sampling.

 Additional tips and practice items for the PMP(R) exam are included in each chapter and in
 the section of the workbook entitled PMP(R) Exam and PMBOK Guide(R) Review.

              MODERN DEVELOPMENTS IN
               PROJECT MANAGEMENT

    Project management has been in existence for thousands of years. From the time the
    pyramids were constructed, probably even well before then, there were projects and project
    managers. Over the centuries project management has changed and improved as new tools
    and techniques were developed to gain efficiencies in the use of resources and the
    management of time. In the past few decades, there has been an increased interest in project
    management not only at the single project level but also at the program and portfolio level.
    Organizations are now interested in how to further financial gains, increase productivity, and
    reduce costs through organizational or enterprise wide project management.
    In the early to mid-1990s, the Project Management Office (PMO) became a focus of
    attention as organizations saw value in standardizing their project management
    processes. The capability maturity model (CMM) also became an item of interest to
    many corporate executives. Continuous improvement through Six Sigma, the
    development of competency models, and development of methods for managing
    multiple projects soon followed.
    Today, there is continued interest in each of these areas including a new edition introduced
    by the Project Management Institute (PMI(R)) in 2003 and updated in 2008. It is known as--
    OPM3(R), or Organizational Project Management Maturity Model. OPM3(R) and introduces a
    standard for measuring project management maturity in an organization through assessing
    the use of generally accepted best practices in project management. Other methodologies
    and techniques are also being used by many companies. These techniques include Agile
    Project Management, Lean Management, and Value Driven Project Management

The following are the major areas of interest that have surfaced as project management
continues to develop:
*   The Project Management Maturity Model (PMMM)
*   Developing effective procedural documentation (standards and guidelines)
*   Project Management Methodologies (at the project, program, and portfolio levels)
*   Continuous Improvement (CMM, CMMi and Six Sigma)
*   Capacity Planning
*   Competency Models (organizational and project management)
*   Management of Multiple Projects



                                                                                                333

The Project Management Maturity Model (PMMM)

The goal of PMMM is to assist an organization in achieving excellence in project
management through a five-step process.

Level 1--Establish a common language. The first step is to ensure a basic knowledge of
project management and an understanding of the accompanying terminology and
language of project management.

Level 2--Common Processes. Processes that are used repeatedly on projects that are
successfully completed are defined and developed and then applied to other projects to
increase the probability of success. These processes are recognized as also contributing to
or supporting other processes within an organization.

Level 3--Singular Methodology. Recognition of the synergistic value of combining
organizational processes into a singular methodology that improves the ability to control
project outcomes and promote consistency within an organization.

Level 4--Benchmarking. Recognizing that process improvement is necessary to maintain a
competitive advantage. Comparison of project results to organizational goals and industry
best practices is necessary and must be performed on a regular basis.

Level 5--Continuous Improvement. The evaluation of information obtained through
benchmarking and the actions taken to improve a process.

Although depicted in the model as a series of steps, these levels and their associated
activities may overlap depending upon the capabilities of the organization.

The Project Management Maturity Model can be expected to impact the culture of an
organization as processes are developed and longstanding procedures and positions of
authority are affected, and in many cases, change considerably as more formal project
management processes are introduced.

Developing Procedural Documentation

Procedural documentation will increase efficiencies, establish more consistency in
planning projects, and assist an organization in achieving project management maturity.

Benefits of procedural documentation:

* Establishment of guidelines and greater uniformity
* Less but more useful documentation
* More effective and clear communication
                                          MODERN DEVELOPMENTS IN PROJECT MANAGEMENT      335



*   Standardized reports, forms, and data
*   Greater unity within and across project teams
*   Basis for analysis
*   Minimize paperwork
*   Reduction in conflict over procedures

Project Management Methodologies (at the project, program, and portfolio levels)
Establishing methodologies for managing projects, programs, and portfolios will increase
the likelihood of success at each of the levels. This greatly depends upon the acceptance of
these methodologies by the project managers and project teams assigned to projects and
programs. Care should be taken to introduce methodologies with a focus on the impact to
organizational culture. It may take significant time for methodologies to take hold, and if
not properly introduced, they could meet with great resistance from project personnel.
Project Management Offices can be used to facilitate the introduction of methodologies
and changes to organizational culture.

Continuous Improvement (CMM and Six Sigma)
Continuous improvement can be associated with the Deming/Shewhart Model--PDCA or
Plan, Do, Check, Act. or Capability Maturity Model (CMM), is very similar to the PMMM
model and encourages an organization to progress through levels to achieve maturity. Six
Sigma is considered a strategic approach to continuous improvement through tighter and
tighter quality controls designed to reduce or possibly eliminate product defects. Six
Sigma focuses on the acronym DMAIC - Define Measure Analyze, Improve, Control.
Capacity Planning
The improvements gained through effective project management are measured through
increased productivity, the need for fewer resources, and completing more work in less
time. Basically, through project management, an organization can increase its "capacity"
to perform work. The gains obtained through efficient processes and methodologies
impacts an organization's business forecasts by requiring adjustments in items such as
anticipated growth, future staffing, and new product development.
Competency Models
Job descriptions were used to provide information about what an employee was expected
to do. They did not address the level of competency and mainly focused on the
expectations of management. In today's project environment, project managers are
expected to assume many roles including leader, planner, and manager. Competency
models will be used to determine the skill levels and ability of project managers which, in
turn, will be used to identify where additional skills training and development may be
needed. Competency models will address and score abilities in such areas as project
management (planning, scope definition, WBS development), interpersonal skills (conflict
management, motivation, communication), business acumen (organizational processes,
financial management), and leadership.

Management of Multiple Projects
Today's project environment often requires a project manager to manage several projects
concurrently. These projects may range from very small projects with short durations to
more complex projects with longer durations. The span of control (number of projects
assigned) to a project manager is usually dependent on previous experience, track record,
and overall competency. Managing multiple projects presents new challenges to the
project manager and a change from a single project mentality.
Areas where change will be required:
336   CHAPTER TWENTY-ONE



* Project selection--ensuring the right projects have been assigned
* Prioritization of projects--for effective resource management
* Management of scope changes--connections between projects
* Capacity planning
* Program and/or portfolio methods and procedures--new guidelines that allow a greater
  degree of flexibility in decision making
* Organizational structures--changing the existing structure to increase the effectiveness
  of the project management methodology. More influence and authority granted to the
  project manager

End of Phase Review Meetings (Project Evaluations and Reviews)
Establish processes for reviewing projects throughout the life cycle, not just at the end of
the project. This is essential to ensure that the organization continues to support projects
that will yield the greatest benefits to the organization. Establishing criteria for success by
phase will increase the probability of successful completion of the project and assist an
organization in managing its resources more effectively.
Critical Chain or Theory of Constraints
This is a method of planning and managing projects that puts more emphasis on the
resources required to execute project tasks. It was developed by Eliyahu M. Goldratt. This
method contrasts the more traditional Critical Path methods, which emphasizes task order
and rigid scheduling. A Critical Chain project network will tend to keep the resources load
leveled but will require them to be flexible in their start times and to quickly switch
between tasks and task chains to keep the whole project on schedule. Project buffers and
activities buffers are used to manage project work throughput. There is also emphasis on
correcting and strengthening any weak links (resource constraints) that may be identified.
Critical Chain is often referred to as managing the "weakest link" where constraints are
identified and elevated to reduce the pressure or strengthen the link. Project buffers and
task buffers are utilized in the critical chain approach. Another characteristic of critical
chain is the focus on eliminating the "student syndrome" or Parkinson's Law which states
that work will expand to meet the time given.
Organizational Project Management Maturity Model - Organizational Project Management
   Maturity Model -- OPM3(R)
A standard developed by the Project Management Institute for reviewing, managing and
enhancing organization project management through best-practices. OPM3(R) provides a
way for organizations to understand their project management processes and measure
their capabilities in preparation for improvement. OPM3 includes three major elements:
* Knowledge - project management best practices in use across many industries
* Assessment - Evaluation of current project management capabilities to identify areas in
    need of improvement.
* Improvement - Develop a plan based on the results of the assessment to achieve
    improvement goals.

Rational Unified Process (RUP)

A prescriptive, well-defined system development process often used to develop systems
based on object and/or component-based technologies. It is based on planning and
engineering principles such as taking an iterative, requirements-driven, architecture
specific approach to software development. It focuses on relatively short-term iterations
with well-defined goals and go/no-go decision points at the end of each phase, to provide
greater visibility into the development process.
                                          MODERN DEVELOPMENTS IN PROJECT MANAGEMENT        337



Agile Project Management               A highly iterative and incremental process involving
developers and project stakeholders actively working together to produce a series of short
gains where needs and functionality are identified and prioritized. It is a rapid planning
process that involves several iterations, reviews and lessons learned and provides an
opportunity for immediate feedback from stakeholders.

Kaizen         Japanese for improvement or change for the better. It is a process for
continuous improvement; The approach seeks to achieve small, incremental changes in
processes in order to improve efficiency and quality.

Kanban          A system that emphasizes a just in time approach to manage inventory and
focuses on customer actual needs rather than on management forecasts, The kanban
approach was popularized by Toyota by standardizing the flow of parts on the assembly
lines. The kanban process starts with the customer order and follows the order through
production. Kanban follows a process that ensures that items will only be manufactured or
ordered when they are actually needed.

Value Driven Project Management                 To achieve project success, greater emphasis
must be placed on factors well beyond the familiar Triple Constraint. Value may defined
differently by the stakeholder involved in a project. Values are developed from exposure to
business environments, social environments, and family environments. Types of values
include Political, Social, Economic, Aesthetic, Religious, and Theoretical. Project value is
determined not only at the completion of the project in terms of performance against plans
but also in the residual value gained over many years.

In the future, project value may become the only constraint or at least the most important
constraint. The definition of a project will become "a collection of sustainable value
scheduled for realization. Project success will be measured on whether the sustainable value
was created. One of the criteria for evaluating potential projects as part of the portfolio of
projects will be the value that can be added and how the creation of value supports the
company's business objectives." After all, why work on a project that has no value?

Answers to Questions and Exercises

1. The five levels of the Project Management Maturity Model Are: Establish a common
   language, define common processes, and create a singular methodology, benchmark,
   continuous improvement.

2. How does Agile Project Management differ from what is known as "traditional" project
   management? Traditional project management emphasizes a disciplined approach to
   planning in which several phases exist, many controls are in place, and progress is
   measured in terms of the entire project. Agile is an accelerated and iterative approach
   using short incremental steps that are analyzed for lessons learned.
                                        MODERN DEVELOPMENTS IN PROJECT MANAGEMENT        339



3. What does the acronym DMAIC refer to? Define Measure Analyze, Improve, Control - It
   is associated with The SIX SIGMA approach to improving quality and reducing the
   number of defects.

4. What is the major difference between the CPM (Critical Path Method) and Critical Chain
   Method?

   CPM focuses on sequence of activities and activity duration to produce a critical path -
   the longest path through a project network. Critical chain method focuses on resource
   constraints and the use of project and activities buffers to relieve constraints.

5. Why is it important to identify and document best practices? Why is continuous
   improvement a major factor in achieving project management maturity? Documenting
   best practices will improve overall project and organizational performance by making
   useful information available to multiple project teams that may reduce cost, accelerate
   project completion time frame, improve quality and reduce risk. Continuous
   improvement is the highest level of the project management maturity model and
   indicates that the organization has achieved a success based culture through a practice
   of analyzing performance to generate a steadily position of superiority over
   competitors.

6. Why does an organization experience high levels of risk and difficulty when attempting
   to achieve level three of the project management maturity model? The changes
   involved in establishing a methodology may have an effect on corporate culture, there
   may be resistance to changes in process, and an unwillingness to accept changes in
   authority and the decision making process.

7. What is the difference between a job description and a competency model? Job
   descriptions emphasize deliverables and specific expectation. Competency models
   emphasize skills required to achieve deliverables.

              SITUATIONAL EXERCISES

Managing actual projects is generally more difficult and unpredictable than what is
described in the many books, articles, and seminars about project management that are
available. Following processes that have been carefully explained in books is helpful in
getting the project started and providing a guide to keep the project on track, but the real
challenge is to use the information provided in the reference literature and apply the
knowledge to the project. Project management is about the application of tools and
techniques to a project to achieve success, and the project manager must become
familiar with these tools and be able to determine which ones can and should be used
during the project life cycle and which ones do not apply to the project. Good judgment
is a key factor in managing projects, and an effective method for fine-tuning and
enhancing your judgment is through situational analysis.

The exercises in this chapter will assist you in further developing your project
management skills and will also help you if you are planning to apply for the PMP(R)
credential. The PMP(R) exam tests the applicant on the principles of project management
through situational-type questions. These questions place you, the student or applicant,
in a project situation, not unlike something you may have experienced in an actual
project, and you are expected to select the correct answer or solution to the problem
that has been described. Situational exercises allow you to analyze a problem; consider
the possible alternatives that may exist; factor in the risks, both negative and positive;
reason through the problem; and determine the best solution. It is important to
remember that there may be many alternatives, but there is generally one that would be
considered the best choice when all factors have been considered.

THE STRUGGLE WITH IMPLEMENTATION

A small division (650 employees) of one of the big three automakers recognized the
necessity for becoming more project-driven. As a result, a committee was formed to
recommend the methodology and timetable to redefine the culture of the company.

The division had tried to use project management previously and found few successes.
Cultural obstacles had to be overcome. The committee identified three major issues that
had to be considered:

A. The only people allowed to function as project managers were the line managers, who
   were instructed to get the projects completed while managing their own lines.

B. Line employees were reluctant to use software for project tracking for fear that the
   software would identify the "truth" in their estimates.

C. Executive management was always too busy to meet with consultants who were
   brought in to discuss the implementation of change.

An organizational audit was sponsored by the committee. The audit was designed to
identify problems that exist currently within the project teams. The results are shown in
Exhibit 1.

EXHIBIT 1

 1. Continuous process changes due to new technology

 2. Not enough time allocated for effort

 3. Too much outside interference (meetings, delays, etc.)

 4. Schedules laid out based on assumptions that eventually change during execution of
    the project

 5. Imbalance of workforce

 6. Differing objectives among groups

 7. Using a process that allows for no flexibility to "freelance"

 8. Inability to openly discuss issues without some people taking technical criticism as
    personal criticism

 9. Lack of quality planning, scheduling, and progress tracking

10. No resource tracking

11. Inheriting someone else's project and finding little or no supporting documentation

12. Dealing with contract or agency management

13. Changing or expanding project expectations
                                                                     SITUATIONAL EXERCISES   343



14. Constantly changing deadlines

15. Last minute requirement changes

16. People on projects having hidden agendas

17. Scope of the project is unclear right from the beginning

18. Dependence on resources without having control over them

19. Finger-pointing: "It's not my problem"



1. How mature in project management is the organization?




2. Is there decentralization and delegation of authority? Explain.




3. Can the problems in Exhibit 1 be classified into groups? If so, what are the groups?
344   CHAPTER TWENTY-TWO



4. Is there "visible" executive support for project management?




5. What recommendations would you make to the steering committee? To senior
   management?




6. How long do you think it will take for changeover to occur?




7. How successful will the changeover be? Explain your answer.
                                                                  SITUATIONAL EXERCISES    345




THE BAD APPLE

John Doyle is the project manager for the Prism Project, a high-priority project that has
also been assigned a project sponsor, from the executive levels. Two of Mr. Doyle's
employees have been performing at levels substantially below expectation. These two
employees report directly to a line manager, but are assigned full-time to the project. At a
meeting with his director and immediate supervisor, Carol Brody, John expresses his
frustration.

Ms. Brody: "Every project, sooner or later, will find team members that are bad apples. It
   was my understanding that good project managers should plan for this possibility."

Doyle: "Our manual on project guidelines does not discuss this at all, and I'm not sure that
   we can put all possible situations into our guide even if we want to."

Ms. Brody: "Whether we handle these situations formally (i.e., through guidelines) or
   informally is irrelevant to me. My concern is that we have some methodology to cover
   this. What did you attempt the last time this happened?"

Doyle: "Once I had a poor employee removed from the project. His close contemporaries
   working on the project lost enthusiasm for the project for fear that they would be next
   to be asked to leave. The project really suffered from poor morale. Another time I tried
   to give an employee an on-the-spot written performance review, and she laughed at
   me, telling me that I did not have the authority to do this. On a third occasion, I
   reassigned the employee to a less critical activity and this was partially successful.
   Unfortunately, I could not find a qualified replacement that late in the project to
   complete the vacated task."

Ms. Brody: "Let's make sure you understand that this problem is yours and should be
   resolved at the working levels. I really think there may be other options for you to
   consider at this time."

QUESTIONS

1. What other options are available?
346   CHAPTER TWENTY-TWO



2. Can a project manager remove employees from a project if the employees report
   administratively to a line manager?




3. Should the project sponsor be involved in this problem? If so, what help would you
   expect from the project sponsor?
                                                                  SITUATIONAL EXERCISES     347




THE COMMUNICATION PROBLEM

In each of the situations below, something appears to have gone wrong with the
communication process. Identify where in the communication process the breakdown
occurred (i.e., the message, encoding, decoding, feedback, etc.).

1. During a project team meeting, you inform your laboratory technician that the customer
   wants their product tested at 80, 90, and 100F rather than at the normal testing
   temperatures of 75, 85, and 95F. The tests are scheduled to begin two months from
   now. After testing is completed, you read the report prepared by the lab personnel and
   find that testing was performed at 75, 85, and 95F.

2. Mary is the project engineer assigned to your project team. During a team meeting,
   Mary casually informs you that she will have her yearly performance review with her
   line manager next month, at which time she intends to request a promotion from
   "engineer" to "senior engineer." You wish her luck and take no further action.

  In the following month, you find that Mary's request for promotion was denied. The
  grapevine has it that you sabotaged her chance for promotion when, in fact, you never
  even talked to her line manager.

3. You are managing a project team of twenty people. Brenda is a procurement specialist
   who has never worked for you before. During a one-on-one meeting, you inform Brenda
   that you will need 2,000 pounds of an expensive raw material and you instruct her to
   find out as quickly as possible the lowest possible cost.

  Two weeks later, you receive a phone call from the inventory control group that your
  2,000 pounds have arrived and have been placed into inventory stores. This creates a
  serious problem because the project's budget did not plan for early procurement or
  even 100 percent procurement at one time. You find out that Brenda signed the
  purchase requisition form for you.

4. The vice president for information systems informs you that he would like to be
   informed as to the status of your project and that he wants to meet with you a week
   from Tuesday. As you walk into his office, he says, "Where's the status report I asked
   you for?"

5. The Drafting Department has just assigned a draftsman to your project. You meet with
   the new team member, a person whom you have never met previously. You inform him
   of the way you want the drawing and ask him if he understood what you said. He
   responds, "Yes!"

  Two weeks later you receive the drawing and find out that it is not to your specifications.
  You question the draftsman, and he responds, "This is the standard way we always
  prepare these drawings."

6. You instruct one of your team members to prepare a technical report for next month's
   meeting with the customer. To prevent any communication gap from occurring, you
   provide the team member with an exact list of the technical details to go into the report.
   The week before the meeting, your team member wants you to review the report prior
   to reproduction. What you thought would be a thirty-five page report is now two
   hundred pages with multicolored artwork.
348   CHAPTER TWENTY-TWO



MEETINGS, MEETINGS, AND MEETINGS

In February 1994, Carver Company purchased a licensing agreement to place a "Meeting
Scheduler" software package on the computers of about 400 employees. The organization
became meeting-happy overnight. Any employee could look at the calendar of all other
employees and schedule a meeting if the time slot were vacant. Some people would show
up at work and discover that they were scheduled for six hours of meetings in one day
without having agreed to attend. Others were scheduled for meetings where they had no
idea what the meeting was about.

Carver's senior management realized quickly that the system was being abused. However,
they were reluctant to remove that software because of its inherent value if used correctly.
Another alternative had to be developed.

Carver's management instructed the Human Resources Group to prepare a meeting
appraisal form. Every employee in every meeting would have to fill out this form. The
completed forms would then be returned to the Human Resources Group for analysis. The
results would be summarized in a memo, with copies to the individual requesting the
meeting as well as to his/her superior. Copies would also be sent to all attendees.

The Human Resources Group prepared a list of topics to be included in the form. The form
had to be a single sheet of paper, preferably on one side. The following information was
considered to be critical:

A. Could the topics of this meeting have been covered without this meeting (i.e., memo,
   phone call, phone mail, one-on-one, etc.)?

B. Was an agenda sent out in advance listing the purpose of the meeting and what subjects
   would be covered and during which time periods?

C. Did the meeting start and finish on time?

D. Were the right people in attendance? Did they all show up?

E. Was the agenda adhered to?

F. Were there summary agreements made and possible action items?

G. Were the "meeting robbers" present that prevented the meeting from being conducted
   properly (i.e., the show-off, the abuser, the rambler, the assignment misser, the whisperers,
   the supersalesman, the wallflower, the later arriver, the wanna-be leader, etc.)?

H. How was the meeting rated overall (i.e., productive, partially productive, waste of time,
   etc.)?

QUESTIONS

1. Is the above list complete, or should there be additional topics included?
                                                               SITUATIONAL EXERCISES   349



2. Using either one or two sheets of paper, design the meeting evaluation form. Make sure
   that you include optional "degrees" of answers, such as very well done, well done,
   acceptable, etc.




3. Does this form apply also to project team meetings? Explain your answer.
350   CHAPTER TWENTY-TWO




THE EMPOWERMENT PROBLEM

In seminars to TQM, employees were told that empowerment must be provided to the
quality teams. The process of empowerment worked reasonably well on the TQM teams,
but struggled on project teams. The question, of course, was why. Some of the project
teams were large enough to justify their own staff on a full-time basis. Other projects were
so small that employees found themselves working on several projects at the same time.

QUESTIONS

1. Should the project team be empowered to set goals or should goals be set elsewhere?




2. Should a project team be empowered to make decisions at the end-of-phase reviews
   (i.e., open gates to the next phase)?




3. How does a project manager know whether his/her team is empowered to make
   decisions?




4. How does a project manager know whether employees are empowered to make
   decisions for their line managers?
                                                              SITUATIONAL EXERCISES    351



5. How does a team resolve a problem if the team members are not empowered to make
   decisions?




6. Who empowers project team members?




7. Can empowerment work if project team members are part-time on several projects at
   once?
352     CHAPTER TWENTY-TWO




THE POTENTIAL PROBLEM AUDIT

There exist both subtle and not-so-subtle problems on projects that eventually lead to
schedule slippages and cost overruns. The problem areas are both quantitative and
nonquantitative. Several of these problems can occur on any given project. Exhibit 1
provides you with a list of 30 situations that lead to schedule slippages and cost overruns.

You and your team should perform the following:

 1. Select a company that is known to use project management. (You may need the
    instructor's help.) The more projects the company has, the more meaningful the results.

 2. Interview the project managers and compile a list of which problems have occurred.

 3. Compare the list from each project and total up the problems.

 4. Identify any trends and if the company is facing persistently common problems.

 5. REVIEW QUESTIONS WITH COMPANY: This is important. The company may wish to
    alter the list of questions. Also, the company may be reluctant to have questions being
    asked about sensitive issues such a salary, promotions, career paths, etc.

 6. ESTABLISH INTERVIEW SCHEDULE: The company will provide you with a contact
    person, usually from the personnel department. However, prior to contacting this
    person, the team should develop an interview availability schedule. There must be two
    students per interview. The class should plan for 20-30 interviews. The more
    interviews, the better the results. It is easier for the company to find people to be
    interviewed than for students who work during the day to reschedule their time.

      Try to request interviews at three levels of the organization: executive level, lower and
      middle management, and professionals. You may find that each level has a different
      opinion of the state-of-the-art of project management.

 7. CONDUCTING THE INTERVIEWS: There should be two students present at each
    interview so that there will be agreement on what the interviewee actually said. With
    more than two students, the interviewee may feel threatened. It is important for the
    two students to review their notes immediately after the interview. Tape recording
    interviews is a good idea as long as the interviewee isn't threatened by it.

      Most interviews should be scheduled for 15-20 minutes. However, in reality, most
      interviewees may talk for an hour or more and provide the students with valuable
      information. The questions must be prioritized in case the students run out of time
      during the interview. A 20-minute interview will handle 5-20 questions.

      The interviewee must agree to have his/her name assigned to the comments. Any
      interviewees who request copies of the report should go through the company contact
      person.
                                                                    SITUATIONAL EXERCISES       353



 8. COLLATE THE DATA: The complete interview process may take three to four weeks. By
    that time, the students may be far enough along in the course to deduce meaningful
    conclusions on their own.

 9. PRESENTATION TO INSTRUCTOR: There are two reasons why presentation to the
    instructor is critical. The instructor must make sure, first, that the proper conclusions
    are identified, and, second, that the information in the report is valid.

   The second item requires further comment. In one class, the instructor never reviewed
   the information in the report until being "called on the carpet" by a furious company
   officer. The students wrote in the report that one of the organization's senior project
   managers commented that the company has good "control" over the union workers.
   The union had seen the report and was very unhappy about this comment. The senior
   project manager swore that he had never made that comment, but both student
   interviewers stated otherwise. This problem should have been resolved prior to
   submittal of the report to the company.

10. SUBMITTAL/PRESENTATION TO COMPANY: Most of the time, a company is happy
    simply to receive a report because it is viewed as free consulting. However, there are
    situations where the company may want a formal presentation. The instructor must
    judge how much involvement he/she should have in the presentation. We must
    remember that this project is a reflection on the school as well as the students and the
    instructor.
354   CHAPTER TWENTY-TWO




THE STATEMENT OF WORK

Misinterpretation of the statement of work (SOW) can lead to expensive scope changes.
Project managers with good communication skills can lower the barrier and perception
screens that lead to SOW misinterpretation. Project managers who prepare statements of
work are often just as guilty as those who must interpret a client's SOW in using improper
language or making improper assumptions.

To illustrate the complexity of SOW preparation and interpretation, consider a customer
that wishes to train approximately 200 employees in the principles of effective project
management. This customer has prepared a statement of work, which is shown in Exhibit
1. Your company has been invited to bid competitively on this training program. The
program is a firm fixed-price effort. All bids must be received by the customer no later than
30 days from today.

The SOW for this request for proposal appears in Exhibit 1. A "full" SOW would also
include contractual terms and conditions, financial payment plans, and penalties. Analyze
the "technical" SOW as it appears in Exhibit 1.

QUESTIONS

1. Are there any portions of the statement of work that can be misinterpreted or are simply
   vague? If so, what are they?




2. Is there any information missing from the statement of work that would be needed
   before effective pricing can be performed? If so, what information?




3. Can the government prevent this situation from recurring? If so, how?
                                                               SITUATIONAL EXERCISES   355



4. Could part of the RFP review process be to evaluate bidders on previous performance on
   government contracts? Is this legal?

THE AUTOMOBILE PROBLEM

You have recently been promoted to assistant project manager assigned to the proposal
team that has been assembled to bid on an upcoming project. To get your feet wet, the
project manager has given you the responsibility of determining the life-cycle cost of
owning an automobile.

If your company wins the contract, you and your team will be required to make numerous
trips to the client's site, which is located in a remote area. You estimate that the project,
which is five years in duration, will require the purchase of an automobile. The customer
has agreed to allow the bids to include this. Rough estimates indicated that you will travel
18,000 miles each year.

You must determine the total life-cycle costs of purchasing an automobile. After extensive
research, you come up with the following data.

A. Purchase price is $19,000 with a salvage value of $2,500 at the end of the fifth year.

B. The automobile can be depreciated over three years using the straight line depreciation
   schedule.

C. Sales tax is 8 percent.

D. Insurance/year will be $870.

E. License/year will be $65.

F. Parking, garaging, and tolls will be $2,500 per year.

G. Gasoline is $1.40 per gallon, and the car is estimated to get 26 miles per gallon.

H. Major tuneups will cost $375 every 12,000 miles.

I. Minor tuneups will cost $140 very 6,000 miles.

J. Tires will cost $75 each, and all four tires must be replaced every 36,000 miles.

K. Alignment will be part of major tuneups.

L. Suspension system and brakes will be required every 24,000 miles at a cost of $220.

M. Mufflers will cost $130 (including installation) every 36,000 miles.

N. The electrical system (horn, washer, wipers, wiring, lighting, battery alternator) will
   require $650 every 44,000 miles.

QUESTIONS

1. Calculate the total cost of owning the automobile for each quarter of each year
   assuming that the car is sold at the end of the fifth year when the contract expires.

2. What assumptions must be made?




3. On a sheet of graph paper, plot the cost/mile as a function of time.

4. What conclusions can be made?




5. If a loan were taken out to pay for the car, can the monthly interest expenses simply be
   included in the life-cycle costing? Explain you answer.




6. Suppose you were asked to evaluate the option of leasing a car for five years rather than
   an outright purchase. What additional factors must be considered.
                                                                   SITUATIONAL EXERCISES   359




LIFE-CYCLE COSTING

Warren Corporation has just completed a seven-year subcontracted project for a
government agency. The project required the development of a high-technology piece of
equipment during the first three years and operational support of the equipment in the
field for the remaining four years. The customer was delighted that Warren Corporation
was able to keep the operation and support cost at 39.9% of the total life-cycle cost rather
than the originally estimated 60%, thus saving the government almost $19 million.
Table 1 shows the final Life-Cycle Cost Breakdown that was prepared by Warren Corporation
at the closeout of the project. The project required the production of 25 units, all of which
worked well. The problem facing Warren Corporation was the follow-on contract, which
could conceivably reach a level of 6,000 units produced over the next 10 years.

Warren was able to use their existing production facilities for the first 25 units. The
maximum production level that could be sustained in the existing plant would be 100 units
per year. Warren would have to build a new manufacturing plant to support the production
of 600 units per year.
The vice president for manufacturing has given you the task of preparing a detailed list of
cost categories that must be looked at to assess the feasibility of building and operating a
manufacturing plant for a 10-year lifetime. (Extension beyond 10 years is possible.)
Prepare a detailed work-breakdown structure of cost categories (as shown in Table 1) for
the total life-cycle costing of the new plant. It is not necessary to use the same major
headings as shown in Table 1.

On the next page are five causes of instability in X and five figures. Match the five figures
(1-5) with the five causes (A-E). Each figure is to be used only once.

CAUSE A: This indicates a gradual drift, probably caused by a machine part becoming
         worn down or possibly a gradual slippage in a machine setting.
            FIGURE:     _____________
CAUSE B: This could indicate different machine operators who perform differently. This
         could also indicate sticky machine settings.
            FIGURE:     _____________
CAUSE C: This indicates a cyclical process, perhaps from using different operators or
         different settings. Also, we should check the day of week or other cyclical
         variables.
            FIGURE:     _____________
CAUSE D: This could be a "freak" point in the process, perhaps due to faulty material or
         operator error.
            FIGURE:     _____________
CAUSE E: This could indicate a change in operators, machine settings, new materials, or
         an employee unfamiliar with the process specifications.

CAUSE D: This could be different employees with different skill levels and different
         training.
            FIGURE:      _____________

              PROJECT MANAGEMENT
               CROSSWORD PUZZLES

Learning doesn't always have to be accomplished through tests and hours of study.
Occasionally, some enjoyment should be added to the learning process to help you
remember key points and to stay focused on your learning objectives. This chapter is
intended to help you continue your project management learning experience through
crossword puzzles that have been designed to not only enhance your knowledge of
project management but also to provide you with an enjoyable yet somewhat
challenging approach to the learning process. The crossword puzzles are a change of
pace from the routine study process and will help you remember key terms and phrases
through reasoning and determining relationships between topics and terms. These
puzzles provide you with an opportunity to think in broader terms and across knowledge
areas to better understand how all project management processes are integrated within
a system. Use them for study on your own or in small study groups. You will find that as
you complete each puzzle your knowledge will grow, you will find yourself reviewing
your notes and the chapters within this workbook which will further enhance your total
learning experience, and you will have a much greater understanding of how the many
project management terms, principles, tools, and techniques are interrelated.

     PMP(R) AND CAPM(R) EXAM REVIEW
 The Project Management Professional or PMP(R) exam is based on the processes within
 the domains of project management known as: Initiating, Planning, Executing,
 Monitoring & Controlling, and Closing. The domain known a Professional and Social
 Responsibility is now embedded in the other 5 domains. Professional responsibility is
 something that all project managers should be aware of and accept. Regardless of type
 of project and industry, as a project is managed through its life cycle the integrity of the
 project manager is of critical importance The specific information about ethics and
 professional responsibility can be found in the PMI(R) Code of Ethics and Professional
 Responsibility. The document is available at www.pmi.org.

 The PMP(R) exam is a four-hour, 200 multiple-choice question, computer-based exam
 that is intended to test a candidate's e ability e to apply project management knowledge
 in many different situations and scenarios. Candidates for the exam must apply to the
 Project Management Institute(R) and complete a detailed and rigorous application
 process. For information about the exam and how to apply as a candidate visit the PMI(R)
 website at www.pmi.org.
 The CAPM(R) Exam, Certified Associate in Project Management is a credential designed
 for practicing project managers who have not accumulated the required hours of
 experience to qualify for the PMP(R) exam.


Eligibility for the Exam
The Project Management Institute has established very specific qualifying criteria for the exam.

A four-year degree (bachelor's or the global equivalent) and at least three years of project
management experience. Of those three years of project management experience, 4,500
hours should have been spent leading and directing projects. 35 hours of project
management education are also required.

In the absence of a four-year degree, a secondary diploma (high school or the global equivalent)
is required, along with at least five years of project management experience. Of those five years
of project management experience, 7,500 hours should have been spent leading and directing
projects. Thirty five hours of project management education are also required.

Contact hours refer to the total amount of time an applicant has spent in formal instruction.
Contact hours are earned by attending project management-relevant training, either in a


                                                                                              405
406   CHAPTER TWENTY-FOUR


classroom or online. While project management experience hours must be accrued within
the last eight years, any project management-related training an applicant took in the past
can count towards the PMI's requirement for contact hours. There is no expiration date on
any project management training an applicant has undertaken.
A complete PMP(R) Credential Handbook is available from PMI(R) at www.pmi.org
The PMP(R) exam is a comprehensive exam that challenges the knowledge of the candidate
through situational- and scenario-based questions that are designed to simulate actual
project management experiences. The exam is based in part on the PMBOK(R) Guide,
(generally the current edition), but also includes questions that go well beyond the project
management framework and processes described in the PMBOK(R) Guide. Knowledge of
leadership techniques, organizational structure, managerial theory and practice, team
motivation, conflict resolution, negotiating, problem solving, scheduling techniques
including CPM, forward and backward pass,, Critical Chain, contract types and sharing
ratios, and the application of earned value analysis will be tested along with the processes
explained in the PMBOK(R) Guide.
The Certified Associate in Project Management (CAPM(R)) certification examination is a
knowledge-based exam that uses A Guide to the Project Management Body of Knowledge
(PMBOK(R) Guide) current edition, as the source of questions. The CAPM(R) exam is a three-
hour, 150 multiple-choice question examination. The CAPM(R) exam focuses on the
fundamental knowledge of project management, and many of the questions are derived
from the PMBOK(R) Guide. PMI(R) offers a basic knowledge assessment on line which will
assist in determining your level of knowledge of project management and provide you with
a recommendation for further study and preparation.


Eligibility for the CAPM(R) Exam

Option 1--High school diploma or equivalent and 1,500 hours of work on a project team
Option 2--High school diploma and 23 contact hours of project management education

Applicants must complete the CAPM(R) Credential Application online or via a downloadable
form available from the PMI(R) website.


Preparing for the Exams

The PMP(R) exam has been developed for experienced project managers and project team
members who are in decision-making and leadership positions and those who influence
project decisions. The CAPM(R) exam has been developed for project managers who plan to
continue their careers as project managers and have not met the criteria for education,
experience, and credentials to apply for the PMP(R) exam. The CAPM(R) is an excellent step
toward the PMP certification.

Although the PMP(R) and CAPM(R) exams are designed for different levels of qualification and
experience, the following information will assist in the study and preparation for each exam.


Working the Workbook

This section of the workbook is intended to provide a summary review of the key points of
project management, the processes within the PMBOK(R) Guide 5th edition, and highlight the
elements of each knowledge area and process group that may be included in the exam.
                                                          PMP(R) AND CAPM(R) EXAM REVIEW   407


     Study Note: It is important to obtain a copy of the PMBOK(R) Guide and read it
thoroughly. Many people will tell you that you should read it at least three times to absorb
the information provided. The PMBOK(R) Guide contains an enormous amount of
information about project management and is referred to as the standard for developing a
project management methodology. The key to successful study is to understand how each
knowledge area is interrelated and that all knowledge areas of the PMBOK(R) Guide are
integrated in the project planning process and the management of a project. The 5 major
process groups - Initiating, Planning, Executing, Monitoring & Controlling, and Closing,
link the knowledge areas by showing the relationships of the sub processes within each
knowledge area to the higher level overall planning process.
A Basic Study Plan for the PMBOK(R) Guide
* Read every chapter of the PMBOK(R) Guide. The first three chapters describe the project
  management context and framework and include key terms and definitions.
* Read chapters 1 through 3 in one study session. These chapters are essential in
  developing an understanding of how the PMBOK(R) Guide is arranged and they provide
  information about enterprise environmental factors, organizational process assets,
  stakeholder types, organizational structure and project life cycle phases.
* Read each of the remaining chapters in succession (the recommendation is to read one
  chapter at each study session to avoid overload of information). The chapters contain a
  large amount of information and you can easily become overwhelmed and lose focus.
  Patience and a steady pace is your best strategy. Makes notes as you review each
  chapter and review them often. Use additional references such as the book Project
  Management - A Systems Approach to Planning, Scheduling and Controlling to obtain
  further details about the information provided in the PMBOK(R) Guide. The PMBOK(R) Guide
  does not provide detailed and comprehensive explanations of many important project
  management terms, tools and techniques,
* Ensure that you understand the flow charts that appear in each chapter and the
  relationships and flows of the inputs, tools and techniques, and outputs of each process
  within a knowledge area.
    * Refer to page 61 of the PMBOK(R) Guide often. This page provides an overview of the
        5 major processes and the linkages to the 10 knowledge areas. It also shows the 47
        logically grouped sub processes that support the 5 major process groups.
* Review very often, the overview charts that are found in each knowledge area chapter
  and learn to recognize the inputs, tools and techniques, and outputs. Concentrate on why
  an input is important, how a tool or technique is applied and how the resulting output
  becomes an input to another process. It is not essential to memorize the PMBOK(R) Guide.
  The study goal is not memorization, but understanding rationale and application of the
  knowledge, tools and techniques
* As you progress through the PMBOK(R) Guide you will begin to see a repetition of many
  processes. The processes are interrelated and the outputs of one process will frequently
  become the inputs to another process. This repetition emphasizes the integrative nature
  of project management.
* The chapter entitled "Project Integration Management" refers to many of the processes
  that are associated with the other knowledge areas. Integration Management is
  describing how all of the knowledge areas are combined and coordinated to achieve
  project success. . The details of these processes are described in later chapters. Make a
  note of unfamiliar terms and look for them in later chapters.
* When you have completed all chapters, review the glossary and then reread "Project
  Integration Management." This will help to further embed the knowledge obtained from the
  other chapters.
* Test yourself frequently with practice questions and try to relate the processes explained
  in the PMBOK(R) Guide with actual projects you have been or are currently assigned to.
  Not every process will be applicable to your projects but it will help with your study if
  you can relate the processes to your project assignments whenever possible.
408   CHAPTER TWENTY-FOUR


Preparing for the Exam

* Obtain the PMP(R) exam certification handbook from www.pmi.org.
  Review the qualifications and verify that you are eligible to apply for the exam.
* Obtain a copy of the current PMBOK(R) Guide (there is usually an overlap period when a
  new edition of the PMBOK Guide is released and the exam is updated to reflect any
  changes. Check with PMI(R) to determine which edition is appropriate for study.
* Read each chapter of the PMBOK. Take notes to further increase retention but do not try
  to memorize each section. Learn to apply the knowledge through practical application.
* When you find a term or subject that you are not familiar with, research the topic to
  ensure you have a full understanding.
* Read the PMBOK(R) Guide one chapter at a time. There is a lot of information to absorb. It
  is best to create personal study plan and establish a suitable pace for study. It is not
  recommended to cram for the exam.
* Obtain additional books for study: Recommendation: Project Management: A Systems
  Approach to Planning, Scheduling, and Controlling, 11th Edition, Harold Kerzner, Ph.D.,
  John Wiley & Sons, 2013
* Plan to study at least one hour each day and plan for a minimum of 40 to 60 hours of
  study.
* Plan to take a formal class in project management. You need 35 hours of formal training
  to satisfy one of the eligibility requirements.
* Take note of all formulas that are associated with project planning: Economic models
  such as Present Value, Net Present Value, Benefit to Cost Ratio, --PERT weighted
  average formula, Earned Value Management, Standard Deviation, Communications
  channels, CPM-Forward and Backward pass, expected monetary value, , contract sharing
  ratios. Most of the formulas are either not available or not explained in detail in the
  PMBOK(R) Guide. Use other resources to obtain this information.
* Obtain additional practice exams and questions.
* Start a study group and develop your own questions and presentations. This is a very
  effective way of studying for the exam.
* Get plenty of rest the night before the exam.
* Last-minute cramming is not recommended!

Questions to Consider Regarding the Various Topics Discussed in This
Workbook
This workbook has introduced you to several project management processes, tools and
techniques. To further your knowledge, consider the following recommendations:

1. Select a process, tool or technique, or a specific concept from a knowledge area and ask
   yourself "How can I apply this concept, process, or technique to my current
   environment?" Example: Creating a WBS for a new project. How would you obtain buy-
   in from team members? How would you start the process of developing the WBS? What
   preparatory work would you be required to perform? How will this process add value to
   your project?
2. If you cannot apply the concept, ask yourself why not? What is preventing the use of the
   concept? Where is there resistance? Why is there resistance? Why is the concept not
   applicable to your environment? It is important to note that the PMBOK(R) Guide provides
   a number of "best practices" that are used in most projects. It doesn't not imply that
   every process is used for every project.
3. If you feel that a process should be used in your organization ask "What changes must
   be introduced within the organization to gain acceptance of the process or technique?"

These questions will assist you in developing a more complete understanding of the
  processes, tools and techniques described in the material and will prepare more
  completely for the PMP(R) exam and to manage your projects more effectively.
                                                          PMP(R) AND CAPM(R) EXAM REVIEW   409

PMBOK(R) Guide--Key Learning Points of Chapters 1, 2, and 3:

Business Value The entire value of the business, the sum of all tangible and intangible
elements. Example: assets, stock equity.

The Project Management Institute Code of Ethics and Professional Conduct
The obligation of trust, fairness, honesty, and respect and a commitment to ethics,
compliance with laws, and observance of cultural diversity.

Enterprise Environmental Factors Internal and external factors that influence
project planning. Examples: organizational culture, industry standards, infrastructure,
human resource capabilities and skills, risk tolerance, and politics.

Project A temporary endeavor that is unique, constrained by resources, planned,
executed, and controlled. A project produces one or more deliverables. Project work is
similar to operations work but the difference is that project work is temporary and
operations work is considered ongoing and repetitive.

Progressive Elaboration The process of proceeding in incremental steps, increasing in
detail as the project moves forward through phases.

Project Management The application of knowledge, skills, and tools to meet stated
requirements. This includes setting objectives, balancing competing demands of time,
cost, scope, and quality.

The Relationships Among Projects, Programs, and Portfolios Portfolios are a
collection of projects and programs and operations, programs are a comprised of a group
of related projects, projects have defined start and end dates.
410   CHAPTER TWENTY-FOUR


Relationship of the 10 Knowledge Areas Three key words--Integration,
interrelationships, and inter-dependencies (all 10 knowledge areas are part of an integrated
system). Consider project management to be a system of components, each significantly
influencing the other parts of the system.
Project Environment It is important to be aware of cultural differences, the
international and political environment, and the physical environment that a project team
may be working with. These items are directly associated with professional and social
responsibility.
Interpersonal Skills The successful project manager can effectively manage project
teams and interpersonal relationships through communication, influencing skills,
leadership, motivation, negotiating skills, conflict management, and problem solving.
Program Generally considered to be comprised of several projects that are related in
some way and are managed in a coordinated way to obtain benefits that would not be
possible if they were managed separately. Programs do not have a definitive end date and
tend to be ongoing for longer, sometimes undetermined, time frames.
Portfolio Management            A collection of projects and programs and other work that
are grouped together to facilitate effective management of that work to meet strategic

Project Management Office                An organizational body or entity assigned various
responsibilities related to the centralized and coordinated management of those projects
under its domain. Three major types - Supportive, Controlling, Directive
Project Based Organizations            Conduct the majority of work as projects
10 Knowledge Areas of the PMBOK(R) Guide             Integration, Scope, Time, Cost, Risk,
Human Resources, Communications, Quality, Procurement Management and Stakeholder
Management. All 10 knowledge areas are integrated and have an inter-relationship. The
knowledge areas are part of a project management system The inputs for one process are,
in many cases, the results of outputs from a process associated with another knowledge
area. Review the overview charts found in each chapter of the PMBOK(R) Guide to observe
the relationships between knowledge areas. Review the chart on page 61 of the 5th edition
to view the relationships.
Relationships to Other Knowledge Areas Project management has many
similarities to General Management. General management skills include financial
management and accounting, purchasing and procurement, contracts and commercial law,
strategic planning, tactical planning, operational planning, organizational structures, safety
practices, and information technology. Project management requires knowledge of these
areas to ensure effective integration with operations during planning and execution.
Project Management may also include Application Area Knowledge such as software
development, construction, aerospace and automobile design where there may be a
requirement to possess knowledge of the technology and terminology associated with the
specific discipline to successfully manage the project.
Deliverable A tangible, verifiable work output. Deliverables are generally defined in
each project phase and reviewed for acceptance prior to the start of the next phase.
Phases and Project Life Cycles Projects are divided into phases for control purposes
and to make the project more manageable. Phases also allow project managers to manage
progress, make decisions regarding project continuation (go-no-go decisions) and provide
an opportunity to review project progress and performance. Phases also provide an
opportunity to identify and assess project risks more effectively. There are three basic
phase to phase relationships--sequential, overlapping, and iterative.

Projects have greater risk and a lower probability of success at project start -
up In the early stages of the project the scope of the project has not been fully
elaborated, and the details required to develop an effective plan have not been completely
defined. Uncertainty is extremely high resulting in a perception of greater project risk. As
the project is progressively elaborated the risk associated with the project is reduced as
more information becomes available resulting in more reliable plans. Risk is not eliminated
during the project progression through the project life cycle but the ability to manage risk
more effectively is improved as more project information is gathered.
Stakeholders People or organizations directly involved in or in some way impacted either
positively or negatively as a result of the project. Stakeholders can be considered positive
(support the project) or negative (impede the project). Project managers should consider the
risks and potential impact of the negative stakeholder (whether internal or external to the
organization). Key stakeholders include: Project Manager, Sponsor, Customer, Project team,
the PMO--Project Management Office, the performing organization, operations
management, suppliers and business partners, the end user, and contractors.
Organizational Structures There are three basic organizational structures: Functional,
Matrix , and Projectized. The matrix structure can be further defined as one of three
possible sub types - Weak matrix where the project manager has little to no authority,
balanced matrix where the project manager and function manager have equal levels of
authority, and strong matrix where the project manager has a greater level of authority
than the functional manager. Consider the advantages and disadvantages of each type of
structure. Example--The project manager authority in each type of organizational structure
is different and may have an impact on how the project manager influences the project. In
the functional structure the project manager has very little authority and acts as a
coordinator or expeditor. In the strong matrix the project manager has greater influence
and has the authority to direct resources and / or functional managers.
Organizational Process Assets Processes and procedures for conducting work.
Examples: standardized guidelines, templates, project closure guidelines, change control
procedures
Key Management Skills The key skills associated with managing and with project
management include: leadership, communications, organizing, team building, conflict
resolution, planning, and administration.
Responsibilities and Competencies of the Project Manager Knowledge--what is
known about project management, performance--what the project manager can
accomplish by applying project management knowledge. Personal--behavior, core
personality characteristics, attitude, and the ability to manage and lead a team.
Plan-Do-Check-Act Cycle The Shewhart Chart adopted by Deming is an underlying
concept of project management and provided a basis for the development of the five major
project management process groups - Initiating, planning, executing, monitoring and
controlling and closing described within the PMBOK(R) Guide.
Project Management Process Groups Initiating, Planning, Executing, Monitoring &
Controlling, and Closing. It is important to note that these are not phases. These processes
are present in each phase of the project life cycle and assist in providing a consistent
approach to achieving objectives.
Rolling Wave Planning           A form of progressive elaboration where near term work is
planned in detail at a low level of the WBS and work scheduled for the future is planned at
a high level. As work is completed in one phase or period, the work of the next phase or
near term is planned in more detail.
Organizational Process Assets         Internal procedures and policies that guide an
organization.

Project Integration Management

Each knowledge area in the PMBOK(R) Guide consists of several processes. These
processes are managed through inputs (items that that are necessary or should be
considered for planning) tools and techniques (the actions and steps taken to process the
inputs'), and outputs (the results of the processing of the inputs). There is a basic flow
from the inputs to the tools and techniques where data is processed to the outputs which
are the results or deliverables of the process. Each knowledge area is part of the project
management system and all knowledge areas are integrated within the system.
The main process groups within Project Integration management are: Develop Project
Charter, Develop Project Management Plan, Direct and Manage Project Work, Monitor and
Control Project Work, Perform Integrated Change Control, Close Project or Phase.

Study Tip: Review the overview chart provided in each knowledge area chapter of the
PMBOK(R) Guide and follow through from the inputs of each process group to the tools and
techniques and then to the outputs. In many of the processes you will see that the output
of one process may become an input to several other processes. You will also notice that
many inputs and tools and techniques are used in the process groups of several
knowledge areas.. Take time to review why an input is important and how it will be used.
Think about the actual actions taking place when applying the tools and techniques and
what outputs are produced. The flow of inputs, tools and techniques, and outputs actually
provides a logical basis for planning and managing a project.
The Project Charter A document that formally recognizes the project and authorizes the
project manager to apply organizational resources. The charter establishes the initial set of
requirements and identifies key project stakeholders. To develop the project charter it is
important to refer to the business need driving the project, the product to be produced, and
the strategic objectives of the organization. If a contract is involved, review the terms and
conditions agreed upon. The charter generally establishes the authority level of the project
manager and provides clearly documented visible support from senior level management.
Project Statement of Work Narrative description of products and services to be
supplied by the project. The statement of work often precedes the formal process of
procuring goods and services. The SOW usually provides information about business need,
product description, and the connection to the requesting organizations strategic plan.
Study Tip: Always consider the enterprise environmental factors and organizational
process assets that may affect the project planning process.
Project Selection Methods Prior to the development of the project charter an
organization will most likely consider and determine which projects would be most beneficial
for the organization. Benefit measurement methods are used to determine the projects that
will be selected for implementation. A benefit cost analysis may be conducted to determine if
the project is value adding. It answers the question "Should we do it? " A feasibility study
will determine if the organization has the capability to perform the project work and answers
the question "Should we do it?" Many organizations consider the tangible benefits such as
profit and cost savings and the intangible benefits such as good will, morale, and customer
satisfaction when selecting projects. Selection methods may include calculation of NPV--Net
Present Value (time value of money). An important formula to remember is the Present Value
formula: Present value PV = FV/(1 + r)n .where PV is present value, FV is Future value, r = rate,
n is the number of years. This formula discounts future cash flows back to current or present
value in terms of dollars (or currency) Other forms of project selection methods include
Internal Rate of Return (IIR) -- an iterative process that will determine the rate or cost of
capital at which the project NPV would equal zero, breakeven analysis, pay-back period,
ROI--Return on Investment, and benefit to cost ratio.

The PMIS (Project Management Information System)                      This is actually a
system of systems and includes all of the systems you will use to obtain project data,
analyze data, and distribute information to the project stakeholders. The Project
Management Information System is any system or group of systems working together to
gather, store, and distribute information about your project. Examples--Time Reporting
System, Accounting System, and Project Software.
The Project Management Plan           This is basically the guide that will be used by the
project manager and team and includes the actions required to integrate the many
subsidiary plans such as cost management, change control, quality management, and
scope management into the total or integrated project plan. The project management plan
is expected to change as the project progresses and new details emerge. Typical outputs of
many PMBOK(R) Guide processes are document updates, and project plan updates.

Outputs From Other Processes This refers to the many outputs of the total planning
process and include the outputs from scope planning, time management planning, cost
planning, quality, risk and other processes.
Subsidiary Plans     Plans that support the project management plan - Scope
management plan, requirements management plan, quality management plan, process
improvement plan as examples.
Direct and Manage Project Execution Performing the work described in the project
management plan such as creating deliverables, obtaining project staff, generating project
data and reports, procuring resources. The outputs of the direct and manage project
execution include project deliverables, work performance data, change requests, project
management plan updates, project document updates. Direct and manage project
execution includes taking corrective action, preventive action, and defect repair.

Monitor and Control Project Work           This includes tracking, reviewing, and
managing project progress, comparing actual performance to planned performance and
reporting project status and managing change.
Perform Integrated Change Control Monitoring results managing change requests,
review and approval of configuration changes. A change control process is used to
minimize scope changes and reduce or eliminate scope creep. Approved changes require
plan updates (documentation updates), implementation of the change, validation that the
change has been successfully implemented, and recording of lessons learned. The 10
knowledge areas are managed in an integrated manner with an understanding that a
change in one area can impact any or all of the other knowledge areas. It is important to
consider the impact of the change before implementing the change. This is referred to as
"impact analysis." Changes such as a schedule slip or a cost overrun may be experienced
during project plan execution. To determine that a change of this nature has occurred of
the actual results with a baseline is necessary. When a change is approved and must be
implemented it is important to determine the appropriate time to make a change and how
to introduce the change to minimize the impact on ongoing operations, the current flow of
project work or other projects.
Closing the Project or Phase Project plans should include a process for closing out the
project or a phase of a project. There are two major procedures for project closure:
Administrative closure--project reviews, verifying project financials, analyzing project success
or failure, lessons learned, and Contract closure--the actions required to close contractual
agreements and ensure that terms and conditions have been met. The closing process should
include a plan that will satisfy project completion requirements and define exit criteria.

Project Scope Management

Ensuring that the project includes all work and only the work required to complete the
objectives of the project.

The project manager and project team will become involved in the Scope
Planning Process Creating a project scope management plan that describes and
documents how the project scope will be defined, verified, controlled, and how the WBS
will be developed. The scope management plan is a subsidiary plan to the project
management plan.

There are two types of scope to be aware of:

       Product Scope          The features, functions, and physical characteristics of the
       product service, or result of the project.

       Project Scope           The work that must be completed to produce the product,
       service, or result

Scope management includes the following major processes:

Project Time Management

The processes required to ensure timely completion of the project. Project Time
Management involves several planning and controlling activities and includes the further
development of the WBS into lower levels of detail referred to as work packages. The work
packages are comprised of activities that will be performed by the assigned resources to
complete the deliverable associated with the work package. Activities are arranged in a
logical sequence and the duration of each activity is estimated. This combination of
planning outputs will produce a project schedule. In addition, time management is
associated with effective use of resources, managing personal time, delegation of work,
anticipating risks, and balancing the needs of the stakeholders. A schedule baseline is
established and as the project life cycle progresses, the project manager and team will
controlling change and manage schedule variances.


The processes of Time Management

Plan Schedule Management            Establishing policies and procedures to effectively
develop, execute, manage and control the project schedule.

Define Activities The project manager works with the project team to identify the
specific activities that must be performed will further define the WBS and create work
packages. This process, known as decomposition, is an extension of the development of
the WBS. Work packages include the activities that must be completed to produce lower
level deliverables that will ultimately sum up to total project deliverable. Inputs include:
The schedule management plan, scope baseline, Enterprise environmental factors, and
organizational process assets.

Define Activity Tools and Techniques Decomposition: breaks the WBS down
further into work packages and activities. Rolling wave planning (work to be performed in
the near term is planned in detail), expert judgment.

      Key terms Rolling Wave Planning, decomposition, Activity Attributes, Milestone list

Sequence Activities This process is intended to define and document the
relationships among project activities. There are three types of dependencies that are used
when developing a project schedule: Mandatory dependency (hard logic), Discretionary
dependency, (soft logic), and External dependency (factors outside the project and outside
of the control of the project manager that may affect the project). The sequence activities
process produces a network diagram that displays the predecessor/successor
relationships or logical relationships between activities.

      Key terms Precedence diagramming method (PDM) also known as activity on the
      node, arrow diagramming method or ADM, also known as activity on the arrow (this
      method is not commonly used). The PDM is the prevalent form of network
      diagramming when sequencing activities. Types of Dependencies--Mandatory,
      Discretionary, and External; Leads (acceleration of time between activities to reduce
      path duration) and Lags - required delays between the finish of an activity and the start
      of a succeeding activity. Relationships used in the PDM process--Finish to Start, Start
      to Start, Finish to Finish, and Start to Finish.

Estimate Activity Resources The process of determining the number and types of
resources required to perform the work and complete project activities.

    level to attain summary project information.
    Key terms Activity Attributes and Bottom-up Estimating (uses the WBS to provide
    details at the work package level for more reliable estimates
Estimate Activity Duration Remember to determine the type of resource required, the
availability of the resources needed for the project, the number of resources needed, and assess
resource capabilities. The capability or skill level and the available time to perform project
activities will affect the duration estimate of each activity. Consider historical information and
lessons learned when estimating duration. . Duration estimating also includes determining
appropriate reserve time or contingency, and the extended time required when resources are not
assigned to the project full time. Ramp up time is a factor when estimating duration.
    Tools and techniques - Expert judgment, analogous estimating (comparing a project to a
    similar project), and parametric estimates (using mathematical algorithms) three point
    estimating -Triangular Distribution, and Beta Distribution (using optimistic, pessimistic and
    4 times the most likely values), Formula: (O + 4M + P) / 6. Group decision making

Control Schedule This process includes determining the status of the project schedule
by assessing variance, influencing the factors that cause schedule changes, determining if
a schedule change has occurred by comparing actual performance to planned
performance, and effectively and efficiently managing approved changes. This involves the
review of project reports, performance, change requests, and the use of a schedule change
control system. Control includes the analysis of variances, taking corrective action, and
documenting lessons learned.

Important Time Management Items to Remember:
PDM--Precedence Diagram Method. There are 4 logical relationships: FS - Finish to Start
(the most common type of relationship), FF - Finish to Finish, SS - Start to Start, SF - Start
to Finish
AOA--Activity on the arrow: This technique may use dummy activities. Uses only FS
relationship. The dummy activity may be a factor in determining the critical path. This
method is not commonly used. The PDM method is prevalent in most current project
software tools.
CPM-- Critical Path Method. Determines the early start and early finish and late start and
late finish of each project activity.
Slack--Also known as float. A measure of flexibility of the activities in a network path. There is
generally no float or slack on the critical path.
Free Float--the amount of time a task may slip without affecting succeeding activities
Total Float-- the amount of time an activity may slip without affecting the project end date
Float ownership--the float is "owned" by the entire path not the individual activity. Path float
is not determined by summing up the float of each activity on the path. Path float is determined
by how usage of float on one activity impacts the other activities on the path.
Forward pass--Determines early start and finish dates. Moves from the project start
through the network to the project finish. At points of convergence the greatest value is
used to determine the start of the convergent activity. (The point of convergence is also
referred to as a "sink point."
Backward pass--Determines late start and finish dates. Begins at the end milestone and
proceeds back through the network. At points of convergence the lower value will
determine the late start.

PERT weighted average formula             (Optimistic + 4 Most Likely + Pessimistic)/6
Standard deviation = (b - a)/6          (Pessimistic - Optimistic divided by 6)

Path convergence - multiple activities that precede an activity. In the forward pass
process the early start of the succeeding is activity is determined by the activity with the
greatest early finish value
Crashing--Reducing critical path duration by adding resources or using overtime to
compress the activity duration.
Fast Tracking --Overlapping activities. Beginning an activity before its successor is complete.

Project Cost Management includes the processes that are used to determine project costs,
    establish the project budget, allocate costs to each phase of the project life cycle,
    monitor project expenses, and to control project costs through analysis of variances
    from the approved project budget.
Typical project costs include: Direct Costs: Human resources (salaries), Materials and
   Equipment, Capital Costs, rent, leases, travel expenses. Indirect costs: overhead
   expenses, recurring costs (electricity, water), training, and insurance.

The four major processes associated with Project Cost Management are plan
cost management, estimate costs, determine budget, and control costs.
Plan Cost Management           Establishing policies and procedures for developing the project
budget, managing the budget, and controlling costs. Inputs include the Scope baseline,
Schedule baseline, other information such as risk data and communications processes.
Tools and Techniques           Expert judgment, Analytical techniques (deciding on
strategic options), Meetings

Estimate Costs         Developing an approximation of the monetary resources required to
complete project activities. Estimating project costs may involve the use of Analogous,
Parametric, and Bottom-up Estimating techniques, Three point estimates and risk analysis.
Inputs to Estimate Cost Cost management plan, Human resource management plan,
Scope baseline, Project Schedule, Risk register, Enterprise environmental factors,
Organizational process assets. Consider why each of these inputs is necessary to develop
reliable estimates. Example: Enterprise environmental factors such as resource capability,
the risk tolerance of an organization, political factors, and industry standards may have a
direct cause the project team to adjust estimates and build in additional contingencies.
   Key terms Analogous estimating (use of similar projects to develop a top down
   estimate), Parametric Estimating (use of mathematical algorithms such as cost per
   square foot multiplies by the number of square feet), and Bottom-up Estimating (Use of
   the WBS to aggregate costs from the work package level to the project level), Cost of
   Quality - costs associated with conformance to quality requirements such as training
   and inspections., Reserve Analysis - analyzing the planned reserves, , level of precision
   - rounding data to a prescribed precision level, Units of measure - hours, weeks, lump
   sum,, control thresholds - allowable variance from a plan, Rules of performance
   measurement - example: the use of earned value analysis or determining the control
   points to be used on the WBS. Vendor bid analysis - review of bids to determine
   accuracy, fairness, consistency within the discipline.

      Key terms Cost Aggregation- create a summary of all project costs, Reserve
      Analysis, Cost Baseline, Time-Phased Budget- allocation of project costs to each phase
      of the project, Risk register. Funding limit reconciliation - resolving differences
      between the planned project budget and the funding limits defined by the organization.
      This also refers to leveling out the work to manage the rate of expenditure.
Control Costs Monitoring the project through each phase and identifying changes or
variances in project costs and taking corrective action. This also includes the management
of change requests, analyzing performance data, and producing measurements for
analysis. A commonly used process is earned value management to identify variances and
trends using three main elements for measurement -Planned value: the cost of activities
scheduled to be accomplished at the time of measurement, Earned Value: The planned
cost of activities that have been accomplished at the time of measurement, Actual Cost:
The amount paid for activities accomplished at the time of measurement.

Other Important Cost Management terms
Learning Curves Used as a basis for predicting cost and quantity outputs of a process
over time. The basic rule of learning curves is: As units are produced, the time and cost
required to produce the unit decreases. Productivity improves through repetition. The rate
of improvement decreases during the process until a point where the output reaches a
level where improvement is minimal. This process is often associated with estimating
manufacturing process outputs.

Life-Cycle Costing The total cost of a product from research and development to
salvage or retirement. The project life cycle is included with the product life cycle.

Future Value Formula FV = PV (1 + r)n where FV= Future value PV = Present Value
      r = rate or cost of capital n= years
                                                           PMP(R) AND CAPM(R) EXAM REVIEW   421


Present Value Formula PV = FV/(1 + r)n where PV = Present value, FV = Future value, r
= rate of cost of capital, n = years. Present value is used to discount a future value of an
investment to the current or present value. This technique is used in the project selection
process to determine which projects will have the greatest financial advantage.

 Net Present Value NPV - The sum of the present values of the cash flows in for each
year of an investment minus the initial investment. If NPV is greater than or equal to zero
the project is generally considered acceptable. The greater the NPV the more acceptable
the project will be financially. A NPV of less than zero would indicate that the project will
produce a loss.

IRR Internal Rate of Return. This is an iterative process used to determine the actual
interest rate or return realized from an investment. The process requires several iterations to
determine the rate at which NPV becomes zero. The IRR generally must meet or exceed a
predetermined "hurdle rate" established by an organization as part of project selection
criteria. This process will provide an organization with a reliable assessment of the return on
investment of a project. IRR is compared with other projects during the selection process.

Payback Period Period of time required to recover the initial investment. It generally
does not consider the time value of money. The period of time required to "recover" the
sum of the original investment. Example, a $1000 investment which returned $200 per year
would have a five-year payback period.

Breakeven The point at which cash outflow and inflow are equal. Breakeven analysis is
also used to determine rent, buy or lease decisions.

Sunk Cost Money already spent that cannot be recovered. Generally not considered as a
factor in the go and no go decision process.

Indirect Costs Costs that are not directly associated with the project but that can impact
the overall budget. Examples - Overhead, building maintenance, benefits, organization
operational costs such as rent, utility bills etc.

Direct Costs Costs directly and clearly associated with the project. Labor, material,
equipment, supplies are considered direct project costs.

BCWP Also known as EV or Earned Value--Budgeted Cost of Work Performed. This is the
estimated or planned cost of the work that has been completed at the time of
measurement. The amount that was planned to be paid for the work that has been
accomplished.

BCWS Also known as PV or Planned Value. Budgeted Cost of Work Scheduled. This the
planned cost of the work (or work packages) that should have been completed at the time
of measurement.

ACWP Also known as AC or Actual Cost. Actual Cost of Work Performed      This is the
amount that was paid for the work that was performed at the time of measurement.

BAC Budget at Completion. This is the final planned and approved budget. The baseline
to compare against actual results.

Note: PV EV and AC are the acronyms associated with the PMBOK(R) Guide. Earned value
information is the common denominator when determining Cost and Schedule variance.

Earned Value: Special note The PMP(R) exam is likely to use the acronyms EV (Earned
Value) instead of BCWP, PV (Planned Value) instead of BCWS and AC (Actual Cost) instead
of ACWP.
422     CHAPTER TWENTY-FOUR


Earned Value Formulas:

EV (BCWP) - AC (ACWP) = Cost variance (CV) (a negative cost variance = budget overrun)
EV - PV (BCWS) = Schedule variance (SV) (a negative SV means the project or work
package is behind schedule)
EV/AC (ACWP) = Cost performance index (CPI) (a measure of efficiency in managing the
project budget)
EV/PV (BCWS) = Schedule performance index (SPI) (a measure of efficiency in managing
the project schedule)

Quick Reference:

EV - AC = CV

EV - PV = SV

EV / AC = CPI

EV / PV = SPI

A performance index (PI) that equals 1 means there is no variance and the project or work
package is performing as planned and at the expected level of efficiency. A PI greater than
1 indicates superior performance (greater efficiency than planned. Example: receiving
$1.10in value for every one dollar spent. A PI less than 1 indicates a performance problem
such as a schedule slippage or a cost overrun.

Estimate at Complete (EAC) The forecasted project competition cost based on current
data. There are three formulas highlighted in the PMBOK(R) Guide:
EAC = AC + (BAC - EV)          This formula is used when a risk assessment indicates that
all remaining work will be accomplished at the budgeted rate. This is a highly optimistic
prediction. .
EAC = BAC / CPI This formula is used when it is assumed that all future work (ETC or
Estimate to Complete) will be completed at the rate of actual performance to date.

EAC = ACC + ( BAC -EV ) / (CPI x x SPI) Used.         This formula is used when the project
schedule is a significant factor impacting the remaining work (ETC). the formula considers
the efficiency rate of cost and schedule performance.

Project Quality Management

Other Quality Related Terms and Key Points

Quality Gurus

W. Edwards Deming - utilized the Shewhart Chart, Plan Do Check Act, Proclaimed that 85%
of quality issues require management involvement, Emphasized statistical analysis.

Joseph Juran - Emphasized Fitness for Use, advised to be aware of the legal issues
associated with quality

Philip Crosby - Postulated that quality is free. The cost of quality is associated with non
conformance. Zero defects is possible

Taguchi - Developed the Design of Experiments approach. Postulated that, quality should
be engineered into a product not inspected into the product. As results move further from
the target, the cost of correcting will increase.

Ishikawa - Developed the cause and effect diagram

Feigenbaum - Developed the concept of Total Quality Management

Key Components of Quality Management Customer satisfaction, prevention of over
inspection, management responsibility, continuous improvement

The Customer Defines Quality The project team analyzes the customer's implied
needs and develops approved and accepted stated needs (requirements) to meet the
customer's expectations. The project manager has ultimate responsibility for quality during
the project life cycle.

Quality Policy Developed by the performing organization. It is an indication of the
intentions of an organization as it relates to quality. The organizational quality policy is
usually established by upper management and compliance is expected within each project.
Project quality policies are an extension of the organization's quality policy and may be
customized as needed based on project requirements.

Prevention Over Inspection Prevention is emphasized. It is generally less costly to
prevent errors than to inspect and identify errors that must be corrected.

TQM Total Quality Management: An organizational approach to quality that starts at the
top management level and includes all levels of employees. The focus of TQM is on
continuous improvement through training and awareness about quality.

Quality Planning       Developing a plan to manage the quality of project deliverables.
Inputs include the scope statement, product description, the company quality policy.
Quality planning identifies which quality standards are relevant to the project.

Benefit Cost Analysis Determining the appropriate level of quality to meet an
acceptable return on the investment while meeting customer needs. Generally the benefits
received should be greater than the cost to produce the product or deliverable.

Benchmarking Comparing desired or best in class performance with existing
performance. Identifying areas for improvement or deficiencies in products and services
and developing corrective actions.
                                                           PMP(R) AND CAPM(R) EXAM REVIEW    425


Flowcharting Diagramming a process to identify the specific steps to achieve a result.
Identifying where gaps in the process exist, and to identify and eliminate redundant work.
Flow charts are used to gain an understanding of the overall operation or flow of work.

Design of Experiments        Introduced by Taguchi, the general principle is that quality
should be engineered into a product, not inspected into it. Basically, when a process has
been defined and approved after multiple iterations, expressly following the process will
always produce the same result.

Cost of Quality There are two major components of the Cost of Quality - Cost of
conformance which includes Prevention and Appraisal costs and Cost of
nonconformance--which includes internal failure (rework) and external failure (customer
dissatisfaction).

Quality Assurance Systematic activities implemented to ensure that the project will
satisfy quality standards. Quality assurance is associated with audits designed to
determine if there are variations from process and/or standards.

Quality Control Monitoring and, analyzing project performance results to determine if
they are acceptable and are within approved standards.

Prevention Keeping errors out of the process and preventing errors from reaching
customer.

Sampling Two basic types of sampling , attribute and variable. Attribute sampling is a
pass or fail approach, with no flexibility in accepting results. Results either conform or do
not conform to requirements. Variable sampling allows for some tolerance from target
and acceptable variance is measured using a specific scale.

Inspection Examining work outputs by conducting walkthroughs, testing, and reviews.

Control Charts In statistical process control, control charts are tools used to determine
if a manufacturing or business process is in a state of control by analyzing data points and
their relationship to the mean or process average. The control chart analysis may include
what is referred to as the Rule of 7 and the Rule 21: 7 consecutive data points above or
below the mean indicate a run, 7 data points indicating a specific positive or negative
direction indicates a trend, . Generally, 21 data points are required for a sample to be
statistically valid. Control charts are used to identify special or assignable causes and to
determine if a process is in control or out of control, The control chart includes the process
average, mean or center line, upper and lower control limits ( UCL and LCL) and upper and
lower specification limits. Study note: review several control chart examples and note the
possible interpretations: In control, out of control, periodicity (patterns), runs, trends,
hugging the center line.

Pareto Diagram A Histogram that displays problems or issues by frequency of
occurrence and is associated with the 80/20 rule as it applies to quality. 80% of problems
are associated with 20% of the causes.

Cost of Conformance Includes two components--Prevention (examples - training,
design reviews), and Appraisal (example inspections and testing).

Cost of Nonconformance Includes two components--Internal Failure (examples:
defects, rework) and External Failure (examples- customer receives a defective product
resulting in loss of business or liabilities).

Remember: DTRTRTFT Do the right thing right the first time. Basically attributed to
Philip Crosby.
426    CHAPTER TWENTY-FOUR


ISO 9000 International certification indicating documented processes for quality. ISO 9001
is the most comprehensive certification in the series. ISO 9000 is updated approximately
every four years. Note ISO is derived from the Greek word ISOS meaning "equal."
Grade vs. Quality Low-grade basically means fewer feature and functions but is not an
indication of quality. Products can be considered to be of high quality and low grade: well
made but missing the technical characteristics and functionality of other similar products.
Low grade is not necessarily a problem but poor quality is always a problem. Example--
software with limited functions may serve a specific need and is produced with high-
quality, but limited features. (It does what it was intended to do, but it is low grade, that is,
it does not have all of the features and functions of a higher grade product.
Quality The basic definition is "The conformance to specifications or requirements and
fitness for use."
Essential Quality Characteristics Utility - ease of use, Financial-- effective
management of all associated costs, Legal - warranties, safe for use, maintainability,
reliability, availability.
Customer Satisfaction Defining and then managing work to meet customer
expectations. A best practice is to define requirements and expectations early in the project
and then review them on a regular basis. The goal is to achieve the desired result as
expressed by the customer.
Management Responsibility Participation of all employees is desired to achieve
quality objectives. According to Deming, management is responsible to provide resources
with the appropriate training, tools equipment and materials. Management is basically
responsible for 85% of quality issues. This means that most quality issues require the
involvement of management to resolve them.
Shewhart Chart--Plan, Do, Check, Act Displays the basic principles of continuous
improvement. Developed by Shewhart and emphasized by Deming. It is the basis from
which the 5 major process groups were developed: Initiating, Planning, Executing,
Monitoring and Controlling, and Closing.
Attribute Sampling Process that focuses on assessing outputs to determine if each
output passes or fails an inspection. Either reject or accept the deliverable t being reviewed.
Variable Sampling Units are measured using a scale to determine acceptance. A
tolerance specification is established and allows some flexibility in when determining the
acceptance of deliverables.
Quality Control Measuring performance to determine where variances exist and taking
actions to correct unacceptable variance. Includes: Inspection, Control Charts, Pareto
Diagrams (80/20 rule), Histograms, Scatter diagrams.
Statistical Sampling Method of determining the appropriate sample group from a
population to determine if the entire population is acceptable. There are different types of
sampling: 100% sampling (used when quantities are very small), single sampling, double
sampling, and multiple sampling. During the sampling process it is possible to experience
Producer's or Alpha risk - the risk to a seller that a good lot will be rejected and
Consumer's or Beta Risk - the risk that a consumer will accept a bad lot.
Six Sigma Generally defined as the process that will eventually result in 3.4 defects per
million opportunities for failure. There is usually a high cost during the early stages of
implementation. From a strategic perspective the costs are expected to be recovered over
time. The goal of Six Sigma--minimize defects through continuous analysis and action.
Six Sigma results are achieved through a process known as DMAIC --Define, Measure,
Analyze, Improve, and Control. The process includes the use of tools such as Pareto
charts, Control charts, Variance testing, Design of Experiments.

Project Human Resources Management

Human Resources Management includes the processes that are used to organize and
manage the project team. This includes selection of the project team, the ability to motivate
and lead a team, conflict management, the difference between authority and power,
influencing people, managing interpersonal interfaces, project and personal performance
appraisals, and professional and ethical behavior. Organizational structure is generally
included in Human Resources Management. Organizational structure refers to three basic
types - Functional, Matrix, and Projectized structures. The specific information about
organizational structure is found in Chapter 2 of the 5th edition of the PMBOK(R) Guide.

   Plan Human Resource Management The process of determining skill
   requirements, identifying project roles, establishing reporting relationships, and
   creating the staffing plan. It also includes organizing, managing, and leading the
   project team.

Roles and Responsibilities Should be identified and assigned during the project
kickoff meeting. Identifying roles and responsibilities will help to minimize conflicts and
improve overall project communications.

RAM--Responsibility Assignment Matrix The RAM is aligned with the WBS and
links project team member responsibility with WBS elements. The RAM is used to clearly
define responsibility for the completion of project tasks and major deliverables. It is
generally not a tool used for determining resource requirements.

Interrelationships The many interfaces a project manager will be expected to manage
and work with during the project life cycle. Examples-- Functional groups such as
engineering, design, and operations. Project Interfaces include Organizational functions
(business units), Technical Groups (design group and production groups), and
Interpersonal Relationships (formal and informal personal relationships with stakeholders).
                                                           PMP(R) AND CAPM(R) EXAM REVIEW     429


Organizational Structure There are three major types of organizational structure -
Functional, Matrix, and Projectized. Each type of structure has unique characteristics,
advantages and disadvantages. The authority of the project manager is generally lowest in
the Functional structure, moderate in the Matrix structure, and nearly total in the
Projectized structure.
Power and Authority The project manager should be aware of the five major types of
power or influence:
Legitimate or formal power - based on position and rank in the organization
Expert - based on level of knowledge and experience
Penalty - based on the ability and authority to penalize employees or threaten disciplinary
action. Also known as coercive power
Reward - based on the ability and authority to offer items of perceived value to employees
in exchange for work
Referent - influencing people through the power and authority of another, Use of Charisma
Conflict Management There are five general types of conflict handling: Withdrawing,
Smoothing, Compromise, Forcing, and Collaboration - through Confrontation (working
together by confronting the problem, not each other) and Problem Solving).
Major Sources of Conflict Schedule priorities, priorities in general, project costs,
estimating techniques, different opinions, lack of communication. Consider projects that
you have been assigned to and identify other sources of conflict and the solutions to those
conflicts. Escalation to the project sponsor or project executive may be necessary to
resolve some conflicts. Generally conflicts are resolved by understanding the needs of the
opposing person or group and identifying common areas of agreement.
Motivation Theories Theory X - an authorative approach - the manager believes
employees attempt to avoid work and therefore must be closely supervised, Theory Y - a
participative management style in which the manager believes the workforce can be
trusted and is willing to accept responsibility, and Theory Z - Introduced by William Ouchi-
a communal type of structure where the workers focus on the higher level needs and goals
of an organization. Other motivation theories include: Maslow's Hierarchy of Needs,
Frederick Herzberg's -Hygiene theory that focuses on factors that may cause dissatisfaction
and motivators that will inspire team members to perform at higher levels.
Motivation There are several motivation theories to review and become familiar with:
Douglas McGregor: Theory X--a micro-manager that distrusts employees, believes
employees do not want to work, and will do only what is minimally required. Significant
levels of supervision are required Theory Y--Participative style, trusting, supportive. The
manager believes people sincerely want to work and make a contribution. Theory Z -
Ouchi believed that a structure in which everyone supported the greater good of the
organization and where long term employment and loyalty to the organization were
emphasized were key to motivating employees.
Maslow--Hierarchy of Needs Expressed graphically as a pyramid. The lowest or first
level is the physiological needs of an individual. As each motivating factor is achieved it is
no longer considered to be a motivator and the individual will seek the next level.. The 5
major levels are: Physiological needs, Safety and Security, Social Needs, Esteem, and Self-
Actualization.
Herzberg's Theory The manager must address hygiene factors such as working
conditions, peer relationships, level of supervision, working environment and
compensation before attempting to motivate the workforce. . If these factors are not
managed and provided at a satisfactory level they may cause pain, discomfort, or conflict.
They are not considered to be motivators but must be managed to remove any potential
dissatisfaction among employees.. Once the hygiene factors are satisfied, motivating
factors can be introduced. Examples of motivators are personal growth, advancement,
increased responsibility, challenging work and recognition.
430   CHAPTER TWENTY-FOUR


Team Building The project manager must remember the importance of team building
and the phases of team development: Forming, Storming, Norming, Performing and
Adjourning. During the forming stage the team member will express concern and approach
the project in a guarded state of mind. Conflict is greatest during the storming phase where
disagreements about responsibilities will peak. Conflict begins to subside in the Norming
phase, and is minimized in the performing stage where the team has learned to trust each
other and protect each other. The project manager is considered to be a team leader and
should determine the best methods to enhance the performance of the team through team
building activities, reward and recognition, training, appraisals, co-location when feasible,
support, direction, feedback, and sincere and well thought out performance appraisals.
Leadership Skills Project managers are expected to lead the project team and should
provide coaching, facilitation, authoritative leadership, supportive leadership, vision,
direction, and motivation.
Organizational Influences Remember the difference between a project based and a
non-project based organization. Project based - the organization performs most work as
project work or manages projects for external customers. Non project based organizations
do not have a formal project management methodology or do not normally engage in
project type work.
Project Stakeholders Any person or organization that is involved in or directly
impacted either positively or negatively as a result of the project.
Negotiating Project managers must develop effective negotiating skills. This includes
understanding other viewpoints and needs, creating an environment for effective
negotiation and developing negotiation skills and tactics such as concessions,
compromise, minimum and maximum values, bargaining, protocol, cultural sensitivity, fair
and reasonable offers, teaming agreements,. Items that may require negotiation include:
obtaining resources, schedule development, activity duration estimates, funding
requirements, resolving conflicts.

Project Communications Management

Project communications includes the processes that will ensure timely collection, analysis,
preparation and distribution of project information. It is about effectively and regularly
exchanging information and establishing and managing the flow of information between the
project manager and stakeholders. Project communication involves an understanding of
stakeholder needs, stakeholder influences, and cultural differences. Communication also
includes establishing feedback loops to ensure that messages and information or
understood by the receivers. Effective communication includes the timely generation,
collection, distribution, storage, and retrieval of project information. A Project Management
Information System--PMIS is a key element of project communications management.

There are three major sub processes associated with project communications: Plan
communications management, Manage communications, and Control communications
Communications activities include: Internal communications, External communications,
formal and informal reports and memos, vertical and horizontal communications (upward,
downward, and cross organizational, official and unofficial reporting (off the record and
grapevine type communications), written, oral, verbal and no-verbal communications
(body language). Many elements of effective communication are directly related to
elements of Human Resource Management such as conflict management, influencing
skills, and team building skills.

planning is based on the following questions: Who needs the information? What information
is needed? When is the information needed? Why is the information needed? In what format
should the information be sent? How frequently should the information be sent? The specific
needs of the stakeholder will determine the communications to be provided.
       Inputs to Plan Communications Management Project management plan,
       Stakeholder register- List of stakeholders and their perceived influence level,

      Key terms          Stakeholders, Information management systems, sender - receiver
      models, Communications methods, Issue logs, Managing resistance to change, document
      updates. Variance analysis, project performance forecasts, Earned value management.

      Performance reporting and performance forecasts are associated with collecting,
      reviewing, analyzing, and then disseminating the information to the appropriate
      stakeholders. Performance reporting includes status reports - the current project
      condition, progress reports - what has been accomplished to date, and forecasts--
      what is expected or anticipated to occur in the future. The use of project information
      dashboards and balanced scorecards are popular forms of status reporting.

      Earned Value Analysis is also associated with performance reporting (refer to the
      information in Project Cost Management)--it utilizes three key values to assess project
      performance: Planned Value, or PV (also known as BCWS or Budgeted Cost of Work
      Scheduled), Actual Cost, or AC (also known as ACWP or Actual Cost of Work
      Performed), and Earned Value, or EV (also known as BCWP or Budgeted Cost of Work
      Performed). These values are used to calculate Cost Variance (EV - AC = CV), Schedule
      Variance (EV - PV = SV), Cost Performance Index CPI = EV/AC, and Schedule
      Performance Index SPI EV/PV.

Other important Communications Management Terms and Study Items
Communication includes internal communication - within the performing
organization, external communication - with suppliers, the media, the public, formal and
informal communications, vertical - upward and downward communications, horizontal
communications - across organizations, official and unofficial communications, verbal and
non-verbal communications (body language).

Constraints Identified limitations that may obstruct or impede communications.

Assumptions Planning items that are not based in fact and carry some degree of risk.
Assumptions should be validated

Sender-Receiver Model          The basic elements of the model - sender or transmitter,
message, encode message, personality screen, sender's region of experience, receiver,
receiver perception screen, noise, medium (method to convey the message) receiver's
region of experience, receiver decode of message, feedback loop for the message, receiver
personality screen, sender perception screen. For more information refer to chapter 5 of
this work book and chapter 5 of Project Management - A Systems Approach to Planning,
Scheduling, and Controlling.

How it works
The sender prepares or encodes a message to transmit to a receiver. The message passes
through the sender's personality screen, across the region of experience to the receiver.
The message passes through the receiver's perception screen and is then decoded. During
this process the message may become distorted by the common communications barriers
that are present during information exchanges (evaluative tendency, opposing views, poor
listening as examples). To ensure that the message was received as intended it is
recommended that the receiver feedback the message by encoding a response to the
message and sending it back to the originator (transmitter) passing through the receiver's
personality screen, through the region of experience, then through the sender's perception
screen. The message is decoded by the original sender to determine if the message was
sent and received as intended. The model illustrates the potential for distortion of
communicated messages to occur due to common communications.
                                                             PMP(R) AND CAPM(R) EXAM REVIEW   433


Communications Channel Formula: Determines the number of communications
channels present within a project team. Knowledge of communications channels assists in
developing plans to ensure effective communication and minimize potential breakdowns in
communications.
Communications Channels (X) = N (N - 1)/2 where N = number of people on the
project team and X is the number of channels of communication. Communications
channels assume two way communication.

Increasing the number of people on a project team increases the number of channels of
communication that will exist between project team members and increases the potential
for communications issues to develop.

Project Risk Management

Project Risk Management includes the processes of risk management planning,
identification of risks, prioritization of risks through analysis, responding to risks and
controlling risks. Risk management involves the assessment of threats as well as
opportunities and is included in every phase of the project life cycle.

Risk management is justifiable regardless of project size or complexity and should begin at the
start of contract negotiations and continue through project charter development, the project
kick off meeting and in all planning discussions. Risk is always present and the project
manager and team should continually assess project risk and revise or update risk plans.

Project Risk Management Processes
Plan Risk Management           Deciding on the approach to conducting risk management
and managing project risk. Note: There are two primary components of risk--probability
and impact. Urgency is also a factor when planning for risk and determining responses.

    attitude, risk tolerances, Expert judgment - key stakeholders, senior management,
    SMEs, Meetings.

    The planning process will establish the methodologies, role and responsibilities of the
    key stakeholders involved, a budget process for managing risk, and the timing for
    when risk management activities swill occur.

    Key terms Risk appetite - the degree of uncertainty an organization is willing to
    accept, Risk tolerance - the volume and intensity of risk that an organization can
    withstand, Risk threshold - the level of uncertainty or impact that a stakeholder is

Other Important Risk Management Terms and Study Items
Risk Tolerance There are risk seekers, risk averse organizations, and risk neutral
organizations. Risk tolerance is an Enterprise Environmental Factor and is affected by
management's view of risk, the willingness to take risks, and the nature of the business.
The Utility Factor is important - It is a measure of the tolerance for risk: Utility (willingness
to accept risk, work with it and manage it). Utility as it relates to the risk averse
organization rises at a decreasing rate as risk increases. Basically the greater the risk the
less the risk averse person likes it). Utility rises at a faster rate for the risk seeker as risk
intensity increases. Risk seekers thrive on risk opportunities.
Expected Monetary Value The calculated outcome based on the probable outcomes
of a decision or a scenario. It is expressed mathematically as the product of an event's
probability of occurrence and the gain or loss that will result.
Hurwitz and Wald Criterion (Maximax and Maximin) The Hurwitz or maximax
criterion is associated with organizations that have a high tolerance for risk and a "go-for-
broke" attitude. The Wald or maximin criterion is associated with risk averse organizations
who are concerned with the potential loss associated with a decision or action.

Decision Tree Associated with Quantitative Risk Analysis. The decision tree assists in
determining the potential outcomes of specific decisions by considering probability, initial
cost, net path value and expected monetary value of each path. Decision trees assist in
identifying the implications of choosing each of the available alternatives and providing
information to make the best choice.
Brainstorming Gathering risk data from the project team by openly generating ideas and
avoiding assessment of the ideas until the generation of new ideas has been exhausted.
Delphi Technique A process used in decision making and analysis where subject
matter experts are engaged to provide input in an anonymous setting to eliminate bias.
436   CHAPTER TWENTY-FOUR


Nominal Group Technique A form of brainstorming where information is gathered as
a group and the prioritization of items is accomplished through anonymous voting.
Risk Triggers Symptoms and indications that suggest a risk event could occur. It is
important to address risk triggers before a serious risk event occurs.
Probability/Impact Matrix A matrix utilized to establish the value of a risk or establish
a risk rating using the product of probability and impact. Scales may be ordinal (.1.2.3.4.5)
or cardinal (low, moderate, high ratings). The matrix displays an axis for level of
probability and a level for risk impact.
Residual Risk          The remaining value of a risk in terms of probability and impact
after mitigation. Generally there is a cost associated with responding to an identified risk
event. The project budget planning process should also include an assessment of risk
mitigation costs and the contingencies that may be required after mitigation.
Risk Response Strategies The typical responses to risk situations: For threats the
responses are Avoid Transfer Mitigation, Accept. The responses for opportunity are:
Exploit, Enhance, Share, Accept - There are two forms of acceptance: Passive acceptance
means that no specific action will be taken, Active acceptance means a specific
contingency will be planned.
Sensitivity Analysis           A technique used to determine how different values of an
independent variable will impact a particular dependent variable under a given set of
assumptions. This technique is used within specific boundaries that will depend on one or
more input variables, such as the effect that changes in material costs will have on net
present value. Commonly displayed as a "tornado" diagram.
Secondary Risk         Risk generated by the response to a primary risk

Threshold              Amount of risk an organization or key stakeholders are willing to
accept.
Types of Risks Insurable Risk: These risk events are associated with a chance for loss
only. Example: accidents, workman's compensation. Business Risk: These risk events are
associated with a chance for profit or loss Examples: Competition, market conditions, new
product development.
Monte Carlo Process A computer simulation t in which variable data is used to
determine probable outcomes. , When applied to project management the project is
simulated through software by introducing variable data such as optimistic, pessimistic,
and most likely values for activities , Generally this type of simulation (similar to the
throwing of dice) is done many times (the typical default in Monte Carlo software is 1000
simulations) to determine possible outcomes and the probability of achieving a specific
result. Examples: The results may indicate the probability completing a project by a certain
date or at a specified total budget or expenditure. Monte Carlo simulation furnishes the
decision-maker with a range of possible outcomes and provides the data to assist in
making risk decisions.
Workaround             A temporary response to an unplanned event

PROCUREMENT MANAGEMENT
Project procurement includes the processes that will assist in determining the specific
goods or services that must be procured externally from an organization. Procurement
management addresses make or buy decisions, buyer and seller relationships, types of
contracts, and the risks associated with contract types. It also includes contract
negotiations, managing the seller, observing seller / contractor work performance,
managing contract terms and conditions, and closing contracts and procurement activities.

Suggested PMP(R) Exam Study Items:
Remember to review the different types of contracts and the advantages and
disadvantages of each type.

As an example: When selecting the lump sum or Firm Fixed Price Contract (FFP) the risk is
associated with the seller. Use of the Cost Plus Contracts generally shifts the risk to the
buyer.

Contract A Legal document that includes an offer, acceptance, and consideration
(something of value).

         Definitive Contract    The final, agreed upon contract

         Completion Contract The contractor/ supplier/ seller is required to produce a
         specific end product or deliverable

         Term Contract A contract that is intended to deliver a specific level of effort

Make or Buy Decisions The decision to build or fabricate an item internally or to
contract the work to a seller. Make or buy decisions depend on cost, desired level of
control, capability of the buyer's organization, type of deliverable, capacity of the buyer's
organization. Consider the benefits and disadvantages of the make and buy decisions and
the risks that may be associated with the decision.
Bidder Conference A meeting scheduled by the buyer to provide information to all
potential bidders. The meeting provides a "level playing field" for potential contractors.

Negotiation Negotiation requires a specific skill set and is a necessary activity in the
procurement process. There are several negotiation tactics that may be utilized during
discussions and contract development activities. Skillful negotiation includes understanding
the needs of the other parties involved, developing fair and reasonable offers, and
willingness to make concessions, understanding the minimum and maximum allowable
amounts to associate with each element to be received or given during the negotiations.
Hygiene issues such as type of room set up, location, type of tables and positioning of the
parties involved, cultural differences, are included in the total negotiation process.
Special Terms and Conditions Make sure to identify Penalty clauses, liquidated
damages clauses, force majeure clauses (natural disasters, events that cannot be
controlled by the contractor) and other contract terms and conditions that may have a
significant impact on the interests of the parties involved.
Force Majeure            A common clause in contracts which essentially frees both parties
from liability or obligation when an extraordinary event or circumstance beyond the
control of the parties, such as a war, strike, riot, crime, or act of nature occurs (e.g.,
flooding, earthquake, volcano).

Privity         In contract law, privity provides that a contract cannot confer rights or
impose obligations arising under it on any person or agent except the parties to it. Privity is
basically the legal relationship established between the parties through the contract.
Penalty Clause           A provision in a contract that stipulates an excessive pecuniary
charge against a defaulting party. Generally, this is a late fee imposed on a seller if a
milestone is not fulfilled.
Liquidated Damages               A contractually agreed upon amount to be paid in the event
of a breach of the contract, in lieu of performance or quantification of actual damages
sustained.

Contract Types
Firm Fixed Price (FFP) or Lump Sum
Fixed Price Incentive Fee

Cost Plus Incentive Fee (CPIF)
Time and Material
Purchase Order

Cost Plus Percentage of Cost (CPPC)
Cost Plus Fixed Fee (CPFF)
Remember the risks associated with each type of contract and which party or parties are
exposed to the greatest risk. Incentive contracts will include a sharing ratio that is negotiated
between the buyer and seller and is intended to create a desire to manage costs effectively...
440   CHAPTER TWENTY-FOUR


Contract Close-out The process that includes development of punch Lists, verification
of contracted deliverables, formal acceptance or deliverables, post project reviews,
contract reviews.

Termination for Convenience A provision in the contract that allows the project to be
terminated by the buyer for other than performance reasons. Example--the technology is
no longer needed, there are no additional funds to support the project, the buyer
organization has a change in strategic direction.

Termination Due to Default A breach in the agreement by the contractor, failure to
provide what was agreed upon in the contract.

Non Disclosure agreement               A Non-Disclosure Agreement (NDA), also known as a
confidentiality agreement, Confidential Disclosure Agreement (CDA), Proprietary
Information Agreement (PIA), or secrecy agreement, is a legal contract between at least
two parties that outlines confidential materials or knowledge the parties wish to share with
one another for certain purposes, but wish to restrict access to by other parties. It is a
contract through which the parties agree not to disclose information outside of agreed
upon boundaries and restrictions described in the agreement

Fait accompli          An accomplished fact; a thing already done. Commonly referred to
as "a done deal."

Administrative Changes Generally this type of change is for records only and does not
impact the work of the project. Example--changing the account that funds will be drawn
from, address changes.

Constructive Change An action or inaction by a party associated with the project that
impacts the actual work and requires a change to the planned work. There is usually a cost
associated with a constructive change.

Project Reviews At project completion the project manager and team conduct reviews
of the entire project and compare actual results with contractual agreements. Lesson
learned are identified and plans for process improvement are often developed. Project
reviews may be conducted several times during the project life cycle.

       Close-out Punch lists (list of unsatisfactory items prepared by the buyer) are
       prepared, verification of contracted deliverables is conducted, formal acceptance is
       obtained, post project reviews are scheduled and conducted, contract reviews are
       conducted, final payments are made. Project close-out is often referred to as a
       project in itself. It requires planning, coordination, and a specific set of objectives.

Stakeholder Management Identifying the people, organizations, external groups, and
other entities that have an interest in the project or are impacted either positively or

General Note about Outputs to PMBOK(R) Guide Processes
The outputs of the processes associated with each of the PMBOK(R) Guide processes will, in
most cases become inputs to another set of processes. As you read each knowledge area
and the associated processes you will notice a consistent flow of processes from inputs, to
tools and techniques, to outputs. As you progress through the PMBOK(R) Guide you will
notice that many inputs and tools & techniques are repeatedly included in the processes
associated with the knowledge area. This repetition emphasizes the integrative nature of
managing a project. It will also assist you in becoming familiar with the terminology and
the application of the process components.

Professional Responsibility - The domain of professional and social
responsibility is now embedded in the 5 project management domains:
Initiating, Planning, Executing, Monitoring & Controlling and Closing. The exam
is structured to provide questions derived from each process group and many
questions will include references or situations that are associated with ethics,
conduct, legal issues and other factors associated with professional conduct.
The following information will be useful as you study for the exam. As you
study, consider how professional conduct can affect a project outcome and the
many stakeholders involved.
The four elements in the domain previously known as Professional and Social Responsibility:
Ensuring Individual Integrity, Contributing to the Project Management Knowledge Base,
Enhancing Personal and Professional Competence, and Promoting Interaction among
Stakeholders.
Professional Responsibility is closely associated with the PMBOK(R) Guide Knowledge areas:
Human Resource Management and Communications Management. Professional
Responsibility is also associated with diversity, cultural differences, managing in an
international project environment such as sensitivity to time zones, geographic location,
political issues, ethics, ethnic differences and customs are important factors to consider
during project planning and implementation. PMP(R) candidates should include in their
study the issues and sensitivities of managing in an international project environment.
Review the Code of Ethics and Professional Conduct developed by PMI(R) and available at
the PMI(R) website www.pmi.org.
Professional responsibility includes the following subjects. Project managers are expected
to be aware of these items and manage appropriately through all project life cycle phases
and when managing each of the 5 major process groups:
      Ensuring Individual Integrity
      Responsibilities of employers (fairness and respect for employees)
      Accommodating employee needs
      Managing diversity in the workplace
      Complying with federal employment laws
      Dealing ethically with all project stakeholders
      Making ethical business decisions (Honesty and integrity)
      Dealing ethically with employees, customers, and other businesses
      Promoting Interaction Among Stakeholders
      Listening skills
      Understanding and adapting communication styles to manage team effectively (Styles
      may be authoritative, facilitating, judicial, participative)
      Effective negotiation and conflict resolution (balancing stakeholder needs, fair and
      reasonable offers, establishing partnerships)
      Recognizing conflict and managing conflicts effectively to seek a win-win solution
                                                           PMP(R) AND CAPM(R) EXAM REVIEW   443


   Conflict management handling modes: Collaboration, Compromise, Forcing,
   Withdrawing, Smoothing

   Enhancing Personal and Professional Competence               Creating a personal
   development plan for self-improvement and continuous education. Becoming a mentor
   and coach,
   Contributing to the Project Management Knowledge Base                    Documenting
   and sharing lessons learned. Writing articles, books, and presenting information at
   project management events.

   Reminder            The PMP exam will include questions derived from or associated
   with the 5 major process groups: Initiating, Planning, Executing, Monitoring and
   Controlling. These 5 processes integrate the 10 knowledge areas. Professional and
   social responsibility issues are embedded in the 5 process groups.

Project Management Formulas
   The following is a list of formulas that may be associated with PMP(R) exam questions:

   Communications channels X = [(N) x (N-1)] / 2 where X is the number of channels of
   communication and N is the number of people on the team

   PERT Weighted average formula (Optimistic + 4 times the most likely value +
   pessimistic) / 6 - Beta Distribution

   Float - obtained during the forward and backward pass calculations in CPM. Float is the
   difference between the late finish and early finish of an activity. In some situations,
   calculation of float will depend on the logical relationship between activities. Consider
   Finish to Start, Start to Start, and Finish to Finish relationships and the differences
   between early start and late start and early finish and late finish when determining how
   a slippage may impact the project end date. In some cases the float may actually be
   calculated as the difference between the early start and late start of an activity when a
   start to start relationship is used.

   Free Float - The difference between the early start of an activity and the early finish of a
   predecessor activity. Free float is the amount of time an activity can slip before it
   affects its successor activities.

   Standard Deviation          (Pessimistic - Optimistic) / 6

   Net Present Value The sum of the present values minus the initial cost

   Present Value       FV / (1+r) n

   Future Value        PV (1 +r) n

Earned Value Formulas

EV (BCWP) - AC (ACWP) = Cost variance (CV) (a negative cost variance = budget overrun)

EV - PV (BCWS) = Schedule variance (SV) (a negative SV means the project or work
package is behind schedule)

EV/AC (ACWP) = Cost performance index (CPI) (a measure of efficiency in managing the
project budget)
444   CHAPTER TWENTY-FOUR




EV/PV (BCWS) = Schedule performance index (SPI) (a measure of efficiency in managing
the project schedule)

A performance index (PI) that equals 1 means there is no variance and the project or work
package is performing as planned. A PI greater than 1 indicates superior performance. A PI
less than 1 indicates a schedule slippage or a cost overrun.

EAC Estimate at Complete

EAC = AC + BAC -EV where BAC is the Budget at Complete This formula is used when
variances are determined to be atypical and the remaining work will be completed at the
budgeted rate.

EAC = BAC / CPI        Used when current variances are seen as typical and are expected to
continue as the project progresses,

EAC = AC + [BAC - EV] / cumulative CPI x cumulative SPI              Used when project
schedule is a factor impacting the ETC effort (Estimate to Complete)

TCPI = [BAC - EV] / [BAC - AC]       Used when the approved BAC must be met

TCPI = [BAC - EV] / [EAC - AC]       Used when the original BAC cannot be met
                                                          PMP(R) AND CAPM(R) EXAM REVIEW   445

14. You are managing a project for an external client. Your company developed a new
    testing procedure to validate certain properties of a product and the new testing
    procedure was developed entirely with internal funds. Your company owns all of the
    intellectual property rights associated with the new test. The workers that developed
    the new test used one of the components developed for your current customer as part
    of the experimental process. The results using the new test showed that the
    component would actually exceed the customer's expectations. You should:

   a. Show the results to the customer but do not discuss the fact that it came from the
   new test procedure

   b. Do not show the results of the new test procedure since the customer's
   specifications call for use of the old test procedures

   c. Change the customer's specifications first and then show the customer the results

   d. Discuss the release of this information with your legal department and senior
   management before taking any action

15. Using the same scenario as in the previous question, assume that the new test
    procedure that is expected to be more accurate than the old test procedure indicates
    that performance will not meet customer specifications whereas the old test indicates
    that customer specifications will be barely met. You should:

   a. Present the old test results to the customer showing that specification requirements
      will be met

   b. Show both sets of test results and explain that the new procedure is unproven
      technology

   c. Change the customer's specifications first and then show the customer the results

   d. Discuss the release of this information with your legal department and senior
      management before taking any action

16. Your customer has demanded to see the "raw data" test results from last week's
    testing. Usually the test results are not released to customers until after the company
    reaches a conclusion on the meaning of the test results. Your customer has heard from
    the grapevine that the testing showed poor results. Management has left the entire
    decision up to you. You should:

   a. Show the results and explain that it is simply raw data and that your company's
      interpretation of the results will be forthcoming

   b. Withhold the information until after the results are verified

   c. Stall for time even if it means lying to the customer

   d. Explain to the customer your company's policy of not releasing raw data

17. One of your team members plays golf with your external customer's project manager.
    You discover that the employee has been feeding the customer company-sensitive
    information. You should:

   a. Inform the customer that project information from anyone other than the project
      manager is not official until released by the project manager

   b. Change the contractual terms and conditions and release the information
484     CHAPTER TWENTY-FOUR

         the company when not at work, then report this as a violation

18. Your company has a policy that all company-sensitive material must be stored in
    locked filing cabinets at the end of each day. One of your employees has received
    several notices from the security office for violating this policy. You should:

      a. Reprimand the employee

      b. Remove the employee from your project

      c. Ask the Human Resources Group to have the employee terminated

      d. Counsel the employee as well as other team members on the importance of
         confidentiality and the possible consequences for violations

19. You have just received last month's earned value information that must be shown to
    the customer in the monthly status review meeting. Last month's data showed
    unfavorable variances that exceeded the permissible threshold limits on time and cost
    variances. This was the result of a prolonged power outage in the manufacturing area.
    Your manufacturing engineer tells you that this is not a problem and next month you
    will be right on target on time and cost as you have been in the last five months. You
    should:

      a. Provide the data to the customer and be truthful in the explanation of the variances

      b. Adjust the variances so that they fall within the threshold limits since this problem
         will correct itself next month

      c. Do not report any variances this month

      d. Expand the threshold limits on the acceptable variances but do not tell the
         customer

20. You are working in a foreign country where it is customary for a customer to present
    gifts to the contractor's project manager throughout the project as a way of showing
    appreciation. Declining the gifts would be perceived by the customer as an insult. Your
    company has a policy on how to report gifts received. The best way to handle this
    situation would be to:

      a. Refuse all gifts

      b. Send the customer a copy of our company's policy on accepting gifts

      c. Accept the gifts and report the gifts according to policy

      d. Report all gifts even though the policy says that some gifts need not be reported

21. You are interviewing a candidate to fill a project management position in your
    company. On his resume, he states that he is a PMP(R). One of your workers who knows
    the candidate informs you that he is not a PMP(R) yet but is planning to take the test next
    month and certainly expects to pass. You should:

      a. Wait until he passes the exam before interviewing him
                                                            PMP(R) AND CAPM(R) EXAM REVIEW   485


   b. Interview him and ask him why he lied

   c. Inform PMI(R) of the violation

   d. Forget about it and hire him if he looks like the right person for the job

22. You are managing a multinational project from your office in Chicago. Half of your
    project team are from a foreign country but are living in Chicago while working on your
    project. These people inform you that two days during next week are national religious
    holidays in their country and they will be observing the holiday by not coming into
    work. You should:

   a. Respect their beliefs and say nothing

   b. Force them to work because they are in the United States where their holiday is not
      celebrated

   c. Tell them that they must work noncompensated overtime when they return to work
      in order to make up the lost time

   d. Remove them from the project team if possible

23. PMI(R) informs you that one of your team members who took the PMP(R) exam last week
    and passed may have had the answers to the questions in advance provided to him by
    some of your other team members who are also PMP(R)s and were tutoring him. PMI(R) is
    asking for your support in the investigation. You should:

   a. Assist PMI(R) in the investigation of the violation

   b. Call in the employee for interrogation and counseling

   c. Call in the other team members for interrogation and counseling

   d. Tell PMI(R) that it is their problem, not your problem

24. One of your team members has been with you for the past year since his graduation
    from college. The team member informs you that he is now a PMP(R) and shows you his
    certificate from PMI(R) acknowledging this. You wonder how he was qualified to take the
    exam since he had no prior work experience prior to joining your company one year
    ago. You should:

   a. Report this to PMI(R) as a possible violation

   b. Call in the employee for counseling

   c. Ask the employee to surrender his PMP(R) credentials

   d. Do nothing

25. Four companies have responded to your RFP. Each proposal has a different technical
    solution to your problem and each proposal states that the information in the proposal
    is company-proprietary knowledge and not to be shared with anyone. After evaluation
    of the proposals, you discover that the best technical approach is from the highest
    bidder. You are unhappy about this. You decide to show the proposal from the highest
    bidder to the lowest bidder to see if the lowest bidder can provide the same technical
    solution but at a lower cost. This situation is:
486     CHAPTER TWENTY-FOUR


      a. Acceptable since once the proposals are submitted to your company, you have
         unlimited access to the intellectual property in the proposals

      b. Acceptable since all companies do this

      c. Acceptable as long as you inform the high bidder that you are showing their
         proposal to the lowest bidder

          CHALLENGING AND ENGAGING
           QUESTIONS AND EXERCISES

 Logic problems are a unique way of learning how to apply project management
 principles to project situations. They are enjoyable and entertaining. Include these
 problems in your project management studies to enhance the learning experience.


How to Solve Logic Problems1

To solve logic problems, the wording in the clues must be read carefully. All of the
necessary information is provided in the clues, and trial-and-error solutions are not
necessary. The problems can be solved with simple logic. In some cases, grids are
provided. Below is the technique for solving the grid problems.

Sample Logic Problem:

Three married couples live in three different cities and each couple has a different number
of children. The husbands are Alfred, Dirk, and Mickey. The wives are Annette, Barbara,
and Cathy but not necessarily married to the husbands according to the order of the
husbands' names. The three cities in which the couples live are Boston, Chicago, and
Denver, and the numbers of children are one, two, and three. In completing the table
below, we will use a "*" to signify "yes" and an "X" to signify "No."

Clues:

1. Barbara and Mickey are a couple but do not live in Chicago.
2. One of the couples which does not include Annette live in Boston with their three children.
3. Alfred and his wife live in Denver; they have more than one child.
4. Cathy's husband's first name begins with an initial that appears later in the alphabet
   than Cathy's first name initial

490 CHAPTER TWENTY-FIVE


Explanation:

From clue 1, Barbara and Mickey are husband and wife. So, a "*" can be placed at the
intersection and the other cells have an "X." Likewise, because they do not live in Chicago,
we can place an "X" in that location as well, and any other locations that relate Barbara or
Mickey to Chicago. This is shown in the figure below.




With clue 2, we can signify a "Yes" in the box that signifies the intersection of Boston and
three children, and also a "No" for the Annette location in that column. This is shown
below.




Using clue 3, we can place a "Yes" in the intersection of Alfred and Denver, and the
corresponding cells will then have a "No" response. We can also eliminate the one child
cell from the Alfred row and the Denver column. The result is shown below.
                                    CHALLENGING AND ENGAGING QUESTIONS AND EXERCISES     491




Now notice that in the cells that relate Husbands and Cities, we know that Dirk must reside
in Chicago and Mickey must reside in Boston. Also, Mickey must live in Boston with three
children. The results are shown below.
492 CHAPTER TWENTY-FIVE


We also know from this figure that the city in which the couple has two children is Denver.
This is represented in the figure below.




Now using clue 4, we know that Cathy cannot be married to Alfred. Therefore, we can
complete the figure as shown below.




We now know the solution to the problem:
* Alfred and Annette live in Denver with two children.
* Mickey and Barbara live in Boston with three children.
* Dirk and Cathy live in Chicago with one child.
                                     CHALLENGING AND ENGAGING QUESTIONS AND EXERCISES          493


Sometimes, you may have to go back over the clues a second or third time to extract more
information. However, guessing is never required and logic must prevail.

For other types of logic problems, the difficulty is in knowing which clue or clues to start
with. Since this may be more complex, hints are provided to assist you.

Now it's your turn to demonstrate your decision-making skills. Good luck!

Logic Problem #1: Types of Contracts

In the figure below are six different contract types for six different project managers. From
the clues under the figure, determine the contract type for each project manager and their
position in the figure. Knowledge of each type of contract is essential to solve the problem.

Project Manager:       Jane, Richard, Paul, Frank, Tim, Alice

Contract Type: Cost-Plus-Percentage-of-Cost (CPPC), Firm-Fixed-Price
               (FFP), Cost-Plus-Incentive-Fee (CPIF), Fixed-Price-
               Incentive-Fee (FPIF), Cost-Plus-Fixed-Fee (CPFF),
               Time & Materials (T & M)




Clues:

1. The contract type, which today is illegal in the government, is located in position 4 in the
   diagram.
2. Tim's project has a contract that contains a "ceiling" and "floor" on profits.
3. Alice's contract is in an even-numbered position in the diagram.
4. The two incentive-type contracts are located in different rows in the figure and
   horizontally adjacent to only one other contract and both of the adjacent contracts are
   for projects managed by female project managers.
5. Frank's project, which is not in position 3, and Richard's project are not adjacent to each
   other either horizontally or vertically, and are located in different rows.
                                                                       (continued on next page)
494 CHAPTER TWENTY-FIVE


6. The contract type with the maximum risk exposure to the seller is to the right (as you
   look at the figure) and next to the Cost-Plus contract where the fee is defined as a dollar
   value rather than as a percentage, and above the contract type that contains a "Point of
   Total Assumption" term.


Logic Problem #2: The Mysterious Network Diagram

A project manager discovers that his team has neglected to complete the network diagram
for the project. The network diagram is shown below. However, the project manager has
some information available, specifically that each activity, labeled A-G, has a different
duration between one and seven weeks. Also, the slack time for each of the activities is
known as shown below.

Duration (weeks):      1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7

Slack time (weeks): 0, 0, 0, 2, 4, 4, 7




Using the clues provided below, determine the duration of each activity as well as the early
start, early finish, latest start, and latest finish times for each activity.


Clues:

1. Activity E is on the critical path.
2. The early start time (ES) for Activity F is five weeks.
3. The duration of Activity B is seven weeks.
4. Activity D has four weeks of slack, but Activity F has the greatest amount of slack.
5. The early finish time (EF) for Activity G is seventeen weeks.
6. The latest finish time (LF) for Activity E is thirteen weeks.

The critical path is 13 weeks. Activity F has an early finish time of eleven weeks, but Activity F
cannot be on the critical path because there is only one critical path and Activity E is on the
critical path. Therefore, Activity G must have a duration of one week. We now know ES, EF,
LS, and LF for Activity E. Because Activity F has an EF of eleven weeks, the durations of
Activities C and F must be eleven weeks, and therefore five and six weeks. Activity C must be
five weeks to align with the ES of five in Activity E. If Activity C were six weeks in duration,
the length of the critical path could not be thirteen weeks. Using clue 3, and knowing that LF
                                        CHALLENGING AND ENGAGING QUESTIONS AND EXERCISES     499


of Activity D must be twelve weeks, the duration of Activity D must be three weeks. Using
clue 4, which tells us that Activity A has only one week of slack, and knowing that the LF for
activity A is five weeks, the duration of Activity A must be four weeks.

  B              7          0       7       0       7

  F              1          5      6       12      13
  G              4         13      17      13      17

From the clues, Activities A, C, and E have slack. Activity F must also have slack since
Activity C is on a path with it. Therefore, the critical path must be B-D-G. Since Activity C
has eight weeks of slack, Activity F must also have eight weeks of slack which means, by
elimination, that Activity A has six weeks of slack and the duration for Activity A must be
four weeks. From clue 1, the critical path, which must have three and only three activities in
it, must be the numbers five, six, and seven, and equal to eighteen weeks. From clue 5, the
duration for Activity F must be three weeks and Activity C must be one week. Therefore,
Activity E must be two weeks in duration. Now we can calculate ES, EF, LS, and LF for
Activities C and F. Since the length of the critical path is eighteen weeks, we now know
that the duration of Activity G must be six weeks. After calculating ES, EF, LS, and LF for
Activity E, we know that the duration of Activity B must be seven weeks.


Challenging Questions and Scenarios


The PMP(R) exam and the CAPM(R) exam will include several questions regarded as
"challenging" and scenario based. These are questions where a situation is provided and
the basic question asks "What should the project manager do next?" or "What will most
likely happen next? Or "What tool would be most appropriate to use? Consider the
following examples. They will assist you in your exam preparation and help to further
enhance your existing project management skills.

The following questions are designed to improve your ability to assess a situation from a
project manager's perspective and determine the most appropriate response or action.

Example #1: You hire a contractor to perform several activities on your project. After a
period of time, the contractor informs you that they are running late. What should the
project manager do next? Your choices are:

    a. Call a meeting with the contractor

    b. Call a meeting with the executives in the contractor's company

    c.     Look at the penalty clauses in the contract

    d. Implement the risk management plan
500 CHAPTER TWENTY-FIVE


On the surface, it appears that you could argue any of the answers as being the correct
answer. That's because we have a tendency to make assumptions and read things into the
wording of the question, things that aren't there. The correct answer is to call a meeting
with the contractor. After all, you cannot make a decision without gathering the facts first,
and having a meeting with the contractor allows you to gather the facts.

Example #2: Let's use the same scenario as in Example #1, but in this case the contractor
informs you that they have no chance of catching up on the schedule. In this case, you
might be able to justify any of the four answers, but some additional information may need
to be provided to differentiate between the answers. If no additional information is
provided, then implementing the risk management plan may be correct.

For each of the following questions, pick the correct answer assuming the question asks,
"What should the project manager do next?"

1. One of your contractors is running late and presents to you a plan to get back on
   schedule. The plan calls for running 10 test rather than 15 tests that are called out in the
   contractual requirements plan. The contractor believes this will save you money as well.

    a. Agree to it quickly to maintain the schedule and reduce costs

    b. Ask your sponsor to make the decision

    c. Tell the contractor that you cannot violate requirements

    d. Ask the contractor to put it in writing and present the recommendation to the
       change control board.

2. Your project is behind schedule. You just learned that another project in the company
   is further behind schedule than your project and senior management has instructed the
   functional managers to remove some of the resources from your project to see if they
   can be of assistance on the other project.

    a. Begin looking at contingency plans and alternatives

    b. Meet with the executives and plead your case

    c. Meet with the functional managers and plead your case

    d. Ask your customer to plead your case with the executives

3. Paula is an important member of your project team. Paula informs you that the
   company approved her application for tuition reimbursement to attend the MBA
   Program at a local university. Most of the courses are in the evenings, but there may be
   one or two courses that meet in the mornings twice a week. You must sign off on this
   request because it could impact your project.

    a. Refuse to let Paula attend the program until the project is completed

    b. Let Paula attend the program but replace her as a member of the project team as
       quickly as possible

    c. Discuss with Paula the options for attending class and still maintaining her
       performance on the project team

   d. Let the project sponsor make the final decision

4. You hire a contractor to work on your project. In order for the contractor to perform
   correctly, your team must exchange some company proprietary information with the
   contractor. To make sure this flows smoothly you should:

   a. Personally brief the team on the techniques for disclosing proprietary information

   b. Ask the sponsor to debrief the team on the company's policy for disclosing
      proprietary information

   c. Ask a representative from the legal group or whoever is the company expert in
      proprietary information to make the presentation

   d. Ask the team to read the confidentiality agreement that was part of the contract

5. You have asked the team to voluntarily work a significant amount of overtime to
   maintain the project's schedule. You discover that one of the members of the team
   inadvertently used the wrong lot of raw materials during a production run and all of the
   units produced had to be thrown away. The loss was $75,000 and the production run
   had to be redone. Management has convened a meeting with you and the team to
   discuss what went wrong and who should be blamed.

   a. At the beginning of the meeting, you should take personal responsibility for what
      happened without disclosing the name of the person who made the mistake.

   b. At the beginning of the meeting, you should take personal responsibility what
      happened and identify the person who made the mistake

   c. Say nothing. Let the executives run the meeting and see what develops.

   d. Ask the team member who made the mistake to immediately step forward and
      explain what happened.

6. You are working on a firm-fixed-price contract. At the end of the first month, you
   provide the client with project performance reports that were generated from your
   enterprise project management methodology. The format of each report is
   standardized and used on all contracts. The client informs you that they want the
   reports modified to better fit their needs. There is a significant cost for modifying the
   reports and you are unsure as to whether the client would be willing to pay for the
   modifications.

   a. Submit a change request to the client asking for payment for the modification. If
      the client refuses to pay, then refuse to make the modifications.

   b. Make the modifications and then submit a change request to the client for
      payment.

   c. Refuse to make the changes since you already have a signed contract.

   d. Ask your sponsor for advice in this matter. There may be other factors such as
      enterprise environmental factors that you may not know about.

7. During an interface meeting with the client, one of your highly competent team
   members acts in an arrogant and disruptive manner to the point where the customer
   becomes upset. After the interface meeting is over, the customer requests that this
   person be removed from the project team so that the customer will no longer have to
   interface with this person.
502 CHAPTER TWENTY-FIVE


     a. Grant the customer's request and remove the person from the team.

     b. Counsel the person and see if there is a way that he can change his behavior.

     c. Explain the situation to the sponsor and ask for advice.

     d. Talk to the functional manager first to see if a replacement exists in case this
        person must be removed.

 8. After an interface meeting with the client from a foreign country, you and your wife
    along with the client and his wife are dining at an elegant restaurant celebrating how
    successfully the project is progressing thus far. During dinner, the client's wife presents
    your wife with a gift of jewelry. The gift is composed of precious stones native to the
    client's country. You company has a policy that all gifts under $1000 need not be
    reported. You believe that this gift is less than $1000 in value, but you are unsure.

     a. Refuse to accept the gift since it may violate company policy

     b. Accept the gift but do not report the gift since it was given to your wife rather than
        you.

     c. Accept the gift and report it to your company even though you do not believe its
        value is over the $1000 limit

     d. Explain the gift acceptance policy to you client and tell him that you cannot accept
        the gift until after discussions with your legal department.

 9. Your external client has assigned an onsite representative to monitor the
    performance of the contract. All reports are provided to the onsite representative who
    reviews the reports for accuracy and then forwards the reports to his parent
    company. After reviewing one of the reports, the onsite representative asks you to
    make changes to one of the reports by including some false statements. The false
    statements will make the onsite representative look good in the eyes of his boss.

     a. Make the changes as long as no damage is done to the project but do not leave an
        audit trail of what happened.

     b. Make the changes and prepare an audit trail in case questions arise in the future.

     c. Refuse to make the changes.

     d. Discuss this with your sponsor and possibly corporate legal before responding to
        the onsite representative.

10. During project staffing activities, one of the functional managers informs you that she
    will not have available all of the resources she would need for your project when you
    need the resources because of resource requirements for other projects. When the
    project was initially approved, she estimated that she would use 8 people and they
    would be available at the right time. Now, because some of the other projects are
    delayed, she has only 5 people available.

     a. Send her a memo demanding the 8 people she promised you.

     b. Ask for a meeting with her to discuss options and contingency plans.

     c. Ask your sponsor to step in and get you the resources you need.
                                     CHALLENGING AND ENGAGING QUESTIONS AND EXERCISES       503


   d. Delay the start date of the project until you have firm commitments from all
      functional managers.


Answers to Challenging Questions:

1. The correct answer is d. Any and all changes to the scope baseline should be in writing
   and approved by the change control board.

2. The correct answer is a. This is reality in project management. Before asking for help
   from above, you must assess the risks to your project and see what options or
   contingency plans are available.

3. The correct answer is c. Project managers must show a concern for people and help
   them satisfy their personal needs and ambitions. You must first discuss this with Paula
   to make sure that she can still perform her job as expected.

4. The correct answer is c. Project managers are not always professionally trained in the
   legalities of protecting proprietary information. Whoever the expert is in the company
   should brief the team on the protocols.

5. The correct answer is a. You created the problem by asking people to work extensive
   overtime. Extensive overtime is an invitation for mistakes. Project managers should try
   to protect the people on their team when mistakes are made. Answer a is what the
   project manager should do first to diffuse the situation. Of course, senior management
   may wish to dig deeper.

6. The correct answer is d. Your sponsor may view this as goodwill and desire to absorb
   the cost internally. Your sponsor may ask you to submit a change request to the client.
   But the first step would be to approach the sponsor for advice to make sure you
   understand all of the ramifications.

7. The correct answer is d, but answer b runs a close second. Project managers may not
   have the authority to remove someone from the project team without support from the
   functional manager. In any event, there must be a replacement.

8. The correct answer is c. It can never be wrong to report the gift to your company and
   let them tell you how to proceed.

9. The correct answer is d. This is a situation where your sponsor and corporate legal
   should be involved before you take any action. You need allies and there may be a
   company policy already established on how to handle these types of situations.

10. The correct answer is b. The first step should be to discuss this with the functional
   manager that controls the resources.

Matching (Memory Jogger) Exercises


Memory jogger and matching the terms exercises provide you with an opportunity to "flex"
your brain and help you to recall the connection between terminology, acronyms, and
processes. You may have noticed that the "language" of project management is unique and
it is helpful to become very familiar with the lexicon used by most project managers.

The following items are three matching terms or memory jogger exercises. In each exercise,
select a letter from the right hand column that best matches the left hand column. Although
it may appear that more than one answer is correct, select one and only one answer. At the
end of the exercise, make sure that each of the letters A - U appears once and only once. You
may wish to review the PMBOK(R) Guides dictionary of terms for precise definitions.

Crashing the Schedule Exercises


Crashing the Schedule (Part 1)

1. Your client has asked you to look at the additional cost for compressing the schedule
   by a given number of weeks. The information you need is shown below in Exhibits 1
   and 2. First, complete the network diagram below by determining the earliest and latest
   start and finish times, as well as the critical path:

3. Using the data in the above table, what is the total normal cost for the project?

4. If the client wants the project completed in 29 weeks rather than 30 weeks, how much
   additional cost will be expended and which activities are crashed and by how many
   weeks?

5. If the client wants the project completed in 28 weeks rather than 30 weeks, how much
   additional cost will be expended and which activities are crashed and by how many
   weeks?

6. If the client wants the project completed in 27 weeks rather than 30 weeks, how much
   additional cost will be expended and which activities are crashed and by how many weeks?

Crashing the Schedule (Part 2)

1. Part 2 is a continuation of Part 1. Use the same data from Part 1. Let's assume that the
   client wants the project done in the shortest possible time. Crash all the activities to
   their maximum compression time and identify the critical path.

4. Activity C is the lowest crashing cost per week activity on the critical path. Compress it
   by 1 week at an additional cost of $1500. Activity B has a lower crashing cost per week
   than Activity C but it is not on the critical path.

5. You must crash Activity C by 2 weeks for an additional cost of $3000.

6. You must crash Activity C by 3 weeks at an additional cost of $4500.

7. You must crash Activity C by 4 weeks at an additional cost of $6000.

8. Activity C can be crashed for only 4 weeks. Therefore, you must crash Activity E by 1
   week at an additional cost of $8000. Activity E is crashed because it is cheaper than
   Activity A.

Crashing the Schedule (Part 2)

1. The critical path is now 22 weeks rather than 30 weeks, and there is a new critical path.

2. Activities A and D are on the new critical path and therefore had to be crashed to the
   maximum. Activities B, C and E are not on the critical path and have some slack.

   For the activities that are not on the critical path, namely Activities B, C and E, they may
   not need to be crashed. To determine whether or not they need to be crashed, at least
   from a financial point of view, you must be willing to allow multiple critical paths to
   exist. Therefore, by working backwards, determine the cheapest way to allow the paths
   B-E and A-C-E to be 22 weeks in length. It is possible that an activity may not need to
   be crashed at all, thus saving money. There are algorithms for these calculations but
   more often than not they are trial and error solutions.

   Out of the remaining activities, B, C and E, Activity E is the most expensive to crash.
   Therefore you must look at ways to minimize the cost of crashing. Since Activity E has
   two weeks of slack according to the answer to Question #1, then Activity E can be
   crashed from 11 weeks to 8 weeks only thus saving $4000. If we do this, then Activity B
   does not have to be crashed at all.

   There are other types of problems where eliminating slack in Activities B and C may be
   the cheapest way to do a maximum compression. But this is not the case for this
   problem.

5. We generally assume linearity, but it is entirely possible that crashing the first week will
   be $1000 and crashing the second week will be $3000 because the compression of the
   second week is more difficult than the compression of the first week. However, most
   people just use linearity in making the calculations.

2. Activity B has 4 weeks of slack. There is no impact on the end date.

3. If Activity F slips by 3 weeks, then both Activities F and G are now critical path activities
   and there are two critical paths in the network.

4. Activity H has the most, 6 weeks of slack. If Activity H were to slip by more than 6
   weeks, then the new critical path would be A-C-H.

Earned Value Problems


Earned value analysis provides the project manager and the key stakeholders to assess
the condition or "health" of a project by determining the level of variance from the
scheduled work and budgeted cost of project activities. The three main elements for
determining the condition of the project are: Planned Value (work that was scheduled to
be accomplished) Earned Value (the planned budget for the work that was accomplished)
and the Actual Cost (the amount paid for the work that was accomplished). Typically
Earned Value Analysis is reported in dollars or other currency but other methods of
measurement can be used. Review chapter 15 in the workbook or in the 11th edition of
Project Management - A Systems Approach to Planning, Scheduling, and Closing for
detailed information about Earned Value Management.

The following problems will provide you with practice in the use of Earned Value
Analysis

A small contractor wins a contract to lay tiles on the floors of all 40 offices in a small office
complex. All 40 offices are the same dimensions. The contractor expects to work five days
per week and to complete one office per day. The duration of the project is expected to be
eight weeks. Labor is estimated at $1000 per day. The raw material costs were paid by the
client and are not part of the contract.

The customer has asked for an earned value report to be prepared at the end of the 6th
week of the project. At the end of the 6th week of the project 24 offices had been completed
at a cost of $27,000. This included a freak accident where the tiles for two of the offices had
to be removed and replaced. Answer the following questions using the formulas below for
the end of week 6 report:

 1. SV($) = EV - PV

 2. CV($) = EV - AC

 3. EAC = (AC / EV) x BAC = BAC / CPI

 4. VAC = BAC - EAC

 5. ETC = EAC - AC

 6. SV(%) = SV($) / PV

 7. CV(%) = CV($) / EV

 8. CPI = EV / AC

 9. SPI = EV / PV

10. EV = % COMPLETE x BAC, or % COMPLETE = EV / BAC

11. % MONEY SPENT = AC / BAC

12. NEW TIME = ORIGINAL TIME / SPI

Earned Value Questions

1. What is PV?

2. What is EV?

3. What is AC?

4. What is BAC?

5. What is SV($)?

6. What is CV($)?

7. What is EAC?

8. What is ETC?

9. What is VAC?

10. What is the % complete?

11. What is the % money spent?

12. What is CPI?

13. What is SPI?

14. If the critical path is the duration of the project, 8 weeks, then what is the new time to
    complete the project?

15. What are the values for SV(%) and CV(%) and how are they actually used during status
    reporting?

16. There are often multiple formulas that can be use to express some of the earned value
    elements. Formula 3 was used to calculate the estimated cost at completion (EAC). In
    that formula, (AC / EV) is the rate at which you are burning or spending money. But
    what if the freak accident that occurred was a one-time occurrence? It may be better to
    use another formula for EAC. Use the formula below for EAC and compare your results
    to your answer to Question 7.

    EAC = [Actual to date] + [all remaining work and work in progress to be completed as
       planned.]

17. Most earned value calculations are based upon labor hours and labor dollars rather,
    and do not consider the cost of materials. If materials are considered, there are
    separate earned value calculations for materials, such as procurement of raw materials,
    and then the earned value calculations for materials and labor are added together to
    get a complete picture of the project's health. What is the main issue with using earned
    value for procurement?


Earned Value Answers

1. PV was estimated at 30 offices completed at the end of the 6th week for a labor cost of
   $30,000.
522 CHAPTER TWENTY-FIVE


2. EV is based upon only 24 offices being completed for a cost $24,000.

3. AC is $27,000.

4. BAC is 40 offices at $1000 each for a cost of $40,000.

5. SV from Formula 1 = $24,000 - $30,000 = <$6000>.

6. CV from Formula 2 = $24,000 - $27,000 = <$3000>.

7. EAC from Formula 3 = ($27,000/$24,000) x $40,000 = $45,000

8. ETC from Formula 5 = $45,000 - $27,000 = $18,000 to finish the work.

9. VAC from Formula 4 = $40,000 - $45,000 = <$5000>.

10. % complete from Formula 10 = ($24,000 / $40,000) x 100% = 60%. This is not good
    because you had planned to be 75% complete by this time.

11. % money spent from Formula 11 = ($27,000 / $40,000) x 100% = 67.5%. You have spent
    67.5% of the money and completed 60% of the work.

12. CPI from Formula 8 = $24,000 / $27,000 = 0.88

13. SPI from Formula 9 = $24,000 / $30,000 = 0.80

14. Using Formula 12, New Time = 8 weeks / 0.80 = 10 weeks. You will finish 2 weeks late.

15. Using Formulas 6 and 7, SV(%) = <20%> and CV(%) = <12.5%>. This indicates that you
    are behind schedule by 20% and over budget by 12.5%. CV(%) is used frequently for
    status reporting, especially if your company's project management methodology
    requires that an exception report be prepared if you are above or below a certain
    financial envelop, but SV(%) has limitations. Although a negative SV(%) indicates that
    you are behind schedule, it may be the result of activities that are not on the critical
    path and the original end date may still be workable. If you prepared a schedule where
    activities that were not on the critical path were assumed to start as early as possible,
    you could be using up slack without altering the critical path.

16. Assuming you have 16 offices left to complete, EAC = $27,000 + $16,000, or $43,000.
    This is $2000 less than your answer to Question 7 and probably closer to the true EAC.

17. The main issue is in the determinate of EV for raw materials. EV can be calculated
    when the materials are ordered, when they are received, when they are placed in
    inventory, when they are used or when they are paid for. The number of choices for
    calculating EV makes it a little complicated for standard earned value calculations.

A company is undertaking a project internal to their organization. Only one functional
department will be involved and the functional manager has estimated that 10,000 hours
will be required to complete the work. The project is scheduled to begin in two weeks. The
functional manager states that he has six people already selected to be assigned to your
project, and their average hourly pay rate is $44.80. The functional pay grade system for
the department is shown below. The overhead rate for this department is 125%.

1. What is the fully burdened cost for completing the 10,000 hours of work?

2. Senior management has approved the budget for your project according to your
   answer to Question 1. Unfortunately, the start date of the project had been delayed by
   three months and the functional manager does not know who he will be able to assign.
   How will you now price out the 10,000 hours?

3. Assume the functional manager tells you that he will assign two Grade 6 workers, two
   Grade 7 workers and two Grade 8 workers but is unsure exactly who they will be. How
   will you price out the 10,000 hours now?

4. Assume that the functional manager tells you that he will assign Grade 8 and Grade 9
   workers only, but is not sure about how many from each of the pay grades. How will
   you price out the 10,000 hours now?

5. If you compare your answers to the above four questions, what are your conclusions?


Estimating the Budget at Completion Answers

1. The fully burdened cost will be $1,120,000.

2. Using weighted averages, the weighted average salary would be

   4($36.20) + 7($45.40) + 5($49.10) + 6($58.25) = $48.07

                         22

   The fully loaded cost of 10,000 hours at this rate = $1,201,818

3. Using weighted averages, the weighted average salary would be:

   2($36.20) + 2($45.40) + 2($49.10) = $45.57

                     6

   The fully loaded cost of 10,000 hours at this rate = $1,089,166

4. Using weighted averages again, the weighted average salary would be:

     5($49.10) + 6($58.25) = $54.09

                    11

          The fully loaded cost of 10,000 hours at this rate = $1,352,273

5. The most accurate budgetary estimates are made from the actual salaryof the workers
   to be assigned. If weighted averaging of salaries is used, then the project manager
   must be prepared to tell senior management that the budget they approved at the
   initiation stage of the project may have to be adjusted.


Decision Trees


To be an effective project manager, you must know how to solve problems and make
decisions. There are several factors that influence decision making such as the number of
alternatives, the favorable or unfavorable result of each alternative, the probabilities
assigned to each alternative, the risk associated with each alternative, and enterprise
environmental factors that may not be able to be quantified but identify possible
opportunities and threats. Most executives prefer a discussion regarding your decision
explained to them in financial terms. Fortunately there are tools that can be used such as
expected monetary value (EMV) and decision tree analysis.

Calculating the EMV for each possible decision path is a way to quantify each decision in
monetary terms. EMV and decision trees can be used throughout the project's life cycle but
they are most frequently used as part of Project Risk Management. As an example, you
conduct a SWOT Analysis to determine whether an idea is worth pursuing. Unfortunately,
there may be a lack of sufficient data to reach a decision. Decision tree analysis is a means
by which you can quantify the data that exists, arrive at a decision, and convince
management that your decision is worth considering.

Decision tree analysis is a four step process usually accomplished in the following order:

   1. Prepare a decision tree outlining all decisions that are required

   2. Assign a probability of occurrence to the risk, impact or outcome of that decision

   3. Assign a monetary value to the risk, impact or outcome of that decision should it
      occur

   4. Calculate the EMV for each decision that must be made

There are three standard symbols or nodes that are commonly used in decision tree
diagrams:

   *   Decision nodes commonly represented by a rectangle

   *   Chance nodes commonly represented by a circle

   *   Outcome nodes commonly represented by a triangle


Problem 1:

For the past several years, your company has been purchasing a product from a supplier and
selling it to your customers at a somewhat lower price than your customers could get by
purchasing it directly from your supplier. Although you have made money doing this, your
customers believe that the quality of the product can be improved. Your supplier has
indicated that they have no plans to improve the quality of the product in the near term.
Management in your company wants to know if the idea of purchasing some equipment and
manufacturing it yourself to improve quality will increase profits over the next year. The
purchase price of the necessary equipment is $500,000 and training your workers will required
an added cost of $100,000. Your marketing team says that the chances of a good market for
the product next year is 60% and the chances of a poor market are 40%. If you manufacture
the product yourself and improve the quality of the product, you estimate that a good market
will generate $1,000,000 in gross revenue and a poor market will bring in $200,000. If you
continue selling the product provided by your supplier, a good market will generate $300,000
in gross revenue and a poor market will bring in $50,000. The procurement costs associated
with working with your supplier are estimated at $30,000 yearly.
The decision tree for this problem is shown in Exhibit 1. The decision to be made is
whether to manufacture it yourself or continue purchasing the product from your supplier.
Decision trees are analyzed from right to left. First, we must calculate the EMV at chance
nodes A and B:

       EMVA= (60% * $1,000,000) + (40% * $200,000) = $680,000

       EMVB = (60% * $300,000) + (40% * $50,000) = $200,000
Looking at these two amounts, it appears that significantly more revenue is generated by
manufacturing it ourselves. But this is not necessarily the best choice because we must
subtract our costs from the gross revenue in order to arrive at profits. We must continue
working from right to left and calculate EMV for decision node C.

       EMVMANUFACTURING = $680,000 - $600,000 = $80,000

       EVMPURCHASING = $200,000 - $30,000 = $170,000
Therefore, in this example here, the best decision for next year appears to be the
continuation of purchasing the components from our supplier and selling them to our
customers.
Even though the example provided in Exhibit 1 is relatively simple, there are modifications
that could be made to this problem:

   *   Rather than using a good or poor market for the product, we could use optimistic,
       most likely and pessimistic outcomes such as with a beta distribution, or we could
       use the triangular distribution. This adds some complexity to the problem.
526 CHAPTER TWENTY-FIVE


   *   The probabilities of good and poor occurring when manufacturing the product
       could be different than the probabilities for purchasing the product. For example,
       with a higher quality product, the probabilities of a good market might be 80% or
       90%. In the above example, If the probabilities of a good/poor market for
       manufacturing are 80% and 20%, and the probabilities of a good/poor market using
       procurement remain the same at 60% and 40%, then the EMV for manufacturing
       would be $240,000 and would be the better choice.

   *   The probabilities could be based upon the chances of a specific revenue stream
       occurring rather than the chances of the market being good or poor.

   *   In the example in Exhibit 1, the best decision was purchasing the product from a
       supplier. But if we consider the profitability over several years with the cost of the
       equipment and training spread over several years, purchasing the equipment now
       may be the better choice.

   *   Additional decision points can be included such as whether or not to conduct a
       marketing survey on market demand should we decide to manufacture the product.
       There can be several decision points in one decision tree diagram.

   *   Exhibit 1 did not consider the cost of raw material procurement as an addition
       expense when manufacturing a product.

   *   The final decision is highly dependent upon the accuracies of the probabilities and
       impacts.

   *   In many situations the EMV calculation can indicate negative numbers.

   *   The more assumptions we make and the more scenarios that are added into the
       decision tree, the more cautious we should be over the end result.

Exhibit 1 Sample decision Tree

We can see the advantages and disadvantages of using decision trees.

The advantages are:

   *   Easy to create, understand and interpret

   *   Can be enhanced to include several different scenarios

   *   Has significant value

   *   Can be combines with other decision-making tools

The disadvantage are:

   * Identifies a possible decision that is based upon future rather than present
   outcomes

   *   The more complex the decision tree becomes, and the more assumptions that must
       be made, the greater the chance that the final result may be suspect

   * Outcomes and EMV calculations are based upon an "average" result which may be
   unrealistic

   *   Management may become more enamored with the possibility of one highly
       favorable outcome that overshadows the possibilities of unfavorable outcomes that
       can occur. The corollary is also true.

While decision trees have value for project managers, there are other tools that can be
used. The information in a decision tree can be represented more compactly as an
influence diagram, focusing attention on the issues and relationships between events.
However, this could add complexity to the decision-making process.
