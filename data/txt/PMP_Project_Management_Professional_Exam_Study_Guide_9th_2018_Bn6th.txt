Acknowledgments
Thank you for buying PMP(R): Project Management Professional Exam Study Guide, Ninth
Edition, to help you study and prepare for the PMP(R) exam. Thousands of readers world-
wide have used previous editions of this book to help them study for and pass the exam.
Because of their success and their recommendations to friends and coworkers, we've been
able to keep this study guide up-to-date to match the changes made in A Guide to the
Project Management Body of Knowledge (PMBOK(R) Guide), Sixth Edition (PMI(R), 2017).
   I would also like to thank the countless instructors who use my book in their PMP(R) prep
classes. Thank you for your continued interest in using it in your classes. A big thanks goes
to all the PMI(R) chapters who use this book in their classes as well.
   A huge thank-you goes to Neil Edde, former vice president and publisher at Sybex, for
taking a chance way back when on the first edition of this book. I can't thank him enough
for having the foresight at that time to believe in this little-known exam.
   Publishing this book clearly fits the definition of a project, and the team at Sybex is
one of the best project teams you'll ever find. I appreciate all the hard work and dedica-
tion everyone on the team put into producing this book. A special thanks goes to Kenyon
Brown, the acquisitions editor, for giving me the opportunity to update the book and for
his ideas on making it stronger.
   Next, I'd like to thank David Clark, the development editor, for his diligent work
in helping me make this edition the best it can be. A big thanks also goes to Christine
O'Connor, the production editor, for all her help on the book. It was great to work with
her. And thanks also to Liz Welch, the copyeditor, for all her help.
   There were many folks involved behind the scenes who also deserve my thanks, includ-
ing Nancy Carrasco, the proofreader, and John Sleeva, the indexer.
   Next, I'd like to thank Vanina Mangano, technical editor, for her wealth of sugges-
tions and ideas for new topics I should add to the text. It is always a pleasure to work with
Vanina. She is a true professional. Vanina is an instructor and consultant in project man-
agement. I highly recommend Vanina's classes and videos if you're looking for additional
study materials for the exam. Last, but always the first on my list, is my best friend for a
couple of decades and counting, BB. I love you, and I would never have accomplished what
I have to date without your love and support. You're the best! And I'd be remiss if I didn't
also thank Jason and Leah, Noelle, Amanda, and Joe, and of course the two best grand-
daughters on the planet, Kate and Juliette, for their support and understanding.

Introduction
This book was designed for anyone thinking of taking the Project Management
Professional (PMP(R)) exam sponsored by the Project Management Institute (PMI(R)). This
certification is growing in popularity and demand in all areas of business. PMI(R) has experi-
enced explosive growth in membership over the last few years, and more and more organi-
zations are recognizing the importance of project management certification.


                 Although this book is written primarily for those of you taking the PMP (R)
                 exam, you can also use this book to study for the Certified Associate in
                 Project Management (CAPM(R)) exam. The exams are similar in style, and
                 the information covered in this book will help you with either exam.

   This book has been updated to refl ect the latest edition of A Guide to the Project
Management Body of Knowledge (PMBOK(R) Guide), Sixth Edition (PMI (R), 2017). It
assumes you have knowledge of general project management practices, although not
necessarily specifi c to the PMBOK(R) Guide. It's written so that you can skim through
areas you are already familiar with, picking up the specifi c PMBOK(R) Guide terminol-
ogy where needed to pass the exam. You'll fi nd that the project management processes
and techniques discussed in this book are defi ned in such a way that you'll recognize
tasks you've always done and be able to identify them with the PMBOK(R) Guide process
names or methodologies.
   PMI(R) offers the most recognized certification in the field of project management, and
this book deals exclusively with its procedures and methods. Project management consists
of many methods, each with its own terminology, tools, and procedures. If you're familiar
with another organized project management methodology, don't assume you already know
the PMBOK(R) Guide processes. I strongly recommend that you learn all of the processes--
their key inputs, tools and techniques, and outputs. Take the time to memorize the key
terms found in the Glossary as well. Sometimes just understanding the defi nition of a term
will help you answer a question. It might be that you've always done that particular task
or used the methodology described but called it by another name. Know the name of each
process and its primary purpose.


                 The process names, inputs, tools and techniques, outputs, and descrip-

What Is the PMP(R) Certification?
PMI(R) is the leader and the most widely recognized organization in terms of promoting
project management best practices. PMI(R) strives to maintain and endorse standards and
ethics in this field and offers publications, training, seminars, chapters, special interest
groups, and colleges to further the project management discipline.
   PMI(R) was founded in 1969 and first started offering the PMP(R) certification exam in
1984. PMI(R) is accredited as an American National Standards Institute (ANSI) standards
developer and also has the distinction of being the first organization to have its certification
program attain International Organization for Standardization (ISO) 9001 recognition.
   PMI(R) boasts a worldwide membership of more than 470,000, with members from 207
countries and territories around the globe. Local PMI(R) chapters meet regularly and allow
project managers to exchange information and learn about new tools and techniques of
project management or new ways to use established techniques. I encourage you to join a
local chapter and get to know other professionals in your field.


Why Become PMP(R) Certified?
The following benefits are associated with becoming PMP(R) certified:
       It demonstrates proof of professional achievement.
       It increases your marketability.
       It provides greater opportunity for advancement in your field.
       It raises customer confidence in you and in your company's services.


Demonstrates Proof of Professional Achievement
PMP(R) certification is a rigorous process that documents your achievements in the field of
project management. The exam tests your knowledge of the disciplined approaches, meth-
odologies, and project management practices as described in the PMBOK(R) Guide.
   You are required to have several years of experience in project management before sit-
ting for the exam, as well as 35 hours of formal project management education. Your
certification assures employers and customers that you are well grounded in project man-
agement practices and disciplines. It shows that you have the hands-on experience and a
mastery of the processes and disciplines to manage projects effectively and motivate teams
to produce successful results.


Increases Your Marketability
Many industries are realizing the importance of project management and its role in the
organization. They are also seeing that simply proclaiming a head technician to be a "proj-
ect manager" does not make it so. Project management, just like engineering, information
                                                                     Introduction            xxv




technology, and a host of other trades, has its own specific qualifications and skills.
Certification tells potential employers that you have the skills, experience, and knowledge
to drive successful projects and ultimately improve the company's bottom line.
   A certification will always make you stand out above the competition. If you're a PMP(R)
credential holder and you're competing against a project manager without certification,
chances are you'll come out as the top pick. As a hiring manager, all other things being
equal, I will usually opt for the candidate who has certification over the candidate who
doesn't have it. Certification tells potential employers you have gone the extra mile. You've
spent time studying techniques and methods as well as employing them in practice. It shows
dedication to your own professional growth and enhancement and to adhering to and
advancing professional standards.


Provides Opportunity for Advancement
PMP(R) certification displays your willingness to pursue growth in your professional career
and shows that you're not afraid of a little hard work to get what you want. Potential
employers will interpret your pursuit of this certification as a high-energy, success-driven,
can-do attitude on your part. They'll see that you're likely to display these same character-
istics on the job, which will help make the company successful. Your certification displays
a success-oriented, motivated attitude that will open up opportunities for future career
advancements in your current field as well as in new areas you might want to explore.


Raises Customer Confidence
Just as the PMP(R) certification assures employers that you've got the background and expe-
rience to handle project management, it assures customers that they have a competent,
experienced project manager at the helm. Certification will help your organization sell
customers on your ability to manage their projects. Customers, like potential employers,
want the reassurance that those working for them have the knowledge and skills necessary
to carry out the duties of the position and that professionalism and personal integrity are of
utmost importance. Individuals who hold these ideals will translate their ethics and profes-
sionalism to their work. This enhances the trust customers will have in you, which in turn
will give you the ability to influence them on important project issues.



How to Become PMP(R) Certified
You need to fulfill several requirements in order to sit for the PMP(R) exam. PMI(R) has
detailed the certification process quite extensively at its website. Go to www.pmi.org and
click the Certifications tab to get the latest information on certification procedures and
requirements.
xxvi          Introduction



   As of this writing, you are required to fill out an application to sit for the PMP(R) exam. You
can submit this application online at the PMI(R) website. You also need to document 35 hours
of formal project management education. This might include college classes, seminars, work-
shops, and training sessions. Be prepared to list the class titles, location, date, and content.
   In addition to filling out the application and documenting your formal project management
training, there is one set of criteria you'll need to meet to sit for the exam. The criteria in this
set fall into two categories. You need to meet the requirements for only one of these categories:
       Category 1 is for those who have a baccalaureate degree. You'll need to provide proof,
       via transcripts, of your degree with your application. In addition, you'll need to com-
       plete verification forms--found at the PMI(R) website--that show 4,500 hours of project
       management experience that spans a minimum of three years.
       Category 2 is for those who do not have a baccalaureate degree but do hold a high
       school diploma or equivalent. You'll need to complete verification forms documenting
       7,500 hours of project management experience that spans a minimum of five years.
   As of this writing, the exam fee is $405 for PMI(R) members in good standing and $555
for non-PMI(R) members. Testing is conducted at Prometric testing centers. You can find a
center near you on the Prometric center website, but you will not be able to schedule your
exam until your application is approved by PMI(R). You have one year from the time PMI(R)
receives and approves your completed application to take the exam. You'll need to bring
two forms of identification, such as a driver's license and a credit card in your name, with
you to the Prometric testing center on the test day. You will not be allowed to take anything
with you into the testing room and will be provided with a locker to store your personal
belongings. You will be given a calculator, pencils, and scrap paper. You will turn in all
scrap paper, including the notes and squiggles you've jotted during the test, to the center
upon completion of the exam.
   The exam is scored immediately, so you will know whether you've passed at the con-
clusion of the test. You're given four hours to complete the exam, which consists of 200
randomly generated questions. Only 175 of the 200 questions are scored. Twenty-five of
the 200 questions are "pretest" questions that will appear randomly throughout the exam.
These 25 questions are used by PMI(R) to determine statistical information and to determine
whether they can or should be used on future exams. You will receive a score of Proficient,
Moderately Proficient, or Below Proficient for each exam domain, as well as a Pass or Fail
score. Because PMI(R) uses psychometric analysis to determine whether you have passed the
exam, a passing score is not published. The questions on the exam cover the five process
groups and professional responsibility. You'll answer questions on the following:
       Initiating
       Planning
       Executing
       Monitoring and Controlling
       Closing
       Professional Responsibility
                                                                    Introduction         xxvii




                 Questions pertaining to professional responsibility on the exam will be
                 intermixed with questions for all the process groups. You won't see a sec-
                 tion or set of questions devoted solely to professional responsibility, but
                 you will need to understand all of the concepts in this area. I've devoted
                 a good portion of the last chapter of this book to discussing professional
                 responsibility topics.

   All unanswered questions are scored as wrong answers, so it benefits you to guess at an
answer if you're stumped on a question.
   After you've received your certification, you'll be required to earn 60 professional devel-
opment units (PDUs) every three years to maintain certification. Approximately one hour
of structured learning translates to one PDU. The PMI(R) website details what activities
constitute a PDU, how many PDUs each activity earns, and how to register your PDUs with
PMI(R) to maintain your certification. As an example, attendance at a local chapter meeting
earns one PDU.



Who Should Buy This Book?
If you are serious about passing the PMP(R) exam (or the CAPM(R) exam for that matter), you
should buy this book and use it to study for the exam. This book is unique in that it walks
you through the project processes from beginning to end, just as projects are performed
in practice. When you read this book, you will benefit from the explanations of specific
PMBOK(R) Guide processes and techniques coupled with real-life scenarios that describe
how project managers in different situations handle problems and the various issues all
project managers are bound to encounter during their careers. This study guide describes
in detail the exam objective topics in each chapter and has attempted to cover all of the
important project management concepts.



Interactive Online Learning Environment
and Test Bank
The interactive online learning environment that accompanies PMP(R) Project Management
Professional Exam Study Guide, Ninth Edition provides a test bank with study tools to
help you prepare for the certification exam--and to increase your chances of passing it the
fi rst time! The test bank includes the following tools:
Sample Tests All of the questions in this book are provided, including the Assessment
Test, which you'll fi nd at the end of this Introduction, and the Chapter Tests that include
the review questions at the end of each chapter. In addition, there are two Practice Exams.
   xxviii       Introduction



   Use these questions to test your knowledge of the study guide material. The online test
   bank runs on multiple devices.
   Flashcards Questions are provided in digital flashcard format (a question followed by a
   single correct answer). You can use the flashcards to reinforce your learning and for last-
   minute test prep before the exam.
   Other Study Tools Several bonus study tools are included:
      Glossary The key terms from this book and their definitions are available as a fully
      searchable PDF.
      Bonus Questions Supplement the topics in the book with bonus questions that'll help
      you test your knowledge and understanding of concepts.
      Audio Instruction and Review With over two hours of audio instruction, you can lis-
      ten to the author review essential concepts, helping you to increase your understanding
      and fine-tune critical skills.


                    Go to http://www.wiley.com/go/sybextestprep to register and gain access
                    to this interactive online learning environment and test bank with study tools.




   How to Use This Book and the Test Bank
   I've included several study tools, both in the book and in the test bank at
   http://www.wiley.com/go/sybextestprep. Following this Introduction is an assessment
   test that you can use to check your readiness for the actual exam. Take this test before you
   start reading the book. It will help you identify the areas you may need to brush up on.
   The answers to the assessment test appear after the last question of the test. Each answer
   includes an explanation and a note telling you in which chapter this material appears.
      Exam Essentials appear at the end of every chapter to highlight the topics you'll most
   likely find on the exam and help you focus on the most important material covered in the
   chapter so that you'll have a solid understanding of those concepts. However, it isn't pos-
   sible to predict what questions will be covered on your particular exam, so be sure to study
   everything in the chapter.


                    Like the exam itself, this study guide is organized in terms of process
                    groups and the natural sequence of events a project goes through in its life
                    cycle. This is in contrast to other study guides, where material is organized
                    by Knowledge Area (Human Resource Management, Communications
                    Management, and so on); such organization can make mapping the pro-
                    cesses in each Knowledge Area to process groups confusing when you're
                    studying for the exam.

                                                                        Introduction            xxix




   Review questions are also provided at the end of every chapter. You can use them to
gauge your understanding of the subject matter before reading the chapter and to point
out the areas in which you need to concentrate your study time. As you fi nish each
chapter, answer the review questions and then check to see whether your answers are
right--the correct answers appear in Appendix A. You can go back to reread the section
that deals with each question you got wrong to ensure that you answer the question cor-
rectly the next time you are tested on the material. If you can answer at least 80 percent
of the review questions correctly, you can probably feel comfortable moving on to the next
chapter. If you can't answer that many correctly, reread the chapter, or the section that
seems to be giving you trouble, and try the questions again. You'll also fi nd more than
200 fl ashcard questions on the website for on-the-go review.


                 Don't rely on studying the review questions exclusively as your study
                 method. The questions you'll see on the exam will be different from the
                 questions presented in the book. There are 200 randomly generated
                 questions on the PMP (R) exam and 150 on the CAPM(R), so it isn't possible
                 to cover every potential exam question in the review questions section of
                 each chapter. Make sure you understand the concepts behind the mate-
                 rial presented in each chapter and memorize all the formulas as well.

   In addition to the assessment test and the review questions, you'll fi nd bonus exams
online. Take these practice exams just as if you were actually taking the exam (that is,
without any reference material). When you have fi nished the fi rst exam, move on to the
next exam to solidify your test-taking skills. If you get more than 85 percent of the answers
correct, you're ready to take the real exam.
   Finally, you will notice various Real-World Scenario sidebars throughout each chapter.
They are designed to give you insight into how the various processes and topic areas apply
to real-world situations.



The Exam Objectives
Behind every certification exam, you can be sure to fi nd exam objectives--the broad topics
in which the exam developers want to ensure your competency. PMP(R) exam objectives are
listed at the beginning of every chapter in this book.


                 Exam objectives are subject to change at any time without prior notice and
                 at the sole discretion of PMI(R). Please visit the Certifications page of PMI(R) 's
                 website, www.pmi.org, for the most current listing of exam objectives.

Assessment Test
1.   The project sponsor has approached you with a dilemma. At the annual stockholders meet-
     ing, the CEO announced that the project you're managing will be completed by the end of
     this year. The problem is that this is six months prior to the scheduled completion date. It's
     too late to go back and correct her mistake, and now stockholders expect implementation
     by the announced date. You must speed up the delivery date of this project. Your primary
     constraint before this occurred was the budget. Choose the best action from the options
     listed to speed up the project.
     A. Hire more resources to get the work completed faster.
     B.   Ask for more money so that you can contract out one of the phases you had planned to
          do with in-house resources.
     C.   Utilize negotiation and influencing skills to convince the project sponsor to speak with
          the CEO and make a correction to her announcement.
     D.   Examine the project management plan to see whether there are any phases that can be
          fast tracked, and then revise the project management plan to reflect the compression of
          the schedule.

2.   These types of dependencies can create arbitrary total float values and limit your schedul-
     ing options.
     A. Discretionary
     B.   External
     C.   Mandatory
     D.   Hard logic

3.   Project managers spend what percentage of their time communicating?
     A. 90
     B.   85
     C.   75
     D.   50

4.   Which of the following is not another term for inspections?
     A. Reviews
     B.   Assessment
     C.   Walkthrough
     D.   Audits
                                                                   Assessment Test             xxxv



5.   The primary function of the Closing processes is to perform all of the following except
     which one?
     A. Formalize lessons learned and distribute this information to project participants.
     B.   Complete all activities associated with closing out the project.
     C.   Validate the deliverables are complete and accurate.
     D.   Ensure all project work is complete and accurate.

6.   During your project meeting, a problem was discussed, and a resolution to the problem

                                Congratulations on your decision to study for and take the
                                Project Management Institute (PMI(R)) Project Management
                                Professional (PMP)(R) certification exam (PMP(R) exam). This
book was written with you in mind. The focus and content of this book revolve heavily
around the information contained in A Guide to the Project Management Body of
Knowledge (PMBOK(R) Guide), Sixth Edition, published by PMI(R) 2017. I will refer to this guide
throughout this book and elaborate on those areas that appear on the test. Keep in mind that
the test covers all the project management processes, so don't skip anything in your study time.
   When possible, I'll pass on hints and study tips that I collected while studying for the
exam. First, you'll want to familiarize yourself with the terminology used in the PMBOK(R)
Guide. Volunteers from differing industries from around the globe worked together to
come up with the standards and terms used in the guide. These folks worked hard to
develop and define project management terms, and the terms are used interchangeably
among industries. For example, resource planning means the same thing to someone
working in construction, information technology, or healthcare. You'll find many of the
PMBOK(R) Guide terms explained throughout this book. Even if you are an experienced
project manager, you might find that you use specific terms for processes or actions you
regularly perform but that the PMBOK(R) Guide calls them by another name. So, the first
step is to get familiar with the terminology.
   The next step is to become familiar with the processes as defined in the PMBOK(R)
Guide. The process names are unique to PMI (R), but the general principles and guidelines
underlying the processes are used for most projects across industry areas.
   This chapter lays the foundation for building and managing your project. I'll address
project and project management definitions as well as organizational structures. Good luck!



Is It a Project?
Let's start with an example of how projects come about, and later we'll look at a definition of
a project. Consider the following scenario: You work for a wireless phone provider, and the VP
of marketing approaches you with a fabulous idea--"fabulous" because he's the big boss and
because he thought it up. He wants to set up kiosks in local grocery and big-box stores as mini-
offices. These offices will offer customers the ability to sign up for new wireless phone services,
make their wireless phone bill payments, and purchase equipment and accessories. He believes
that the exposure in grocery stores will increase awareness of the company's offerings. After
all, everyone has to eat, right? He tells you that the board of directors has already cleared the
project, and he'll dedicate as many resources to this as he can. He wants the new kiosks in place
in 12 stores by the end of this year. The best news is he has assigned you to head up this project.
                                                                     Is It a Project?        3




   Your first question should be "Is it a project?" This might seem elementary, but projects
are often confused with ongoing operations. Projects are temporary in nature; have definite
start and end dates; produce a unique product, service, or result; and are completed when
their goals and objectives have been met and signed off by the stakeholders or when the
project is terminated.


Exam Spotlight

Projects may be terminated for any number of reasons. Examples include: The objectives
have been met, the objectives cannot be met, funding is no longer available or was spent,
the project is no longer needed, or it was terminated for legal cause or convenience.


   Another characteristic of projects is that they often initiate change in an organization
by moving the business from one state to another. For example, when an organization
undergoes a new back office software implementation or upgrade, changes will occur
within the organization to accommodate the new business process and software. The busi-
ness moves from current state--where they are now--to future state--where they will be
once the software is implemented.
   Lastly, projects also bring about business value creation. Business value can be tangible
(revenue, goods, market share) or intangible (goodwill, recognition, public benefit).
   When considering whether you have a project on your hands, you need to keep some
issues in mind. First, is it a project or an ongoing operation? Next, if it is a project, who
are the stakeholders? And third, what characteristics distinguish this endeavor as a project?
We'll look at each of these next.


Projects vs. Operations
Projects are temporary in nature and have definitive start dates and definitive end dates. The
project is completed when its goals and objectives are accomplished (by producing deliver-
ables) to the satisfaction of the stakeholders. Sometimes projects end when it's determined
that the goals and objectives cannot be accomplished or when the product, service, or result
of the project is no longer needed and the project is canceled. Projects exist to bring about
a product, service, or result that didn't exist before. This might include tangible products,
components of other products, services such as consulting or project management, and
business functions that support the organization. Projects might also produce a result or an
outcome, such as a document that details the findings of a research study. In this sense, a
project is unique. However, don't be confused by the term unique. For example, Ford Motor
Company is in the business of designing and assembling cars. Each model that Ford designs
and produces can be considered a project. The models differ from each other in their features
and are marketed to people with various needs. An SUV serves a different purpose and clien-
tele than a luxury sedan or a hybrid. The initial design and marketing of these three models
are unique projects. However, the actual assembly of the cars is considered an operation--a
repetitive process that is followed for most makes and models.
4        Chapter 1      What Is a Project?



   Determining the characteristics and features of the different car models is carried out
through what the PMBOK(R) Guide terms progressive elaboration. This means the char-
acteristics of the product, service, or result of the project are determined incrementally
and are continually refined and worked out in detail as the project progresses. More
information and better estimates become available the further you progress in the project.
Progressive elaboration improves the project team's ability to manage greater levels of detail
and allows for the inevitable change that occurs throughout a project's life cycle. This con-
cept goes along with the temporary and unique aspects of a project because when you first
start the project, you don't know all the minute details of the end product. Product charac-
teristics typically start out broad-based at the beginning of the project and are progressively
elaborated into more and more detail over time until they are complete and finalized.



Exam Spotlight

Progressive elaboration is most often used when creating the project or product scope,
developing requirements, determining human resources, scheduling, and defining risks
and their mitigation plans.




The New Website Project

You've just been charged with creating a new intranet site for your organization. At the
beginning of the project, you don't know a lot of detail other than the high-level purpose
of the project. One of the next steps is to discover the elements that should be included
on the website. For example, you might need to make available human resources' policies
and procedures, travel request forms, expense reimbursement forms, and so on. At this
point, you are progressively elaborating the scope of the project. Each of these elements
will need its own progressive elaboration process to further define its requirements and
develop estimates. For example, as you interview stakeholders, you discover that travel
request forms require two electronic signatures, one from the employee's supervisor and
one from the section manager. Progressive elaboration continues throughout the project
life cycle, including defining the requirements and scope, delivering the end product or
result, and obtaining acceptance from the stakeholders.


   Operations are ongoing and repetitive. They involve work that is continuous without an
ending date, and you often repeat the same processes and produce the same results. One way
to think of operations is the transforming of resources (steel and fiberglass, for example) into
outputs (cars). The purpose of operations is to keep the organization functioning, whereas
the purpose of a project is to meet its goals and to conclude. At the completion of a proj-
ect, or at various points throughout the project, the deliverables may get turned over to the
                                                                       Is It a Project?          5




organization's operational areas for ongoing care and maintenance. For example, let's say
your company implements a new human resources software package that tracks employees'
time, expense reports, benefits, and so on, like the example described in the sidebar "The
New Website Project." Defining the requirements and implementing the software is a project.
The ongoing maintenance of the site, updating content, and so on are ongoing operations.
   It's a good idea to include some members of the operational area on the project team
when certain deliverables or the end product of the project will be incorporated into their
future work processes. They can assist the project team in defining requirements, devel-
oping scope, creating estimates, and so on, helping to ensure that the project will meet
their needs. The process of knowledge transfer to the team is much simpler when they are
involved throughout the project; they gain knowledge as they go and the formal handoff is
more efficient. This isn't a bad strategy in helping to gain buy-ins from the end users of the
product or service either. Often, business units are resistant to new systems or services, but
getting them involved early in the project rather than simply throwing the end product over
the fence when it's completed may help gain their acceptance.
   Managing projects and managing operations require different skill sets. Operations
management involves managing the business operations that support the goods and ser-
vices the organization is producing. Operations managers may include line supervisors in
manufacturing, retail sales managers, and customer service call center managers. The skills
needed to manage a project include general management skills, interpersonal skills, plan-
ning and organization skills, and more. The remainder of this book will discuss project
management skills in detail.
   According to the PMBOK(R) Guide, several examples exist where projects can extend into
operations up until and including the end of the product life cycle:
    Concluding the end of each phase of the project
    Developing new products or services
    Upgrading and/or expanding products or services
    Improving the product development processes
    Improving operations
   The preceding list isn't all inclusive. Whenever you find yourself working on a project
that ultimately impacts your organization's business processes, I recommend you get people
from the business units to participate on the project.


Stakeholders
A project is successful when it achieves its objectives by producing deliverables that meet
the expectations of the stakeholders. Stakeholders are those folks (or organizations) with a
vested interest in your project. They may be active or passive as far as participation on the
project goes, but the one thing they all have in common is that each of them has something
to either gain or lose as a result of the project. Stakeholder identification is not a onetime
process. You should continue to ask fellow team members and stakeholders if other stake-
holders should be a part of the project.
6              Chapter 1          What Is a Project?




                        Key stakeholders can make or break the success of a project. Even if
                        all the deliverables are met and the objectives are satisfied, if your key
                        stakeholders aren't happy, nobody is happy.

    The project sponsor, generally an executive in the organization with the authority to
assign resources and enforce decisions regarding the project, is a stakeholder. The proj-
ect sponsor generally serves as the tie-breaking decision maker and is one of the people
on your escalation path. The project sponsor is also the person who approves the project
charter and gives the project manager the authority to commence with the project. We will
cover this topic in more detail in Chapter 2, "Creating the Project Charter." The customer
is a stakeholder, as are contractors and suppliers. The project manager, the project team
members, and the managers from other departments, including the operations areas, are
stakeholders as well. It's important to identify all the key stakeholders in your project up
front. Leaving out an important stakeholder or their department's function and not discov-
ering the error until well into the project can be a project killer.
    Figure 1.1 shows a sample listing of the kinds of stakeholders involved in a typical project.
The org chart view shows a hierarchical view, not an organizational reporting view, of how the
stakeholders listed in the chart and in the box below the chart interact with the project manager.

    Many times, stakeholders have conflicting interests. It's the project manager's responsi-
bility to understand these conflicts and try to resolve them. It's also the project manager's
responsibility to manage stakeholder expectations. Be certain to identify and meet with
all key stakeholders early in the project to understand their expectations, needs, and con-
straints. When in doubt, you should always resolve stakeholder conflicts in favor of the
customer.


Project Characteristics
You've just learned that a project has several characteristics:
    Projects are unique.
    Projects are temporary in nature and have a definite beginning and ending date.
    Projects are completed when the project goals are achieved or it's determined the
    project is no longer viable.
    A successful project is one that meets the expectations of your stakeholders.
    Projects initiate change in the organization.
    Projects bring about business value creation.
   Using these criteria, let's examine the assignment from the VP of marketing (to set up
kiosks in local grocery and big-box stores as mini-offices) to determine whether it is a project:
Is it unique? Yes, because the kiosks don't exist now in the local grocery stores. This is a
new way of offering the company's services to its customer base. Although the service the
company is offering isn't new, the way it is presenting its services is.
Does the project have a limited time frame? Yes, the start date of this project is today, and
the end date is the end of this year. It is a temporary endeavor.
Is there a way to determine when the project is completed? Yes, the kiosks will be installed,
and services will be offered from them. Once all the kiosks are intact and operating, the
project will come to a close.
Is there a way to determine stakeholder satisfaction? Yes, the expectations of the stakehold-
ers will be documented in the form of deliverables and requirements during the Planning
processes. Some of the requirements the VP noted are that customers can sign up for new
services, pay their bills, and purchase equipment and accessories. These deliverables and
requirements will be compared to the finished product to determine whether it meets the
expectations of the stakeholders.
Is it driving change?   Yes, this is a new way of doing business and providing service to our
customers.
Will business value creation be realized? Yes, this project will hopefully improve market
share, increase revenues, produce goodwill among our customers, create more brand
recognition, and drive up shareholder equity.
Houston, we have a project.

What Is Project Management?
You've determined that you indeed have a project. What now? The notes you scratched on
the back of a napkin during your coffee break might get you started, but that's not exactly
good project management practice.
   We have all witnessed this scenario: An assignment is made, and the project team mem-
bers jump directly into the project, busying themselves with building the product, service,
or result requested. Often, careful thought is not given to the project-planning process.
I'm sure you've heard co-workers toss around statements like, "That would be a waste of
valuable time" or "Why plan when you can just start building?" Project progress in this cir-
cumstance is rarely measured against the customer requirements. In the end, the delivered
product, service, or result doesn't meet the expectations of the customer. This is a frustrat-
ing experience for all those involved. Unfortunately, many projects follow this poorly con-
structed path.
   Project management brings together a set of tools and techniques--performed by
people--to describe, organize, and monitor the work of project activities. Project managers
are the people responsible for managing the project processes and applying the tools and
techniques used to carry out the project activities. All projects are composed of processes,
even if they employ a haphazard approach. There are many advantages to organizing
projects and teams around the project management processes endorsed by PMI(R). We'll
be examining those processes and their advantages in depth throughout the remainder of
this book.
   According to the PMBOK(R) Guide, project management involves applying knowledge,
skills, tools, and techniques during the course of the project to meet requirements. It is the
responsibility of the project manager to ensure that project management techniques are
applied and followed.



Exam Spotlight

Remember that according to the PMBOK(R) Guide, the definition of project management
is applying tools, techniques, skills, and knowledge to project activities to bring about
successful results and meet the project requirements.


   Project management is a collection of processes that includes initiating a new project,
planning, putting the project management plan into action, and measuring progress and
performance. It involves identifying the project requirements, establishing project objec-
tives, balancing constraints, and taking the needs and expectations of the key stakeholders
into consideration. Planning is one of the most important functions you'll perform during
the course of a project. It sets the standard for the remainder of the project's life and is used
to track future project performance. Before we begin the Planning process, let's look at
some of the ways the work of project management is organized.
                                                      What Is Project Management?                  9




Programs
According to the PMBOK(R) Guide, programs are groups of related projects, subsidiary pro-
grams, and other activities that are managed using similar techniques in order to capitalize
on benefits that wouldn't be feasible if you managed the projects individually. When projects
are managed collectively as programs, it's possible to capitalize on benefits that wouldn't be
achievable if the projects were managed separately. This would be the case where a very large
program exists with many subprojects under it--for example, building an urban live-work-
shopping development. Many subprojects exist underneath this program, such as design and
placement of living and shopping areas, architectural drawings, theme and design, construc-
tion, marketing, facilities management, and so on. Each of the subprojects is a project unto
itself. Each subproject has its own project manager, who reports to a project manager with
responsibility over several of the areas, who in turn reports to the head project manager who
is responsible for the entire program. All the projects are related and are managed together so
that collective benefits are realized and controls are implemented and managed in a coordi-
nated fashion. Sometimes programs involve aspects of ongoing operations as well. After the
shopping areas in our example are built, the management of the buildings and common areas
becomes an ongoing operation. The management of this collection of projects--determining
their interdependencies, managing among their constraints, and resolving issues among
them--is called program management. Program management also involves centrally manag-
ing and coordinating groups of related projects to meet the objectives of the program.
    A new type of project has been identified by the PMBOK(R) Guide called a megaproject.
These projects, as implied by the term, are very large and take multiple years to complete.
The total investment of these multiyear projects must be $1 billion or more (in US dollars)
and the project must affect 1 million people or more. A few examples might include the
construction of a new interstate highway, or the implementation of a national healthcare
system.


Portfolios
Portfolios are collections of programs, subsidiary portfolios, operations, and projects that
support strategic business goals or objectives. Let's say our company is in the construction
business. Our organization has several business units: retail, single-family residential, and
multifamily residential. Collectively, the projects within all of these business units make up
the portfolio. The program I talked about in the preceding section (the collection of projects
associated with building the new live-work-shopping urban area) is a program within our
portfolio. Other programs and projects could be within this portfolio as well. Programs and
projects within a portfolio are not necessarily related to one another in a direct way. How-
ever, the overall objective of any program or project in this portfolio is to meet the strategic
objectives of the portfolio, which in turn should meet the strategic objectives of the depart-
ment and ultimately the business unit or corporation.
   Portfolio management encompasses centrally managing the collections of programs,
projects, other work, and sometimes other portfolios. It involves guiding the investment
decisions of the organization and ensures that the investments are appropriately applied
10        Chapter 1      What Is a Project?



to the projects and programs so that they advance the organization's strategic goals. The
project management office (discussed in the next section) is typically responsible for man-
aging portfolios. This gives a central, enterprise view to the projects for the organization as
a whole and leads to more effective management of the programs and projects within the
portfolio. Maximizing the portfolio is critical to increasing success. This includes weighing
the value of each project, or potential project, against the business's strategic objectives,
selecting the right programs and projects, eliminating projects that don't add value, and
prioritizing resources among programs and projects. It also concerns monitoring active
projects for adherence to objectives, balancing the portfolio among the other investments
of the organization, and ensuring the efficient use of resources. Portfolio managers also
monitor the organizational planning activities of the organization to help prioritize proj-
ects according to fund availability, risk, the strategic mission, and more. As you can see,
portfolio management (and program management) has a different objective, life cycle, and
benefits than project management. Portfolio management is generally performed by a senior
manager who has significant experience in both project and program management.

Projects or programs within a portfolio are not necessarily related or dependent on
each other.

Exam Spotlight

Project and program management both focus on performing the projects and programs
in the right way. Portfolio management is concerned with working on the right projects
and the right programs for the organization.



Organizational Project Management
Organizational project management (OPM) ensures that projects, programs, and portfolios
are aligned and managed according to the organization's strategic business objectives. It
optimizes the organization's capabilities by correlating projects, programs, and portfolios to
perform efficiently and align with the strategic goals. The focus of OPM is to ensure that the
organization performs the right projects, that critical resources are available and assigned
appropriately, and that the strategic objectives and business value are first and foremost.


Project Management Offices
The project management office (PMO) is usually a centralized organizational unit that
oversees the management of projects and programs throughout the organization. The
most common reason a company starts a project management office is to establish and
maintain procedures and standards for project management methodologies and to man-
age resources assigned to the projects in the PMO. PMOs are often tasked with establish-
ing an organizational project management (OPM) framework. OPM helps ensure that
projects, programs, and portfolios are managed consistently and that they support the
overall goals of the organization. OPM is used in conjunction with other organizational
practices, such as human resources, technology, and culture, to improve performance and
maintain a competitive edge.
12          Chapter 1      What Is a Project?



   According to the PMBOK(R) Guide, the key purpose of a PMO is to provide support for
project managers. This may include the following types of support:
     Providing an established project management methodology, including templates, forms,
     and standards
     Mentoring, coaching, and training project managers
     Facilitating communication within and across projects
     Managing resources
   Not all PMOs are the same. Some PMOs may have a great deal of authority and control,
whereas others may only serve a supporting role. According to the PMBOK(R) Guide, there
are three types of PMOs: supportive, controlling, and directive. Table 1.2 describes each
type of PMO, its roles, and its levels of control.

Ta b l E 1 . 2   PMO organizational types

                  A PMO might exist in all organizational structures--functional, project-
                  oriented, or matrix. (These structures will be discussed later in this
                  chapter.) It might have full authority to manage projects, including the
                  authority to cancel projects, or it might serve only in an advisory role.
                  PMOs might also be called project offices , program management offices ,
                  or Centers of Excellence .

   The PMO usually has responsibility for maintaining and archiving project documen-
tation for future reference. This office compares project goals with project progress and
gives feedback to the project teams and management. It ensures that projects are aligned
with the strategic objectives of the organization, and it measures the performance of active
projects and suggests corrective actions. The PMO evaluates completed projects for their
adherence to the project management plan and asks questions like "Did the project meet
the time frames established?" and "Did it stay within budget?" and "Was the quality
acceptable?"
                                       Skills Every Good Project Manager Needs               13




                 Project managers are typically responsible for meeting the objectives of
                 the project they are managing, controlling the resources within the project,
                 and managing the individual project constraints. The PMO is responsible
                 for managing the objectives of a collective set of projects, managing
                 resources across the projects, and managing the interdependencies of all
                 the projects within the PMO's authority.

   Project management offices are common in organizations today, if for no other reason
than to serve as a collection point for project documentation. Some PMOs are fairly sophis-
ticated and prescribe the standards and methodologies to be used in all project phases
across the enterprise. Still others provide all these functions and also offer project manage-
ment consulting services. However, the establishment of a PMO is not required in order for
you to apply good project management practices to your next project.



There Ought to be a law

The importance of practicing sound project management techniques has grown signifi-
cantly over the past several years. In 2015, President Obama signed the Program Manage-
ment Improvement and Accountability Act of 2015 (PMIAA). This act intended to enhance
accountability in project management and ensure that best practices are used for proj-
ects performed by the federal government. It developed an official career path for project
managers and recognized the importance of the role of the project sponsor and executive
management on the project. This act enforced the development of a standards-based
program management policy across the federal government and set up an interagency
council on project management so that knowledge sharing could occur among agencies.




Skills Every Good Project Manager Needs
Many times, organizations will knight their technical experts as project managers. The skill
and expertise that made them stars in their technical fields are mistakenly thought to trans-
late into project management skills. This is not necessarily so.
   Project managers are generalists with many skills in their repertoires. They are also
problem solvers who wear many hats. Project managers might indeed possess technical
skills, but technical skills are not a prerequisite for sound project management skills.
Your project team should include a few technical experts, and these are the people on
whom the project manager should rely on for technical details. Understanding and apply-
ing good project management techniques, along with a solid understanding of strategic
and business management skills, as well as interpersonal skills, are career builders for all
aspiring project managers.
14        Chapter 1      What Is a Project?



    Project managers have been likened to small-business owners. They need to know a bit
about every aspect of management. General management skills include every area of man-
agement, from accounting to strategic planning, supervision, personnel administration, and
more. Interpersonal skills are often called soft skills and include, among others, commu-
nications, leadership, and decision making. General management and interpersonal skills
are called into play on every project. But some projects require specific skills in certain
application areas. Application areas consist of categories of projects that have common ele-
ments. These elements, or application areas, can be defi ned several ways: by industry group
(automotive, pharmaceutical), by department (accounting, marketing), and by technical
(software development, engineering) or management (procurement, research and develop-
ment) specialties. These application areas are usually concerned with disciplines, regula-
tions, and the specific needs of the project, the customer, or the industry. For example, most
governments have specific procurement rules that apply to their projects but that wouldn't
be applicable in the construction industry. The pharmaceutical industry is acutely interested
in regulations set forth by the Food and Drug Administration. The automotive industry has
little or no concern for either of these types of regulations. Having experience in the appli-
cation area you're working in will give you a leg up when it comes to project management.
Although you can call in the experts who have application area knowledge, it doesn't hurt
for you to understand the specific aspects of the application areas of your project.
    Project managers are not the sole performers on a project and are not expected to know
everything or to perform every task. But they should have sound project management skills,
adequate technical skills, and sufficient experience to manage the size, complexity, and
risk of the project they'll undertake. They also serve as champions for the value of project
management, help to socialize and gain acceptance of project management concepts, and
advance the effectiveness and advantages of the PMO.
    The PMBOK(R) Guide outlines the skills every project manager needs in what they call the
PMI(R) Talent TriangleTM, which is made up of technical project management skills, leader-
ship skills, and strategic and business management skills. I will discuss each of those next
along with other skills that I consider the foundation of good project management practices.
Your mastery of them (or lack thereof) will likely affect project outcomes. We'll look at an
overview of these skills now, and I'll discuss each in more detail in subsequent chapters.


                  Once you become a certified PMP(R) credential holder, you will need to com-
                  plete a certain amount of professional development units (PDUs) every
                  three years. PMI(R) requires you record the PDUs according to the Talent
                  TriangleTM. That is, PDUs are earned and recorded in the leadership,
                  strategic, and technical categories.


Technical Project Management Skills
Technical skills, as it relates to project management, refer to the technical aspects of perform-
ing the role. This incorporates skills like applying project management knowledge in order
to deliver the objectives of the projects, defining the critical success factors of the project,
developing a project schedule, and knowing when you don't know and need to ask for help.
                                        Skills Every Good Project Manager Needs                15




As I noted earlier, the project manager isn't expected to be the technical expert (from the
perspective of the product of the project) and should have sufficient subject matter experts
on the project team to address technical concerns. The project manager is concerned with
using the right tools and techniques for the project, planning appropriately, and managing
the schedule, budget, resources, and risks. Technical project management skills are included
in the PMI (R) Talent TriangleTM skills.


Business Management and Strategic Skills
Project managers should be able to describe the business needs of the project and how
they align to the organization's goals, including elements such as operations, market condi-
tions, competition, and strategy. This also means that the project manager should have a
basic understanding of how the goals of the project relate to various business functions in
the organization, such as finance, marketing, customer service, and operations. Having an
understanding of the business needs and the strategic vision of the organization helps you to
understand what aspects of the project may need to be closely monitored or which deliver-
ables have higher priority than others.
   Business skills also involve understanding the risks and issues involved in bringing about
the results of the project, the fi nancial impacts and their effects, how business value is max-
imized through a successful project, and how to manage the scope and schedule.
   Another skill you might not equate to a business skill is understanding the politics of the
organization and, most importantly, understanding who has the power, responsibility, and
authority to make things happen for your project. Business management and strategic skills
are included in the PMI (R) Talent TriangleTM skills.


Communication Skills
One of the single most important characteristics of a first-rate project manager is excellent
communication skills. Written and oral communications are the backbone of all successful
projects. Many forms of communication will exist during the life of your project. As the cre-
ator or manager of most of the project communication (project documents, meeting updates,
status reports, and so on), it's your job to ensure that the information is explicit, clear, and
complete so that your audience will have no trouble understanding what has been com-
municated. Once the information has been distributed, it is the responsibility of the people
receiving the information to make sure they understand it.


                  Many forms of communication and communication styles exist. I'll discuss
                  them more in depth in Chapter 8, "Developing the Project Team."


Organizational and Planning Skills
Organizational and planning skills are closely related and probably the most important
skills, after communication skills, a project manager can possess. Organization takes
on many forms. As project manager, you'll have project documentation, requirements
16        Chapter 1      What Is a Project?



information, memos, project reports, personnel records, vendor quotes, contracts, and much
more to track and be able to locate at a moment's notice. You will also have to organize
meetings, put together teams, and perhaps manage and organize media-release schedules,
depending on your project.
   Time management skills are closely related to organizational skills. It's difficult to stay
organized without an understanding of how you're managing your time. I recommend that
you attend a time management class if you've never been to one. They have great tips and
techniques to help you prioritize problems and interruptions, prioritize your day, and man-
age your time.
   I discuss planning extensively throughout the course of this book. There isn't any aspect
of project management that doesn't first involve planning. Planning skills go hand in hand
with organizational skills. Combining these two with excellent communication skills is
almost a sure guarantee of your success in the project management field.


Conflict Management Skills
Show me a project, and I'll show you problems. All projects have some problems, as does, in
fact, much of everyday life. Isn't that what they say builds character? But I digress.
    Conflict management involves solving problems. Problem solving is really a twofold
process. First, you must define the problem by separating the causes from the symptoms.
Often when defining problems, you end up just describing the symptoms instead of getting
to the heart of what's causing the problem. To avoid that, ask yourself questions like, "Is
it an internal or external problem? Is it a technical problem? Are there interpersonal prob-
lems between team members? Is it managerial? What are the potential impacts or conse-
quences?" These kinds of questions will help you get to the cause of the problem.
    Next, after you have defined the problem, you have some decisions to make. It will take
a little time to examine and analyze the problem, the situation causing it, and the alterna-
tives available. After this analysis, the project manager will determine the best course of
action to take and implement the decision. The timing of the decision is often as important
as the decision itself. If you make a good decision but implement it too late, it might turn
into a bad decision.


Negotiation and Influencing Skills
Effective problem solving requires negotiation and influencing skills. We all utilize negotia-
tion skills in one form or another every day. For example, on a nightly basis I am asked,
"Honey, what do you want for dinner?" Then the negotiations begin, and the fried chicken
versus swordfish discussion commences. Simply put, negotiating is working with others to
come to an agreement.
   Negotiation on projects is necessary in almost every area of the project, from scope
definition to budgets, contracts, resource assignments, and more. This might involve
negotiation one-on-one or with teams of people, and it can occur many times throughout
the project.
                                        Skills Every Good Project Manager Needs                 17




   Influencing is convincing the other party that swordfish is a better choice than fried
chicken, even if fried chicken is what they want. It's also the ability to get things done
through others. Influencing requires an understanding of the formal and informal structure
of all the organizations involved in the project.
   Power and politics are techniques used to influence people to perform. Power is the
ability to get people to do things they wouldn't do otherwise. It's also the ability to change
minds and the course of events and to influence outcomes.


                  I'll discuss power further in Chapter 8.




   Politics involve getting groups of people with different interests to cooperate creatively
even in the midst of confl ict and disorder.
   These skills will be utilized in all areas of project management. Start practicing now
because, guaranteed, you'll need these skills on your next project.


Leadership Skills
Leaders and managers are not the same. Leaders impart vision, gain consensus for strategic
goals, establish direction, and inspire and motivate others. They guide and direct the team
in accomplishing the project's objectives. Managers focus on results and are concerned with
getting the job done according to the requirements. Even though leaders and managers are
not the same, project managers must exhibit the characteristics of both during different times
on the project. Understanding when to switch from leadership to management and then back
again is a finely tuned and necessary talent. Leadership is one of the Talent TriangleTM skills.


Team-Building and Motivating Skills
Project managers will rely heavily on team-building and motivational skills. Teams are often
formed with people from different parts of the organization. These people might or might
not have worked together before, so some component of team-building groundwork might
involve the project manager. The project manager will set the tone for the project team and
will help the members work through the various stages of team development to become fully
functional. Motivating the team, especially during long projects or when experiencing a lot
of bumps along the way, is another important role the project manager fulfills during the
course of the project.
   An interesting caveat to the team-building role is that project managers many times are
responsible for motivating team members who are not their direct reports. This scenario
has its own set of challenges and dilemmas. One way to help this situation is to ask the
functional manager to allow you to participate in your project team members' performance
reviews. Use the negotiation and influencing skills I talked about earlier to make sure you're
part of this process.
18        Chapter 1        What Is a Project?




Multiple Dimensions

Project managers are an interesting bunch. They know a little bit about a lot of topics
and are excellent communicators. They have the ability to motivate people, even those
who have no reason to be loyal to the project, and they can make the hard-line calls when
necessary. Project managers can get caught in sticky situations that occasionally require
making decisions that are good for the company (or the customer) but aren't good for
certain stakeholders. The offended stakeholders will then drag their feet, and the project
manager has to play the heavy in order to motivate and gain their cooperation again.
Some organizations hire contract project managers to run their large, company-altering
projects just because they don't want to burn out a key employee in this role. Fortunately,
that doesn't happen often.



Role of a Project Manager
Project managers are responsible for ensuring that the objectives of the project are met.
Projects create value, which in turn increases the business value of the organization. Busi-
ness value is the total value of all the assets of the organization, including both tangible and
intangible elements. The project manager must be familiar with the organization's strategic
plan in order to marry those strategic objectives with the projects in the portfolio. This re-
quires all of the skills we covered in the preceding sections.
   Now that you've been properly introduced to some of the skills you need in your tool
kit, you'll know to be prepared to communicate, solve problems, lead, and negotiate your
way through your next project.



Understanding Organizational
Structures
Just as projects are unique, so are the organizations in which they're carried out. Organiza-
tions have their own styles, cultures, and ways of communicating that influence how project
work is performed and their ability to achieve project success. Because uniqueness abounds
in business cultures, you're likely to find any number of organizational structures. Some of
the elements that help frame an organizational structure, according to the PMBOK(R) Guide,
include the following:
     Alignment with organizational objectives
     Skills and special capabilities
     Escalation path
     Authority levels
                                       Understanding Organizational Structures              19



    Accountability and responsibility levels
    Ability to adapt
    Efficient and effective performance
    Cost
    Locations
    Communications
    According to the PMBOK(R) Guide, examples of organizational structures include
simple, multidivisional, functional, project-oriented, matrix, virtual, hybrid, or PMO. It's
helpful to know and understand the organizational structure and the culture of the entity
in which you're working. Companies with aggressive cultures that are comfortable in a
leading-edge position within their industries are highly likely to take on risky projects.
Project managers who are willing to suggest new ideas and projects that have never been
undertaken before are likely to receive a warm reception in this kind of environment.
Conversely, organizational cultures that are risk-averse and prefer the follow-the-leader
position within their industries are highly unlikely to take on risky endeavors. Project
managers with risk-seeking, aggressive styles are likely to receive a cool reception in a
culture like this.
    One of the keys to determining the type of organization you work in is measuring how
much authority senior management is willing to delegate to project managers. The level
of authority the project manager enjoys is denoted by the organizational structure and by
the interactions of the project manager with various levels of management. For example, a
project manager within a functional organization has little to no formal authority. Their
title might not be project manager; instead, they might be called a project leader, a project
coordinator, or perhaps a project expeditor. And a project manager who primarily works
with operations-level managers will likely have less authority than one who works with
middle-or strategic-level managers.



Exam Spotlight

According to the PMBOK(R) Guide, the project managers' authority levels, the availability
of resources, control over the project budget, the role of the project manager, and the
project team makeup are influenced by the structure of the organization; by the level of
interaction the project manager has with strategic-level managers, middle managers,
and operations-level managers; and by the project management maturity levels of the
organization.


   We'll now take a look at each of these types of organizations individually to better
understand how the project management role works in each one. Functional, matrix, and
project-oriented organizational structures are the most common, so we'll focus more heavily
on those. I discussed the PMO earlier in this chapter.
20        Chapter 1           What Is a Project?




Functional Organizations
One common type of organization is the functional organization. Chances are you have
worked in this type of organization. This is probably the oldest style of organization and is,
therefore, known as the traditional approach to organizing businesses.
   Functional organizations are centered on specialties and grouped by function, which
is why they're called functional organizations. As an example, the organization might
have a human resources department, finance department, marketing department, and
so on. The work in these departments is specialized and requires people who have
the skill sets and experience in these specialized functions to perform specific duties
for the department. Figure 1.2 shows a typical organizational chart for a functional
organization.

F i g u r e 1. 2      Functional organizational chart



                                                       CEO




                       VP Human
                                                                          VP Finance

                   Staff                       Staff                   Staff                     Staff

                   Staff                       Staff                   Staff                     Staff

                   Staff                       Staff                   Staff                     Staff

                   Staff                       Staff                   Staff                     Staff

                   Staff                       Staff                   Staff                     Staff


   You can see that this type of organization is set up to be a hierarchy. Staff personnel
report to managers who report to vice presidents who report to the CEO. In other words,
each employee reports to only one manager; ultimately, one person at the top is in charge.
Many companies today, as well as governmental agencies, are structured in a hierarchical
fashion. In organizations like this, be aware of the chain of command. A strict chain of
command might exist, and the corporate culture might dictate that you follow it. Roughly
                                       Understanding Organizational Structures              21




translated: Don't talk to the big boss without first talking to your boss who talks to their
boss who talks to the big boss. Wise project managers should determine whether there is a
chain of command, how strictly it's enforced, and how the chain is linked before venturing
outside it.
    Each department or group in a functional organization is managed independently and
has a limited span of control. Marketing doesn't run the fi nance department or its projects,
for example. The marketing department is concerned with its own functions and projects.
If it were necessary for the marketing department to get input from the fi nance department
on a project, the marketing team members would follow the chain of command. A market-
ing manager would speak to a manager in fi nance to get the needed information and then
pass it back down to the project team.

Human Resources in a Functional Organization
Commonalities exist among the personnel assigned to the various departments in a
functional organization. In theory, people with similar skills and experiences are easier
to manage as a group. Instead of scattering them throughout the organization, it is more
efficient to keep them functioning together. Work assignments are easily distributed to
those who are best suited for the task when everyone with the same skill works together.
Usually, the supervisors and managers of these workers are experienced in the area they
supervise and are able to recommend training and career enrichment activities for their
employees.


                 Workers in functional organizations specialize in an area of expertise--
                 finance or personnel administration, for instance--and then become very
                 good at their specialty.

  People in a functional organization can see a clear upward career path. An assistant
budget analyst might be promoted to a budget analyst and then eventually to a department
manager over many budget analysts.

The Downside of Functional Organizations
Functional organizations have their disadvantages. If this is the kind of organization you
work in, you probably have experienced some of them.
   One of the greatest disadvantages for the project manager is that they have little to no
formal authority. This does not mean project managers in functional organizations are
doomed to failure. Many projects are undertaken and successfully completed within this
type of organization. Good communication and interpersonal and influencing skills on
the part of the project manager are required to bring about a successful project under this
structure.
   In a functional organization, the vice president or senior department manager is usually
the one responsible for projects. The title of project manager denotes authority, and in a
functional structure, that authority rests with the VP.
22        Chapter 1      What Is a Project?



Managing Projects in a Functional Organization
Projects are typically undertaken in a divided approach in a functional organization. For
example, the marketing department will work on its portion of the project and then hand it
off to the manufacturing department to complete its part, and so on. The work the market-
ing department does is considered a marketing project, whereas the work the manufacturing
department does is considered a manufacturing project.
   Some projects require project team members from different departments to work
together at the same time on various aspects of the project. Project team members in this
structure will more than likely remain loyal to their functional managers. The functional
manager is responsible for their performance reviews, and their career opportunities lie
within the functional department--not within the project team. Exhibiting leadership
skills by forming a common vision regarding the project and the ability to motivate people
to work toward that vision are great skills to exercise in this situation. As previously men-
tioned, it also doesn't hurt to have the project manager work with the functional manager
in contributing to the employee's performance review.

Resource Pressures in a Functional Organization
Competition for resources and project priorities can become fierce when multiple projects
are undertaken within a functional organization. For example, in my organization, it's com-
mon to have competing project requests from three or more departments all vying for the
same resources. Thrown into the heap is the requirement to make, for example, mandated
tax law changes, which automatically usurps all other priorities. This sometimes causes frus-
tration and political infighting. One department thinks their project is more important than
another and will do anything to get that project pushed ahead of the others. Again, it takes
great skill and diplomatic abilities to keep projects on track and functioning smoothly. In
Chapter 2 I'll discuss the importance of gaining stakeholder buy-in, and in Chapter 5, "De-
veloping the Project Budget and Communicating the Plan," I'll talk about the importance of
communication to avert some of these problems.
   Project managers have little authority in functional organizations, but with the right
skills, they can successfully accomplish many projects. Table 1.3 highlights the advantages
and disadvantages of this type of organization.

Ta b l e 1 . 3   Functional organizations

Project-Oriented Organizations
Project-oriented organizations are nearly the opposite of functional organizations. The focus
of this type of organization is the project itself. The idea behind a project-oriented organiza-
tion is to develop loyalty to the project, not to a functional manager.
   Figure 1.3 shows a typical organizational chart for a project-oriented organization.

   Organizational resources are dedicated to projects and project work in purely project-
oriented organizations. Project managers almost always have ultimate authority over
the project in this structure and report directly to the CEO. In a purely project-oriented
organization, supporting functions such as human resources and accounting might report
directly to the project manager as well. Project managers are responsible for making deci-
sions regarding the project and acquiring and assigning resources. They have the authority
to choose and assign resources from other areas in the organization or to hire them from
outside if needed. For example, if there isn't enough money in the budget to hire additional
resources, the project manager will have to come up with alternatives to solve this problem.
This is known as a constraint. Project managers in all organizational structures are limited
by constraints such as scope, schedule, and cost (or budget). Quality is also considered a
constraint, and it's generally affected by scope, schedule, and/or cost. We'll talk more about
constraints in Chapter 2.


                   You may come across the term triple constraints in your studies. The term
                   refers to scope, schedule, and cost constraints. However, please note that
                   the PMBOK(R) Guide also calls constraints competing constraints , and notes
                   that the primary competing demands on projects are scope, schedule,
                   cost, risk, resources, and quality.
24        Chapter 1      What Is a Project?



   Teams are formed and often colocated, which means team members physically work at
the same location. Project team members report to the project manager, not to a functional
or departmental manager. One obvious drawback to a project-oriented organization is
that project team members might find themselves out of work at the end of the project. An
example of this might be a consultant who works on a project until completion and then is
put on the bench or let go at the end of the project. Some inefficiency exists in this kind of
organization when it comes to resource utilization. If you have a situation where you need a
highly specialized skill at certain times throughout the project, the resource you're using to
perform this function might be idle during other times in the project.
   In summary, you can identify project-oriented organizations in several ways:
     Project managers have high to ultimate authority over the project.
     The focus of the organization is the project.
     The organization's resources are focused on projects and project work.
     Team members are colocated.
     Loyalties are formed to the project, not to a functional manager.
     Project teams are dissolved at the conclusion of the project.




The Project-Oriented Graphic Artist

You've been appointed project manager for your company's website design and imple-
mentation. You're working in a project-oriented organization, so you have the authority
to acquire and assign resources. You put together your team, including programmers,
technical writers, testers, and business analysts. Julianne, a highly qualified graphic arts
designer, is also part of your team. Julianne's specialized graphic arts skills are needed
only at certain times throughout the project. When she has completed the graphic design
portion of the screen she's working on, she doesn't have anything else to do until the next
page is ready. Depending on how involved the project is and how the work is structured,
days or weeks might pass before Julianne's skills are needed. This is where the ineffi-
ciency occurs in a purely project-oriented organization. It's not practical to let her go and
then hire her back when she's needed again.

In this situation, you might assign Julianne to other project duties when she's not work-
ing on graphic design. Perhaps she can edit the text for the web pages or assist with the
design of the upcoming marketing campaign. You might also share her time with another
project manager in the organization.

During the Planning process, you will discover the skills and abilities of all your team
members so that you can plan their schedules accordingly and eliminate idle time.

Matrix Organizations
Matrix organizations came about to minimize the differences between, and take advantage
of, the strengths and weaknesses of functional and project-oriented organizations. The idea
at play here is that the best of both organizational structures can be realized by combining
them into one. The project objectives are fulfilled and good project management techniques
are utilized while still maintaining a hierarchical structure in the organization.
   Employees in a matrix organization oftentimes report to one functional manager and to at
least one project manager. It's possible that employees could report to multiple project man-
agers if they are working on multiple projects at one time. Functional managers pick up the
administrative portion of the duties and assign employees to projects. They also monitor the
work of their employees on the various projects. Project managers are responsible for execut-
ing the project and giving out work assignments based on project activities. Project managers
and functional managers share the responsibility of performance reviews for the employee.


                 In a nutshell, in a matrix organization, functional managers assign
                 employees to projects, whereas project managers assign tasks
                 associated with the project.

   Matrix organizations have unique characteristics. We'll look at how projects are
conducted and managed and how project and functional managers share the work in this
organizational structure next.

Project Focus in a Matrix Organization
Matrix organizations allow project managers to focus on the project and project work just
as in a project-oriented organization. The project team is free to focus on the project objec-
tives with minimal distractions from the functional department.
    Project managers should take care when working up activity and project estimates for the
project in a matrix organization. The estimates should be given to the functional managers
for input before publishing. The functional manager is the one in charge of assigning or free-
ing up resources to work on projects. If the project manager is counting on a certain employee
to work on the project at a certain time, the project manager should determine their availabil-
ity up front with the functional manager. Project estimates might have to be modified if it's
discovered that the employee they were counting on is not available when needed.

Balance of Power in a Matrix Organization
As we've discussed, a lot of communication and negotiation takes place between the project
manager and the functional manager. This calls for a balance of power between the two, or
one will dominate the other.
   In a strong matrix organization, the balance of power rests with the project manager.
They have the ability to strong-arm the functional managers into giving up their best
resources for projects. Sometimes, more resources than necessary are assembled for the
project, and then project managers negotiate these resources among themselves, cutting out
the functional manager altogether, as you can see in Figure 1.4.

   On the other end of the spectrum is the weak matrix (see Figure 1.5). As you would sus-
pect, the functional managers have the majority of power in this structure. Project manag-
ers are really project coordinators or expeditors with part-time responsibilities on projects
in a weak matrix organization. Project managers have limited authority, just as in the func-
tional organization. On the other hand, the functional managers have a lot of authority and
make all the work assignments. The project manager simply expedites the project.

   In between the weak matrix and the strong matrix is an organizational structure called
the balanced matrix (see Figure 1.6). The features of the balanced matrix are what I've
been discussing throughout this section. The power is balanced between project managers
and functional managers. Each manager has responsibility for their parts of the project or
organization, and employees are assigned to projects based on the needs of the project, not
the strength or weakness of the manager's position.

   Matrix organizations have subtle differences, and it's important to understand their dif-
ferences for the PMP(R) exam. The easiest way to remember them is that the weak matrix has
many of the same characteristics as the functional organization, whereas the strong matrix has
many of the same characteristics as the project-oriented organization. The balanced matrix is
exactly that--a balance between weak and strong, where the project manager shares authority
and responsibility with the functional manager. Table 1.4 compares all three structures.

    Most organizations today use some combination of the organizational structures
described here. They're a composite of functional, project-oriented, and matrix structures.
It's rare that an organization would be purely functional or purely project-oriented. Project-
oriented structures can coexist within functional organizations, and most composite orga-
nizations are a mix of functional and project-oriented structures.
    In the case of a high-profile, critical project, the functional organization might appoint
a special project team to work only on that project. The team is structured outside the
bounds of the functional organization, and the project manager has ultimate authority for
the project. This is a workable project management approach and ensures open communi-
cation between the project manager and team members. At the end of the project, the proj-
ect team is dissolved, and the project members return to their functional areas to resume
their usual duties.

Other Organizational Structures
A simple, or organic, organizational structure is one that is flexible and tends to be fluid
depending on the situation. People usually work in close proximity in this type of structure.
A virtual organizational structure is one where people are not physically together at the same
place but are connected via a corporate network or the Internet or both. Hybrid structures,
as you can imagine, take on aspects of two or more structures.
        Understanding Project Life Cycles and Project Management Processes                         29




Project-Based Organizations
Remember that a PMO is another type of organizational structure, and along those lines,
there is one more structure we should talk about called a project-based organization (PBO).
A PBO is a temporary structure an organization puts into place to perform the work of the
project. A PBO can exist in any of the organizational structure types we've just discussed.
Most of the work of a PBO is project-based and can involve an entire organization or a
division within an organization. The important thing to note about PBOs for the exam is
that a PBO measures the success of the final product, service, or result of the project by
bypassing politics and position and thereby weakening the red tape and hierarchy within
the organization. This is because the project team works within the PBO and takes its
authority from there.
   Organizations are unique, as are the projects they undertake. Understanding the orga-
nizational structure will help you, as a project manager, with the cultural influences and
communication avenues that exist in the organization to gain cooperation and successfully
bring your projects to a close.

Understanding Project Life Cycles and
Project Management Processes
Project life cycles are similar to the life cycle that parents experience raising their children to
adulthood. Children start out as infants and generate lots of excitement wherever they go.
However, not much is known about them at first. So, you study them as they grow, and you
assess their needs. Over time, they mature and grow (and cost a lot of money in the process)
until one day the parents' job is done.
   Projects start out just like this and progress along a similar path. Someone comes up
with a great idea for a project and actively solicits support for it. The project, after being
approved, progresses through the intermediate phases to the ending phase, where it is com-
pleted and closed out.


Project Phases
Most projects are divided into phases, and all projects, large or small, have a similar project
life cycle structure. A project phase generally consists of segments of work that allow for
30        Chapter 1      What Is a Project?



easier management, planning, and control of the work and generally produce at least one
deliverable by the end of the phase. The work and the deliverables produced during a phase
are typically unique to that phase. Some projects may consist of one phase, and others may
have many phases.
    Project phases are determined in any number of ways. For example, the PMO may have
predefined phases based on stakeholder or management needs. The type of project itself
and the industry you're in may drive the phases of the project, as could decision points
such as milestone completion or go/no-go decisions. The number of phases in the project
life cycle depends on the project complexity and the industry you're in. According to the
PMBOK(R) Guide, phases are described by such attributes as name, number, duration,
resource requirements, and entrance and exit criteria. For example, information technology
projects might progress through phases named this way: requirements, design, develop-
ment, test, and implement.
    Many industries use a feasibility study as one of the first phases of the project (this is
also another potential phase name). A feasibility study is used to determine whether the
project is worth undertaking and whether the project will be profitable to the organiza-
tion. It's a preliminary assessment of the viability of the project; the viability or perhaps
marketability of the product, service, or result of the project; and the project's value to the
organization. It might also determine whether the product, service, or result of the project
is safe and meets industry or governmental standards and regulations. The completion and
approval of the feasibility study triggers the beginning of the requirements phase, where
requirements are documented and then handed off to the design phase, where blueprints
are produced, and so on through the phases. The feasibility study might also show that the
project is not worth pursuing and the project is then terminated; therefore, the next phase
never begins.

Phase Reviews
Project phases evolve through the life cycle in a series of phase sequences called handoffs, or
technical transfers. For projects that consist of sequential phases, the end of one phase typi-
cally marks the beginning of the next.
   A phase review should be held at the end of each phase. This allows the project manager,
stakeholders, and project sponsor the opportunity to determine whether the project should
continue to the next phase. They will examine the progress performance to date against the
project charter, the business case, the project management plan, and the benefits manage-
ment plan. As each phase is completed, it's handed off to the next phase.
   For example, as we've discussed, a deliverable produced in the beginning phase of a proj-
ect might be the feasibility study. Producing, verifying, and accepting the feasibility study
will signify the ending of this phase of the project. The successful conclusion of one phase
does not guarantee authorization to begin the next phase. Let's say our feasibility study
was performed for a construction project. The study showed that environmental impacts of
a serious nature would result if the construction project were undertaken at the proposed
location. Based on this information, a go or no-go decision can be made at the end of the
phase. Phase reviews give the project manager the ability to discover, address, and take cor-
rective action against errors discovered during the phase.
         Understanding Project Life Cycles and Project Management Processes                        31




                   The PMBOK(R) Guide states that phase reviews are also known by a few
                   other names: phase gate, phase entrance, phase exit , stage gate, and
                   kill points .

Phase Completion
You will recognize phase completion because each phase has a specific deliverable, or mul-
tiple deliverables, that marks the end of the phase. A deliverable is an output that must be
produced, verified, and approved to bring the phase, life-cycle process, or project to comple-
tion. Deliverables are unique and verifiable and may be tangible or intangible, such as the
ability to carry out a service. Deliverables might also include things such as design docu-
ments, project budgets, blueprints, project schedules, prototypes, and so on.

Multiphased Projects
Projects may consist of one or more phases. The phases of a project are often performed
sequentially, but there are situations where performing phases concurrently, or overlapping
the start date of a sequential phase, can benefit the project. Multiple phases allow the team
to analyze project performance and take action in concurrent and later phases to correct or
prevent the problems that occurred previously. According to the PMBOK(R) Guide, there are
three ways project life-cycle phases could be performed:
Sequential   One phase must finish before the next phase can begin.
Iterative More than one phase is being performed at the same time.
Overlapping One phase starts before the prior phase completes.
   Sometimes phases are overlapped to shorten or compress the project schedule. This is
called fast tracking. Fast tracking means that a later phase is started prior to completing
and approving the phase, or phases, that comes before it. This technique is used to shorten
the overall duration of the project.


Project Life Cycles
All the collective phases the project progresses through from the start of the project until the
end are called the project life cycle. Project life cycles are similar for all projects regardless of
their size or complexity.
    The phases that occur within the project life cycle are sequential and sometimes overlap
each other, as we discussed in the previous section. Most projects consist of the following
life-cycle structure (not to be confused with the project management process groups that
we'll discuss in the section "Project Management Process Groups"):
    Beginning the project
    Planning and organizing the work of the project
    Performing the work of the project
    Closing out the project
32        Chapter 1      What Is a Project?



   A development life cycle consists of the phases of the project associated with producing
the product, service, or result of the project. A development life cycle is performed within
the project life cycle.


                  Don't confuse a product life cycle with a project life cycle. A product life
                  cycle consists of the phases that represent the development of a product
                  idea to market delivery and eventually to retirement of the product. A
                  project life cycle is the series of phases from the start of a project until
                  the end. Product and project life cycles are independent of each other.

Life Cycle Categories
According to the PMBOK(R) Guide, there are four categories of development life cycles and
two categories of project life cycles. Each contains the phases we just discussed (beginning,
planning, performing, closing). Let's look at the development life cycles first.
Predictive Development Life Cycle (Also Known as Plan-Driven Life Cycle or Waterfall)
The predictive development life-cycle approach defines the scope or deliverable at the begin-
ning of the life cycle. Changes are monitored closely and typically permitted only if they are
essential for completing the product of the project. The entire life cycle is completed before
moving on to the remaining project phases.
Iterative Development Life Cycle Project deliverables are defined early in the development
life cycle and progressively elaborated as the project, or life cycle, progresses. Schedule and
cost estimates are continually modified as the final product, service, or result of the project
becomes clear. The product of the project continues to evolve by adding functionality during
repeating, iterative cycles.
Incremental Development Life Cycle The incremental development life cycle is similar to
iterative, but the incremental approach uses predetermined periods of time called iterations
(not to be confused with the iterative life cycle) to complete the deliverable. During each
iteration, new functionality is introduced. The deliverable is considered complete after the
final iteration is finished.
Iterative and incremental development life cycles are a perfect choice for large projects, for
complex projects (these life-cycle processes will reduce the complexity), for projects where
changing objectives and scope are known ahead of time, or for projects where deliverables
need to be delivered incrementally.
Hybrid Development Life Cycle This development life cycle is a combination of a predic-
tive and adaptive life cycle (adaptive in the development life cycle refers to an iterative or
incremental life cycle). Typically, the elements of the deliverable that are well known at the
beginning of the life cycle will follow a predictive approach whereas the elements that are
not clear at that stage will follow either an incremental or an iterative approach.
   Project life cycles are either predictive or adaptive. Remember that a development life
cycle can be performed within the project life cycle so you may use more than one life-cycle
        Understanding Project Life Cycles and Project Management Processes                       33




approach during the course of the project. For example, the development life cycle might
be incremental whereas the project life cycle might be predictive. We discussed predictive
in the context of the development life cycle, so next we'll look at it from a project life-cycle
approach and also examine the adaptive approach.
Predictive Life Cycle (Also Known as Plan-Driven Life Cycle or Waterfall) The project
scope is defined at the beginning of the project and changes are monitored closely. If changes
are made, you must revisit and modify project plans and formally accept the changes to the
scope and subsequent project management plan. The work of each phase is usually distinct
and not repeated in other phases. Schedules and budgets are defined early in the life cycle as
well. Each phase has an emphasis on a different portion of the project activities, and differ-
ent project management process groups are performed during each phase.
Adaptive Life Cycles (Also Known as Agile or Change-Driven Life Cycle) Adaptive life
cycles are incremental or iterative. The scope is defined at the beginning of an iteration
(predetermined periods of time) and is progressively elaborated over future iterations.
Choose this method when active participation of your stakeholders is required throughout
the project, when you are not certain of all the requirements at the beginning of the project,
or when you work in a changing environment. This life cycle produces deliverables, or por-
tions of deliverables, in short periods of time. Each iteration must produce something that is
ready for release at the end of the time period, and as such, the time period and the resources
are fixed. All iterations require the Planning process group, and most will perform all of the
project management process groups.

Life Cycle Characteristics
Project phases are performed within a project life cycle, as I mentioned earlier. Project life
cycles typically consist of initiating the project, performing the work of the project, and so
on. As a result, most projects have the following characteristics in common:
    In the beginning of the project life cycle, when the project is initiated, costs are low,
    and few team members are assigned to the project.
    As the project progresses, costs and staffing increase and then taper off at closing.
    The potential that the project will come to a successful ending is lowest at the begin-
    ning of the project; its chance for success increases as the project progresses through its
    phases and life-cycle stages.
    Risk is highest at the beginning of the project and gradually decreases the closer the
    project comes to completion.
    Stakeholders have the greatest chance of influencing the project and the characteristics
    of the product, service, or result of the project in the beginning phases and have less
    and less influence as the project progresses.
   This same phenomenon exists within the project management processes as well. We'll
look at those next.
34        Chapter 1      What Is a Project?




Project Management Process Groups
Project management processes organize and describe the work of the project. The PMBOK(R)
Guide describes five process groups used to accomplish this end. These processes are per-
formed by people and are interrelated and dependent on one another.
   These are the five project management process groups that the PMBOK(R) Guide
documents:
     Initiating
     Planning
     Executing
     Monitoring and Controlling
     Closing
    All these process groups have individual processes that collectively make up the group.
For example, the Initiating process group has two processes called Develop Project Charter
and Identify Stakeholders. Collectively, these process groups--including all their individual
processes--make up the project management process. Projects, or each phase of a project, start
with the Initiating process and progress through all the processes in the Planning process
group, the Executing process group, and so on, until the project is successfully completed or
it's canceled. All projects must complete the Closing processes, even if a project is killed.
    Let's start with a high-level overview of each process group. The remainder of this book
will cover each of these processes in detail. If you want to peek ahead, Appendix B, "Process
Inputs and Outputs," lists each of the process groups, the individual processes that make
up each process group, and the Knowledge Areas in which they belong. (I'll introduce
Knowledge Areas in the section "Exploring the Project Management Knowledge Areas," in
Chapter 2.)



Project Phases vs. Project Management Process Groups

Don't confuse project phases and project life cycles with the project management pro-
cess groups. Project phases and life cycles describe how the work associated with the
product of the project will be completed. For example, a construction project might have
phases such as feasibility study, design, build, inspection, and turnover. The five project
management process groups (Initiating, Planning, Executing, Monitoring and Controlling,
and Closing) organize and describe how the project activities will be conducted in order
to meet the project requirements. These processes are generally performed for each
phase of a large project. The five process groups are the heart of the PMBOK(R) Guide and
the exam. As you progress through this book, be certain you understand each of these
processes as they're described in the PMBOK(R) Guide.



Initiating The Initiating process group, as its name implies, occurs at the beginning of the
project and at the beginning of each project phase for large projects. Initiating acknowl-
edges that a project, or the next project phase, should begin. This process group grants the
        Understanding Project Life Cycles and Project Management Processes                   35




approval to commit the organization's resources to working on the project or phase and
authorizes the project manager to begin working on the project. The outputs of the Initiating
process group, including the project charter and identification of the stakeholders, become
inputs into the Planning process group.
Planning The Planning process group includes the processes for formulating and revising
project goals and objectives and creating the project management plan that will be used to
achieve the goals the project was undertaken to address. The Planning process group also
involves determining alternative courses of action and selecting from among the best of
those to produce the project's goals. This process group is where the project requirements are
fleshed out. Planning has more processes than any of the other project management process
groups. To carry out their functions, the Executing, Monitoring and Controlling, and Closing
process groups all rely on the Planning processes and the documentation produced during
the Planning processes. Project managers will perform frequent iterations of the Planning
processes prior to project completion. Projects are unique and, as such, have never been done
before. Therefore, planning must encompass all areas of project management and consider
budgets, activity definition, scope planning, schedule development, risk identification, staff
acquisition, procurement planning, and more. The greatest conflicts a project manager will
encounter in this process group are project prioritization issues.
Executing The Executing process group involves putting the project management plan into
action. It's here that the project manager will coordinate and direct project resources to meet
the objectives of the project management plan. The Executing processes keep the project on
track and ensure that future execution of project plans stays in line with project objectives.
This process group is typically where approved changes are implemented. The Executing
process group will utilize the most project time and resources, and as a result, costs are usu-
ally highest during the Executing processes. Project managers will experience the greatest
conflicts over schedules in this cycle.
Monitoring and Controlling The Monitoring and Controlling process group is where
project performance measurements are taken and analyzed to determine whether the project
is staying true to the project management plan. The idea is to identify problems as soon as
possible and apply corrective action to control the work of the project and ensure successful
outcomes. For example, if you discover that variances exist, you'll apply corrective action to
get the project activities realigned with the project management plan. This might require ad-
ditional passes through the Planning processes to adjust project activities, resources, sched-
ules, budgets, and so on.


                  Monitoring and Controlling is used to track the progress of work being
                  performed and identify problems and variances within a process group as
                  well as the project as a whole.

Closing The Closing process group is probably the most often skipped process group
in project management. Closing brings a formal, orderly end to the activities of a project

ready to move on to the next project. However, Closing is important because all the project

information is gathered and stored for future reference. The documentation collected during
the Closing process group can be reviewed and used to avert potential problems on future
projects. Formal acceptance and approval are obtained from project stakeholders.



Exam Spotlight

The project manager and project team are responsible for determining which processes
within each process group are appropriate for the project on which you're working. This
is called tailoring. You should consider the size and complexity of the project and the
various inputs and outputs of each of the processes when determining which processes
to implement and perform. Small projects might not require all of the processes within
a process group or the same level of rigor of a large project. Every process should be
addressed, and it should be determined whether the process is appropriate for the proj-
ect at hand and, if so, what level of implementation is required. Use your judgment when
deciding which processes to follow, particularly for small projects.


Characteristics of the Process Groups
The progression through the project management process groups exhibits the same char-
acteristics as progression through the project phases. That is, costs are lowest during the
Initiating processes, and few team members are involved. Costs and staffing increase in the
Executing process group and then decrease as you approach the Closing process group. The
chances for success are lowest during Initiating and highest during Closing. The chances for
risks occurring are higher during Initiating, Planning, and Executing, but the impacts of risks
are greater during the later processes. Stakeholders have the greatest influence during the Ini-
tiating and Planning processes and less and less influence as you progress through Executing,
Monitoring and Controlling, and Closing. For a better idea of when certain characteristics
influence a project, refer to Table 1.5.

The Process Flow
You should not think of the five process groups as onetime processes that are performed
as discrete elements. Rather, these processes interact and overlap with each other. They are
iterative and might be revisited and revised several times as the project is refined throughout
its life. The PMBOK(R) Guide calls this process of going back through the process groups
an iterative process. The conclusion of each process group allows the project manager and
stakeholders to reexamine the business needs of the project and determine whether the proj-
ect is satisfying those needs--and it is another opportunity to make a go or no-go decision.
    Figure 1.7 shows the five process groups in a typical project. Keep in mind that during
phases of a project, the Closing process group outputs can provide inputs to the Initiating
process group. For example, once the feasibility study discussed earlier is accepted or
closed, it becomes an input to the Initiating process group of the design phase.

             Monitoring and                Closing
             Controlling

    It's important to understand the flow of these processes for the exam. If you remember
the processes and their inputs and outputs, it will help you when you're trying to decipher
an exam question. The outputs of one process group may in some cases become the inputs
into the next process group (or the outputs might be a deliverable of the project). Sometimes
just understanding which process the question is asking about will help you determine the
answer. One trick you can use to memorize these processes is to remember syrup of ipecac.
This is an old-fashioned remedy for accidental poisoning that is no longer used today.
If you think of the Monitoring and Controlling process group as simply "Controlling,"
when you sound out the first initial of each of the process, it sounds like IPECC (Initiating,
Planning, Executing, Monitoring and Controlling, and Closing).
38        Chapter 1      What Is a Project?



   As I stated earlier, individual processes make up each of the process groups. For
example, the Closing process consists of the Close Project or Phase process. Each process
takes inputs and uses them in conjunction with various tools and techniques to produce
outputs.


                 It's outside the scope of this book to explain all the inputs, tools and
                 techniques, and outputs for each process in each process group
                 (although each is listed in Appendix B). You'll find all the inputs, tools
                 and techniques, and outputs detailed in the PMBOK(R) Guide, and I highly
                 recommend you become familiar with them.



Exam Spotlight

Understand each project management process group and all the processes that make up
these groups. Appendix B contains a table of all the processes, their inputs, their tools
and techniques, their outputs, and the Knowledge Area in which they each belong.


   You'll likely see test questions regarding inputs, tools and techniques, and outputs of
many of the processes within each process group. One way to keep them all straight is to
remember that tools and techniques usually require action of some sort, be it measuring,
applying some skill or technique, planning, or using expert judgment. Outputs are usually
in the form of a deliverable. Remember that a deliverable is characterized with results or
outcomes that can be verified. Last but not least, outputs from one process oftentimes serve
as inputs to another process.

Process Interactions
We've covered a lot of material, but I'll explain one more concept before moving on to Agile
project management. As stated earlier, project managers must determine the processes that
are appropriate for effectively managing a project based on the complexity and scope of the
project, available resources, budget, and so on. As the project progresses, the project man-
agement processes might be revisited and revised to update the project management plan as
more information becomes known. Underlying the concept that process groups are iterative
is a cycle the PMBOK(R) Guide describes as the Plan-Do-Check-Act cycle, which was origi-
nally defined by Walter Shewhart and later modified by Edward Deming. The idea behind
this concept is that each element in the cycle is results oriented. The results from the Plan
cycle become inputs into the Do cycle, and so on, much like the way the project management
process groups interact. The cycle interactions can be mapped to work with the five proj-
ect management process groups. For example, the Plan cycle maps to the Planning process
group. Before going any further, here's a brief refresher:
     Project phases describe how the work required to produce the product of the project
     will be completed.
        Understanding Project Life Cycles and Project Management Processes                   39



    Project management process groups organize and describe how the project activities
    will be completed in order to meet the goals of the project.
    The Plan-Do-Check-Act cycle is an underlying concept that shows the integrative
    nature of the process groups.
   Figure 1.8 shows the relationships and interactions of the concepts you've learned so far.
Please bear in mind that a simple figure can't convey all the interactions and iterative nature
of these interactions; however, I think you'll see that the figure ties the basic elements of
these concepts together.

Agile Project Management
Agile project management is a method of managing projects in small, incremental portions
of work that can be easily assigned, easily managed, and completed within a short period
of time called an iteration or sprint. Iterations or sprints (the terms are interchangeable) are
always time-bound. Typically, a sprint is a two-week period but can be any short period of
time defined and agreed on by the team. The goal of a sprint is to produce a deliverable, or a
tangible portion of a deliverable, by the end of the sprint.
   An Agile project management approach allows the team to quickly adapt to new require-
ments and allows for the continual assessment of the goals, deliverables, and functionality
of the product, service, or result of the project. Agile is used in software development for
similar reasons. The development team can quickly adapt to changes and new or refi ned
functionality requests. Small deliverables are completed in a limited time frame. In a highly
predictive or waterfall approach, the software program is defi ned in infi nite detail before
any coding starts. In this approach, it is very difficult to change requirements or incorpo-
rate new ideas. Sometimes months, if not years, of planning go into getting every detail of
the software program documented before it's handed off to the developers to start coding.
Typically, the end user won't see any deliverables or even a mock-up of the program until
the project is close to the end.
   Using an Agile approach, a development team or project team can assess results and
adjust processes in order to meet the new or modified requirements. Prototypes are deliv-
ered early and progress is made in each iteration.


                  Agile is a highly iterative approach where requirements can be
                  continually defined and refined based on continuous feedback from
                  the product owner.

   Agile has been around for many years in one form or another. In 2001, several software
developers converged to formalize the Agile approach. They published the Manifesto for
Agile Software Development, http://agilemanifesto.org/, and identified twelve princi-
ples that are the focus of any Agile approach. These principles include factors such as daily
interactions between the business and Agile teams, frequent deliverables, self-managed
teams, and more.
   One of the key principles in the Agile Manifesto is the focus on the value to the
customer. Instead of measuring how efficient a certain process runs or the quality of a
deliverable, attention is given to the value the customer perceives. For example, this value
may include a tangible deliverable that contains functionality that's critical to the suc-
cess of the project. Rather than measuring project success based on the "on time and on
budget" approach, success is measured by the progress made in incremental steps, and
the value that the functionality or deliverables bring to the stakeholders as the project is
progressively elaborated.

Project Life Cycles
Life cycles, as you'll recall from an earlier section in this chapter, are all the phases a project
progresses through from the beginning of the project to the end.
    Table 1.6 highlights the differences in the life cycles between an Agile approach (highly
adaptive) and a waterfall approach (highly predictive). The hybrid of the two methodologies
is listed in the middle of the chart. This hybrid column could read "It depends" for every
entry, because the more the organization leans toward predictive (versus adaptive), the
more the hybrid approach will behave as predictive does and will produce similar results. If
the approach is more predictive, the planning will be more methodical in the beginning of
the cycle with few changes. If it's more adaptive, the approach will be iterative and incre-
mental. The bottom portion of the table highlights the differences between these life cycles
and their interaction with each project process group.

Agile Roles and Responsibilities
Agile methodologies have many benefits, and one of the greatest is active stakeholder
involvement in all aspects of the project. Agile is a flexible approach that is highly interac-
tive. It encourages a great deal of communication between and among the team. It keeps the
stakeholders and project team members engaged and utilizes a facilitated process so the team
can interact on a daily basis. Agile teams are self-directed, adaptable, and aware of customer
needs. Agile teams are self-directed, adaptable, and aware of customer needs. The Agile
team consists of several members: Team facilitator, product owner, stakeholders, and cross-
functional team members. Here is a brief description of each.
Team Facilitator The team facilitator is also known as project manager, project team lead,
team coach, or Scrum master, Scrum is a type of Agile methodology and Scrum master is a
well known term referring to the team facilitator. I will use the term Scrum master through-
out the remainder of this book. The Scrum master coordinates the work of the sprint. They
also run interference between the team and distractions that might keep them from the work
at hand. Scrum masters are facilitators and help educate others in the Agile process. They
typically do not perform development tasks, but they assist the product owner in maintain-
ing the backlog, prioritizing work, and defining when the work is done. The Scrum master is
a facilitator and not a manager. Project team members do not report to the Scrum master.
Product Owner The product owner represents the stakeholders and is the liaison between
the stakeholders and the Scrum master. Product owners speak on behalf of the business
unit, customer, or the end user of the product and are considered the voice of the customer.
There should only be one product owner on the team. Communicating with the stakehold-
ers is a critical responsibility of product owners. They communicate progress and milestones
achieved. They determine project scope and schedule, and request the funding needed to
                                                         Agile Project Management              43




complete the work of the project. They manage and prioritize the backlog, which is essen-
tially a list of tasks or work components.
Stakeholders Stakeholders are people with a vested interest in the project or the outcomes
of the project. They interface with the product owner, who informs them of work progress.
Cross-functional team members Cross-functional team members are responsible for com-
pleting backlog items. They sign up for tasks based on the priority of the work and their
skill sets. They establish estimates for the work and take on enough tasks to fill the iteration
period. Agile teams are self-directed, self-organized, and self-managed.


Sprint Planning
A sprint (or iteration), which is a short, time-bound period of work, always starts with
a sprint planning meeting. During the meeting, team members choose items from the
backlog to work on during the sprint. The backlog is a list of requirements (both func-
tional and nonfunctional) for the project. The requirements are defined by documenting
user stories.
   The product owner prioritizes the backlog items based on business need, risk, and value
to the organization. The Agile team members break down large requirements into manage-
able portions of work that can be completed in a sprint.
   The backlog is reviewed at the beginning of each sprint, and new requirements
can be introduced, changes can be made to existing requirements, or some require-
ments might be deleted altogether. The product owner typically determines whether
a requirement should be added or removed from the backlog. Team members choose
which backlog items to work on during the sprint and how much of the work can be
accomplished during the sprint. Daily standups (discussed next) are held every day of
the sprint.
   The sprint items are easily managed with sticky notes on a whiteboard. The backlog
items (also known as user stories) are listed in the first column. The next column shows
the backlog items that will be worked during the sprint, followed by columns noting the
progress or stages the work is in. Last there is a column for completed work. Table 1.7 is an
example of a Kanban Board or Scrum Board.

   Many software programs are available that help manage the backlog items chosen for
the upcoming sprint in a more automated fashion. The software program can also create
a burn-down chart. A burn-down chart shows the remaining work effort (or time remain-
ing) for the sprint. It displays the time period of the sprint on the horizontal axis (usually
expressed as days) and the backlog items on the vertical axis (can be expressed as days or
hours). At the end of each day, team members update their estimates for the remaining
amount of work, which then updates the burn-down chart. Team members and stakeholders
can visually see the amount of work remaining in the sprint. Figure 1.9 shows a simplified
example of a burn-down chart.

Daily Standups or Scrum Meetings
Daily standups or Scrum meetings should be held at the same time and same place every day
and should be time limited, usually no more than 15 minutes. Team members must come
prepared to discuss the answers to three questions at each meeting:
     What did I accomplish yesterday?
     What will I work on today?
     Do I have any roadblocks or issues preventing me from doing my work?
  Standups are an important element in the Agile process. They keep the team informed
and alert the Scrum master of any obstacles in the way of completing tasks.

                 Daily standups are not status meetings for the product owner or the stake-
                 holders. This is a working meeting for the team members and the product
                 owner to determine what work was accomplished and what will be worked
                 on today.


Sprint Review and Retrospective
After the sprint has concluded, a sprint review is held with the team members, Scrum master,
product owner, customers, and management to review the work accomplished or completed
during the sprint. This may include a demonstration of functionality or a demonstration of
the design work completed during the sprint.
   After the sprint review, a sprint retrospective meeting with the team members, Scrum
master, and product owner is held to determine the following:
    Overall progress
    Changes that are needed to schedule or scope
    Ideas for improvement for the next sprint
    What worked well during this sprint
    To review lessons learned to determine how the next sprint, and future sprints, can be
    improved.
   If there are backlog items that were not completed during the current sprint, you'll want
to discuss this at the next sprint planning meeting. The product owner will use information
from this meeting to inform project stakeholders of the overall progress.


Other Methodologies
There are other methods of managing projects you may need to know about for the exam.
Scrum is an original form of Agile used for software development projects. It follows the
same processes discussed in this chapter.
   Waterfall is an approach where each phase of the project is completed in its entirety
before moving to the next phase. This can be a risky methodology because it leaves little
room for adding new requirements or functionality, and it doesn't perform reviews or test-
ing of the fi nal product until the end of the project. Final acceptance of the product also
occurs at the end of the project after all the deliverables are complete. With Agile or Scrum
there are continuous reviews and approvals throughout the project, and you will know
right away if you're off-track. You can use an iterative waterfall approach that will reduce
risk by completing components of work in a given time frame, but it is still less efficient and
effective than the Agile methodology. For the exam, you should know that the waterfall
and Agile methodologies each use an iterative approach.
   PRINCE2 stands for Projects in Controlled Environments version 2, and it incorporates
quality management into the project management processes. It is a comprehensive meth-
odology and is supported by the UK government. It's a methodology in which components
and processes are defi ned, but it does not use predefi ned project phases. PRINCE2 uses
product-based planning rather than project-based planning.

Understanding How This Applies
to Your Next Project
As you can tell from this first chapter, managing projects is not for the faint of heart. You
must master multiple skills and techniques in order to complete projects successfully. In your
day-to-day work environment, it probably doesn't matter much if you're working in a func-
tional or a strong matrix organization. More important are your communication, conflict
management, and negotiation and influencing skills. Good communication is the hallmark of
successful projects. (We'll talk more about communication and give you some communica-
tion tips in the coming chapters.)
    In any organizational structure, you'll find leaders and you'll find people who have the
title of leader. Again, the organizational structure itself probably isn't as important as
knowing who the real leaders and influencers are in the organization. These are the people
you'll lean on to help with difficult project decisions and hurdles.
    I talked about the definition of a project in this chapter. You'd be surprised how many
people think ongoing operations are projects. Here's a tip to help you explain the defini-
tion to your stakeholders: Projects involve the five project management process groups
(Initiating through Closing). Ongoing operations typically involve the Planning, Executing,
and Monitoring and Controlling processes. But here's the differentiator--ongoing opera-
tions don't include Initiating or Closing process groups because ongoing operations don't
have a beginning or an end.
    Most projects I've worked on involved more than one stakeholder, and stakeholders
often have conflicting interests. On your next project, find out what those stakeholder inter-
ests are. Resolving conflicts is easier at the beginning of the project than at the end. You'll
likely need both negotiating and influencing skills.
    I've made the mistake of thinking the project management process groups are overkill
for a small project. My team once embarked on a small project and thought that within a
matter of weeks we'd have it wrapped up and delivered. We neglected to get signatures from
the project requestor on the agreed-upon scope, and, you guessed it, the scope grew and
grew and changed several times before we were able to get the project back under control.
If you're reading between the lines here, you can also tell we didn't have adequate change
control in place. As you progress through the book, I'll highlight the important processes
you'll want to include on all projects, large and small, so you don't get caught in this trap.



Summary
Phew! We covered a lot of ground in this chapter. You learned that projects exist to bring
about a unique product, service, or result. Projects are temporary in nature and have definite
beginning and ending dates.
   Stakeholders are those people or organizations that have a vested interest in the outcome
of the project. Stakeholders include people such as the project sponsor, the customer, key
                                                                   Exam Essentials           47




management personnel, operations managers, the project manager, contractors, suppliers,
and more. Projects are considered complete when the project meets or exceeds the expecta-
tions of the stakeholders.
    Project management is a discipline that brings together a set of tools and techniques to
describe, organize, and monitor the work of project activities. Project managers are the
ones responsible for carrying out these activities. Projects might be organized into pro-
grams or portfolios and might be managed centrally by a PMO.
    Project managers have a wide variety of skills. They should be versed not only in the
field they're working in but in general management skills as well. Communication is the
most important skill a project manager will use in the course of a project.
    Organizational structures come in a variety of forms, such as functional, project-
oriented, and matrix. Functional organizations are traditional, with hierarchical reporting
structures. Project managers have little to no authority in this kind of organization. Project-
oriented organizations are structured around project work, and personnel report to project
managers. Project managers have full authority in this organizational structure. Matrix
organizations are a combination of the functional and project-oriented. A project manager's
authority varies depending on the structure of the matrix, be it a weak matrix, a balanced
matrix, or a strong matrix.
    A project manager's authority level, ability to manage the project budget, and availabil-
ity of staff are also influenced by the project manager's interactions within the hierarchy of
management (strategic, middle, and operations management) and the project management
maturity level of the organization.
    All projects have one or more phases and the progression of phases from the beginning
to the end of the project is known as a project life cycle. There are also development life
cycles that can occur within a project life cycle.
    The Agile project management methodology is a method of managing projects in small,
incremental portions of work that can be easily assigned, easily managed, and completed
within a short period of time called an iteration or sprint. The Scrum master, also known
as the team facilitator, project manager, project lead, or team coach helps the team to man-
age and organize work. Sprint planning meetings are held with the Scrum master, prod-
uct owner, and team members, who choose items from the backlog list to work on in the
upcoming sprint. Daily standups are held with team members, and the retrospective meet-
ing is held at the end of the sprint to discuss the work completed and what work will be
carried over to the next sprint.
    The project management process groups are performed throughout the project's life
cycle. The process groups described in the PMBOK(R) Guide are Initiating, Planning,
Executing, Monitoring and Controlling, and Closing.



Exam Essentials
Be able to describe the difference between projects and operations. A project is temporary
in nature with a definite beginning and ending date. Projects produce unique products, ser-
vices, or results. Operations are ongoing and use repetitive processes that typically produce
the same result over and over.

Be able to denote some of the skills every good project manager should possess. Communi-
cation, organizational, problem solving, negotiation and influencing, leading, team building,
technical, and business knowledge are skills a project manager should possess.
Be able to denote the skills listed in the PMI (R) Talent TriangleTM. The three skills are techni-
cal project management, leadership, and strategic and business management.
Be able to differentiate the organizational structures and the project manager's authority in each.
Organizations are usually structured in some combination of the following: functional, project-
oriented, and matrix (including weak matrix, balanced matrix, and strong matrix). Project
managers have the most authority in a project-oriented organization and the least amount of
authority in a functional organization.

6.   The VP of customer service has expressed concern over a project in which you're involved.
     His specific concern is that if the project is implemented as planned, he'll have to purchase
     additional equipment to staff his customer service center. The cost was not taken into con-
     sideration in the project budget. The project sponsor insists that the project must go for-
     ward as originally planned or the customer will suffer. Which of the following is true?
     A. The VP of customer service is correct. Since the cost was not taken into account at the
        beginning of the project, the project should not go forward as planned. Project initia-
        tion should be revisited to examine the project plan and determine how changes can be
        made to accommodate customer service.
     B.   The conflict should be resolved in favor of the customer.

    you that this project is not her top priority. What should you do to avoid situations like
    this in the future?
    A. Establish the business analyst's duties well ahead of due dates, and tell her you'll be
       reporting on her performance to her functional manager.
    B.   Establish the business analyst's duties well ahead of due dates, and tell her you are
         expecting her to meet these expectations because the customer is counting on the
         project meeting due dates to save significant costs on their annual mailings.

          The PMP(R) exam content from the
          Initiating the Project and Planning
          the Project domains covered in this
          chapter includes the following:

           Task 1. Perform project assessment based on available
           information, lessons learned from previous projects, and
           meetings with relevant stakeholders in order to evaluate
           the feasibility of new products or services within the
           given assumptions and/or constraints.

           Task 2. Identify key deliverables based on the business
           requirements in order to manage customer expectations
           and direct the achievement of project goals.

           Task 3. Perform stakeholder analysis using appropriate
           tools and techniques in order to align expectations and
           gain support for the project.

           Task 4. Identify high level risks, assumptions, and
           constraints based on the current environment,
           organizational factors, historical data, and expert
           judgment, in order to propose an implementation
           strategy.

           Task 5. Participate in the development of the project
           charter by compiling and analyzing gathered information
           in order to ensure project stakeholders are in agreement
           on its elements.

           Task 6. Obtain project charter approval from the sponsor,
           in order to formalize the authority assigned to the project
           manager and gain commitment and acceptance for the
           project.

           Task 7. Conduct benefit analysis with relevant
           stakeholders to validate project alignment with
           organizational strategy and expected business value.
 Task 8. Inform stakeholders of the approved project
 charter to ensure common understanding of the
 key deliverables, milestones, and their roles and
 responsibilities.

                                Now that you're armed with a detailed overview of project
                                management, you can easily determine whether your next
                                assignment is a project or an ongoing operation. You've learned
some of the basics of good project management techniques. Now you can start putting those
techniques into practice during the Initiating process group, which is where all projects start.
As you've probably already guessed, you'll be using some of the general management skills
outlined in Chapter 1, "What Is a Project?"
    One of the first skills you will put to use will be your communication skills. Are you
surprised? Of course you're not. It all starts with communication. You can't start defining
the project until you've first talked to the project sponsor, key stakeholders, and manage-
ment personnel. All good project managers have honed their communication skills to a nice
sharp edge.
    You'll remember from Chapter 1 that Initiating is the first process group in the five proj-
ect management process groups. You can think of it as the official project kickoff. Initiating
acknowledges that the project, or the next phase in an active project, should begin. This
process group culminates in the publication of a project charter and a stakeholder register.
I'll cover each in this chapter. But before we dive into the Initiating processes, we have one
more preliminary topic to cover regarding the 10 Knowledge Areas.
    At the end of this chapter, I'll introduce a case study that will illustrate the main points
of the chapter. I'll expand on this case study from chapter to chapter, and you'll begin
building a project using each of the skills you learn.



Exploring the Project Management
Knowledge Areas
We talked about the five process groups in Chapter 1. They are Initiating, Planning, Execut-
ing, Monitoring and Controlling, and Closing. Each process group is made up of a collec-
tion of processes used throughout the project life cycle. A Guide to the Project Management
Body of Knowledge (PMBOK(R) Guide), Sixth Edition, 2017 groups these processes into
10 categories that it calls the Project Management Knowledge Areas. These groupings, or
Knowledge Areas, bring together processes that have characteristics in common. For exam-
ple, the Project Cost Management Knowledge Area involves all aspects of the budgeting pro-
cess, as you would suspect. Therefore, processes such as Estimate Costs, Determine Budget,
and Control Costs belong to this Knowledge Area. Here's the tricky part: These processes
58        Chapter 2      Creating the Project Charter



don't belong to the same project management process groups (Estimate Costs and Determine
Budget are part of the Planning process group, and Control Costs is part of the Monitoring
and Controlling process group). Think of it this way: Knowledge Areas bring together pro-
cesses by commonalities, whereas project management process groups are more or less the
order in which you perform the project management processes (although remember that you
can come back through these processes more than once). The PMBOK(R) Guide names the
10 Knowledge Areas as follows:
     Project Integration Management
     Project Scope Management
     Project Schedule Management
     Project Cost Management
     Project Quality Management
     Project Resource Management
     Project Communications Management
     Project Risk Management
     Project Procurement Management
     Project Stakeholder Management
   Let's take a closer look at each Knowledge Area so you understand how they relate to
the process groups. Included in each of the following sections are tables that illustrate the
processes that make up the Knowledge Area and the project management process group
to which each process belongs. This will help you see the big picture in terms of process
groups compared to Knowledge Areas. I'll discuss each of the processes in the various
Knowledge Areas throughout the book, but for now, you'll take a high-level look at each of
them with the exception of the Project Integration Management Knowledge Area. Since this
chapter kicks off the processes in this Knowledge Area, we'll go a little deeper explaining
the purpose of integration in the next section.



Exam Spotlight

The PMP(R) exam may have a question or two regarding the processes that make up a
Knowledge Area. Remember that Knowledge Areas bring together processes by com-
monalities, so thinking about the Knowledge Area itself should tip you off to the pro-
cesses that belong to it. Projects are executed in process group order, but the Knowledge
Areas allow a project manager to think about groups of processes that require specific
skills. This makes the job of assigning resources easier because team members with spe-
cific skills might be able to work on and complete several processes at once. To broaden
your understanding of the Knowledge Areas, cross-reference the purposes and the pro-
cesses that make up each Knowledge Area with the PMBOK (R) Guide.

                 The descriptions, process names, and project management process
                 groups in the 10 Knowledge Areas described in this section are based on
                 content from the PMBOK (R) Guide .



Project Integration Management
The Project Integration Management Knowledge Area consists of seven processes, as shown
in Table 2.1.

Ta b l e 2 .1   Project Integration Management


Process name                                        Project management process group

Close Project or Phase                              Closing



    The Project Integration Management Knowledge Area is concerned with coordinating
all aspects of the project management plan and is highly interactive. This Knowledge Area
involves identifying and defi ning the work of the project and combining, coordinating, uni-
fying, and integrating the appropriate processes. Integration of these processes might occur
once, or multiple times as needed, or continuously throughout the project. For example,
obtaining resources for the project may occur at specific times when those skills or abilities
are needed so this process is repeated periodically. Or, processes that involve identifying
risks may occur throughout the life of the project until it's closed out or risks no longer
pose a threat so these processes are performed continuously throughout the project. It also
involves aligning deliverable due dates with the project life cycle and benefits management
plan. This Knowledge Area is also concerned with choosing among alternative approaches,
managing resource assignments, tailoring the processes, and performing trade-offs among
the competing demands of several projects. Phase transitions are carried out in this
Knowledge Area.
60        Chapter 2      Creating the Project Charter



   An example of integration across the Knowledge Areas is that project planning, execut-
ing, monitoring, and change control occur throughout the project and are repeated continu-
ously while you're working on the project. Project planning and executing involve weighing
the objectives of the project against the alternatives to bring the project to a successful
completion. The project manager also makes choices about how to effectively use resources
and how to coordinate the work of the project on a continuous basis. Monitoring the work
of the project involves anticipating potential problems and issues and dealing with them
before they reach the critical point. Change control can impact the project schedule, which
in turn impacts the work of the project, which in turn can impact the project management
plan, so you can see that these processes are tightly integrated.


                  According to the PMBOK (R) Guide, performing integration is a critical skill
                  that all project managers should possess.

   The project manager is responsible for managing the processes within the Project
Integration Management Knowledge Area. These processes should not be delegated. The
elements covered in this Knowledge Area include activities such as developing the project
management plan, performing change control, monitoring and reporting on project work,
directing and managing project work, managing project knowledge, and formally closing
out the project. It is also concerned with satisfactorily meeting the requirements of the cus-
tomer and stakeholder. These activities are all directly related to the processes found within
this Knowledge Area.
   Integration processes can be enhanced for both the project manager and stakeholders by
using automated project management tools, visual aids, and sharing project management
knowledge with others so that the knowledge or project and techniques are retained.
   Integration involves processes, knowledge, and people. According to the PMBOK(R)
Guide, integration occurs on three levels: the process level, cognitive level, and context
level.
Process Level Integration The process level is what we just discussed earlier in this sec-
tion. The integration of project processes may occur once, multiple times, or continuously
throughout the project, and processes may overlap one another.
Cognitive Level Integration The cognitive level factors in elements such as the complexity
of the project, the culture of the organization, the project size, and the complexity of the or-
ganization itself. Project managers' adeptness at understating these elements, along with their
technical project management skills, experience, and the other skills we discussed in Chap-
ter 1, will guide them in integrating the appropriate processes from the various Knowledge
Areas in a way that leads to the fulfillment of the project objectives.
Context Level Integration The context level refers to the business environment and its
culture and the environment or culture the business serves, including elements such as
technology, social networks, team make-up, and more. It's important that the project man-
ager understands these factors so that integration is performed in a way that relates to the
context level.
                            Exploring the Project Management Knowledge Areas                     61




                  Although all three levels of integration may involve process, knowledge,
                  and people, as you can see from these descriptions, the process level leans
                  more toward process integration, the cognitive level is more focused on
                  knowledge, and the context level emphasizes people.

   There isn't one right way to integrate processes. It is up to the project manager, using
his or her knowledge and consideration of the business environment, to determine and tai-
lor which project processes will interact with each other and integrate them appropriately.
Complex, high-risk projects require more rigor than smaller, low-risk projects will need.
When tailoring, consider the life-cycle process, development and management approaches,
change control and how changes will be managed, governance processes, lessons learned,
and the benefits gained using the tailored approach.
   Integration is managed and performed by the project manager when using an Agile proj-
ect management methodology. However, the planning, control, and delivery of the product
is managed by the Agile team. The project manager's role in performing integration within
an Agile approach entails the following:
    Providing an atmosphere of collaboration among the team members
    Assisting them in decision making
    Providing an environment that allows them to respond to change
    Project Integration Management uses visual tools to help present information about the
project and automated tools to assist in integrating processes and document project informa-
tion. The project management information system (PMIS) is an automated system used to
document the project management plan and subsidiary plans, to facilitate the feedback pro-
cess, and to revise the documents. It also incorporates the configuration management system
and the change control system. Later in the project, the PMIS can be used to control changes
to any of the plans. When you're thinking about the PMIS as an input to a process (generally
it's listed as part of the enterprise environmental factors input), think of it as a collection and
distribution point for information as well as an easy way to revise and update documents.
When you're thinking about the PMIS as a tool and technique, think of it just that way--as
a tool to facilitate the automation, collection, and distribution of data and to help monitor
processes such as scheduling, resource leveling, budgeting, and web interfaces.


Project Scope Management
The Project Scope Management Knowledge Area has six processes, as shown in Table 2.2.

Ta b l e 2 . 2   Project Scope Management


Process name                               Project management process group

62        Chapter 2      Creating the Project Charter



Ta b l e 2 . 2   Project Scope Management (continued)


Process name                             Project management process group

Define Scope                             Planning

Create WBS                               Planning

Validate Scope                           Monitoring and Controlling

Control Scope                            Monitoring and Controlling



   Project Scope Management is concerned with defi ning all the work of the project and
only the work needed to successfully achieve the project goals. These processes are highly
interactive. They defi ne and control what is and what is not part of the project. Each pro-
cess occurs at least once--and often many times--throughout the project's life.
   Project Scope Management encompasses both product scope and project scope. Product
scope concerns the characteristics of the product, service, or result of the project. It's mea-
sured against the product requirements to determine successful completion or fulfi llment.
The application area usually dictates the process tools and techniques you'll use to defi ne
and manage product scope. Project scope involves managing the work of the project and
only the work of the project. Project scope is measured against the project management
plan. The scope baseline is made up of the project scope statement, the work breakdown
structure (WBS), and the WBS dictionary.


                  To ensure a successful project, both product and project scope must
                  be well integrated. This implies that Project Scope Management is well
                  integrated with the other Knowledge Area processes.

   Collect Requirements, Defi ne Scope, Create WBS, Validate Scope, and Control Scope
involve the following:
     Defining and detailing the deliverables and requirements of the product of the project
     Creating a WBS
     Validating deliverables using measurement techniques
     Controlling changes to the scope of the project


Project Schedule Management
The Project Schedule Management Knowledge Area has six processes, as shown in Table 2.3.
                            Exploring the Project Management Knowledge Areas              63



Ta b l e 2 . 3      Project Schedule Management


Process name                                  Project management process group

Plan Schedule Management                      Planning

Define Activities                             Planning

Sequence Activities                           Planning

Estimate Activity Durations                   Planning

Develop Schedule                              Planning

Control Schedule                              Monitoring and Controlling



   This Knowledge Area is concerned with estimating the duration of the project activities,
devising a project schedule, and monitoring and controlling deviations from the schedule.
Collectively, this Knowledge Area deals with completing the project in a timely manner.
Time management is an important aspect of project management because it concerns keep-
ing the project activities on track and monitoring those activities against the project man-
agement plan to ensure that the project is completed on time.
   Although most processes in this Knowledge Area occur at least once in every project
(and sometimes more), in many cases--particularly on small projects--Sequence Activities,
Estimate Activity Durations, and Develop Schedule are completed as one activity. Only one
person is needed to complete these processes for small projects, and they're all worked on
at the same time.


Project Cost Management
As its name implies, the Project Cost Management Knowledge Area centers around costs and
budgets. Table 2.4 shows the processes that make up this Knowledge Area.

Ta b l e 2 . 4      Project Cost Management


Process name                                  Project management process group

Plan Cost Management                          Planning

Estimate Costs                                Planning

Determine Budget                              Planning

Control Costs                                 Monitoring and Controlling
64        Chapter 2      Creating the Project Charter



    The activities in the Project Cost Management Knowledge Area establish cost estimates
for resources, establish budgets, and keep watch over those costs to ensure that the project
stays within the approved budget. The earlier you can develop and agree on the scope of the
project, the earlier you can estimate costs. The benefit of this practice is that costs are more
easily influenced early in the project.
    This Knowledge Area is primarily concerned with the costs of resources, but you should
think about other costs as well. For example, be certain to examine ongoing maintenance
and support costs for software or equipment that may be handed off to the operations
group at the end of the project.
    Depending on the complexity of the project, these processes might need the involve-
ment of more than one person. For example, the finance person might not have expertise
about the resources documented in the staffing management plan, so the project manager
will need to bring in a staff member with those skills to assist with the activities in this
process.
    Two techniques are used in this Knowledge Area to decide among alternatives and
improve the project process: life-cycle costing and value engineering. The life-cycle costing
technique considers a group of costs collectively (such as acquisition, operations, disposal,
and so on) when deciding among or comparing alternatives. The value engineering tech-
nique helps improve project schedules, profits, quality, and resource usage and optimizes
life-cycle costs, among others. Value engineering, in a nutshell, involves optimizing project
performance and cost and is primarily concerned with eliminating unnecessary costs. By
examining the project processes, performance, or even specific activities, the project man-
ager can identify those elements that are not adding value and could be eliminated, modi-
fied, or reduced to realize cost savings. These techniques can improve decision making,
reduce costs, reduce activity durations, and improve the quality of the deliverables. Some
application areas require additional financial analysis to help predict project performance.
Techniques such as payback analysis, return on investment, and discounted cash flows are a
few of the tools used to accomplish this.


Project Quality Management
The Project Quality Management Knowledge Area is composed of three processes, as shown
in Table 2.5.

Ta b l e 2 . 5    Project Quality Management


Process name                                 Project management process group

Manage Quality                               Executing

Control Quality                              Monitoring and Controlling
                           Exploring the Project Management Knowledge Areas                 65




   The Project Quality Management Knowledge Area ensures that the project meets the
requirements that it was undertaken to produce. This Knowledge Area focuses on product
quality as well as on the quality of the project management processes used during the proj-
ect. These processes measure overall performance and monitor project results and compare
them to the quality standards set out in the project-planning process to ensure that the cus-
tomers will receive the product, service, or result they commissioned. It's easy to think that
this Knowledge Area only applies to manufacturing or construction type projects that pro-
duce a tangible product. According to the PMBOK(R) Guide, Project Quality Management
applies to all projects.


Project Resource Management
The Project Resource Management Knowledge Area consists of six processes, as shown in
Table 2.6.

Ta b l e 2 . 6   Project Resource Management


Process name                                 Project management process group

Plan Resource Management                     Planning

Estimate Activity Resources                  Planning

Acquire Resources                            Executing

Develop Team                                 Executing

Manage Team                                  Executing

Control Resources                            Monitoring and Controlling



   Project Resource Management involves all aspects of people management and personal
interaction, including leading, coaching, dealing with conflict, conducting performance
appraisals, and more. It also involves the management of physical resources. These pro-
cesses ensure that the physical and human resources assigned to the project are used in the
most effective way possible. Some of the project participants on whom you'll practice these
skills are stakeholders, team members, and customers. Each requires the use of different
communication styles, leadership skills, and team-building skills. A good project manager
knows when to enact certain skills and communication styles based on the situation.
   Projects are unique and temporary, and project teams usually are too. Teams are built
based on the skills and resources needed to complete the activities of the project, and many
times project team members might not know one another. The earlier you can involve team
members on the project, the better, because you'll want the benefit of their knowledge and
66        Chapter 2      Creating the Project Charter



expertise during the planning processes. Their participation early on will also help ensure
their buy-in to the project. Because the makeup of each team is different and the stakehold-
ers involved in the various stages of the project might change, you'll use different techniques
at different times throughout the project to manage the processes in this Knowledge Area.


Project Communications Management
The processes in the Project Communications Management Knowledge Area are related to
general communication skills, but they encompass much more than an exchange of informa-
tion. Communication skills are considered interpersonal skills that the project manager uses on
a daily basis. The processes in the Project Communications Management Knowledge Area seek
to ensure that all project information--including plans, risk assessments, meeting notes, and
more--is collected, organized, stored, and distributed to stakeholders, management, and project
members at the proper time. When the project is closed, the information is archived and used
as a reference for future projects. This is referred to as historical information in several project
processes. These activities involve developing and maintaining a solid communication strategy.
   Everyone on the project has some involvement with this Knowledge Area because all
project members will send and/or receive project communication throughout the life of the
project. It is important that all team members and stakeholders understand how communi-
cation affects the project. The communications management plan details how, when, what,
and with whom you'll communicate throughout the project.
   Three processes make up the Project Communications Management Knowledge Area, as
shown in Table 2.7.

Ta b l e 2 . 7   Project Communications Management


Process name                                    Project management process group

Manage Communications                           Executing

Monitor Communications                          Monitoring and Controlling




Time to Communicate

Project Communications Management is probably the most important Knowledge Area
on any project, and most project managers understand the importance of good com-
munication skills and making sure stakeholders are informed of project status. I know a
project manager who had difficulties getting time with the project sponsor. The project
sponsor agreed to meet with the project manager, even set up the meetings himself, and
then canceled them or simply didn't show up. The poor project manager was at wit's end
                          Exploring the Project Management Knowledge Areas                  67




about how to communicate with the sponsor and get some answers to the questions she
had. Her desk was not far outside the project sponsor's office. One day as she peeked
around the corner of her cube, she decided if the sponsor wouldn't come to her, she
would go to him. From then on, every time the sponsor left his office, she would jump up
from her chair and ride with him on the elevator. He was a captive audience. She was able
to get some easy questions answered and finally convince him, after the fourth or fifth
elevator ride, that they needed regular face-to-face meetings. She understood the impor-
tance of communication and went to great lengths to make certain the sponsor did too.



Project Risk Management
The Project Risk Management Knowledge Area, as shown in Table 2.8, contains seven
processes.

Ta b l e 2 . 8   Project Risk Management


Process name                                Project management process group

Plan Risk Management                        Planning

Identify Risks                              Planning

Perform Qualitative Risk Analysis           Planning

Perform Quantitative Risk Analysis          Planning

Plan Risk Responses                         Planning

Implement Risk Responses                    Executing

Monitor Risks                               Monitoring and Controlling



   Risks include both threats to and opportunities for the project. The processes in this
Knowledge Area are concerned with identifying, analyzing, and planning for potential
risks, both positive and negative, that might impact the project. This means minimizing the
probability and impact of negative risks while maximizing the probability and impact of
positive risks. These processes are also used to identify the positive consequences of risks
and exploit them to improve project objectives or discover efficiencies that might improve
project performance. All projects have risk, and the processes in this Knowledge Area
should not be skipped in order to speed up project progress.
   Project managers will often combine several of these processes into one step. For exam-
ple, Identify Risks and Perform Qualitative Risk Analysis might be performed at the same
time. The important factor of the Project Risk Management Knowledge Area is that you
68        Chapter 2      Creating the Project Charter



should strive to identify all the risks and develop responses for those with the greatest con-
sequences to the project objectives.


Project Procurement Management
There are three processes in the Project Procurement Management Knowledge Area, as
shown in Table 2.9.

Ta b l e 2 . 9    Project Procurement Management


Process name                                 Project management process group

Plan Procurement Management                  Planning

Conduct Procurements                         Executing

Control Procurements                         Monitoring and Controlling



   The Project Procurement Management Knowledge Area includes the processes involved
with purchasing goods or services from vendors, contractors, suppliers, and others outside
the project team. As such, these processes involve negotiating and managing contracts and
other procurement vehicles, and managing changes to the contract or work order. When dis-
cussing the Project Procurement Management processes, it's assumed that the discussion is
taking place from your perspective as a buyer, while sellers are external to the project team.
Interestingly, the seller might manage their work as a project, particularly when the work is
performed on contract, and you as the buyer become a key stakeholder in their project.


Project Stakeholder Management
There are four processes in the Project Stakeholder Management Knowledge Area, as shown
in Table 2.10.

Ta b l e 2 .1 0    Project Stakeholder Management


Process name                                 Project management process group

                                        Understanding How Projects Come About                  69




    The Project Stakeholder Management Knowledge Area is concerned with identifying
all of the stakeholders associated with the project, both internal and external to the orga-
nization. These processes also assess stakeholder needs, expectations, and involvement on
the project and seek to keep the lines of communication with stakeholders open and clear.
Remember from Chapter 1 that the definition of a successful project is one where the stake-
holders are satisfied. These processes ensure that stakeholder expectations are met, and that
their satisfaction is a successful deliverable of the project.
    The remainder of this book will deal with processes and process groups as they occur in
order (that is, Initiating, Planning, Executing, Monitoring and Controlling, and Closing),
because this is the way you will encounter and manage them during a project.



Understanding How Projects Come About
Your company's quarterly meeting is scheduled for today. You take your seat, and each of
the department heads gets up and gives their usual "We can do it" rah-rah speech, one after
the other. You sit up a little straighter when the CEO takes the stage. He starts his part of the
program pretty much the same way the other department heads did, and before long, you
find yourself drifting off. You are mentally reviewing the status of your current project when
suddenly your daydreaming trance is shattered. You perk up as you hear the CEO say, "And
the new phone system will be installed by Thanksgiving."
   Wait a minute. You work in the telecom department and haven't heard a word about this
project until today. You also have a funny feeling that you've been elected to manage this
project. It's amazing how good communication skills are so important for project managers
but not for...well, we won't go there.
   Project initiation is the formal recognition that a project, or the next phase in an exist-
ing project, should begin, and resources should be committed to the project. Unfortunately,
many projects are initiated the way the CEO did in this example. Each of us, at one time
or another, has experienced being handed a project with little to no information and told
to "make it happen." The new phone system scenario is an excellent example of how not to
initiate a project.
   Taking one step back leads you to ask, "How do projects come about in the first place?
Do CEOs just make them up like in this example?" Even though your CEO announced
this new project at the company meeting with no forewarning, no doubt it came about as a
result of a legitimate need. Believe it or not, CEOs don't just dream up projects just to give
you something to do. They're concerned about the future of the company and the needs of
the business and its customers.
   According to the PMBOK(R) Guide, projects are initiated by business leaders due to four
categories or factors that influence the organization:
    Regulatory compliance, legal requirements, or social requirements
    Stakeholder needs and requests
    Changing technology needs of the organization
    Creation or improvement of processes, services, or products
70        Chapter 2      Creating the Project Charter



   There are several needs or demands that bring about the creation of a project. Once
those needs and demands are identified, the next logical step might include performing a
feasibility study to determine the viability of the project. I'll cover these topics next.


Needs and Demands and Other Factors That Lead
to Project Creation
Organizations exist to generate profits or serve the public. To stay competitive, organizations
are always examining new ways of creating business, gaining efficiencies, or serving their
customers. Sometimes laws are passed to force organizations to make their products safer
or to make them less harmful to the environment. Projects might result from any of these
needs as well as from business requirements, opportunities, or problems. According to the
PMBOK(R) Guide, most projects will fit one of the seven needs and demands described next
and are included in the business case, which is an input to the Develop Project Charter pro-
cess. Let's take a closer look at each of these areas:
Market Demand The demands of the marketplace can drive the need for a project. For
example, a bank initiates a project to offer customers the ability to apply for mortgage loans
using a simple phone app because of a drop in interest rates and an increase in demand for
refinancing and new home loans.
Organizational Need The new phone system talked about earlier that was announced at
the quarterly meeting came about as a result of a business need. The CEO, on advice from
his staff, was advised that call volumes were maxed on the existing system. Without a new
system, customer service response times would suffer, and that would eventually affect the
bottom line.
Customer Request Customer requests run the gamut. Generally speaking, most compa-
nies have customers, and their requests can drive new projects. Customers can be internal
or external to the organization. Government agencies don't have external customers per se
(we're captive customers at any rate), but there are internal customers within departments
and across agencies.
Perhaps you work for a company that sells remittance-processing equipment and you've just
landed a contract with a local utility company. This project is driven by the need of the util-
ity company to automate its process or upgrade its existing process. The utility company's
request to purchase your equipment and consulting services is the project driver.
Technological Advance Many of us own a smartphone that keeps names and numbers
handy along with a calendar, a to-do list, and a plethora of other apps to help organize our
day or add a little fun in between meetings. I couldn't live without mine. However, a newer,
better version is always coming to market. Satellite communications, bigger screens, thinner
bodies, touch screens, video streaming, and more are all examples of technological advances.
Electronics manufacturers are continually revamping and reinventing their products to take
advantage of new technology (thank you!).

Legal Requirement Private industry and government agencies both generate new projects
as a result of laws passed during every legislative season. For example, new sales tax or
healthcare laws might require changes to the computer programs that support these systems.
The requirement that food labels on packaging describe the ingredients in the product, the
calories, and the recommended daily allowances is another example of legal requirements
that drive a project.
Ecological Impacts Many organizations today are undergoing a "greening" effort to reduce
energy consumption, save fuel, reduce their carbon footprint, and so on. Another example
might include manufacturing or processing plants that voluntarily remove their waste
products from water prior to putting the water back into a local river or stream to prevent
contamination. These are examples of environmental considerations that result in projects.
Social Need The last need is a result of social demands. For example, perhaps a developing
country is experiencing a fast-spreading disease that's infecting large portions of the popula-
tion. Medical supplies and facilities are needed to vaccinate and treat those infected with the
disease.

Understand the needs and demands that bring about a project.



   In addition to the needs and demands that may bring about a project, other factors are
outlined in the PMBOK(R) Guide that may also lead to project creation. Let's take a look at
those next.
Strategic Opportunity or Business Need An example here might include the acquisition
or merger of two business entities in order to expand market penetration. The business
may need to purchase or build a new warehouse, they may have a strategic opportunity to
expand into a new market, and so on. There are an unlimited number of business needs that
could bring about a project.
Competitive Forces We've all likely seen the better burger commercials and two-for-one
promotions, or maybe stood in line all night in the cold waiting to be one of the first to buy
the next new gadget. When one business develops new pricing structures or new products, or
offers more for the same, competing businesses must do something similar in order to stay
competitive. This can bring about the creation of projects.
Political Changes I have witnessed this example countless times in my career. A new gov-
ernment official is elected, or perhaps a change in power occurs in a legislative body, and
once they take office, they kill the projects that the previous office held dear and initiate their
own projects.
New Technology This category is like the technological advance category described earlier.
It can also include technology that will improve efficiencies within the organization, provide
a better customer experience, save money, increase revenues, and so on.
72        Chapter 2      Creating the Project Charter



Stakeholder Demands Stakeholder demands can create an infinite number of projects. There
is no limit to what they might need in order to support the organization or their customers.
Business Process Improvements This category of project creation can also bring about nu-
merous requests. For example, perhaps the organization currently uses a manual process for
travel authorization requests. To improve the business process, they request an automated
workflow and electronic signature so that travel requests can be routed electronically rather
than using paper.
Material Issues This need refers to issues that may occur with existing assets that require a
project to replace or fix. For example, a warehouse holding products ready to ship is hit by a
tornado. The building will need to be demolished and replaced.
   All of these needs and demands represent opportunities, business requirements, or prob-
lems that need to be solved. Each may also introduce risk to the project. Management must
decide how to respond to these needs and demands, which will more often than not initiate
new projects.




Project Initiation

Corey is an information technology manager who works for the National Park Service.
One warm spring Sunday morning, he is perusing the local newspaper online and comes
across an article about new services being offered at some of the national parks. He
perks up when he sees his boss's name describing the changing nature of technology
and how it impacts the types of services the public would like to see at the parks. Corey
knows that the public has been asking when wireless Internet services will be avail-
able in some of the larger parks and has also been involved in the discussions about the
resources needed to make this happen, but the project never has enough steam to get off
the ground. It seems that a higher-priority project always takes precedence. However, all
that changes when Corey sees the next sentence in the article: his boss promising wireless
access in two of the largest parks in their region by July 4. It looks like the customer requests
have finally won out, and Corey has just learned he has a new project on his hands.



Feasibility Studies
After the opportunity for a project becomes evident, the next step might be to initiate it,
which means you're ready to jump right into creating a business case followed by a project
charter for the project. Before you take that plunge, you should know that some organiza-
tions will require a feasibility study prior to making a final decision about starting the project.
   Feasibility studies are undertaken for several reasons. One is to determine whether the
project is a viable project. A second reason is to determine the probability of the project
succeeding. Feasibility studies can also examine the viability of the product, service, or
                                       Understanding How Projects Come About                  73




result of the project. For example, the study might ask, "Will the new lemon-flavored soda
be a hit? Is it marketable?" The study might also look at the technical issues related to
the project and determine whether the technology proposed is feasible, reliable, and easily
assimilated into the organization's existing technology structure.
   Feasibility studies are typically conducted as the fi rst phase of a project, but they might
also be conducted as separate projects or subprojects. When you don't have any precon-
ceived ideas about the outcome of the study, it's best to treat it as a separate project. The
group of people conducting the feasibility study should not be the same people who will
work on the project. Project team members might have built-in biases toward the project
and will tend to influence the feasibility outcome toward those biases.


                  It's always a good idea to meet with the sponsor, customer, and other
                  subject matter experts when evaluating the feasibility of new products or
                  services.


Performing Project Selection and Assessment
Most organizations don't have the luxury of performing every project that's proposed. Even
consulting organizations that sell their project management services must pick and choose
the projects on which they want to work. Selection and evaluation methods help organiza-
tions decide among alternative projects and determine the tangible benefits to the company
of choosing or not choosing the project.
   How projects are assessed will vary depending on the company, the people serving on
the selection committee, the criteria used, and the project. Sometimes the criteria for selec-
tion methods will be purely fi nancial, sometimes purely marketing, and sometimes they'll
be based on public perception or political perception. In most cases, the decision is based
on a combination of all these and more.
   Most organizations have a formal, or at least semiformal, process for selecting and
prioritizing projects. In my organization, a steering committee is responsible for project
review, selection, and prioritization. A steering committee is a group of folks consisting of
senior managers and sometimes mid-level managers who represent each of the functional
areas in the organization.




The Interactive voice response (Ivr) Tax-filing system

Jason, Sam, and Kate are web programmers working for the Department of Revenue in
the State of Bliss. Ron, their manager, approaches them one day with an idea.

"Team, business unit managers think it would be a great idea to offer motor vehicle own-
ers the ability to renew their license plates on their mobile phone. We already offer them
74        Chapter 2       Creating the Project Charter




the ability to file on the Internet, thanks to all your efforts on that project last year. It has
been a fabulous success. No other state has had the success that Bliss has had with our
Internet renewal system.

"Kate, I know you've had previous experience with IVR technology, but I'm not sure about
you guys, so this is new territory for us. I'd like to hear what each of you thinks about this
project."

Jason speaks up first. "I think it's a great idea. You know me; I'm always up for learning
new things, especially when it comes to programming. When can we start?"

Sam echoes Jason's comments.

"This technology is pretty sophisticated," Kate says. "Jason and Sam are excellent
coders and could work on the programming side of things, but I would have to pick
up the telephony piece on my own. After we're up and running, we could go over the
telephony portions step-by-step, so Jason and Sam could help me support it going
forward. I'd really like to take on this project. It would be good for the team and good for
the department."

Ron thinks for a minute. "Let's not jump right into this. I know you're anxious to get
started, but I think a feasibility study is in order. The senior director of the tax business
unit doesn't know whether this project is cost justified and has some concerns about its
life span. A feasibility study will tell us the answers to those questions. It should also help
us determine whether we're using the right technology to accomplish our goals, and it
will outline alternative ways of performing the project that we haven't considered. I don't
want Kate going it alone without first examining all the issues and potential impacts to
the organization."



   Here's how our process works: The steering committee requests project ideas from the
business staff and other subject matter experts prior to the beginning of the fiscal year.
These project ideas are submitted in writing and contain a high-level overview of the
project goals, a description of the deliverables, the business justification for the project, a
desired implementation date, what the organization stands to gain from implementing the
project, a list of the functional business areas affected by the project, and (if applicable) a
benefit-cost ratio analysis (I'll talk about that in a bit).
   A meeting is called to review the projects, and a determination is made on each project
about whether it will be included on the upcoming list of projects for the new year. Once
the no-go projects have been weeded out, the remaining projects are prioritized according
to their importance and benefit to the organization using a scoring model. The projects are
documented on an official project list, and progress is reported on the active projects at the
regular monthly steering committee meetings.
                                       Understanding How Projects Come About                   75




   In theory, it's a great idea. In practice, it works only moderately well. Priorities can and
do change throughout the year. New projects come up that weren't originally submitted
during the call for projects, and they must be added to the list. Reprioritization begins
anew, and resource alignment and assignments are shuffled. But again, I'm getting ahead
of myself. Just be aware that organizations usually have a process to recognize and screen
project requests, accept or reject those requests based on some selection criteria, and priori-
tize the projects based on some criteria.



Exam Spotlight

According to PMI(R), project selection is outside the scope of the project manager's role.
In reality, the project manager often participates in the decision and assists with analysis
and selection methods. For the exam, remember that project selection is performed by
the project sponsor, customer, or subject matter experts.



   I'll discuss several project selection methods next. Selection methods are one way the
sponsor or customer may choose between projects. The individual opinion, and power, of
selection committee members also plays a part in the projects the organization chooses to
perform. Don't underestimate the importance of the authority, political standing, and indi-
vidual aspirations of selection committee members. Those committee members who hap-
pen to carry a lot of weight in company circles, so to speak, are likely to get their projects
approved just because they are who they are. This is sometimes how project selection works
in my organization. How about yours?


Using Project Selection Methods
Project selection methods are concerned with the advantages or merits of the product of the
project. In other words, selection methods measure the value of what the product, service, or
result of the project will produce and how it will benefit the organization. Selection methods
involve the types of concerns about which executive managers are typically thinking. This
includes factors such as market share, financial benefits, return on investment, customer
retention and loyalty, and public perceptions. Most of these are reflected in the organiza-
tion's strategic goals. Projects, whether large or small, should always be weighed against the
strategic plan. If the project doesn't help the organization reach its goals (increased market
share, for example), then the project probably shouldn't be undertaken.
   There are generally two categories of selection methods: constrained optimization methods
(also known as mathematical models or calculation methods) and benefit measurement
methods (also known as decision models). Decision models examine different criteria used
in making decisions regarding project selection, whereas calculation methods provide a way
to calculate the value of the project, which is then used in project-selection decision making.
76        Chapter 2      Creating the Project Charter



Constrained Optimization Methods
For the exam, all you need to understand about constrained optimization methods is that
they use linear, dynamic, integer, nonlinear, and/or multi-objective programming in the
form of algorithms--or in other words, a specific set of steps to solve a particular problem.
These are complicated mathematical formulas and algorithms that are beyond the scope
of this book and require an engineering, statistical, or mathematical background to fully
understand. Organizations considering undertaking projects of enormous complexity might
use mathematical modeling techniques to make decisions regarding these projects. The vast
majority of project selection techniques will use the benefit measurement methods to make
project selection decisions.


exam spotlight

Project selection methods are also used to evaluate and choose between alternative ways
of performing the project.



Benefit Measurement Methods
Benefit measurement methods employ various forms of analysis and comparative approaches
to make project decisions. These methods include comparative approaches such as benefit-
cost ratio analysis, scoring models, and benefit contribution methods that include various
cash flow techniques and economic models. The end result you're looking for with this
method is whether the project will produce a sustained benefit realization for the organiza-
tion. The following methods may also be used and documented in the business case to use
as criteria for determining whether the project will provide value to the organization. You'll
examine several of these methods, starting with benefit-cost ratio analysis.

Benefit-Cost Ratio Analysis
One common benefit measurement method is the benefit-cost ratio analysis (BCR). The
name of this method implies what it does--it compares the cost to produce the product, ser-
vice, or result of the project to the benefit (usually financial in the form of savings or revenue
generation) that the organization will receive as a result of executing the project. Obviously,
a sound project choice is one where the costs to implement or produce the product of the
project are less than the financial benefits. How much less is the organization's decision.
Some companies are comfortable with a small margin, whereas others are comfortable with
a much larger margin between the two figures.


                  Benefit-cost ratio analysis is also known as cost-benefit analysis . The
                  techniques are the same.
                                       Understanding How Projects Come About                 77




   When examining costs for a benefit-cost ratio analysis, include the costs to produce the
product or service, the costs to take the product to market, and the ongoing operational
support costs. For example, let's say your company is considering writing and marketing a
database software product that will allow banks to dissect their customer base, determine
which types of customers buy which types of products, and then market more effectively to
those customers. You will take into account some of the following costs:
    The costs to develop the software, such as programmer costs, hardware costs, and
    testing costs
    Marketing costs such as advertising, traveling costs to perform demos at potential
    customer sites, and so on
    Ongoing costs such as having a customer support staff available during business hours
    to assist customers with product questions and problems
   Let's say the cost to produce this software plus the ongoing support costs total $5 million.
Initial projections look like the demand for this product is high. Over a three-year period,
which is the potential life of the software in its proposed form, projected revenues are
$12 million. Taking only the fi nancial information into account, the benefits outweigh the
costs of this project. This project should receive a go recommendation.


                 Projects of significant cost or complexity usually involve more than one
                 benefit measurement method when go or no-go decisions are being made
                 or one project is being chosen over another. Keep in mind that selection
                 methods can take subjective considerations into account as well--the
                 project is a go because it's the new CEO's pet project; nothing else needs
                 to be said.


Scoring Models
Another project selection technique in the benefit measurement category is a scoring model,
or weighted scoring model. My organization uses weighted scoring models not only to
choose between projects but also as a method to choose between competing bids on out-
sourced projects.
   Weighted scoring models are quite simple. The project selection committee decides on
the criteria that will be used on the scoring model--for example, profit potential, market-
ability of the product or service, or ability of the company to quickly and easily produce the
product or service. Each of these criteria is assigned a weight depending on its importance
to the project committee. More important criteria should carry a higher weight than less
important criteria.
   Then each project is rated on a scale from 1 to 5 (or some such assignment), with the
higher number being the more desirable outcome to the company and the lower number
having the opposite effect. This rating is then multiplied by the weight of the criteria factor
and added to other weighted criteria scores for a total weighted score. Table 2.11 shows an
example that brings this together.
78          Chapter 2       Creating the Project Charter

*5 = highest



     In this example, Project A is the obvious choice.

Cash Flow Analysis Techniques
The remaining benefit measurement methods involve a variety of cash flow analysis tech-
niques, including payback period, discounted cash flows, net present value, and internal rate
of return. We'll look at each of these techniques individually, and I'll provide you with a
crash course on their meanings and calculations.
Payback Period
The payback period (PBP) is the length of time it takes the company to recoup the initial
costs of producing the product, service, or result of the project. This method compares the
initial investment to the cash inflows expected over the life of the product, service, or result.
For example, say the initial investment on a project is $200,000, with expected cash inflows
of $25,000 per quarter every quarter for the first two years and $50,000 per quarter from
then on. The payback period is two years and can be calculated as follows:
      Initial investment = $200,000.
      Cash inflows = $25,000 x 4 (quarters in a year) = $100,000 per year total inflow.
      Initial investment ($200,000) - year 1 inflows ($100,000) = $100,000 remaining balance.
      Year 1 inflows remaining balance - year 2 inflows = $0.
      Total cash flow year 1 and year 2 = $200,000.
      The payback is reached in two years.
   The fact that inflows are $50,000 per quarter starting in year 3 makes no difference
because payback is reached in two years.
   The payback period is the least precise of all the cash flow calculations. That's because
the payback period does not consider the value of the cash inflows made in later years,
commonly called the time value of money. For example, if you have a project with a
                                       Understanding How Projects Come About                    79




five-year payback period, the cash inflows in year 5 are worth less than they are if you
received them today. The next section will explain this idea more fully.
Discounted Cash Flows
As I just stated, money received in the future is worth less than money received today.
The reason for that is the time value of money. If I borrowed $2,000 from you today and
promised to pay it back in three years, you would expect me to pay interest in addition to
the original amount borrowed. If you were a family member or a close friend, maybe you
wouldn't, but ordinarily this is the way it works. You would have had the use of the $2,000
had you not lent it to me. If you had invested the money (does this bring back memories of
your mom telling you to save your money?), you'd receive a return on it. Therefore, the fu-
ture value of the $2,000 you lent me today is $2,315.25 in three years from now at 5 percent
interest per year. Here's the formula for future value calculations:
    FV = PV(1 + i)n
   In English, this formula says the future value (FV) of the investment equals the present
value (PV) times (1 plus the interest rate) raised to the value of the number of time periods
(n) the interest is paid. Let's plug in the numbers:
    FV = 2,000(1.05)3
    FV = 2,000(1.157625)
    FV = $2,315.25
   The discounted cash flow technique compares the value of the future cash flows of the
project to today's dollars. To calculate discounted cash flows, you need to know the value
of the investment in today's terms, or the PV. PV is calculated as follows:
    PV = FV / (1 + i)n
  This is the reverse of the FV formula we talked about earlier. So, if you ask the question,
"What is $2,315.25 in three years from now worth today given a 5 percent interest rate?"
you'd use the preceding formula. Let's try it:
    PV = $2,315.25 / (1 + .05)3
    PV = $2,315.25 / 1.157625
    PV = $2,000
    $2,315.25 in three years from now is worth $2,000 today.
    Discounted cash flow is calculated just like this for the projects you're comparing for
selection purposes or when considering alternative ways of doing the project. Apply the PV
formula to the projects you're considering, and then compare the discounted cash flows of
all the projects against each other to make a selection. Here is an example comparison of
two projects using this technique:
    Project A is expected to make $100,000 in two years.
    Project B is expected to make $120,000 in three years.
80          Chapter 2      Creating the Project Charter



     If the cost of capital is 12 percent, which project should you choose?
     Using the PV formula used previously, calculate each project's worth:
      The PV of Project A = $79,719.
      The PV of Project B = $85,414.
   Project B is the project that will return the highest investment to the company and
should be chosen over Project A.
Net Present Value
Projects might begin with a company investing some amount of money into the project to
complete and accomplish its goals. In return, the company expects to receive revenues, or
cash inflows, from the resulting project. Net present value (NPV) allows you to calculate
an accurate value for the project in today's dollars. The mathematical formula for NPV is
complicated, and you do not need to memorize it in that form for the test. However, you do
need to know how to calculate NPV for the exam, so I've given you some examples of a less
complicated way to perform this calculation in Table 2.12 and Table 2.13 using the formulas
you've already seen.

   Net present value works like discounted cash flows in that you bring the value of future
monies received into today's dollars. With NPV, you evaluate the cash inflows using the
discounted cash flow technique applied to each period the inflows are expected instead of in
one sum. The total present value of the cash flows is then deducted from your initial invest-
ment to determine NPV. NPV assumes that cash inflows are reinvested at the cost of capital.
   Here's the rule: If the NPV calculation is greater than 0, accept the project. If the NPV
calculation is less than 0, reject the project.
   Look at the two project examples in Tables 2.12 and 2.13. Project A and Project B have
total cash inflows that are the same at the end of the project, but the amount of inflows at
each period differs for each project. We'll stick with a 12 percent cost of capital. Note that
the PV calculations were rounded to two decimal places.
   Project A has an NPV greater than 0 and should be accepted. Project B has an NPV less
than 0 and should be rejected. When you get a positive value for NPV, it means that the
project will earn a return at least equal to or greater than the cost of capital.
   Another note on NPV calculations: Projects with high returns early in the project are
better projects than projects with lower returns early in the project. In the preceding exam-
ples, Project A fits this criterion also.
Internal Rate of Return
The internal rate of return (IRR) is the most difficult equation to calculate of all the cash
flow techniques we've discussed. It is a complicated formula and should be performed on a
financial calculator or computer. IRR can be figured manually, but it's a trial-and-error ap-
proach to get to the answer.
   Technically speaking, IRR is the discount rate when the present value of the cash inflows
equals the original investment. When choosing between projects or when choosing alterna-
tive methods of doing the project, projects with higher IRR values are generally considered
better than projects with low IRR values.



Exam Spotlight

For the exam, you need to know three facts concerning IRR:

    IRR is the discount rate when NPV equals 0.
    IRR assumes that cash inflows are reinvested at the IRR value.
    You should choose projects with the highest IRR value.
82        Chapter 2      Creating the Project Charter



Applying Project Selection Methods
Now that we've discussed some of the project selection techniques, let's look at how to apply
them when choosing projects or project alternatives. You can use one, two, or several of the
benefit measurement methods alone or in combination to come up with a selection decision.
Remember that payback period is the least precise of all the cash flow techniques, NPV is
the most conservative cash flow technique, and NPV and IRR will generally bring you to the
same accept/reject conclusion.
   You can use project selection methods, and particularly the benefit measurement meth-
ods, to evaluate multiple projects or a single project. You might be weighing one project
against another or simply considering whether the project you're proposing is worth
performing.




Fun Days Vacation Resorts

Nick is a project manager for Fun Days Vacation Resorts. He is working on three differ-
ent project proposals to present to the executive steering committee for review. As part
of the information-gathering process, Nick visits the various resorts pretending to be a
guest. This gives him a feel for what Fun Days guests experience on their vacations, and
it better prepares him to present project particulars and alternatives.

Nick has prepared the project overviews for three projects and called on the experts in
marketing to help him out with the projected revenue figures. He works up the numbers
and finds the following:

     Project A: payback period = 5 years; IRR = 8 percent.
     Project B: payback period = 3.5 years; IRR = 3 percent.
     Project C: payback period = 2 years; IRR = 3 percent.

Funding exists for only one of the projects. Nick recommends Project A and predicts this is
the project the steering committee will choose since the projects are mutually exclusive.

Nick's turn to present comes up at the steering committee. Let's listen in on the action:

"On top of all the benefits I've just described, Project A provides an IRR of 8 percent, a full
5 percent higher than the other two projects we discussed. I recommend the committee
choose Project A."

"Thank you Nick," Jane says. "Good presentation." Jane is the executive chairperson of
the steering committee and has the authority to break ties or make final decisions when
the committee can't seem to agree.

"However, here at Fun Days we like to have our fun sooner rather than later." Chuckles
ensue from the steering committee. They've all heard this before. "I do agree that an
8 percent IRR is a terrific return, but the payback is just too far out into the future. There
are too many risks and unknowns for us to take on a project with a payback period this
long. As you know, our industry is directly impacted by the health of the economy. Any-
thing can happen in five years' time. I think we're much better off going with Project C. I
recommend we accept Project C. Committee members, do you have anything to add?"




Kicking Off the Project Charter
Your first stop in the Initiating process group is a process called Develop Project Charter.
As the name of the process suggests, your purpose is to create a project charter. As I talked
about in Chapter 1, the purpose for the Initiating group is to authorize a project, or the next
phase of a project, to begin. It also gives the project manager the authority to apply resourc-
es to the project. These are also the purposes of a project charter: formally authorizing the
project to begin and committing resources.


                  The charter contains several elements that I'll discuss in the section
                  "Formalizing and Publishing the Project Charter" later in this chapter.




exam spotlight

The project charter (which is an output of the Develop Project Charter process) is the writ-
ten acknowledgment that the project exists. The project charter documents the name of
the project manager and gives that person the authority to assign organizational resources
to the project. The project is officially authorized when the project charter is signed.


   As you'll discover, every process has inputs, tools and techniques, and outputs, and this
one is no exception. You'll start with the inputs. Let's get to it.
   Inputs to the project processes are typically documents or other information that are key
to the process. They come from one of two places: They are outputs from a previously com-
pleted process, or they are produced outside of the project. Inputs are used in combination
with the tools and techniques to produce the outputs of each process. Process outputs are
usually tangible, such as a report or an update or a list, for example. To get to the output, you
have to start with the inputs. Let's take a look at the Develop Project Charter process inputs:
    Business documents
         Business case
         Benefits management plan
84        Chapter 2       Creating the Project Charter



     Agreements
     Enterprise environmental factors
     Organizational process assets


Business Documents
There are two business documents that this process is referring to: the business case and the
benefits management plan. The business case documents the need for the project, and the
benefits management plan documents how the project will create, augment, or preserve and
improve its benefits to the organization. The benefits management plan is iterative and up-
dated throughout the life cycle of the project. The business case and the benefits management
plan are directly related to each other. We'll look at each of these documents next.

Business Case
The purpose of a business case is to understand the business need for the project and deter-
mine whether the investment in the project is worthwhile. The business case also contains the
financial analysis we discussed earlier in this chapter (such as NPV, ROI, IRR, PBP, and BCR),
and it describes the business need or demand that brought about the project. As a refresher,
these business needs or demands include market demand, organizational need, customer
request, technological advance, legal requirements, ecological impacts, and social needs.


                   According to the PMBOK (R) Guide, the business case is an economic feasi-
                   bility study. It is used to track progress and compare project results against
                   the success factors identified in the business case.

   Performing a needs assessment is a great fi rst step in building the business case. The
needs assessment will examine the needs and demands of the business, marketing oppor-
tunities, costs, risks, and more, while taking into account the given assumptions and con-
straints of the proposed products or services. Once the needs assessment is completed, it's
easy to build a business case based on the fi ndings of the assessment. Don't forget that the
feasibility study is often the fi rst phase in the project, and the fi ndings from it are typically
summarized in the business case.
   Most sound business case documents contain the following elements:
     Description of the project, including the business need, demand, or opportunity that's
     driving the project. This section may note the needs assessment and feasibility study
     findings as well. This section should also include a description of the impact to the
     organization if the project is not undertaken.
     A high-level description of the scope of the project, which might include a list of high-
     level deliverables and desired outcomes.
     Names of the stakeholders involved with the project.
                                                    Kicking Off the Project Charter            85



    Analysis of the problem or opportunity the project presents, including how the project
    aligns with the organization's strategic vision and goals, the cause of the problem (or
    opportunity) that's driving the creation of the project, and a gap analysis showing the
    existing capabilities of the organization versus how the organization will change if the
    project is implemented.
    A high-level list and description of risks. (This includes risks known at this time. As the
    project progresses, more risks will be identified and added to the list.)
    Description of the critical success factors.
    Description of the expected results of each alternative solution and the course of action
    for each.
    Recommended option. (This includes a summary of the analysis performed to get
    to this solution; a description of the risks, constraints, and assumptions associated
    with the recommended option; and a high-level plan to implement the solution
    outlining major milestones, any project dependencies, and roles and responsibilities of
    stakeholders.)
    Evaluation statement. (This includes how you'll measure the benefits the project will
    bring to the organization once it's completed.)


                 Remember that when your selection committee is analyzing and approv-
                 ing the business case, (and thus triggering the Develop Project Charter
                 process), they are completing these activities outside of the boundaries of
                 the project. Typically, the project team is not involved at this stage. In other
                 words, the project isn't a project until the project charter is approved, and
                 the project charter cannot be started until the business case is approved.

   One of the elements discussed earlier includes an analysis of the problem or opportunity
the project presents. According to the PMBOK(R) Guide, there are three categories you can
use for your decision analysis:
Required Must perform or must have to successfully realize the opportunity, solve the
problem, or make a decision
Desired The preferred solution or option to fulfill the opportunity, solve the problem, or
make a decision
Optional Alternative solutions or options for solving the problem or taking advantage of
the opportunity, or making a decision. Optional choices include the following:
        Do nothing.
        Do the minimum needed.
        Do more than the minimum.
86        Chapter 2      Creating the Project Charter



   Once the business case is reviewed by the project selection committee, including weigh-
ing all the alternatives, there are one of two decisions they will make: Proceed with the
project charter, or kill the request. If the project proceeds, it's good practice to review the
business case at each phase gate to make sure the project is successfully producing the
objectives and benefits outlined in the business case.

Benefits Management Plan
The benefits management plan outlines the intended benefits of performing the project, how
the benefits will be measured, and how they will be obtained (this is typically described in
financial terms). According to the PMBOK(R) Guide, a project benefit is the result of actions
or behaviors, and/or the value of the product, service, or result the project brings to the orga-
nization and the project stakeholders.
   The benefits management plan, according to the PMBOK(R) Guide, includes the follow-
ing elements:
     Target benefits, including tangible and intangible value. Financial value is often a tar-
     get benefit, and it should always be stated using net present value.
     Strategic alignment to the organization's goals and objectives
     Time frame in which benefits will come to fruition
     Benefits owner, who will track, monitor, document, and report when or if benefits are
     realized
     Metrics to show how benefits will be measured
     Assumptions about the project or the benefits that are believed to be true
     Risks associated with the benefits
    As I mentioned previously, the benefits management plan and the business case are tightly
linked. The business case is reviewed at each phase gate, and the benefits management plan
is updated iteratively throughout the project life cycle. For example, the benefits management
plan will use the preferred option from the business case to outline the expected benefits.
The benefit-cost ratio analysis documented in the business case can also be used to describe
benefit realization. The project manager is responsible for coordinating the project documents
and keeping them aligned throughout the project.


                  Remember that the sponsor is accountable for documenting and updat-
                  ing the business case. The project manager is responsible for tailoring
                  the project documents in accordance with the size and complexity of the
                  project and for keeping the project artifacts (such as the business case,
                  benefits management plan, project charter, and the project management
                  plan) coordinated and aligned with each other and with the organization's
                  strategic goals.

Agreements
Agreements refer to documents that define the intent of the project and are usually legal in
nature. For example, a contract is an example of an agreement. Other agreements might
include a memorandum of understanding, emails, an intergovernmental agency agreement, a
verbal commitment, and so on. A contract is applicable when you are performing a project
for a customer external to the organization or you are hiring an outside firm to perform the
project for your organization. Agreements are an input to this process because they typically
document the conditions under which the project will be executed, the time frame, and a
description of the work.


Enterprise Environmental Factors
Enterprise environmental factors (EFF) show up as input to many of the other processes
we'll discuss throughout the book and are most notably found in the Planning processes.
This input refers to the factors outside the control of the project team that have (or might
have) significant influence on the success of the project. According to the PMBOK(R) Guide,
environmental factors are both internal and external to the organization and include the
following.

Internal EEFs
The EEFs described next are internal to the organization and outside the control of the
project team.
Organizational Culture, Structure, and Governance I talked about organizational struc-
tures and their influence on the organization in Chapter 1.
Geographic Distribution of Facilities and Resources As the title states, this refers to people,
office locations, buildings, and so on that are located in different places. This also refers to
technology that is not located on premises, such as cloud computing, a virtual team and the
infrastructure to support them, and shared systems.
Infrastructure This refers to the organization's facilities and capital equipment. I'll also
include information technology in this category.
Resource Availability This refers to the availability of contracting resources and the con-
straints associated with purchasing their services.
Information Technology Software This refers to software systems that may be used to help
plan, manage, and monitor the project, such as project management software, scheduling
software, work authorization systems, and so on, and the software used by the organization,
such as accounting systems, human resource systems, and so on. This category considers the
policies associated with the technology and software systems, such as access policies, security
policies, user agreements, and so on.
Employee Capability This refers to the skills, knowledge, expertise, and specialized capa-
bilities of the existing staff members.
88        Chapter 2      Creating the Project Charter



External EEFs
The EEFs described next are external to the organization and outside the control of the
project team.
Marketplace Conditions The old supply-and-demand theory applies here along with eco-
nomic and financial factors, competitors, market share, brand recognition, and so on.
Social and Cultural Influences and Issues This concerns elements such as the internal and
external political climate or influences on the project or organization, codes of conduct, the
perceptions the market place or internal staff have about the organization, and the use or
perception of ethical standards.
Legal Restrictions This can include any number of laws or government regulations dic-
tating how an organization conducts their business practices including employment law,
security of data, purchasing regulations, and more.
Commercial Databases These refer to industry-specific information, cost estimating data,
industry risk databases, and so on.
Academic Research As the name implies, this refers to research studies, benchmarking
information, or other academic data that will influence how the project is conducted or its
outcomes.
Government or Industry Standards This is similar to the legal category but includes stan-
dards bodies such as those that describe security standards or environmental regulations, or
industry specific standards in terms of manufacturing or product specifications.
Financial Considerations This includes factors that influence finances such as the interest
rate for borrowing money, the exchange rates for currency, and tariffs or taxes associated
with the geographic location.
Physical Environmental Elements As the heading implies, this refers to the physical condi-
tions that workers will experience during the course of the project such as weather, factory
conditions, and so on.
   The EEFs mentioned in the PMBOK(R) Guide for the Develop Project Charter process are
government or industry standards, legal and regulatory requirements, marketplace condi-
tions, organizational culture and political climate, organizational governance framework,
and stakeholders' expectations and risk thresholds.
   Some or all of these factors can influence the way you manage the project and, in some
cases, the outcomes of the project. For example, perhaps the folks assigned to your project
are junior level and don't have the skills, experience, or knowledge needed to complete the
work of the project. It's up to the project manager to understand the organization's envi-
ronmental factors and account for and consider how they can influence the management
and outcomes of the project.

Organizational Process Assets
Organizational process assets (OPA) are the organization's policies, guidelines, processes,
procedures, plans, approaches, and standards for conducting work, including project work.
Organizational process assets are divided into two categories: 1) processes, policies, and
procedures and 2) organizational knowledge bases. Processes, policies, and procedures refer
to a wide range of elements that might affect several aspects of the project, such as project
management policies, safety policies, performance measurement criteria, templates, financial
controls, communication requirements, issue and defect management procedures, change
control procedures, risk control procedures, and the procedures used for authorizing work.
These are usually established by the PMO or the organization itself and are not updated as
the project progresses. Table 2.14 lists the process, policies, and procedures OPAs associated
with each project process according to the PMBOK(R) Guide.

   Organizational knowledge bases refers to items such as lessons learned, process mea-
surement databases, project fi les, and the information the organization has learned on
previous projects (including how to store and retrieve that information). For example, pre-
vious project risks, performance measurements, earned value data, and schedules for past
projects are valuable resources of knowledge for the current project. This information, also
known as historical information, falls into the corporate knowledge base category. If you
don't capture and store this information, however, it won't be available when you're start-
ing a new project. You'll want to capture and store information such as project fi nancial
data (budgets, costs, overruns), historical information, lessons learned, project fi les, issues
and defects, process measurements, and configuration management knowledge.
   According to the PMBOK(R) Guide, the following are the types of organizational knowl-
edge repositories you may encounter:
     Configuration management
     Financial data
     Historical information and lessons learned
     Issue and defect management data
     Data repositories
     Project files from other projects


                  I'll discuss many of the OPAs in more detail throughout the Planning chap-
                  ters when they appear in a specific process.


   Organizational process assets and historical information should be reviewed and exam-
ined when a new project is starting. Historical information can be useful to project manag-
ers and to stakeholders. When you're evaluating new projects, historical information about
previous projects of a similar nature can be handy in determining whether the new project
should be accepted and initiated. Historical information gathered and documented dur-
ing an active project is used to assist in determining whether the project should proceed to
the next phase. Historical information will help you with the project charter, project scope
statement, development of the project management plan, the process of defi ning and esti-
mating activities, and more during the project-planning processes.
   Understanding previous projects of a similar nature--their problems, successes,
issues, and outcomes--will help you avoid repeating mistakes while reusing successful
techniques to accomplish the goals of this project to the satisfaction of the stakeholders.
Many of the processes in the project management process groups have organizational
process assets as an input, implying that you should review the pertinent organizational
assets that apply for the process you're about to start. For example, when performing the
Estimate Costs process, you might fi nd it helpful to review the activity estimates and bud-
gets on past projects of similar size and scope before estimating the costs for the activities
on the new project.
                                                    Kicking Off the Project Charter             91




   According to the PMBOK(R) Guide, the OPAs you may need to consider when working in
the Develop Project Charter process include organizational policies, procedures, and pro-
cesses; portfolio, program, and project governance framework; monitoring and reporting
methods; templates; and historical information such as the lessons learned repository.



Exam Spotlight

Remember that organizational process assets encompass many elements, including poli-
cies, guidelines, standards, historical information, and so on, and that they're divided into
two categories: 1) processes, policies, and procedures, and 2) corporate knowledge base.
OPAs are internal to the organization. For the exam, make certain you understand what
the organizational process assets entail and that you can differentiate them from the
enterprise environmental factors input.




Tools and Techniques
Tools and techniques are multifaceted and include elements such as brainstorming, meet-
ings, focus groups, alternatives analysis, and much more. Tools and techniques are used with
the inputs of every process to produce the outputs of that process. For example, in Develop
Project Charter, the business documents, agreements, EEF, and OPA inputs are examined
using the tools and techniques of this process (expert judgment, data gathering, interpersonal
and team skills, and meetings) to produce the project charter, which is the primary output of
this process and the assumption log. Let's look at the tools and techniques of this process in
more detail.

Expert Judgment
The concept behind expert judgment is to rely on individuals, or groups of people, who
have training, specialized knowledge, or skills in the areas you're assessing. These folks
might be stakeholders, consultants, other experts in the organization, subject matter experts,
the PMO, industry experts, or technical or professional organizations. According to the
PMBOK(R) Guide, you should utilize experts who have knowledge or training in the
following: organizational strategy, benefits management, technical industry knowledge,
estimating techniques for duration and cost, and risk identification. Expert judgment is a
tool and technique used in other processes as well.
   In the case of developing a project charter, expert judgment would be helpful in assess-
ing the inputs of this process, the environmental factors, organizational assets, and histori-
cal information. For example, as the project manager, you might rely on the expertise of
your executive committee to help you understand how the proposed project gels with the
strategic plan, or you might rely on team members who have participated on similar proj-
ects in the past to make recommendations regarding the proposed project.
92        Chapter 2      Creating the Project Charter



Data Gathering
Data gathering techniques include brainstorming, focus groups, and interviews. Brainstorm-
ing is used with groups of people to gather information, whether pertinent to the topic or
not, in a short amount of time. Focus groups are sessions conducted with stakeholders to
help identify success criteria, risks, and other information. Interviews are typically one-on-
one and used to gather information regarding project requirements, the assumptions that
stakeholders are making, defining approval criteria, and identifying constraints. I will discuss
each of these techniques in more depth in coming chapters.

Interpersonal and Team Skills
In Chapter 1, you learned that the most important skill a project manager can possess is
communication. A close runner-up to that is interpersonal skills. This is the ability to relate
to others in a genuine manner. This tool and technique also includes the ability to manage
conflict, facilitate, and manage meetings, and conduct meetings.
   Confl ict management, as we discussed in Chapter 1, is common on all projects. The
project manager must have the ability to bring diverse ideas, stakeholders, and team mem-
bers to an agreement so that project work can commence and continue.
   Facilitation involves bringing groups of people together to make decisions or fi nd solu-
tions. The facilitator ensures that all parties are heard and that there is agreement at the
end of the meeting. Meeting management refers to being prepared for meetings, such as
creating an agenda beforehand, making certain the right people attend the right meetings,
and keeping the meeting on track. Meeting minutes and action items are recorded during
the meeting and sent to the participants after the meeting concludes.

Meetings
Meetings are plentiful on a project. There will be stakeholder meetings, progress meetings,
update meetings, budget meetings, and more. Meetings in this process refer to identifying
high-level requirements, determining summary milestones, defining success criteria, and more.


                  All successful project managers are adept at communicating with others
                  and possess excellent interpersonal skills.




Formalizing and Publishing
the Project Charter
The approved project charter is the official, written acknowledgment and recognition that a
project exists. It ties the work of the project with the ongoing operations of the organization.
It's usually issued and signed by the project initiator or the project sponsor, and it gives the
project manager the authority to assign organizational resources to the project. It is one of
two outputs of this process. The other output is the assumptions log.
                                  Formalizing and Publishing the Project Charter              93




   The charter documents the business need or demand that the project was initiated to
address, and it includes a description of the product, service, or result of the project. It is
usually the first official document of the project once acceptance of the project has been
granted. Project charters are often used as a means to introduce a project to the organiza-
tion. Because this document outlines the high-level project description, the business oppor-
tunity or need, and the project's purpose, executive managers can get a first glance at the
benefits of the project. Good project charters that are well documented will address many
of the questions your stakeholders are likely to have up front.


Pulling the Project Charter Together
According to the PMBOK(R) Guide, to create a useful and well-documented project charter,
you should include elements such as the following:
    Purpose or justification for the project
    Project objectives that are measurable
    High-level list of requirements
    High-level description of the project with high-level deliverables
    Overall project risks
    Milestone schedule (summary level)
    Preapproved budget
    List of key stakeholders
    Criteria for project approval (success criteria)
    Criteria for project exit
    Name of the project manager and their authority levels
    Name of the sponsor (or authorizer of the project) and their authority levels
   Many of these elements are self-explanatory. Let's look at criteria for project approval
(success criteria) and criteria for project exit in a bit more depth.
   I've talked about project success a couple of times here and in Chapter 1. As a refresher,
the project is considered successful when it meets the objectives of the project and the stake-
holders are satisfied. This might be easy to say, but how do you know specifically that the
project is a success? In many organizations in which I've worked, our projects were deter-
mined successful (or not) using the universal triad of project success measures: on time, on
budget, and the scope (deliverables and objectives) is fulfilled. But what if my sponsor isn't
happy? It doesn't matter if I'm on time or on budget. They won't see the project as a suc-
cess. What if my customers don't adopt the new product, service, or result of my project?
That's not successful. What if my project outcomes cannot be integrated into the existing
organizational infrastructure or business environment? Oops, that's a problem. What if my
project takes a long time to complete and over time, it no longer aligns with the organiza-
tional goals and mission? Again, not good.
94        Chapter 2      Creating the Project Charter



  In order to ensure you and your stakeholders know what a successful project looks like,
you must defi ne and document the success criteria. According to the PMBOK(R) Guide, and
my own personal experience, there are two questions that must be asked and answered
and agreed to (in writing) by the stakeholders:
     What does success look like?
     How will success be measured?
   The answers to these are part of the project approval requirements that should be docu-
mented in the project charter.
   Project exit criteria is different than success criteria. This element focuses on the cir-
cumstances or conditions under which you can cancel or close the project or phase. For
example, an exit criterion for the starting phase of a project might be whether the project
charter or contract is documented, signed, and approved. Exit criteria for a working phase
in the project might be whether testing of all interfaces is complete and data is being pro-
cessed correctly. Exit criteria for the project might include whether the application is free
from defects or the app is live and available in the app store.
   For the exam, the important factors to remember about the project charter are that:
     It is a formal record of the project.
     It authorizes the project to begin.
     It authorizes the project manager to assign resources to the project.
     It shows the organization's commitment to the project.
     It authorizes the project manager to plan, execute, and control the project.
     It documents the business need, justification, and impact.
     It describes the customer's requirements.
     It sets stakeholder expectations.
     It ties the project to the strategic goals of the organization.
  Once the charter is signed, the project is formally authorized and work can begin.
  Let's take a brief look at the key stakeholders who might be involved with the project
charter and the role they'll play in developing the charter.


Key Stakeholders
The PMBOK(R) Guide states that the project charter forms a partnership between the organi-
zation requesting the project and the one performing the project. The project charter should
always be written and signed before you begin the Planning process group.


                   The project charter will help ensure that stakeholders' expectations are in
                   alignment with the project scope and with the final results of the project.
                   According to the PMBOK (R) Guide, the project charter is a document issued by
                   the person (or organization) who initiated the project or the project sponsor.
                                  Formalizing and Publishing the Project Charter              95




   Let's take a look at the roles of some of the key stakeholders and how they can help
contribute to creating a comprehensive project charter. I'll explain how to identify the right
stakeholders for your project in the next main section, "Identifying Stakeholders."

Project Manager
The project manager is the person who assumes responsibility for the success of the proj-
ect. The project manager should be identified as early as possible in the project and ideally
should participate in writing the project charter.
   The project charter identifies the project manager and describes the authority the project
manager has in carrying out the project. The project manager's primary responsibilities
are project planning and then executing and managing the work of the project. By oversee-
ing the project charter and the project planning documents created later in the project, the
project manager is assured that everyone knows and understands what's expected of them
and what constitutes a successful project.
   Project managers are responsible for setting the standards and policies for the projects
on which they work. As a project manager, it is your job to establish and communicate the
project procedures to the project team and stakeholders. In turn, the project team is respon-
sible for supporting you by performing the work of the project.
   Project managers will identify activities and tasks, resource requirements, project costs,
project requirements, performance measures, and more. Communication and documenta-
tion must become the project manager's best friends. Keeping stakeholders, the project
sponsor, the project team, and all other interested parties informed is "job one," as the
famous car manufacturer's ads say.

Project Sponsor
Have you ever attended a conference or event that was put on by a sponsor? In the infor-
mation technology field, software development companies often sponsor conferences and
seminars. The sponsor pays for the event, the facilities, and the goodies and provides an
opportunity for vendors to display their wares. In return, the sponsor comes out looking like
a winner. Because it is footing the bill for all this fun, the sponsor gets to call the shots on
conference content, and it gets the prime spots for discussing its particular solutions. Last
but not least, it usually provides the keynote speaker and gets to present its information to a
captive audience.
   Project sponsors are similar to this. In their role as project champion, they rally support
from stakeholders and the executive management team. They keep the project front and
center at the higher levels of the organization and are the spokesperson for the project.
   The project sponsor is usually an executive in the organization who has the power and
authority to make decisions and settle disputes or conflicts regarding the project. The
sponsor takes the project into the limelight, so to speak, and gets to call the shots regard-
ing project outcomes. The project sponsor is also the one with the big bucks who provides
funds for your project. The project sponsor should be named in the project charter and
identified as the final authority and decision maker for project issues. Ultimately, the project
sponsor is responsible for facilitating the project's success.
96        Chapter 2      Creating the Project Charter



   Sponsors are actively involved in the Initiating and Planning phases of the project
and tend to have less involvement during the Execution and Monitoring and Controlling
phases. It's up to the project manager to keep the project sponsor informed of all project
activities, project progress, and any conflicts or issues that arise. The sponsor is the one
with the authority to resolve conflicts and set priorities when these things can't be dealt
with any other way.

Functional Managers
I covered functional managers briefly in Chapter 1. Project managers must work with and
gain the support of functional managers in order to complete the project. Functional manag-
ers fulfill the administrative duties of the organization, provide and assign staff members
to projects, and conduct performance reviews for their staff. It's a good idea to identify the
functional managers who will be working on project tasks or assigned project responsibili-
ties in the charter.
    It's also a good idea to identify the key project stakeholders in the project charter.
Although this isn't explicitly stated as part of this process, you'll see in the next section that
stakeholder influences make up one of the components of the project charter. To identify
stakeholder influences, it's also necessary to identify the stakeholders and describe their
roles in high-level terms as I've done here.



Exam Spotlight

In some organizations, the project manager might write the project charter. However, if
you (as the project manager) are asked to write the charter, remember that your name
should not appear as the author. Because the project charter authorizes the project and
authorizes you as the project manager, it doesn't make sense for you to write a document
authorizing yourself to manage the project. The author of the charter should be an execu-
tive manager in your organization with the power and authority to assign resources to
this project. This is usually the project sponsor or project initiator.



Project Charter Sign-Off
The project charter isn't complete until you've received sign-off from the project sponsor,
senior management, and key stakeholders. Sign-off indicates that the document has been
read by those signing it (let's hope so, anyway) and that they agree with its contents and are
on board with the project. It also involves the major stakeholders right from the beginning
and should win their continued participation in the project going forward. If someone has a
problem with any of the elements in the charter, this is the time to speak up.
   Prior to publishing the charter, I like to hold a kickoff meeting with the key stakehold-
ers to discuss the charter and then obtain their sign-off. I think it's imperative for you to
identify your key stakeholders as soon as possible and involve them in the creation of the
project charter. Remember that stakeholder identification is an ongoing activity.
                                                           Identifying Stakeholders            97




   Signing the project charter document is the equivalent of agreeing to and endorsing the
project. This doesn't mean the project charter is set in stone, however. Project charters will
change throughout the course of the project. As more details are uncovered and outlined
and as the Planning processes begin, more project issues will come to light. This is part of
the iterative process of project management and is to be expected. The charter will occa-
sionally be revised to reflect these new details, project plans will be revised, and project
execution will change to incorporate the new information or direction.
   The last step in this process is publishing the charter. Publishing, in this case, means dis-
tributing a copy of the project charter to the key stakeholders, the customer, the manage-
ment team, and others who might be involved with the project. Publication can take several
forms, including printed format or electronic format distributed via the company email
system or on the company's intranet.


Assumptions Log
The assumptions log is used to document all the assumptions and constraints for the project
from this point forward. You might recall that high-level assumptions and constraints were
documented in the business case. If they still apply, they should be transferred to the as-
sumptions log. For your reference, assumptions are events or actions believed to be true.
Constraints are actions that restrict or dictate the actions of the project team. We will discuss
assumptions and constraints in more detail in Chapter 3, "Developing the Project Scope
Statement."



Identifying Stakeholders
Think of stakeholders and project participants as a highly polished orchestra. Each partici-
pant has a part to play. Some play more parts than others, and, alas, some don't play their
parts as well as others. An integral part of project management is getting to know your
stakeholders and the parts they play. You'll remember from Chapter 1 that stakeholders are
those people or organizations who have a vested interest in the outcome of the project. They
have something to either gain or lose as a result of the project, and they have the ability to
influence project results.


Identify Stakeholders Inputs
The Identify Stakeholders process involves identifying and documenting all the stakeholders
on the project, including their interests, interdependencies, and potential positive or negative
impacts on the project.
   Identifying key stakeholders seems like it should be fairly easy, but once you get beyond
the obvious stakeholders, the process can become difficult. Sometimes stakeholders, even
key stakeholders, will change throughout the project's life. The key stakeholders on a
98        Chapter 2       Creating the Project Charter



project might include the project sponsor, the customer (who might also be the project
sponsor), the project manager, project team members, management personnel, contractors,
suppliers, and so on. The stakeholders involved in the project charter and the contract are
obvious picks to be included in the stakeholder register, the primary output of this process.
   The inputs of this process are as follows:
     Project charter
     Business documents (business case and benefits management plan)
     Project management plan (communications management plan and stakeholder engage-
     ment plan)
     Project documents (change log, issue log, requirements documentation)
     Agreements
     Enterprise environmental factors
     Organizational process assets
   The business case and the project charter both contain a list of stakeholders so you
will want to review those documents when preparing the stakeholder register. In addition,
some of the key project management plans and project documents will contain references
to stakeholders. Each of the plans and documents listed as inputs here will be described in
their own process area. Agreements are also key here since they are legal documents and
will contain the names of stakeholders who will be working on the project.
   According to the PMBOK(R) Guide, the environmental factors you'll want to pay par-
ticular attention to during this process are company culture, organizational structure,
governmental or industry standards, global trends, and geographic locations of resources
and facilities. The organization structure will help you understand who has influence and
power based on position and where they reside in the organization. The organizational
process assets you should be concerned about include stakeholder register templates
and lessons learned, including the stakeholder registers from previous projects. We'll
talk more about stakeholder register templates in the "Stakeholder Register and Other
Outputs" section.
   Don't forget important stakeholders. That could be a project killer. Leaving out an
important stakeholder, or one whose business processes weren't considered particularly
during the Initiating and Planning processes, could spell disaster for your project.



Exam Spotlight

Stakeholder identification should occur as early as possible in the project and continue
throughout its life. Likewise, the stakeholder analysis and strategy should be reviewed
periodically throughout the project and updated as needed. Remember to manage stake-
holder satisfaction just as you would any key deliverable on the project. Identifying and
analyzing their needs throughout the project will help make certain you are managing
their expectations, and thus their satisfaction.
                                                          Identifying Stakeholders            99




Stakeholder Analysis
The tools and techniques of Identify Stakeholders are expert judgment, data gathering (ques-
tionnaires and surveys and brainstorming), data analysis (stakeholder analysis, document
analysis) data representation (stakeholder mapping/representation), and meetings.
   According to the PMBOK(R) Guide, stakeholder analysis involves using qualitative and
quantitative data to analyze which stakeholders' interests should be considered throughout
the project. Those with the most influence will also have the most impact.
   During stakeholder analysis, you'll want to identify the influences stakeholders have on
the project and understand their expectations, needs, and desires. From there, you'll derive
more specifics regarding the project goals and deliverables. Be warned that stakeholders
are mostly concerned about their own interests and what they (or their organizations) have
to gain or lose from the project. In all fairness, we all fall into the stakeholder category, so
we're all guilty of focusing on those issues that impact us most.
   Stakeholders can be internal or external to the organization. One way to uncover addi-
tional stakeholders is to ask known stakeholders if they know of anyone else who might be
impacted by this project. Ask team members whether they're aware of stakeholders who
haven't been identified. Stakeholders might also come to the forefront once you start uncov-
ering some of the goals and deliverables of the project.
   I know it's not nice to play favorites, but when it comes to stakeholders, you as the proj-
ect manager need to understand who has power and authority, who can influence project
outcomes, and which ones you should pay particular attention to so that your project pro-
gresses smoothly. Each of these tools and techniques will help you identify and categorize
your stakeholders so that you aren't caught off guard.

Expert Judgment
Expert judgment here has a specific emphasis on experts who have knowledge of the culture
and politics of the organization, the customers of the organization, specific industry experi-
ence (including understanding the particular deliverables of this project), and an understand-
ing of team member skills and capabilities.

Data Gathering
The techniques associated with this process include questionnaires and surveys, and brain-
storming. Both of these techniques can be used to help identify stakeholders and their needs
on the project. We'll talk more about brainstorming in later chapters. For this process, know
that brainstorming can involve the usual process of getting folks in a room and having them
name things (or stakeholders in this case) that come to mind while a facilitator jots down all
the ideas. It may also involve brainwriting, a type of brainstorming, where participants are
given the question or brainstorming topic ahead of time so they have time to think about
their answers. After a period of time, you hold the meeting and host the brainstorming
session. A brainwriting meeting can be face-to-face, or you could use technology such as a
video- or web-conferencing tool to hold the meeting.
100        Chapter 2           Creating the Project Charter



Data Analysis
Data analysis uses two techniques called stakeholder analysis and document analysis.
Stakeholder analysis aids in gathering information about the stakeholders regarding their
expectations for the project, their interest level, their involvement on the project, their level
of influence on the project, knowledge levels, the contributions they make, and more. Docu-
ment analysis is used when examining the business case, benefits management plan, and the
project charter as well as historical information from previous projects. All of this informa-
tion together helps to identify potential stakeholders and determine their needs and interest
in the project.

Data Representation
Data representation is used to categorize stakeholders primarily in terms of influence. Accord-
ing to the PMBOK(R) Guide, this tool and technique consists of the following methods for
categorizing stakeholders:
Power/Interest Grid, Power/Influence Grid, or Impact/Influence Grid These grids are used
to identify the power, authority, interest, or influence level the stakeholder has on the project.
They are most useful on small projects where it's easier to identify the relationship between
the stakeholder and the project. Figure 2.1 shows a sample power/interest grid.

Stakeholder Cube A stakeholder cube uses the elements described in the power/interest grid
along with other elements, which could include attitudes, influence-level designations, power-
level designations, or any combination of elements associated with the power, influence, and
abilities of the stakeholders to impact, change, or influence the project. The cube is displayed
                                                         Identifying Stakeholders            101




as a 3D model and allows the project manager and team members to identify stakeholders,
understand how their characteristics can impact the project, and better interact with them
according to their needs,
Salience Model This model uses three elements in analyzing stakeholders: power, urgency,
and legitimacy. Power refers to their ability to influence the project outcomes. Urgency may
seem strange, here but it refers to stakeholders who may have a significant investment or
interest in the outcomes of the project (meaning they will require a lot of attention and likely
need a lot of handholding throughout the project), how attentive you'll need to be, and
whether their participation is time bound. This model is very helpful when your project has
a large number of stakeholders and/or a significant amount of interaction among the large
community of stakeholders. The Salience model is displayed as a Venn diagram. Each ele-
ment (power, urgency, legitimacy) is represented in a circle, and the intersection of the three
circles shows the strongest influences of the stakeholder at a glance.
Directions of Influence Just as the title sounds, this describes the direction of influence a
stakeholder might have inside and outside the organization, including up, down, sideways,
and outward. In my experience, you should pay close attention to those with upward influ-
ence. If the project hits some rocky bumps or you find additional funding is needed, these
stakeholders will go right to the top of the organization to assure the executives that the
project is under control but has hit a snag and needs some help. They'll also be your biggest
champions in carrying the great news upward so that you and your team get the recognition
they deserve. Be certain to prioritize stakeholders throughout the project and their direction
of influence. Stakeholders have a tendency to come and go on the project, and their relation-
ships within the organization and with each other are often dynamic.
Prioritization This is another method to categorize your stakeholders in terms of influ-
ence levels, interest, impact, and so on. Prioritization comes in handy on complex projects,
or projects where you may have dozens of stakeholders and you need to keep track of those
with the most power and influence.

Meetings
Meetings in this process refer to getting to know your key stakeholders. Meetings can in-
clude virtual meetings, facilitation workshops, group meetings, and more.

Understanding Stakeholder Roles
As the project manager, you must understand each stakeholder's role in the project and
in the organization, and the power and influence they exert. Get to know them and their
interests. Determine the relationship structure among the various stakeholders. Start cultivat-
ing partnerships with these stakeholders now, because it's going to get pretty cozy during the
course of your project. If you establish good working relationships up front and learn about
their business concerns and needs, it might be easier to negotiate or motivate them later
when you have a pressing issue that needs action. Knowing which stakeholders work well
together and which don't can also help you in the future. One stakeholder might have the
102        Chapter 2      Creating the Project Charter



authority or influence to twist the arm of another, figuratively speaking, of course. Conversely,
you might know of two stakeholders who are like oil and water when put into the same
room together. This can be valuable information to keep under your hat for future reference.
   Some stakeholders may have a significant amount of influence over the project and its
outcomes. Understanding the organizational structure, and where the stakeholders fit in
that structure, should be your fi rst step in determining the level of influence they have. For
example, if Melanie in accounting wields a significant amount of power and influence over
the organization, when you need input or decisions from her regarding costs or budgets
for the project, you'd better believe that those decisions are not likely to be overridden.
Conversely, if stakeholders with little influence provide direction that you don't verify, that
input could be overridden at a later date by a more powerful stakeholder, causing changes
to the project.


                  Remember that the definition of a successful project is one that accom-
                  plishes the goals of the project and meets stakeholders' expectations. Under-
                  stand and document those expectations, and you're off to a good start.


Stakeholder Register and Other Outputs
There are several outputs to this process, including stakeholder register, change requests,
project management plan updates, and project documents updates. The key output of this
process is the stakeholder register, so we'll tackle it first.
   The stakeholder register contains information about the stakeholder, including their con-
tact information. Remember that you can use the stakeholder register template (part of the
OPA inputs to this process) if your organization has one. The stakeholder register should
contain at least the following details, according to the PMBOK(R) Guide:
Identifying Information This includes items such as contact information, department, role
in the project, and so on.
Assessment Information This includes elements regarding influence, expectations, key re-
quirements, and when the stakeholder involvement is most critical. It should also identify the
phase of the project in which the stakeholder will have the most influence or impact.
Stakeholder Classification This includes the classification elements we discussed in the
"Tools and Techniques" section, including the influence, power, impact, direction of influ-
ence, and whether they are internal stakeholders or hold a position outside the organization.
   It's important to update the stakeholder register on a routine basis so that new stake-
holders are added and those who have fi nished their role on the project are noted as
completed.


                  Remember that project documents are usually easily accessible by the
                  project team and stakeholders. Use caution when documenting sensitive
                  information regarding a stakeholder and your strategy for dealing with that
                  stakeholder because it could become public knowledge.
                            Introducing the Kitchen Heaven Project Case Study                103




   Change requests generally occur later in the project once the work of the project has
started. However, the existing stakeholders could change, new stakeholders might be
added, and/or information you've gathered about the stakeholders could change. All of
these situations could generate change requests, so keep an eye on those stakeholders as the
project progresses.
   Project management plan updates are an output you will see frequently. Remember that
many project documents evolve iteratively throughout the project (or throughout certain
project process groups) and may require updates as a result of changing stakeholders. In
particular, the requirements management plan, the communications management plan,
the risk management plan, and the stakeholder engagement plan will almost always need
updates when stakeholder changes or additions occur.
   Project documents updates are another output you will see often. The documents you
will need to update for this process include the assumption log, the issue log, and the risk
register. These documents are frequently updated throughout the life of the project, so keep
them handy.



Introducing the Kitchen Heaven Project
Case Study
This chapter introduces a case study that we'll follow throughout the remainder of the
book. The case study is updated at the end of every chapter. It's designed to show you how
a project manager might apply the material covered in the chapter to a real-life project. As
happens in real life, not every detail of every process is followed during all projects. Remem-
ber that the processes from the PMBOK(R) Guide that I'll cover in the remaining chapters
are project management guidelines. You will often combine processes during your projects,
which will allow you to perform several steps at once. The case studies will present situa-
tions or processes that you might find during your projects and describe how one project
manager resolves them.




Project Case Study: New Kitchen Heaven Retail Store

You are a project manager for Kitchen Heaven, a chain of retail stores specializing in
kitchen utensils, cookware, dishes, small appliances, and some gourmet foodstuffs,
such as bottled sauces and spices. You're fairly new to the position, having been hired to
replace a project manager who recently retired.

Kitchen Heaven currently owns 49 stores in 34 states and Canada. The world headquar-
ters for Kitchen Heaven is in Denver, Colorado. Counting full-time and part-time employ-
ees, the company employs 1,500 people, 200 of whom work at headquarters.

The company's mission statement reads, "Great gadgets for people interested in great food."

Recently, the vice president of marketing paid you a visit. Dirk Perrier is a very nice, well-
dressed man with the formal air you would expect a person in his capacity might have.
He shakes your hand and gives you a broad, friendly smile.

"We've decided to go forward with our 50th store opening! Sales are up, and our new line
of ceramic cookware is a hot seller, no pun intended. I don't know if you're familiar with
our store philosophy, so let me take a moment to explain it. We like to place our stores in
neighborhoods that are somewhat affluent. The plain fact is that most of our shoppers
have incomes of more than $150,000 a year. So, we make an effort to place our stores in
areas where those folks usually shop.

"We're targeting the type of customer who watches the Food Network channel and must
have all the gadgets and tools they see the famous chefs using. So, the stores are upbeat
and convey a fun, energetic feel, if you will.

"Our next store is going to be right here in our home area--Colorado Springs. Because
this is going to be our 50th store, we plan on having a 50th grand-opening celebration,
with the kind of surprises and activities you might expect for such a notable opening.

"Our stores generally occupy from 1,500 to 2,500 square feet of retail space, and we typi-
cally use local contractors for the build-out. A store build-out usually takes 120 days from
the date the property has been procured until the doors open to the public. I can give you
our last opening's project plan so you have a feel for what happens. Your job will be to
procure the property, negotiate the lease, procure the shelving and associated store fur-
nishings, get a contractor on the job, and prepare the 50th store festivities. My marketing
folks will assist you with that last part.

"You have six months to complete the project. Any questions?"

You take a deep breath and collect your thoughts. Dirk has just given you a lot of informa-
tion with hardly a pause between thoughts. A few initial ideas drift through your head
while you're reaching for your notebook.

You work in a functional organization with a separate project-oriented department respon-
sible for carrying out projects of this nature. You've been with the company long enough
to know that Dirk is high up there in the executive ranks and carries the authority and
power to make things happen. Therefore, Dirk is the perfect candidate for project sponsor.

You grab your notebook and start documenting some of the things Dirk talked about,
clarifying with him as you write:

      The project objective is to open a new store in Colorado Springs six months
      from today.
      The store should be located in an affluent area.
                             Introducing the Kitchen Heaven Project Case Study                    105




    The store will carry the full line of products from utensils to gourmet food items.
    The grand opening will be accompanied by lots of fanfare because this is the 50th
    store opening.

You have a question or two for Dirk.

"Is there a special reason we have to open, let's see, six months from now, which is
February 1?"

He responds, "Yes, we want the store open the first week in February. Early February is
when the Garden and Home Show conference hits the Springs area. We'll have a trade
show booth there. We know from experience in other areas that our stores generally see
a surge in sales during this month as a result of the trade show. It's a great way to get a
lot of advertising out there and let folks know where we're located."

"Another question, Dirk. Is there a budget set for this project yet?"

"We haven't set a hard figure," Dirk replies. "But again, from past experience we know it
takes anywhere from $1.5 to $2 million to open a new store--and we don't want to forget
the big bash for the grand opening."

"Thanks, Dirk. I'll get started writing the project charter right away. I'll put your name on
the document because you're the project sponsor."

Dirk concludes with, "Feel free to come to me with questions or concerns at any time."

One week later.

You review your notes and reread the project charter you've prepared for the Kitchen
Heaven retail store one last time before looking for Dirk. You finally run across Dirk in a
hallway near the executive washroom.

"Dirk, I'm glad I caught you. I'd like to go over the project charter with you before the kick-
off meeting tomorrow. Do you have a few minutes?"

"Sure," Dirk says to you. "Let's have it."

"The project charter states the purpose of the project, which of course is to open the
50th Kitchen Heaven store in Colorado Springs. I also documented some of the high-
level requirements, many of which we talked about last time we met. I documented the
assumptions and constraints you gave me with the understanding that we'll define these
much more closely when I create the scope statement. I've included a section that out-
lines a preliminary milestone schedule, and I've included some preliminary ROI [return on
investment] calculations. Using your estimate of $2 million as our initial budget request
and based on the projected inflows you gave me last week, I've calculated a payback
period of 19 months, with an IRR [internal rate of return] of 6 percent."
106         Chapter 2       Creating the Project Charter




"That's impressive," replies Dirk. "That's even better than our Phoenix store. If I recall,
the payback period there was just over two years. Let's hope those numbers hold true."

"I think they're reliable figures," you say. "I researched our data based on recent store
openings in similar-sized cities and factored in the economic conditions of the Colorado
Springs area. Since they're on a growth pattern, we think the timing is perfect.

"As you know, the project kickoff is scheduled for tomorrow. What I'll need, then, is for
you to talk about the project and the goals, talk about the commitment you'll need from
the management team to support this project, and introduce me as the project manager.
I've already forwarded a copy of the project charter to the meeting attendees so that they
can review it before the meeting. I included a list of the assumptions we've made so far as
an appendix to the charter. Lastly, I'll need you to ask everyone present to sign a copy of
the project charter."

"Sounds like you've covered everything," Dirk says. "I don't anticipate any problems
tomorrow, because everyone is looking forward to this store opening."

                         Understanding How This Applies to Your Next Project                 107




Understanding How This Applies
to Your Next Project
There are as many ways to select and prioritize projects as there are organizations. You
might be profit driven, so money will be king. You might have a stakeholder committee that
weighs the pros and cons, or you might have an executive director who determines which
project is up next. Scoring models and cash flow analysis techniques are useful on the job.
Whether your organization uses these methods or others, an organized, consistent way to
select and prioritize projects is necessary. I know I could work the next 100 years straight
and probably still not get all the projects completed my organization would like to see imple-
mented. What I've found is that the selection method must be fair and reasonable. If your
organization uses an arbitrary method--say you like Tara better than Joe, so Tara's projects
always end up on the "yes" list--it won't be long before stakeholders demand that another
method be devised to select projects that everyone can understand. Whatever method you're
using, stick to it consistently.
   If you're like me, when I'm faced with a new project I want to get right to the heart of
the matter and understand the purpose of the project. Projects come about for many rea-
sons. Most of the time, understanding the reason it came about will give you some insight
into its purpose. For example, if a new law is passed that requires anyone applying for a
driver's license to show two forms of identification but the existing system has the space to
record verification of only one document, you immediately have a firm grasp on the pur-
pose of the project--you'll have to update the system to include additional space for record-
ing the second document.
   It has been my experience in working with project teams that when the team under-
stands the reason or the need that brought about the project and they grasp the goal of the
project, the project is more successful. I don't have any scientific evidence for this, but when
the teams have a clear understanding of what they're working on and why, they tend to stay
more focused, and fewer unplanned changes make their way into the project. Don't assume
everyone on the project team understands the goal of the project. It's good practice to
review the project goal early in the project and again once the work of the project is under
way. Reminding the team of the goal helps keep the work on track.
   I usually write a project charter for all but the smallest of projects. I believe the most
important sections of the charter are the objectives of the project, the high-level require-
ments, and the summary level milestone schedule. It's important that the goal or objective
of the project be written down, no matter how small the project, so that the team and the
stakeholders know what they're working toward.
   Identifying the stakeholders early in the project is imperative to project success. You
won't want to write the charter without their involvement. The two processes described
in this chapter are almost performed simultaneously when you're conducting a project. I
won't begin writing the charter without stakeholder input first, and it's just as important
to understand the role stakeholders will play in the project as well as their influence. If the
108        Chapter 2      Creating the Project Charter



CFO has ultimate influence over which projects proceed and what they'll include, you'll
want the CFO's buy-in as soon as possible. Involvement in writing the charter and develop-
ing the future Planning process outputs helps to ensure their buy-in. At a minimum, it helps
reduce surprises midway through the project.
   Always, and I mean always, get approval and signatures on the project charter. You
will use this document as your basis for project planning, so make certain the sponsor, key
stakeholders, and the project manager understand the goals of the project the same way.



Summary
This chapter started with a discussion of the ten Knowledge Areas. The Knowledge Areas
bring together processes that have characteristics in common. They also help you understand
what types of skills and resources are needed to complete the processes within them.
   Next, I detailed how projects are initiated. Projects come about as a result of one of
seven needs or demands: market demands, organizational needs, customer requests, tech-
nological advances, legal requirements, ecological impacts, or social needs.
   Project selection methods include decision models in the form of benefit measurement
methods and constrained optimization methods. The constrained optimization methods
utilize mathematical models. Benefit measurement methods come in the form of benefit-
cost ratio (BCR) analyses, scoring models, and economic analyses. These are primarily
comparative approaches. Besides benefit-cost ratio analysis, the most commonly used form
of benefit measurement methods is cash flow analysis.
   Analysis of cash flows includes payback period, discounted cash flows, net present value
(NPV), and internal rate of return (IRR). These last three methods are concerned with
the time value of money--or, in other words, converting future dollars into today's value.
Generally, projects with a shorter payback period are desired over those with longer pay-
back periods. Projects that have an NPV greater than 0 should be accepted. Projects with
the highest IRR value are considered a better benefit to the organization than projects with
lower IRR values.
   The Develop Project Charter process is the first process in the Initiating process group.
The business case is an input to this process that describes the product, service, or result the
project was undertaken to complete; it is part of the business documents input. The busi-
ness case should include the business needs of the organization as well as a high-level scope
description and should map to the organization's strategic plan.
   Enterprise environmental factors (EEFs) are factors outside the control of the proj-
ect team that might have significant influence on the success of the project. EEFs can be
internal or external to the organization. Organizational process assets (OPAs) refer to
policies, guidelines, and procedures for conducting the project work and are internal to the
organization.
   Expert judgment, data gathering, interpersonal and team skills, and meetings are the tools
and techniques of this process. Experts usually have specialized knowledge or skills and can
include staff from other departments in the company, external or internal consultants, and
                                                                   Exam Essentials           109




members of professional and technical associations or industry groups. Data gathering tech-
niques include brainstorming, focus groups, and interviews. Interpersonal and team skills
include conflict management, facilitation, and meeting management. Meetings are used to
define objectives, success criteria, summary milestones, and more.
   The outputs of this process include the project charter and the assumptions log. The
project charter is the formal recognition that a project, or the next project phase, should
begin. The charter authorizes the project to begin, it authorizes the project manager to
assign resources to the project, it documents the business need and justification, it describes
the customer's requirements, and it ties the project to the ongoing work of the organization.
The assumptions log contains a list and description of all the assumptions and constraints
on the project for the life of the project.
   The Identify Stakeholders process concerns identifying, assessing, and classifying stake-
holders in a stakeholder register. Stakeholder involvement is critical to the success of the
project. The more the project manager understands stakeholder influences, expectations,
and impacts, the easier it is to prepare a strategy plan to deal with the impacts or issues,
sometimes before they occur.



Exam Essentials
Be able to name the 10 Project Management Knowledge Areas. The 10 Project Management
Knowledge Areas are Project Integration Management, Project Scope Management, Project
Schedule Management, Project Cost Management, Project Quality Management, Project
Resource Management, Project Communications Management, Project Risk Management,
Project Procurement Management, and Project Stakeholder Management.
Be able to distinguish between the seven needs or demands that bring about project creation.
The seven needs or demands that bring about project creation are market demand, orga-
nizational need, customer requests, technological advances, legal requirements, ecological
impacts, and social needs.
Be able to define decision models. Decision models are project selection methods that are used
prior to the Develop Project Charter process to determine the viability of the project. Decision
models include benefit measurement methods and constrained optimization methods.
Be able to describe and calculate the payback period. The payback period is the amount
of time it will take the company to recoup its initial investment in the product of the project.
It's calculated by adding up the expected cash inflows and comparing them to the initial
investment to determine how many periods it takes for the cash inflows to equal the
initial investment.
Be able to denote the decision criteria for NPV and IRR. Projects with an NPV greater
than 0 should be accepted, and those with an NPV less than 0 should be rejected. Projects
with high IRR values should be accepted over projects with lower IRR values. IRR is the
discount rate when NPV is equal to 0, and IRR assumes reinvestment at the IRR rate.
110        Chapter 2      Creating the Project Charter



Be able to describe a feasibility study. A feasibility study is used to determine the viability
of the project, the probability of success, and the viability of the product, service, or result of
the project.
Be able to list the Develop Project Charter inputs. The inputs for Develop Project Charter
are business documents, agreements, enterprise environmental factors, and organizational
process assets.
Be able to describe the purpose of the business case. The purpose of a business case is to
understand the business need for the project and determine whether the investment in the
project is worthwhile. It is considered an economic feasibility study. It usually includes a
benefit-cost ratio analysis and the needs or demands that brought about the project.
Be able to describe the purpose of the benefits management plan. The benefits management
plan outlines the intended benefit of the project, how those benefits will be measured, and
how they will be obtained.
Be able to describe the importance of the project charter. The approved project charter is
the document that officially recognizes and acknowledges that a project exists. The charter
authorizes the project to begin, it authorizes the project manager to assign resources to the
project, it documents the business need and justification, it describes the customer's require-
ments, and it ties the project to the ongoing work of the organization.
Understand the Identify Stakeholders process. The purpose of this process is to identify the
project stakeholders, assess their influence and level of involvement, and record stakeholder
information in the stakeholder register.

                               Great job! You've successfully completed the project Initiating
                               processes and published the project charter and the stakeholder
                               register. The project is officially under way. Stakeholders have
been identified and informed of the project, you have management buy-in on the project,
the project manager has been assigned, and the project objectives and description have been
identified. A solid foundation for the planning process is in place.
   In this chapter, we will begin the Planning processes for the project. In fact, I will con-
tinue discussing the Planning processes through Chapter 7, "Planning Project Resources."
Planning is a significant activity in any project and, if done correctly, will go a long way
toward ensuring project success.
   This chapter begins with the Develop Project Management Plan process. This process
will describe the overall approach you'll use to manage the project. The result of this pro-
cess is the project management plan document that describes how you'll execute, monitor,
and control the project outcomes as the project progresses and how you'll close out the
project once it concludes.
   Then we'll move on to the Project Scope Management Knowledge Area overview. Next
we'll cover the Plan Scope Management process. Here you'll learn how to document a plan
that outlines how to defi ne, validate, and control the project scope.
   The Collect Requirements process is next. During this process, quantified requirements
are gathered and documented to ensure that stakeholder needs are met and expectations
are managed.
   During the Defi ne Scope process, you'll use the project charter and the requirements
documentation--plus some other inputs--and then apply the tools and techniques of this
process to come up with the project scope statement. I'll talk in depth about project objec-
tives, requirements, and other elements of writing the project scope statement, which is an
output of this process.
   Once you have the deliverables and requirements well defi ned, you'll begin the process
of breaking down the work of the project via a work breakdown structure (WBS). You'll
accomplish this task in the Create WBS process. The WBS defi nes the scope of the project
and breaks the work down into components that can be scheduled and estimated as well as
easily monitored and controlled.
   We have a lot to cover in this chapter, so let's get started.


                  The process names, inputs, tools and techniques, outputs, and
                  descriptions of the project management process groups and related
                  materials and figures in this chapter are based on content from A
                  Guide to the Project Management Body of Knowledge (PMBOK (R) Guide),
                  Sixth Edition (PMI(R), 2017).

Developing the Project
Management Plan
The first process in the Planning process group is the Develop Project Management Plan
process. It's first for good reasons. This process is part of the Project Integration Manage-
ment Knowledge Area and is concerned with defining, preparing, coordinating, and then
integrating all the various subsidiary project plans into an overall project management plan.
Remember that you will tailor this process (and all processes) according to the size and com-
plexity of your project. When tailoring, you should take into account the project life cycle,
development life cycle, management approaches, knowledge management, change, gover-
nance, lessons learned, and benefits.
   If you haven't already done so, make certain to conduct a project kickoff meeting with
the stakeholders and project team members. Before beginning the processes we'll discuss in
this chapter, you need stakeholder buy-in and commitment to the project in order to suc-
cessfully document requirements, key milestones, and deliverables.


exam Spotlight

The PMBOK (R) Guide notes that kickoff meetings may occur in two different places in the
project, depending on its size. A small project generally involves a small project team
who are actively involved in the Planning processes, so it makes sense to hold the kickoff
meeting now. For large projects, a kickoff meeting is typically held in the Executing pro-
cess group because the project manager and a few key team members will perform most
of the planning before assigning other resources.


   This process involves defining and documenting the processes you're going to use to man-
age this project. For example, let's say you and the project team have determined you will use
project management processes involving costs, human resources, risks, and a project sched-
ule. (Warning: This is a demonstration only--don't try this at home. In reality, professionals
perform many more processes than this on a typical project.) Each particular process might
have a management plan that describes it. For instance, a cost management plan (an example
of a subsidiary plan) would describe how costs will be managed and controlled and how
changes to costs will be approved and managed throughout the project. The Develop Project
Management Plan process brings all these subsidiary plans together, along with the outputs
of the Planning group processes, into one document called the project management plan.


                 In Chapter 1, "What Is a Project?," I talked about tailoring--determining
                 which processes within each process group are appropriate for the project
                 on which you're working. Tailoring is also used in the Develop Project Man-
                 agement Plan process because it's here you'll determine what processes
                 to use to best manage the project.
120           Chapter 3      Developing the Project Scope Statement



  To create and document the plan, you need to gather some inputs and build on the infor-
mation you've already collected.


Developing Project Management Plan Inputs
The Develop Project Management Plan process has four inputs:
       Project charter
       Outputs from other processes
       Enterprise environmental factors
       Organizational process assets
      Let's take a look at each next.
Project Charter You'll recall that the project charter describes the objectives of the project
and the high-level requirements needed to satisfy stakeholder expectations. It's an input into
this process because the content of the project charter--including project objectives, project
description, high-level requirements, summary milestone schedule, summary budget, and so
on--will help you and the team determine exactly which project management processes to
use on the project.
Outputs from Other Processes The project management processes include all the individual
processes that make up the process groups we're talking about throughout this book. The
Initiating group, for example, has two processes, Planning has a zillion (okay, not that many,
but it seems like it), and so on. The outputs from other processes you use on the project
become inputs to the Develop Project Management Plan process. For example, the cost man-
agement plan we talked about previously is an input. Any processes you use that produce a
baseline (such as schedule or cost) or a subsidiary management plan (such as a risk man-
agement plan, communications management plan, and so on) are included as inputs to this
process.


                    I'll talk more about baselines and the makeup of individual subsidiary man-
                    agement plans as we discuss the various Planning processes, starting with
                    this chapter and continuing through Chapter 7.


Enterprise Environmental Factors (EEFs) You've seen enterprise environmental factors
before. Some of the key elements of the environmental factors you should consider when
choosing the processes to perform for this project include standards and regulations (both
industry and governmental), legal requirements, project management expertise in the indus-
try or focus area of the project, company culture and organizational structure, governance
framework used within the organization, and infrastructure.
Organizational governance framework (part of the EEFs for this process) include ele-
ments such as rules, policies and procedures, systems, relationships, and norms. These
                                      Developing the Project Management Plan                 121




help to frame the culture and behavior of the organization, which will in turn influence
the project, the risk tolerance of the organization, and how people perform. It's impor-
tant to note that management elements are influenced according to the organizational
structure (i.e., functional, matrix, or project-oriented) and the organizational governance
framework. Example management elements include how work is distributed, authority
levels of workers, disciplinary actions, chain of command, fair treatment of employees,
fair payment for work performed, communication channels, safety of staff members,
morale, and more.
Organizational Process Assets (OPAs) Some of the critical elements of the organizational
process assets input you should consider when choosing the processes to perform for this
project include policies, procedures, and standards used in the organization; project man-
agement plan template; change control procedures; monitoring and reporting criteria and
methods; historical information; and project information from previous projects that are
similar to the current project.
   As I talked about in Chapter 1, the processes you choose to perform for the project
will be based on the complexity of the project, the project scope, and the type of industry
in which you work. Your organization's standards, guidelines, and policies or the project
management office (PMO) might also dictate the types of processes you'll use for the proj-
ect. You should also consider whether your organization has existing change control pro-
cesses in place, templates that you're required to use, or financial controls and processes.
Historical information and past project files are useful in helping you decide which pro-
cesses to use for this project.

Project Complexity
I've mentioned complexity a few times and you'll hear it again throughout the book. Defin-
ing a complex project is a bit subjective, but the PMBOK(R) Guide states that complexity
usually means that the project has multiple parts, that there are a number of dynamic inter-
actions or connections between the parts, and that there is a synergy of behaviors that come
about as a result of these interactions. Complexity comes about because of the organization's
system behavior, human behavior, and ambiguity. System behavior refers to the segments and
systems within the organization and their interdependencies. How the organization relates
to these interdependencies can be simple or complicated, which in turn impacts the complex-
ity of the project. Human behavior refers to the interactions among diverse team members,
departments, and individuals.
    Ambiguity exists in all organizations, some more pronounced than others. And what
does ambiguity mean? Well, I'm not really sure...but I think maybe it has to do with...
I'm kidding with you here to show ambiguity in action. Ambiguity means confusion or
uncertainty, or not understanding. I've often worked in organizations where the procure-
ment process or the hiring process is somewhat ambiguous. On the surface they appear
straightforward, but once you begin the process, the rules seem to change at every turn.
This impacts the project because there isn't a clear-cut process for procuring resources that
could cause risk and/or delays.
122         Chapter 3      Developing the Project Scope Statement



Tools and Techniques of the Develop Project Management Plan
There are four tools and techniques of the Develop Project Management Plan process: expert
judgement, data gathering, interpersonal and team skills, and meetings. According to the
PMBOK(R) Guide, you'll need the following types of expert judgment to complete
this process:
      Tailoring techniques
      Understanding technical and management details that need to be included in the
      project management plan
      Determining which tools and techniques to use
      Determining resources and assessing skill levels needed for project work
      Determining and defining the amount of configuration management to apply on
      the project
      Determining which project documents require formal change control processes
      Prioritizing project work
    Some data gathering techniques you might use in the process are brainstorming, check-
lists, focus groups, and interviews.
    Interpersonal and team skills are the same as those used in the Develop Project Charter
process: conflict management, facilitation, and meeting management.
    Meetings in this process are used to help determine the project approach (tailoring the
processes to the project), how to execute the work of the project so that its objectives are
met, and how the project will be monitored and controlled. A kickoff meeting is an exam-
ple of a meeting that might occur during this process. According to the PMBOK(R) Guide, a
kickoff meeting might be held for small projects just after the creation of the project char-
ter is complete and stakeholders have been identified (which signals the end of Initiating
processes and the beginning of the Planning processes). That means for small projects, the
team would be involved with the Develop Project Management Plan process because it's
the first process in the Planning process group. Kickoff meetings for large projects usually
occur as soon as the Executing process group begins (and Planning is complete). Planning
processes on large projects are completed mostly by the project management team. Team
members are brought onto the project when work is ready to begin (Executing processes),
and a large kickoff meeting is held to explain the objectives of the project, to gain buy-in
from the project team members, and to explain roles and responsibilities of all stakeholders
and team members.



Exam Spotlight

For the exam, remember that small project kickoff meetings occur when Planning begins.
Large project kickoff meetings occur when Executing begins.

Documenting the Project Management Plan
The purpose of most processes is, of course, to produce an output. Outputs are usually
a report or document of some type or a deliverable. These often become inputs to other
processes. In this case, you end up with a document--the project management plan--that
describes, integrates, and coordinates baselines and subsidiary plans for the processes you've
determined to use for the project. The project management plan can be detailed, or it can be
a high-level summary based on the needs of the project.
    According to the PMBOK(R) Guide, the project management plan defines how the project
is executed, how it's monitored, how it's controlled, and how it's closed. It is progressively
elaborated over the life of the project. It also documents the outputs of the Planning group
processes, which I'll cover over the next several chapters. The subsidiary management plans
that are associated with the processes you'll be using for this project should be documented
in the project management plan. Each of these subsidiary management plans might con-
tain the same elements that the overall project management plan does, but they're specifi-
cally related to the topic at hand. For example, the cost management plan should define
how changes to cost estimates will be reflected in the project budget and how changes or
variances with a significant impact should be communicated to the project sponsor and
stakeholders. The schedule management plan describes how changes to the schedule will be
managed, monitored, and controlled.
    The subsidiary management plans might be detailed or simply a synopsis, depending
on the needs of the project. I've listed the subsidiary plans along with a brief description
next. I will cover each of these plans in more detail throughout the remainder of this book.
According to the PMBOK(R) Guide, the subsidiary management plans that make up the
project management plan are as follows:
Scope Management Plan Describes the process for defining, maintaining, and managing
project scope; facilitates creating the work breakdown structure (WBS); describes how the
product or service of the project is validated and accepted; and documents how changes to
scope will be handled.
Requirements Management Plan Describes how requirements will be analyzed, document-
ed, traced, reported, and managed throughout the project.
Schedule Management Plan Describes how the project schedule will be developed and con-
trolled and how changes will be incorporated into the project schedule.
Cost Management Plan Describes how costs will be managed and controlled and how
changes to costs will be approved and managed.
Quality Management Plan Describes how the organization's quality policy will be imple-
mented. It should address and describe quality control procedures and measures, quality
assurance procedures and measures, and continuous process improvement.
Communications Management Plan Describes the communication needs of the stakehold-
ers, including timing, frequency, and methods of communications.
124         Chapter 3        Developing the Project Scope Statement



Risk Management Plan Describes how risks will be managed and controlled during the
project. This should include risk management methodology; roles and responsibilities; defini-
tions of probability and impact; when risk management will be performed; and the catego-
ries of risk, risk tolerances, and reporting and tracking formats.
Procurement Management Plan Describes how the procurement processes will be managed
throughout the project. This might include elements such as type of contract, procurement
documents, and lead times for purchases.
Resource Management Plan Documents the roles and responsibilities for project team
members, their reporting relationships, and how resources (materials, equipment, and human
resources) will be managed.
Stakeholder Engagement Plan Documents the strategies to use to encourage stakeholder
participation, the analysis of their needs and interests and impacts, and the process regarding
project decision making.
   The project management plan is not limited to the subsidiary plans listed here. For
example, even though the PMBOK(R) Guide does not mention the change management plan
in the list of subsidiary plans, you should develop and include a change management plan
with your project management plan. The change management plan describes how you
will document, address, track, and control changes. You might include other plans and
documentation that help describe how the project will be executed or monitored and con-
trolled. Perhaps you're working on a project that requires precise calculations and exact
adherence to requirements. You could include a plan that describes these calculations,
how they'll be monitored and measured, and the processes you'll use to make changes or
corrections.
   The project management plan also includes project baselines, such as these:
      Schedule baseline
      Cost baseline
      Scope baseline
   Together, the schedule, cost, and scope baseline make up what's called the performance
measurement baseline. I'll talk about each of these documents and baselines in the
remaining chapters as well.



Exam Spotlight

Understand that the purpose of the project management plan is to define how the project
is executed, monitored and controlled, and closed, as well as to document the processes
you'll use during the project. It is made up of the subsidiary management plans and proj-
ect baselines.
                                       Developing the Project Management Plan                 125




   The project management plan consists of all the subsidiary plans and all of the project
baselines as well as other information. Using a more detailed view, the project management
plan should include or discuss the following components:
    Processes you'll use to perform each phase of the project and their level of implementa-
    tion, the tools and techniques you'll use from these processes, and the interactions and
    dependencies among the processes. All this was determined as part of the tailoring
    exercise we talked about in Chapter 2, "Creating the Project Charter."
    The project life cycle you'll use for the project and for each phase of the project if
    applicable
    The development approach you'll use such as waterfall, Agile, or hybrid
    When management reviews should be established (for example, at certain times during
    the project or at completion of milestones), so that the stakeholders can review project
    progress and ensure it's meeting the objectives and/or take action if it is not on track as
    planned
    Change management plan describing methods for monitoring and controlling change
    Configuration management plan describing elements of the product, service, or result
    of the project
    Methods for determining and maintaining the validity of performance baselines, espe-
    cially scope, schedule, and cost
   Once the project management plan is complete and approved, it should be baselined.
Most importantly, the scope, schedule and cost management plans must be baselined so
that changes can be closely managed, and so that you have a point of reference to deter-
mine and measure project progress against for the remainder of the project. As the project
progresses and more and more processes are performed, the subsidiary plans and the proj-
ect management plan itself might change. After the project management plan is baselined,
you will manage these changes using the Perform Integrated Change Control process. All
changes should be reviewed following the processes outlined in the Change Management
Plan, and the project management plan should be updated to reflect the approved changes.



Exam Spotlight

In practice, you'll find that you'll prepare the project management plan after you've pro-
gressed through several of the other Planning processes. It's difficult to finalize some of
these subsidiary plans without thinking through or sometimes performing the process
they're associated with first. However, for the exam, remember that Develop Project Man-
agement Plan is the first process in the Planning group, and it should be performed first.
Updates can and should occur to the project management plan as subsidiary plans are
created or changed. However, once the project management plan is baselined, it can only
be changed using the Perform Integrated Change Control process.
126        Chapter 3      Developing the Project Scope Statement




Overview of the Project Scope
Management Knowledge Area
You'll recall from Chapter 2 that Project Scope Management is concerned with defining all
the work of the project and only the work needed to successfully produce the project goals.
These processes are highly interactive and define and control what is and what is not part of
the project.
    The processes in this Knowledge Area are managed differently under adaptive or Agile
life cycles than they are under predictive life cycles. This is due to the high levels of changes
in an Agile approach. When you're using an Agile process, because of the amount of
changes occurring, you need high stakeholder engagement and high levels of involvement
from the product owner. The product owner should prioritize the backlog items according
to the current needs.
    Table 3.1 highlights the differences between Agile and predictive life cycles when per-
forming the Project Scope Management Knowledge Area processes.

 The remainder of the processes in this chapter are contained in the Project Scope
Management Knowledge Area.



Plan Scope Management
Plan Scope Management is the first process in the Project Scope Management Knowledge
Area. Remember that the purpose of the Project Scope Management Knowledge Area is to
describe and control what is and what is not work of the project. Scope is collectively the
product, service, or result of the project and the deliverables the project intends to produce.
   The primary purpose of this process is twofold: to write the scope management plan
and to develop the requirements management plan. The scope management plan is a plan-
ning tool that documents how the project team will go about defining project scope, how
changes to scope will be maintained and controlled, and how project scope will be vali-
dated. The requirements management plan addresses analyzing, documenting, and manag-
ing the project requirements. I'll cover the requirements management plan in detail in the
section "Documenting the Scope Management Plan" later in this chapter.



Exam Spotlight

According to the PMBOK (R) Guide the activities and processes in the Planning process
group involve defining, assessing, and reviewing detailed project requirements based on
the project charter in order to establish the project deliverables. You will perform these
processes with your stakeholders using requirements gathering techniques. Review-
ing lessons learned from previous projects of similar size and scope and reviewing the
constraints and assumptions of this project are all keys to documenting a detailed list of
project deliverables.

  For now you'll concentrate on the inputs to this process, which will help you get started
documenting the decisions about the Plan Scope Management process for your project.


Understanding the Plan Scope Management Inputs
You've seen the inputs to the Plan Scope Management process before. They are as follows:
      Project charter
      Project management plan (quality management plan, project life cycle description,
      development approach)
      Enterprise environmental factors
      Organizational process assets
   Even though I've talked about these before, you'll want to look at specific elements
of some of these inputs closely. Defining project scope, and managing that scope as you
progress through the project, has a direct relationship to the success of the project. It's dif-
ficult to document how you'll define project scope if you don't first understand the purpose
behind the project; the product, service, or result you're trying to produce; and the environ-
mental factors and organizational process assets under which you're working. The process
of how you'll go about defining and managing scope is what the scope management plan
(which is what you're ultimately getting to with this process) is about.
   The project charter describes the purpose and high-level requirements of the project.
Analyzing the information in this document will help you determine the appropriate tools
and methodologies to use (as well as which processes to perform) for the project. The idea
here is that you want to understand the size and complexity of the project so that you don't
spend more time than needed documenting how you're going to go about defining and
managing scope.
   The project management plan is helpful in developing scope, and special consideration
should be given to the quality management plan. This plan documents how the quality
policy, methodologies, and standards for the organization, and thus your project, should
be implemented. The project life cycle description describes the phases of the project so this
will help clarify the scope boundaries for your project as well. Also note that the develop-
ment approach, be it predictive (or waterfall), Agile, or hybrid, will also dictate how scope
will be defined. In a waterfall approach, for example, the entire scope statement and all
elements of scope will be developed before the work commences versus an Agile approach,
where scope is developed iteratively throughout the project.
   One of the environmental factors that might influence the way scope is managed is per-
sonnel administration, or more specifically, the human resources involved on the project.
Their skills, knowledge, and abilities to communicate and escalate issues appropriately
might influence the way project scope is managed.
   Other environmental factors that might affect scope management are the organization's
culture, infrastructure, and market conditions.
   Organizational process assets typically include policies and procedures, whether formal
or informal. Your organization's policies or the policies and guidelines of your industry
                                                        Plan Scope Management                 129




might have an effect on scope management, so make certain you're familiar with them. For
example, personnel policies might dictate how team members should interact or relate with
each other. Let's say you have a team member who has a close relationship with one of the
stakeholders. And imagine that the stakeholder wants a change to the project. The stake-
holder and team member grab a cup of coffee together at the corner deli, and the next thing
you know, the team member is incorporating the change into the project. Scope can't be
managed efficiently when it's being changed without the knowledge of the project manager
or project team. Personnel policies may help you curb situations like this.
   And don't forget historical information and lessons learned. You can review the scope
management plan from previous projects of similar size and scope to help you craft the one
for this project.




Scope Management Plan Requirements

Phil Reid is a gifted engineer. He works as an accident reconstructionist and has a 90 per-
cent success rate at assisting his clients (who are attorneys) at winning court cases. Phil
can intuitively and scientifically determine whether the scene of an accident is real or is
insurance fraud. Most cases Phil works on are managed as projects because each acci-
dent is unique, the cause of each accident is unique, and each investigation has a definite
beginning and ending. The attorneys that Phil's organization works with want the final
results of the investigation delivered in different formats. Although Phil is exceptionally
good at determining the forensic evidence needed to prove or disprove how the accident
occurred, he is not at all gifted in oral communication skills. As a result, the scope man-
agement plan requires the client to define how the outcome of the investigation should
be presented and whether the engineer might be required to testify regarding the results
of the investigation. That way, Phil's organization can plan in advance how to use his tal-
ents on the project and assign a resource to work with him who has the communication
skills and ability to testify if that's required.




Using Plan Scope Management Tools and Techniques
Plan Scope Management has three tools and techniques:
Expert Judgment You'll rely on the expert judgment of people or groups with specific
skills, knowledge, or training to help assess the process inputs. One expert you can count
on in this process is the executive manager who wrote or contributed to the project charter.
This person can clarify questions you might have about the project objectives as well as the
product description. Stakeholders, industry experts, team members, people with specialized
training, or other project managers with previous experience on projects similar to yours can
help you determine how scope management should work for this project.
130        Chapter 3      Developing the Project Scope Statement



Data Analysis (Alternatives Analysis) Alternatives analysis is useful in defining scope and
helps the team think outside the box. I like to use a simple one-word question to help drive
alternative analysis: "Why?" From there, you can ask follow-up questions that will lead you
to alternative approaches, outcomes, or results. Continue until you have viable alternatives
to consider. This is also helpful when determining requirements, defining project scope, and
when validating and controlling scope later in the project. Alternatives analysis is used in
several processes, so I will provide more in-depth details on this technique following this
section.
Meetings You will use meetings with the experts previously noted to determine and formal-
ize the information contained in the scope management plan. You will also want input from
the project sponsor and key stakeholders and should include them in your meetings.


Alternatives Analysis
Alternatives analysis is a technique used for discovering different methods or ways of ac-
complishing the work of the project, or for identifying requirements or project scope. For
example, brainstorming might be used to discover alternative ways of achieving one of the
project objectives. Perhaps the project's budget doesn't allow for a portion of the project that
the stakeholders think needs to be included. Brainstorming might uncover an alternative that
would allow the needed portion to be accomplished.
   Lateral thinking is a form of alternatives generation that can be used to help define
scope, requirements, or objectives. Edward de Bono created this term and has done exten-
sive research and writing on the topic of lateral thinking. The simplest definition is that it's
thinking outside the box. Lateral thinking is a process of breaking apart the problem (or in
our case the deliverables and requirements), looking at them from angles other than their
obvious presentation, and encouraging team members to come up with ways to solve prob-
lems or look at requirements that are not apparently obvious.



Outside the Box

Lateral thinking is a way of reasoning and thinking about problems from perspectives
other than the obvious. It challenges our perceptions and assumptions. Consider these
two examples of lateral thinking that I crafted based on some puzzles I found at this
website: www.folj.com/lateral/. Use your favorite search engine and run a query on
"lateral thinking puzzles" to find many more examples.

Question: How could your pet Yorkie fall from the window of an 18-story building
and live?

Answer: The question asks how your pet could fall from an 18-story building and live;
however, the question doesn't state that your pet fell from the 18th floor. Your pet Yorkie fell
from the basement-level window of an 18-story building.
                                                          Plan Scope Management                  131




Question: Eight chocolates are arranged in an antique candy dish. Eight people each take
one chocolate. There is one chocolate remaining in the dish. How can that be?

Answer: If there are eight chocolates in an antique dish, how can the last person take the
last chocolate yet one remains in the dish? Well, the last person to take a chocolate took the
dish as well--therefore, the last chocolate remained in the dish.

Remember these examples the next time you're defining requirements or looking for
alternative answers to a problem.


   The use of pairwise comparisons is another alternatives generation technique. This is
much like it sounds in that you compare any number of items against each other to deter-
mine which is preferred. This technique typically uses quantitative measures to determine
the preferred option.


Documenting the Scope Management Plan
The first output of the Plan Scope Management process is the scope management plan. This
plan describes how the project team will go about defining project scope, validating the
work of the project, and managing and controlling scope. According to the PMBOK(R) Guide,
the scope management plan should contain the following:
    The process you'll use to prepare the project scope statement. The project scope state-
    ment (which I'll define later in this chapter) contains a detailed description of what the
    deliverables and requirements of the project are and is based on the information con-
    tained in the preliminary scope.
    A process for creating, maintaining, and approving the WBS. The WBS further defines
    the work of the project (as defined in the project scope statement) by breaking down
    the deliverables into smaller pieces of work.
    A process describing the approval process for the scope baseline and how the scope
    baseline will be maintained throughout the project
    A process that defines how the deliverables will be obtained and formally accepted



Exam Spotlight

The scope management plan is a planning tool that documents how the project team will
go about defining project scope, how the work breakdown structure will be developed,
how approval of the scope baseline will be obtained, and how the deliverables will be
obtained and accepted. The scope management plan is based on the approved project
scope. And don't forget, the scope management plan is a subsidiary of the project
management plan.
132         Chapter 3      Developing the Project Scope Statement




Documenting the Requirements Management Plan
The requirements management plan is much like the scope management plan but focuses
on the project and product requirements. This plan details how to analyze, document, and
manage the project requirements throughout all phases of the project. The development ap-
proach you use for the project, such as waterfall, Agile, or a hybrid approach, will influence
how you will manage the project requirements. For example, a predictive or waterfall ap-
proach would dictate that all the requirements for each phase be completed before beginning
the work of the phase and most certainly before moving on to the next phase of the project.
An Agile or hybrid approach might mean that the requirements are not fully defined before
the work begins and are progressively elaborated as the project (or phase) progresses.
   There are several components of a sound requirements management plan. According
to the PMBOK(R) Guide, you should include the following factors in the plan (and you are
always free to add more than those noted here):
      How planning, tracking, and reporting of requirements activities will occur
      How changes to the requirements will be requested, tracked, and analyzed along with
      other configuration management activities
      How requirements will be prioritized
      What metrics will be used to trace product requirements
      What requirements attributes will be documented in the traceability matrix (the last
      output of this process)
      What elements to include on the traceability matrix



Collecting Requirements
Now we are getting into the meat of the Planning processes. In the Collect Requirements
process, we define what the final product or service of the project will look like. You will
recall that scope management describes what is and what is not included in the project
scope. In this case, we're starting off by defining what is included in the work of the project.



Exam Spotlight

This process will gather all the requirements desired for the end product, service, or
result of the project. However, not all of the requirements gathered during this process
will be included in the end result of the project. The Define Scope process is where you
will determine which of the requirements gathered here will be included in the final
project. We will look at Define Scope later in this chapter.
                                                          Collecting Requirements            133




   Requirements describe the characteristics of the deliverables. They might also describe
functionality that a deliverable must have or specific conditions a deliverable must meet to
satisfy the objective of the project. Requirements are typically conditions that must be met
or criteria that the product or service of the project must possess to satisfy the objectives of
the project. Requirements quantify and prioritize the wants, needs, and expectations of the
project sponsor and stakeholders. According to the PMBOK(R) Guide (and lots of personal
experience), you must be able to measure, trace, and test requirements. It's important that
they're complete and accepted by your project sponsor and key stakeholders.
   Requirements can take many forms. According to the PMBOK(R) Guide, requirements
can be classified into the categories listed here, which may also assist you in elaborating
them further:
    Business
    Stakeholder
    Solution
         Functional
         Nonfunctional
    Transition and readiness
    Project
    Quality
   The primary purpose of the Collect Requirements process is to define and document the
project sponsor's, the customer's, and the stakeholder's expectations and needs for meet-
ing the project objectives. In my experience, understanding, documenting, and agreeing
on requirements are critical factors to project success. This also requires actively engaged
stakeholders who are able to define their needs so that the project team can decompose
these needs into the product and project requirements. Recording the requirements and
attaining stakeholder approval of the requirements will help you define and manage their
expectations throughout the project.



Exam Spotlight

Requirements must be documented, analyzed, and quantified in enough detail that they
can be measured once the work of the project begins. Requirements become the basis for
developing the WBS and are essential in estimating costs, developing the project sched-
ule, and quality planning.


   Requirements gathering and documentation is primarily the responsibility of a business
analyst. Project managers may perform this function on very small projects, but trends in
project management show these activities are typically performed by the business analyst
role. According to the PMBOK(R) Guide and PMI(R)'s publication titled Business Analysis
134         Chapter 3      Developing the Project Scope Statement



for Practitioners: A Practical Guide. Business analysis concerns applying knowledge, skills,
and tools and techniques to determine business needs; recommend workable solutions for
those needs; document and manage stakeholder requirements; encourage stakeholders to
be forthcoming with requirements; and facilitate the implementation of these requirements
into the final product, service, or result of the project. Business analysts are the people who
apply the knowledge and skills to obtain and document the stakeholder requirements.
   Business analysts are often the first people assigned to a project, and they are usually
engaged in the business case or feasibility phase before the project even gets to the Initiating
processes. If business analysts are assigned to the project, all the processes associated with
gathering, tracking, recording, analyzing, controlling requirements, and solution evaluation
are the responsibility of that role. The business analyst will follow the project all the way
through to implementation and closeout.
   When a business analyst is working on a project, they work in coordination and close
collaboration with the project manager. The project manager in this scenario is responsible
for overseeing that the requirements gathering and tracking activities are being conducted
and performed according to the project schedule and budget. They also ensure that the
requirements process and business analysts are adding value to the process. It's important
that the business analyst and project manager understand their roles on the project and don't
try to do each other's job. When they are both clear that the business analyst will manage
the requirements processes, the project is likely to proceed smoothly and successfully.


Gathering Inputs for the Collect Requirements Process
The inputs of the Collect Requirements process include the following:
      Project charter
      Project management plan (scope management plan, requirements management plan,
      stakeholder engagement plan)
      Project documents (assumption log, lessons learned register, stakeholder register)
      Business documents
      Agreements
      Enterprise environmental factors
      Organizational process assets
   We've covered the project charter previously. The project management plan subsidiary
plans that apply in this process include the scope management plan and requirements
management plan, which we discussed earlier in this chapter. The stakeholder engagement
plan outlines the communication needs for the stakeholders and their level of involvement
on the project. We will discuss this plan in more detail in Chapter 5, "Developing the
Project Budget and Communicating the Plan." Project documents include the assumption
log, which documents assumptions and constraints (remember that this is an output of the
Develop Project Charter process); the lessons learned register, which identifies what worked
well and not so well regarding requirements gathering techniques on past projects; and
                                                        Collecting Requirements            135




the stakeholder register (which is an output of the Identify Stakeholders process). Business
documents might include the feasibility study or the business case. Agreements (typically
contract type documents) contain scope and requirements information for the project.
   Some of the EEFs you'll focus on in this process are the same as the Plan Scope
Management process: culture, infrastructure, personnel administration, and marketplace
conditions. OPAs for this process include policies and procedures, and historical informa-
tion and lessons learned.
   Let's take a little time to understand the assumptions and constraints that are docu-
mented in the assumption log in more detail before we move on to the tools and techniques
for this process.

Project Assumptions and the Assumption Log
You've probably heard the old saying about the word assume, something about what it
makes out of "u" and "me." In the case of project management, however, throw this old say-
ing out the window, because it's not true.
    Assumptions, for the purposes of project management, are things you believe to be true.
For example, if you're working on a large construction project, you might make assump-
tions about the availability of materials. You might assume that concrete, lumber, drywall,
and so on are widely available and reasonably priced. You might also assume that finding
contract labor is either easy or difficult, depending on the economic times and the avail-
ability of labor in your locale. Each project will have its own set of assumptions, and the
assumptions should be identified, documented, and updated throughout the project.
    It's essential to understand and document the assumptions you're making, and the
assumptions your stakeholders are making, about the project. Did I mention you should
write these down? Record them all in the assumption log. It's also important to find out
as many of the assumptions as you can up front. Projects can fail, sometimes after lots of
progress has been made, because an important assumption was forgotten or the assumption
was incorrect. Defining new assumptions and refining old ones through the course of the
project are forms of progressive elaboration.
    Let's say you make plans to meet your buddy for lunch at 11:30 on Friday at your favor-
ite spot. When Friday rolls around, you assume he's going to show up, barring any catas-
trophes between the office and the restaurant. Project assumptions work the same way. For
planning purposes, you presume the event or thing you've made the assumptions about is
true, real, or certain. You might assume that key resources will be available when needed
on the project. Document that assumption. If Sandy is the one and only resource who can
perform a specific task at a certain point in the project, document your assumption that
Sandy will be available and run it by her manager. If Sandy happens to be on a plane for
Helsinki at the time you thought she was going to be working on the project, you could
have a real problem on your hands.
    Other assumptions could be factors such as vendor delivery times, product availability,
contractor availability, the accuracy of the project plan, the assumption that key project
members will perform adequately, contract signing dates, project start dates, and project
phase start dates. This is not an exhaustive list, but it should get you thinking in the right
136        Chapter 3      Developing the Project Scope Statement



direction. As you interview your stakeholders, ask them about their assumptions and
add them to your list. All of the assumptions you're uncovering could lead to discovering
requirements that weren't previously thought about. Use brainstorming exercises with your
team and other project participants to come up with additional assumptions.


                  Think about some of the factors you usually take for granted when you're
                  trying to identify assumptions. Many times they're the elements everyone
                  expects will be available or will behave in a specific way. Think about fac-
                  tors such as key team members' availability, access to information, access
                  to equipment, management support, and vendor reliability. From there,
                  determine what requirements are needed to support these assumptions.

   Try to validate your assumptions whenever possible. When discussing assumptions with
vendors, make them put those assumptions in writing. In fact, if the services or goods
you're expecting to be delivered by your suppliers are critical to the project, include a clause
in the contract to create a contingency plan in case your suppliers fail to perform. For
example, if you're expecting 200 computers to be delivered, configured, and installed by a
certain date, require the vendor to pay the cost of rental equipment in the event the vendor
can't deliver on the promised due date.
   Remember, when assumptions are incorrect or not documented in the assumption log, it
could cause problems partway through the project and might even be a project killer.

Project Constraints
Constraints are anything that either restrict the actions of the project team or dictate the
actions of the project team. Constraints put you in a box. (I hope you're not claustropho-
bic.) As a project manager, you have to manage to the project constraints, which sometimes
requires creativity.
   In my organization--and I'm sure the same is true in yours--we have far more project
requests than we have resources to work on them. In this case, resources are a constraint.
You'll fi nd that a similar phenomenon occurs on individual projects as well. Almost every
project you'll encounter must work within the triple constraint combination of scope, time,
and cost. The quality of the project (or the outcomes of the project) is affected by how well
these three constraints are managed. Usually, one or two of the triple constraints apply (and
sometimes all three), which restricts the actions of the project team. You might work on
projects where you have an almost unlimited budget (don't we wish!) but time is the limita-
tion. For example, if the president mandated that NASA put an astronaut on Mars by the
end of 2025, you'd have a time-constrained project on your hands.
   Other projects might present the opposite scenario. You have all the time you need to
complete the project, but the budget is fi xed. Still other projects might incorporate two or
more of the project constraints. Government agencies are notorious for starting projects
that have at least two and sometimes all three constraints. For example, new tax laws
are passed that impact the computer programs, requiring new programs to calculate and
track the tax changes. Typically, a due date is given when the tax law takes effect, and the
                                                         Collecting Requirements               137




organization responsible is required to implement the changes with no additions to budget
or staff. In other words, they are told to use existing resources to accomplish the objec-
tives of the project, and the specific requirements, or scope, of the project are such that they
cannot be changed to try to meet the time deadline.
   As a project manager, one of your biggest jobs is to balance the project constraints while
meeting the expectations of your stakeholders. On most projects, you will always have to
balance the triple constraints and/or quality in addition to these. For example, if your pri-
mary constraint is completing the project by the end of the year, you will need to balance
the other constraints: scope and cost (and/or quality). As the saying goes, "I can give you
good, cheap, or on time--pick two."
   Constraints can take on many forms and aren't limited to time, cost, and scope.
Anything that impedes your project team's ability to perform the work of the project or
specifically dictates the way the project should be performed is considered a constraint.
Constraints can come from inside or outside the project or organization. Let's say to fulfill
some of the deliverables of your project you'll have to purchase a large amount of materials
and equipment. Procurement processes may be so cumbersome that ordering supplies for a
project adds months to the project schedule. The procurement process itself becomes a con-
straint because of the methods and procedures you're required to use to get the materials.
   You're likely to encounter the following constraints on your future projects:
Time Constraints As I said, time can be a project constraint. This usually comes in the form
of an enforced deadline, commonly known as the "make it happen now" scenario. If you are
in charge of the company's holiday bash scheduled for December 10, your project is time
constrained. Once the invitations are out and the hall has been rented, you can't move the
date. All activities on this project are driven by the due date.
Budget Constraints Budgets, or cost, are another element of the classic triple constraint.
Budgets limit the project team's ability to obtain resources and might potentially limit the
scope of the project. For example, component X cannot be part of this project because the
budget doesn't support it.
Scope Constraints Scope is the third element of the original triple constraints. Scope defines
the deliverables of the project, and you may have situations where scope is predefined by
your project sponsor. Alternatively, sometimes budget constraints will impact the scope of
the project and require you to cut back on the deliverables originally planned.
Quality Constraints Quality constraints typically are restricted by the specifications of the
product or service. The specifications for those 3-inch widgets we talked about earlier could
be considered a quality constraint. Most of the time, if quality is a constraint, one of the
other constraints--time or budget--has to have some give. You can't produce high qual-
ity on a restricted budget and within a tightly restricted time schedule. Of course, there are
exceptions--but only in the movies.
Schedule Constraints Schedule constraints can cause interesting dilemmas for the project
manager. For example, say you're the project manager in charge of building a new football
stadium in your city. The construction of the stadium will require the use of cranes--and
crane operators--at certain times during the project. If crane operators are not available
138        Chapter 3      Developing the Project Scope Statement



when your schedule calls for them, you'll have to make schedule adjustments so that the
crane operators can come in at the right time.
Resource Constraints Resources could be a constraint from a few different perspectives,
including availability of key resources both internally and in the marketplace, skill levels,
and personality. You may also have availability issues or quality problems with nonhuman
resources, like materials and goods. Human resources constraints are something I deal with
on every project.
Technology Constraints Technology is marvelous. In fact, how did humans survive prior to
the invention of computers and cell phones? However, it can also be a project constraint. For
example, your project might require the use of new technology that is still so new it hasn't
been released on a wide-scale basis or hasn't been adequately tested to determine stability in
production. One impact might be that the project will take an additional six months until
the new technology is ready and tested.
Directive Constraints Directives from management can be constraints as well. Your depart-
ment might have specific policies that management requires for the type of work you're
about to undertake. This might add time to the project, so you must consider those policies
when identifying project constraints. When you're performing work on contract, the provi-
sions of the contract can be constraints.
   Constraints, particularly the classic triple constraints, can be used to help drive out the
objectives and requirements of the project. If it's difficult to discern which constraint is the
primary constraint, ask the project sponsor something like this: "Ms. Sponsor, if you could
have only one of these two alternatives, which would you choose? The project is delivered
on the date you've stated, or we don't spend one penny more than the approved budget." If
Ms. Sponsor replies with the date response, you know your primary constraint is time. If
push comes to shove during the project, the budget might have to give because time cannot.
   You'll want to understand what the primary constraint is on the project. If you assume
the primary constraint is budget when in actuality the primary constraint is time, in the
immortal words of two-year-olds worldwide, "Uh-oh." Understanding the constraints and
which one carries the most importance will help you later in the project Planning process
group with details such as scope planning, scheduling, estimating, and project management
plan development. That's assuming your project makes it to the Planning process group.
Which brings me back to the assumption log. Constraints are documented right along with
assumptions in the assumption log. Did I mention the importance of writing these down
and reviewing them periodically throughout the project?


Using the Tools and Techniques of the Collect
Requirements Process
Your communication skills are about to come in handy. Gathering and documenting require-
ments is not a task for the faint of heart. Because defining and producing requirements are
so critical to the success of the project, I recommend using team members with excellent
                                                         Collecting Requirements            139




communication skills to perform this task. If they have the ability to read minds, all the bet-
ter. Stakeholders almost always know what they want the end product to look like but often
have difficulty articulating their needs. An expert communicator can read between the lines
and ask probing questions that will draw the information out of the stakeholder. Even better,
if you are lucky enough to have a business analyst assigned to your project, they are usually
experts at asking the right questions and taking high-level concepts from stakeholders and
breaking them down into specific requirements.
    There are several tools and techniques in this process, and we'll cover each next. They
include the following:
    Expert judgment
    Data gathering (brainstorming, interviews, focus groups, questionnaires and surveys,
    benchmarking)
    Data analysis (document analysis)
    Decision making (voting, multicriteria decision analysis)
    Data representation (affinity diagrams, mind mapping)
    Interpersonal and team skills (nominal group, observation/conversation, facilitation)
    Context diagram
    Prototypes

Expert Judgment
Business process owners are those people who are experts in their particular area of the
business. They are invaluable resources to the project manager and in gathering requirements
for the project. They are usually the mid-level managers and line managers who still have
their fingers in the day-to-day portion of the business. For example, it takes many experts
in various areas to produce and market a great bottle of beer. Machinists regulate and keep
the stainless steel and copper drums in top working order. Chemists check and adjust the
secret formulas brewing in the vats daily. Graphic artists must develop colorful and interest-
ing labels and ads to attract the attention of those thirsty patrons. Of course, those great TV
commercials advertising the tasty brew are produced by yet another set of business experts,
and managers at all levels review and approve the work. These are the kinds of people you'll
interview and ask to assist you in identifying requirements.

Data Gathering Tools and Techniques
There are several data gathering tools and techniques in this process you can use to help
identify the requirements of the project. Some of these tools and techniques can also be
used during the Identify Risks process and the Plan Quality Management process. We'll
cover those processes in Chapter 6, "Risk Planning," and Chapter 7 respectively. The
following data gathering tools and techniques are used for the Collect Requirements
process:
Brainstorming This involves getting a group of expects together to help identify potential
requirements. A facilitator usually conducts these sessions and all ideas (there are no bad
140         Chapter 3      Developing the Project Scope Statement



ideas in brainstorming) are shared, collected, prioritized and then determined to be valid
requirements or not.
Interviews Interviews are typically one-on-one conversations with stakeholders. Interviews
can be formal or informal and generally consist of questions prepared ahead of time. The ad-
vantages to this tool are that subject matter experts and experienced project participants can
impart a lot of information in a short amount of time and typically have a good understand-
ing of the features and functions needed from the project deliverables. You should record the
responses during the interviews, and don't be afraid to ask spontaneous questions as they
occur to you during the interview.
Focus Groups Focus groups are usually conducted by a trained moderator. The key to
this tool lies in picking the subject matter experts and stakeholders to participate in the
focus group.
Questionnaires and Surveys The questionnaires and surveys in this case would be written
with a focus on gathering requirements. This data gathering technique is useful when teams
are not colocated or you need responses quickly.
Benchmarking This technique is used in the Quality processes as well and involves compar-
ing measurements against standards to determine performance. It can also compare process-
es, operations, management practices, and so on against other departments, organizations,
or industries to help refine and promote best practices or come up with ideas to improve
current practices.

Data Analysis
Data analysis for this process involves reviewing documents with the purpose of identifying
requirements or information associated with potential requirements. The documents might
include agreements, business plans, business processes, business rules, process flows, issue
logs, regulatory documents, marketing information, and more.

Decision Making
The purpose of decision making in this process is to ultimately come to conclusions regard-
ing the requirements needed to fulfill the project objectives. There are two options you can
use for this tool and technique including voting and multicriteria decision analysis. Voting
can be a straightforward technique where stakeholders simply vote yes or no on including
the requirements. The PMBOK(R) Guide outlines several voting methods that are a bit more
complex than a simple yes/no vote. Stakeholders should agree beforehand which of the fol-
lowing methods they will use for voting. The methods are as follows:
Unanimity    This decision is unanimous in that all stakeholders agree.
Majority    This occurs when the majority of stakeholders agree on the decision.
Plurality This involves counting the excess of votes where the largest segment of a group
decides but is not necessarily a majority. This is typically used when two or more options are
being voted on.
                                                        Collecting Requirements            141




Autocratic decision   Making involves one person making the decision on behalf of the
group.
Multicriteria decision analysis Is another method of making a decision where a matrix is
used to analyze criteria identified ahead of time (such as risk levels valuation).

Data Representation
This tool and technique is concerned with how you will present the information. In this pro-
cess, affinity diagrams and mind mapping methods are helpful in brainstorming or visually
displaying the interplay of requirements.
   Affinity diagrams are what you might end up with after a brainstorming session. These
diagrams group like ideas and solutions so that it's easier to analyze them.
   Mind mapping is another data representation technique in which participants first use
brainstorming techniques to record their ideas. Whiteboards and flip charts are great tools
to use with this process. The facilitator uses the whiteboard to map ideas, and using a
mind-mapping layout, groups similar topics together. There are a few mind-mapping soft-
ware packages available on the market that can greatly assist with this process. Mind map-
ping allows the participants to gain an understanding of common ideas and themes, create
new ideas, and understand differences.

Interpersonal and Team Skills
Several techniques can be used to assist in defining requirements within this heading, includ-
ing the nominal group technique, observation and conversation, and facilitation.
    The nominal group technique can be used for several processes. I'll explain this one in
more detail in Chapter 6. For now, understand that this technique enhances brainstorming
and involves a facilitator and a voting process.
    Observation and conversation is a way to elicit requirements from stakeholders by
observing their actions or speaking with them one-on-one. Observation is also known as
job shadowing because you sit beside the stakeholder and physically watch each step she
takes in performing her task or function. This helps you, or the business analyst, to define
the requirements in terms the project team will understand. Sometimes, stakeholders have
difficulty explaining their requirements in an understandable manner, so actually observing
them performing their tasks is a great way to obtain firsthand knowledge of their require-
ments. An equally effective method is for the business analyst or project manager to per-
form the task or function themselves so they see what the stakeholder experiences (this is
known as a participant observer). This may also reveal elements of the process that are not
apparent when discussing the process verbally with a stakeholder.
    Facilitation in this process may involve workshops or interactive participant meet-
ings where requirements are identified. Facilitated sessions are usually performed by
someone without a vested interest in the outcome so they can remain objective and keep
everyone focused on the objectives of the session. It builds camaraderie and trust and
can often turn into lively, spirited discussions where everyone is engaged and consensus
is easier to obtain.
142        Chapter 3      Developing the Project Scope Statement



   According to the PMBOK(R) Guide, facilitation sessions might include joint application
design and development sessions (JAD), quality function deployment (QFD), or user
stories. JAD is used primarily on technical projects where the program developers sit
with the business process experts in a facilitated session and discuss requirements and the
software development process at the same time.
   QFD sessions involve identifying essential characteristics of the product being developed.
This focuses on gathering information about the customer needs and is also known as voice
of the customer. This method is used primarily in the manufacturing industry.
   User stories, used primarily on technology projects, are short descriptions of the func-
tionality required and describe the role (that is, the stakeholder, also known as an actor)
who desires the functionality, the goal they are trying to meet with this requirement or
functionality, and their motivation or the benefits to them or their department of deploying
this functionality.



Exam Spotlight

The primary difference between focus groups (discussed earlier in this section) and
facilitated workshops is that focus groups are gatherings of prequalified subject matter
experts and stakeholders, and facilitated workshops consist of cross-functional stake-
holders who can define cross-functional requirements. Differences among stakeholders
can be resolved more quickly and consensus is more easily attained in a facilitated
workshop environment.



Context Diagram
A context diagram visually shows the business process or system, where or how actors inter-
act with the system at differing points in the process, and how the interactions between them
take place.

Prototypes
Prototyping is a technique that involves constructing a working model or mock-up of the
final product with which the participants can experiment. The prototype does not usually
contain all the functionality the end product does, but it gives participants enough informa-
tion that they can provide feedback regarding the mock-up. Storyboarding is a prototyp-
ing technique used in the film industry, instructional design projects, and technology and
software development projects (it is particularly useful when using Agile development
methodologies). In a technology project, for example, the storyboard may walk through the
steps involved when a user opens an app and clicks on the various buttons or menu options.
You can experience a simulated mock-up of what end users will see when they interact with
the app by storyboarding all the screens or options that will be presented to them. This is an
iterative process where participants experiment and provide feedback and the prototype is
revised and the cycle starts again.

Documenting Requirements
Now that you've employed the tools and techniques of this process to gather requirements,
you'll want to record them in a requirements document. Stakeholders sometimes have short
memories, particularly on long-term projects, so documenting requirements and obtaining
their approval is essential for project success. You will use the requirements documentation
throughout the project to manage stakeholder and customer expectations. This is a lot easier
to accomplish when they've agreed to the requirements ahead of time, and you have their
approval documented.
   I've already mentioned the fi rst output of this process, which is requirements documen-
tation. The other output of this process is the requirements traceability matrix. I'll describe
each in detail next.

Requirements Documentation
As I mentioned earlier, requirements quantify and prioritize the wants, needs, and expecta-
tions of the project sponsor and stakeholders to achieve the project objectives. Requirements
typically start out high level and are progressively expanded as the project progresses. You
must be able to track, measure, test, and trace the requirements of the project. You never
want to find yourself at the end of the project (or phase) and discover you have no way to
validate the requirements. If you can't measure or test whether the requirement satisfies the
business need of the project, the definition of success is left to the subjective opinions of
the stakeholders and team members.
   You've worked hard to gather and defi ne requirements, and you don't want all that
effort going to waste. This output involves recording the requirements in a require-
ments document. The PMBOK(R) Guide does not dictate the format of this document and
acknowledges that it can be formal with lots of detail or a simple list categorized by stake-
holder and priority. However, it does state that the requirements can be classified into the
following categories:
    Business requirements, such as the business needs or opportunities to be realized and
    the reasons why the project was started
    Objectives of the project and the business objectives the project hopes to fulfill


                  The first two items in this list--business need for the project and
                  objectives--are also needed for the traceability matrix.


    Stakeholder requirements describing stakeholder needs
    Solution requirements, including both functional and nonfunctional requirements:
         Functional requirements are those that describe how the product will perform.
         Nonfunctional requirements are those that describe characteristics needed for the
         requirement to function, such as security needs, performance, and reliability.
144         Chapter 3      Developing the Project Scope Statement




                   Functional requirements is a term used often in software development.
                   It typically describes a behavior, such as calculations or processes that
                   should occur once data is entered. In non-software terms, functional
                   requirements might describe specifications, quantities, colors, and more.
                   Nonfunctional requirements refers to elements that are related to the
                   product but doesn't describe the product directly. In the case of a software
                   product, this could be a security requirement or performance criteria.

      Quality requirements describing the criteria needed to ensure the deliverable or require-
      ment was fulfilled successfully
      Transition and readiness requirements that are needed to ensure successful transition
      to the end or future state. Training and data conversion are examples of transition and
      readiness requirements.
      Project requirements that might include milestone completion dates, constraints, and
      contract commitments
   One of the most important elements of the requirements document that isn't in the
preceding list is the signatures of the key stakeholders indicating their acceptance of the
requirements. They will also sign the scope statement, which we'll talk about in the section
"Defi ning Scope" later in this chapter.

Requirements Traceability Matrix
The last output of the Collect Requirements process is the requirements traceability matrix.
The idea behind the traceability matrix is to document where the requirement originated,
document what the requirement will be traced to, link each requirement to a testing strategy,
and then follow it through to delivery or completion. Table 3.2 shows a sample traceability
matrix with several attributes that identify the requirement.

Ta b l e 3 . 2    Requirements traceability matrix


          Description of                                                            Status and
Unique ID requirement          Source      Priority Test scenario   Owner           date

001          Requirement       Project     B         User           HR specialist   Approved
             one               objective             acceptance                     3/15



   Each requirement should have its own unique identifier. You could devise a numbering
system that defi nes both the category of the requirement and a unique, ascending number--
for example, HR (for human resources) 001--or a simple numbering system, as shown in
this example, may suffice.
                                                                     Defining Scope            145




   The description should be brief but have enough information to easily identify the
requirement.
   The source column refers to where the requirement originated. Requirements may come
from many sources, including project objectives, business needs, product design, the work
breakdown structure, and deliverables.
   Priority refers to the priority of the requirement. You can use any prioritization process,
like a simple numbering system or an alpha system, as the example shows. The definition of
a "B" priority should be included in the requirements management plan. Perhaps an "A" is
essential to project success, and a "B" is highly desirable.
   The test scenario in this example is where you record how the requirement will be
tested (or during which project phase) and the owner of the test item, who will also decide
whether the test scenario passes or fails.
   Status may capture information about the requirement that refers to whether the
requirement has been approved to be included in the project; if it was added, deferred, or
canceled; and so on.
   The traceability matrix may also include the WBS deliverable the requirement is associ-
ated with, how it ties to the product design, and/or the product development.



Exam Spotlight

According to the PMBOK (R) Guide, the requirements traceability matrix helps ensure that
business value is realized when the project is complete because each requirement is
linked to a business and project objective.


   The next process in the Planning process group is the Define Scope process. We'll look
at that next.



Defining Scope
Now that you've documented the project requirements, you're ready to further define the
needs of the project in the Define Scope process. Scope can refer to product scope (the fea-
tures and characteristics that describe the product, service, or result of the project) or project
scope (the project management work). We'll look at both product and project scope in this
part of the chapter. The project scope statement (an output of this process) is what you'll
use to develop and document a detailed description of the deliverables of the project and
the work needed to produce them. This process is progressively elaborated as more detail
becomes known.
146           Chapter 3      Developing the Project Scope Statement




Exam Spotlight

You'll want to pay particular attention to the accuracy and completeness of this process.
Defining project scope is critical to the success of the project because it spells out exactly
what the product or service of the project looks like. Conversely, poor scope definition
might lead to cost increases, rework, schedule delays, and poor morale.


      First, you'll examine the inputs and tools and techniques of this process.
      The inputs to the Define Scope process are as follows:
       Project charter
       Project management plan (scope management plan)
       Project documents (assumption log, requirements documentation, risk register)
       Enterprise environmental factors
       Organizational process assets
   Some of the important elements from the project charter that you'll want to consider
when writing the project scope statement (we'll cover this output later) are the project
description, project objectives, the characteristics of the product of the project, and the pro-
cess for approving the project.
   Objectives are quantifiable criteria used to measure project success. They describe
"what" you're trying to do, accomplish, or produce. Quantifiable criteria should at least
include schedule, cost, and quality measures. You might use business measures or qual-
ity targets as well. These objectives will be broken down shortly into deliverables that will
describe the objectives outlined in the charter.
   The scope management plan is useful because it defines the processes and methods you'll
use to define scope, including how to define scope, how to ensure scope is correct, and how
to control scope.
   The project documents that are useful for this process include the assumption log,
requirements documentation, and risk register. You are familiar with the assumption log.
   The requirements documentation is a starting point for developing the scope statement.
During the Define Scope process, you will determine which requirements will be included
in the final product, service, or result of the project. They will be progressively elaborated
and then documented in detail in the scope statement. The idea here is that you know
some information when the charter is being written and more information comes to light
when you hold brainstorming sessions or other meetings with stakeholders to discover
the requirements of the product of the project (during the Collect Requirements process).
Finally, those requirements are decided on, further elaborated, and documented (again) in
much more detail in the scope statement. Keep in mind that not all of the requirements that
you gathered and documented in the Collect Requirements process may be included in the
scope statement. You will reexamine those requirements here and determine which ones are
keepers and which ones are not.
   All of Chapter 6 is devoted to risk planning, and we'll discuss the risk register there, but
for now, understand that the risk register is a list of risks that may impact the project and
therefore may affect scope.
                                                                   Defining Scope              147




   Some of the key EEFs for this process include the organizational culture, its infra-
structure, personnel administration practices, and the marketplace conditions. The
OPAs include historical information from previous projects, policies and procedures,
templates that may exist to write the scope statement, and lessons learned from
previous projects.



Exam Spotlight

If the project charter is missing or was not created, you'll need to develop the information
normally found in the charter (or obtain it from other sources) to use as the foundation for
creating the project scope statement.


   You'll see some new tools and techniques in this process:
    Expert judgment
    Data analysis (alternatives analysis)
    Decision making (multicriteria decision analysis)
    Interpersonal and team skills (facilitation)
    Product analysis
   You learned about expert judgment in Chapter 2 and about interpersonal and team skills
in the form of facilitation and facilitated workshops earlier in this chapter. We also covered
data analysis (alternatives analysis) and decision making earlier in this chapter. I'll discuss
product analysis next.


Product Analysis
Product analysis goes hand in hand with the product scope description and, therefore, is
most useful when the project's end result is a product. Product analysis is a method for
converting the product description and project objectives into deliverables and requirements.
According to the PMBOK(R) Guide, product analysis might include performing value analysis,
product breakdown, requirements analysis, systems-engineering techniques, systems analysis,
and value-engineering techniques to further define the product or service.



Exam Spotlight

It's beyond the scope of this book to go into the various analysis techniques used in prod-
uct analysis. For exam purposes, remember that product analysis is a tool and technique
of the Define Scope process and memorize the list of analysis techniques that might be
performed in this process.
148         Chapter 3        Developing the Project Scope Statement




Writing the Project Scope Statement
The purpose of the project scope statement is to document the project objectives, deliverables,
and the work required to produce the deliverables so that it can be used to direct the project
team's work and as a basis for future project decisions. The scope statement is an agreement
between the project management team and the project customer that states precisely what the
work of the project will produce. Simply put, the scope statement tells everyone concerned
with the project exactly what they're going to get when the work is finished.



Exam Spotlight

Understand that the purpose of the scope statement, according to the PMBOK (R) Guide,
is to provide all the stakeholders with a foundational understanding of the project and
product scope. It describes the project deliverables in detail. Also remember that the
scope statement defines and progressively elaborates the work of the project. It guides
the work of the project team during the Executing process, and all change requests will
be evaluated against the scope statement. If the change request is outside the bounds of
the project scope as documented in the project scope statement, it should be denied.


   Since the scope statement serves as a baseline for the project, if questions arise or
changes are proposed later in the project, they can be compared to what's documented in
the scope statement. Making change decisions is easier when the original deliverables and
requirements are well documented. You'll also know what is out of scope for the project
simply because the work isn't documented in the scope statement (or conversely, deliver-
ables or other elements are documented and noted as being specifically out of scope). The
criteria outlined in the scope statement will also be used to determine whether the project
was completed successfully. I hope you're already seeing the importance of documenting
project scope.


Understanding the Scope Statement Components
According to the PMBOK(R) Guide, the project scope statement should include all of the
following:
      Product scope description
      Acceptance criteria
      Project deliverables
      Project exclusions
   If the details surrounding these are spelled out in other documents, you don't have to
reenter all the information in the scope statement. Simply reference the other document in
the scope statement so that readers know where to find it.
                                             Writing the Project Scope Statement              149




Exam Spotlight

You may be thinking that the project scope statement has some of the same information
as the project charter. Keep in mind the project charter is a high-level description of the
project (and it names the project manager), whereas the project scope statement is a
detailed description of the project and product scope and describes how the final product
or result of the project will be accepted, along with the other items mentioned earlier.



Product Scope Description
The product scope description describes the characteristics of the product, service, or result
of the project. I talked about this in Chapter 2. If the product scope description is contained
in the project charter, you can reference the project charter in the project scope statement,
or you can copy and paste the information from the project charter into the scope state-
ment. It won't hurt anything to have it in both places and will make reading the scope
statement easier.



Exam Spotlight

You'll use the project management plan as your measurement of project scope comple-
tion, and product scope completion will be measured against product requirements.



Acceptance Criteria
Acceptance criteria include the process and criteria that will be used to determine whether
the deliverables and the final product, service, or results of the project are acceptable and
satisfactory. Acceptance criteria help you describe project success because it defines the speci-
fications the deliverables must meet in order to be acceptable to the stakeholder. Acceptance
criteria might include any number of elements, such as quality criteria, fitness for use, and
performance criteria. This component should also describe the process stakeholders will use
to indicate their acceptance of the deliverables.

Project Deliverables
Deliverables are measurable outcomes, measurable results, or specific items that must be pro-
duced or performed to consider the project or project phase completed. Deliverables should
be specific and verifiable. For example, one of your deliverables might include widgets with
a 3-inch diameter that will in turn be assembled into the final product. This deliverable, a
3-inch-diameter widget, is specific and measurable. However, if the deliverable was not docu-
mented or not communicated to the manager or vendor responsible for manufacturing the
widgets, there could be a disaster waiting to happen. If they deliver 2-inch widgets instead of
the required 3-inch version, it would throw the entire project off schedule or perhaps cause
150        Chapter 3      Developing the Project Scope Statement



the project to fail. This could be a career-limiting move for the project manager because it's
the project manager's responsibility to document deliverables and monitor the progress of
those deliverables throughout the project. Most projects have multiple deliverables. As in this
example, if you are assembling a new product with many parts, each of the parts might be
considered independent deliverables.
   A project deliverable is typically a unique and verifiable product or result or a service
that's performed. The product or service must be produced or performed in order to con-
sider the project complete. The deliverables might also include supplementary outcomes,
such as documentation or project management reports.
   The bottom line is this: No matter how well you apply your project skills, if the wrong
deliverables are produced or the project is managed to the wrong objectives, you will have
an unsuccessful project on your hands.



Critical Success Factors

Deliverables and requirements are sometimes referred to as critical success factors. Criti-
cal success factors are those elements that must be completed in order for the project to
be considered complete. For example, if you're building a bridge, one of the deliverables
might be to produce a specific number of trusses that will be used to help support the
bridge. Without the trusses, the bridge can't be completed; in fact, the bridge might not
stand without them. The trusses, in this case, are critical success factors. Not all deliver-
ables are necessarily critical success factors, but many of them will fall into this category
and should be documented as such.




Documenting All the Deliverables and Requirements

One of the project manager's primary functions is to accurately document the deliver-
ables and requirements of the project and then manage the project so that they are pro-
duced according to the agreed-upon criteria. Deliverables describe the components of
the goals and objectives in a quantifiable way. Requirements are the specifications of the
deliverables. (Remember for the exam that requirements are documented in the Collect
Requirements process that occurs before the Define Scope process.)

The project manager should use the project charter as a starting point for identifying
and progressively elaborating project deliverables, but it's possible that only some of
the deliverables will be documented there. Remember that the charter was signed by a
manager external to the project, and it was the first take at defining the project objectives
and deliverables. As the project manager, it's your job to make certain all the deliverables
are identified and documented in the project scope statement. That's because the
scope statement (not the project charter) serves as the agreement among stakeholders--
including the customer of the project--regarding what deliverables will be produced to
meet and satisfy the business needs of the project.
                                            Writing the Project Scope Statement               151




Interview the stakeholders, other project managers, project team members, customers,
management staff, industry experts, and any other experts who can help you identify all
the deliverables of the project. Depending on the size of the project, you might be able to
accomplish this in a group setting using simple brainstorming techniques, but large com-
plex projects might have scope statements for each deliverable of the project. Remember
that the project scope statement is progressively expanded into finer detail and is used
later to help decompose the work of the project into smaller tasks and activities.



Project Exclusions
Project exclusions are, as you'd guess, anything that isn't included as a deliverable or work
of the project. You'll want to note the project exclusions in the project scope statement so
that you can continue to manage stakeholder expectations throughout the project.


Approving and Publishing the Project Scope Statement
Just like the project charter, the project scope statement should be approved, agreed upon,
published, and distributed to the stakeholders, key management personnel, and project
team members. This isn't an official output of this process, nor is it noted in the PMBOK(R)
Guide. You can accomplish this with a formal sign-off procedure that's documented as
part of the approval requirements section of the scope statement. When stakeholders sign
off and agree to the scope statement, they're agreeing to the deliverables and requirements
of the project. As with the project charter, their agreement and endorsement of the proj-
ect requirements and deliverables will likely sustain their participation and cooperation
throughout the rest of the project. That doesn't mean they'll agree to everything as the
project progresses, but it does mean the stakeholders are informed and will likely remain
active project participants.


                  Remember that the definition of a successful project is one that accom-
                  plishes the goals of the project and meets stakeholders' expectations.
                  Understand and document those expectations and you're off to a
                  good start.


Updating the Project Documents
The last output of this process is project documents updates. When you're in the midst of
defining deliverables, you'll often find that changes to the original project objectives, re-
quirements, or stakeholder register will occur. This may require updates to the stakeholder
register, the requirements documentation, the requirements traceability matrix, and the
assumption log. Changes to scope may also occur later in the project. When the changes are
approved, you'll need to update the scope statement and notify stakeholders that changes
have been made.

Mountain Streams Services

Maria Sanchez is the CEO of Mountain Streams Services. She recently accepted a presti-
gious industry award on behalf of the company. Maria knows that without the dedication
and support of her employees, Mountain Streams Services wouldn't have achieved this
great milestone.

Maria wants to host a reception for the employees and their guests in recognition of all
their hard work and contributions to the company. Maria has appointed you to arrange
the reception.

The reception is scheduled for April 12, and Maria has given you a budget of $125 per per-
son. The company employs 200 people. The reception should be semiformal.

You've documented the deliverables as follows:

      Location selection

In addition to the deliverables, you want to go over the following requirements with Maria
to be certain you are both in agreement:

      The location should be in the downtown area.
      Employees are encouraged to bring one guest but no children.
      There will be an open bar paid for by Maria.
      The agenda will include a speech by Maria, followed by the distribution of bonus
      checks to every employee. This is to be kept secret until the reception.
      The decorations should include gold-trimmed fountain pens with the company logo
      at every place setting for the attendees to keep.

Once you've documented all the particulars, you ask to speak with Maria to go over this
project scope statement and get her approval before proceeding with the project.

Creating the Work Breakdown Structure
Have you ever mapped out a family tree? In the Create WBS process, you'll construct
something like it called a work breakdown structure (WBS). It maps the deliverables of the
project with subdeliverables and other components stemming from each major deliverable in
a tree or chart format. Simply put, a WBS is a deliverable-oriented hierarchy that defines and
organizes the entire scope of work of the project and only the work of the project. The items
defined on the WBS come from the approved scope statement. Like the scope statement, the
WBS serves as a foundational agreement among the stakeholders and project team members
regarding project scope.

Subdividing deliverables into smaller components is the purpose of the Create WBS pro-
cess. The PMBOK (R) Guide calls this decomposition, which is also a tool and technique of
this process.


  The WBS will be used throughout many of the remaining Planning processes and is an
important part of project planning. As you probably have concluded, everything you've
done so far builds on the previous step. The project charter, requirements documentation,
and project scope statement outline the project objectives, requirements, and deliverables.
Now you'll use that comprehensive list of requirements and deliverables to build the frame-
work of the WBS.


                 I can't stress enough the importance of the work you've done up to this
                 point. Your WBS will be only as accurate as your list of requirements and
                 deliverables. The deliverables will become the groupings that will form the
                 higher levels of the WBS from which activities will be derived later in the
                 Planning processes.

   The WBS should detail the full scope of work needed to complete the project. This
breakdown will smooth the way for estimating project cost and time, scheduling resources,
and determining quality controls later in the Planning processes. Project progress will be
based on the estimates and measurements assigned to the WBS segments. So, again, accu-
racy and completeness are required when composing your WBS.
   Before you begin constructing the WBS, you'll need to gather and review some impor-
tant project documents. We'll look at those next.
154         Chapter 3      Developing the Project Scope Statement




Gathering the WBS Inputs
The inputs to the Create WBS process aren't new. They are as follows:
      Project management plan (scope management plan)
          Project documents (project scope statement, requirements documentation)
      Enterprise environmental factors
      Organizational process assets
    The scope management plan outlines how you will create the WBS from the elements
listed in the scope statement, and it also describes how to obtain approval for and maintain
the WBS. The important aspect to note about the inputs to this process is that the approved
project scope statement is the document you will use to define and organize the work of the
project in the WBS. Make certain you're using the most current version of the scope state-
ment. Also note that the WBS, just like the project scope statement, contains the work of
the project and only the work of the project.


Decomposing the Deliverables
The Create WBS process consists of two tools and techniques: decomposition and expert
judgment. Decomposition involves breaking down the deliverables into smaller, more
manageable components of work. The idea here is to break down the deliverables to a point
where you can easily plan, execute, monitor and control, and close out the project deliver-
ables. Decomposition typically pertains to breaking deliverables down into smaller deliver-
ables, or component deliverables, where each level of the WBS (or each level of decomposi-
tion) is a more detailed definition of the level above it.
   This breaking-down or decomposing process will accomplish several tasks for you, one
of which is improving estimates. It's easier to estimate the costs, time, and resources needed
for individual work components than it is to estimate them for a whole body of work or
deliverable. Using smaller components also makes it easier to assign performance measures
and controls. These give you a baseline to compare against throughout the project or phase.
Finally, assigning resources and responsibility for the components of work makes better
sense because several resources with different skills might be needed to complete one deliv-
erable. Breaking them down ensures that an assignment, and the responsibility for that
assignment, goes to the proper parties.
   According to the PMBOK(R) Guide, decomposition is a five-step process:
1.    Identify the deliverables and work. This step involves identifying all the major project
      deliverables and related work. You can use the expert judgment technique to analyze
      the project scope statement and identify the major deliverables.
2.    Organize the WBS. This step involves organizing the work of the project and deter-
      mining the WBS structure. (I'll talk more about constructing the WBS in the next
      section.)
                                         Creating the Work Breakdown Structure               155




3.   Decompose the WBS components into lower-level components. WBS components,
     like the deliverables and requirements, should be defined in tangible, verifiable terms
     so that performance and successful completion (or delivery) are easily measured and
     verified. Each component must clearly describe the product, service, or result in verifi-
     able terms, and it must be assigned to a unit in the organization that will take responsi-
     bility for completing the work and making certain of its accuracy.
4.   Assign identification codes. This step is a process where you assign identification codes
     or numbers to each of the WBS components.


                  I'll talk more about the process in step 4, assign identification codes, later
                  in this chapter in the section "Understanding the Unique WBS Identifiers."


5.   Verify the WBS. This is a verification step. Examine the decomposition to determine
     whether all the components are clear and complete. Determine whether each compo-
     nent listed is absolutely necessary to fulfill the requirements of the deliverable, and
     verify that the decomposition is sufficient to describe the work.
    Of course you won't perform this process alone. That's where the expert judgment tool
and technique comes into play. You'll work with others such as team members, stakehold-
ers, other experts with specific training or industry knowledge, those who have worked on
similar projects in the past, and industry aids such as templates.
    You can now plug the components you and the team have identified into the WBS. This
all sounds like a lot of work. I won't kid you--it is, but it's essential to project success. If
you don't perform the WBS process adequately and accurately, you might end up setting
yourself up for a failed project at worst or for lots of project changes, delayed schedules,
and increased costs at best--not to mention all those team members who'll throw up their
hands when you return to them for the third or fourth time to ask that they redo work
they've already completed. I know you won't let this happen, so let's move on to construct-
ing the WBS.
    The Create WBS process has several outputs, one of which is the WBS. You'll look at the
specifics of how to create the WBS next.


Constructing the WBS
There is no "right" way to construct a WBS. In practice, the chart structure is used quite
often. (This structure resembles an organization chart with different levels of detail.) But a
WBS could be composed in outline form as well. The choice is yours. You'll look at a couple
of ways shortly, along with some figures that depict the different levels of a WBS.
   According to the PMBOK(R) Guide, you can organize the WBS in several ways:
Major Deliverables and Subcomponents The major deliverables of the project are used as
the first level of decomposition in this structure. If you're opening a new store, for example,
156          Chapter 3      Developing the Project Scope Statement



the deliverables might include determining location, store build-out, furnishings, product,
and so on. I'll talk about subcomponents next.
Subcomponents That May Be Executed Outside the Project Team Another way to
organize the work is by subcomponents or subprojects within the project. Perhaps you're
expanding an existing highway and several subcomponents are involved. Some of your
first level of decomposition might include these subcomponents: demolition, design,
bridgework, and paving. Each of the project managers will develop a WBS for their
subcomponent that details the work required for that deliverable. When subcomponent
work is involved, oftentimes the subcomponent work is contracted out. In this example, if
you contracted out the bridgework deliverable, this subcomponent requires its own WBS,
which the seller (the bridgework subcontractor) is responsible for creating as part of the
contract and contract work.
Project Phases Many projects are structured or organized by project phases. For example,
let's say you work in the construction industry. The project phases used in your industry
might include project initiation, planning, designing, building, inspection, and turnover. A
feasibility study might be a deliverable under the project initiation phase, blueprints might be
a deliverable under the planning phase, and so on. Each phase listed here would be the first
level of decomposition (that is, the first level of the WBS); their deliverables would be the
next level, and so on.
      We'll take a look at some example WBS structures next.

Understanding the Various WBS Levels
Although the project manager is free to determine the number of levels in the WBS based
on the complexity of the project, all WBS structures start with the project itself. Some WBS
structures show the project as level one. Others show the level under the project, or the first
level of decomposition, as level one. The PMBOK(R) Guide notes that level one is the project
level, so I'll follow that example here.
   The first level of decomposition might be the deliverables, phases, or subprojects, as I
talked about earlier. (Remember that the first level of decomposition is actually the sec-
ond level of the WBS because the project level is the first level.) The levels that follow
show more and more detail and might include more deliverables followed by require-
ments. Each of these breakouts is called a level in the WBS. The lowest level of any
WBS is called the work package level. The goal is to construct the WBS to the work
package level where you can easily and reliably estimate cost and schedule dates. Keep
in mind that not all of the deliverables may need the same amount of decomposition.
Also realize that performing too much decomposition can be as unproductive as not
decomposing enough. My rule of thumb is, when the work outlined in the work pack-
age level is easily understood by team members and can be completed within a reason-
able length of time, you've decomposed enough. If you decompose to the point where
work packages are describing individual activities associated with higher-level elements,
you've gone too far.

exam Spotlight

Remember that each descending level of the WBS is a more detailed description of
the project deliverables than the level above it. Each component of the WBS should be
defined clearly and completely and should describe how the work of the project will be
performed and controlled. Collectively, all the levels of the WBS roll up to the top so that
all the work of the project is captured (and no additional work is added). According to the
PMBOK (R) Guide, this is known as the 100 percent rule.



                   There is some controversy among project managers over whether activi-
                   ties should be listed on the WBS. In practice, I often include activities on
                   my work breakdown structure for small projects only because it facilitates
                   other Planning processes later. In this case, the activities are the work
                   package level. However, you should realize that large, complex projects
                   do not include activities on the WBS. For the exam, remember that you
                   will decompose activities during the Define Activities process that I'll talk
                   about in Chapter 4, "Creating the Project Schedule," and that activities are
                   not part of the WBS.

   The easiest way to describe the steps for creating a WBS is with an example. Let's sup-
pose you work for a software company that publishes children's games. You're the project
manager for the new Billy Bob's Bassoon game, which teaches children about music, musi-
cal rhythm, and beginning sight reading. The fi rst box on the WBS is the project name; it
appears at the top of the WBS, as shown in Figure 3.1, and is defi ned as WBS level one.

f i g u r e 3 .1   WBS levels one and two


           WBS Level One                        Billy Bob's Bassoon

           WBS Level Two
                               Definition         Specifications          Modules


   The next level is the fi rst level of decomposition and should describe the major deliver-
ables for the project. In this example, some of the deliverables might be requirements defi ni-
tion, design specifications, and programming. This isn't an exhaustive list of deliverables; in
practice, you would go on to place all of your major deliverables into the WBS as level two
content. For illustration purposes, just look at a slice of the WBS for this project. Refer to
Figure 3.1 to see the WBS with level one and level two detail added.
158           Chapter 3         Developing the Project Scope Statement



   Level three content might be the component deliverables that are further broken out
from the major deliverables of level two, or it might be the products or results that contrib-
ute to the deliverable. The Billy Bob's Bassoon example shows further deliverables as level
three content. See Figure 3.2 for an illustration of the WBS so far.

              Requirements         Requirements                            Requirements        Requirements




                      Large, complex projects are often composed of several subprojects that
                      collectively make up the main project. The WBS for a project such as the
                      Billy Bob's Bassoon game would show the subprojects as level one detail.
                      These subprojects' major deliverables would then be listed as level two
                      content, perhaps more deliverables as level three, and so on.

    The goal here is to eventually break the work out to the point where the responsibility
and accountability for each work package can be assigned to an organizational unit or a
team of people. In Figure 3.3, I've decomposed this WBS to the fourth level to show an
even fi ner level of deliverable detail. Remember that activities are not usually included in
the WBS. An easy way to differentiate between deliverables and activities is to use nouns
as the deliverable descriptors and verbs as activity descriptors (we'll talk about activi-
ties in Chapter 4). Reaching way back to my grade-school English, I recall that a noun
is a person, place, or thing. In this example, the deliverables are described using nouns.
When we get to the activity list, you might use verbs like defi ne, design, and determine to
describe them.

   You can see from these illustrations how a poorly defined scope or inadequate list of
deliverables will lead to a poorly constructed WBS. Not only will this make the WBS look
sickly, but the project itself will suffer and might even succumb to the dreaded premature
project demise. The final cost of the project will be higher than estimated, and lots of
rework (translation: late nights and weekends) will be needed to account for the missing
work not listed on the WBS. You can construct a good WBS and maintain a healthy project
by taking the time to document all the deliverables during the Define Scope process.



WBS Templates

Work breakdown structures can be constructed using WBS templates or the WBS from a
similar, completed project. Although every project is unique, many companies and indus-
tries perform the same kind of projects repeatedly. The deliverables are similar from proj-
ect to project, and they generally follow a consistent path. WBS templates can be used in
a case like this as a tool to simplify the WBS process, saving the project manager time.
160         Chapter 3      Developing the Project Scope Statement



   Don't get too carried away when creating a WBS. The object is to define the work of
the project so you can easily plan, manage, monitor, and control the work. But you don't
want to take this too far. If you decompose the work to the point that you're showing every
minute detail, you've ventured into inefficiency and will find it more difficult to plan and
manage. In addition, you're potentially stifling the creativity of the people working on the
project because everything is so narrowly defined.
   Sometimes, particularly when working on large projects that consist of several sub-
projects, some of the subprojects might not be scheduled until a future date. Obviously,
it makes sense to develop the WBS in detail at that future date when the deliverables and
subprojects are better known and more details are available. This technique is called rolling
wave planning. The idea behind this technique is that you elaborate the work of the project
to the level of detail you know about at the time. If a subproject or deliverable is scheduled
sometime in the future, the only component that might appear on the WBS today is the
subproject itself. As you get closer to the subproject, you'll elaborate the details of the sub-
project and record them on the WBS.



Exam Spotlight

Understand that rolling wave planning is a process of elaborating deliverables, project
phases, or subprojects in the WBS to differing levels of decomposition depending on the
expected date of the work. Work in the near term is described in more detail than work to
be performed in the future.



Understanding the Unique WBS Identifiers
Each work package in the WBS is assigned a unique identifier known as a code of accounts
identifier. This is typically a number, or a combination of letters and numbers, that's used to
track the costs, schedules, and scope associated with that work package. Code of accounts
identifiers can also be assigned to other unique components of the WBS, but for study pur-
poses, we'll focus on the work package level.
   A control account consists of two or more work packages. And remember that a work
package can be assigned to only one control account. A control account is used to summa-
rize cost, schedule, and scope for all the work package levels assigned to it. Think of them
as a checkpoint to monitor performance for the deliverable. A control account is typically
inserted between a deliverable and the work packages needed to fulfill that deliverable.
Let's look at an example.
   The unique identifiers for the requirements definition branch of the WBS might look
something like this:
      10-1 Billy Bob's Bassoon
      10-2 Requirements Definition
                                        Creating the Work Breakdown Structure             161




    10-3 Game Requirements
        10-3-1 Character Defi nition
        10-3-2 Instruments Design
    10-4 Software Requirements
        10-4-1 Platform
        10-4-2 System Description
   In this example, we have four work packages with code of account identifiers as follows:
10-3-1, 10-3-2, 10-4-1, and 10-4-2. We will assign them all to one control account so that
we can monitor earned value performance measures as well as costs, scope, and schedule
for this component of the project. The control account could be inserted after the 10-2
Requirements Defi nition identifier because it will incorporate all the work packages needed
for this deliverable. Most projects will usually have more than one control account.

Defining Work Packages
Work packages are the units of work that can be assigned to one person, or a team of
people, with clear accountability and responsibility for completing the assignment, and they
can be monitored and controlled throughout the project. Assignments are easily made at
the work package level but can be made at any level in the WBS. The work package level is
where time estimates, cost estimates, and resource estimates are determined.


                 As mentioned earlier, the project manager is free to determine the number
                 of levels in the WBS based on the complexity of the project. You need to
                 include enough levels to accurately estimate project time and costs but not
                 so many levels that it's difficult to distinguish between the components.
                 Regardless of the number of levels in a WBS, the lowest level in a WBS is
                 called the work package level.

   Work package levels on large projects can represent subprojects that are further
decomposed into their own work breakdown structures. They might also consist of proj-
ect work that will be completed by a vendor, another organization, or another depart-
ment in your organization. If you're giving project work to another department in your
organization, you'll assign the work packages to individual managers, who will in turn
break them down into activities during the Defi ne Activities process later in the Planning
process group.
   Work packages might be assigned to vendors or others external to the organization.
For example, perhaps one of the deliverables in your project is special packaging and a
vendor is responsible for completing this work. The vendor will likely treat this deliverable
as a project within its own organization and construct its own WBS with several levels of
decomposition. However, for your project, it's a deliverable listed at the work package level
of the WBS.
162          Chapter 3         Developing the Project Scope Statement




                    This might seem self-evident, but work packages not shown on the WBS
                    are not included in the project. The same holds true for the project scope
                    statement--if the deliverable isn't noted there, it isn't part of the project.




The lincoln Street office building

Flagship International has just purchased a new building to house its growing staff. The
folks at Flagship consider themselves very lucky to have won the bid on the property
located in a prime section of the downtown area. The building is a historic building and
is in need of some repairs and upgrades to make it suitable for office space. Constructing
the renovations will require special handling and care, as outlined in the Historical
Society Building Revisions Guide .

Alfredo Martini is the project manager assigned to the renovation project. Alfredo has
already determined the deliverables for this project. In so doing, he has discovered that
he will not be able to manage all the work himself. He will need several subproject man-
agers working on individual deliverables, all reporting to him. Alfredo calls a meeting
with the other project managers to develop the WBS. Let's eavesdrop on the meeting.

"As you all know, we're planning to move into the Lincoln Street building by November 1.
There is quite a bit of work to do between now and then, and I'm enlisting each of you to
manage a segment of this project. Take a look at this WBS."

Here's how a portion of the WBS that Alfredo constructed looks:

Alfredo continues, "I'm going to manage the Facility Safety project. Adrian, I'd like you
to take the Asbestos Abatement project, and Orlando, you're responsible for the Office
Space project."

"Alfredo," Adrian says, "asbestos abatement is going to take contractors and specialized
equipment. We don't have staff to do these tasks."

"I understand. You'll need to take charge of securing the contractor to handle this. Your
responsibility will be to manage the contractor and keep them on schedule," Alfredo
answers.

Orlando reminds Alfredo that he has missed a deliverable on the WBS. "Part of the Office
Space project needs to include the network communications and telecommunications
equipment rooms. I don't see that on here."

"Good point, Orlando," Alfredo says. "The level two and level three elements of this WBS
are not complete. Each of you has been assigned to the subproject level, level one. Your
first assignment is to meet back here in two weeks with a WBS for your subproject. I'd like
to see some ideas about the staff assignments you'd make at the work package level and
how long you think these components will take. We'll refine those after we meet next."



Creating WBS Process Outputs
The Create WBS process has two outputs: the scope baseline and project documents updates.
We'll look at both of these next.

Scope Baseline
Remember how I said that everything you've done so far has built upon itself? This is an
important concept you should know for this output. The scope baseline for the project is the
approved project scope statement, the WBS, the work package, the planning package, and
the WBS dictionary. (You'll recall that the project scope statement serves as a baseline for
future project decisions because it helps the team determine whether requested changes are
inside or outside of scope.) In other words, these documents together describe in detail all
the work of the project. From these documents, you'll develop schedules, assign resources,
and monitor and control the work of the project according to what's described here. We've
already talked about the project scope statement and the WBS, but let's look at the planning
package and the WBS dictionary.



Exam Spotlight

The scope baseline is used for predictive life cycle approaches and is defined as the
approved version of the detailed project scope statement, the WBS, and the WBS diction-
ary. Understand this concept for the exam. This process does not name the WBS as an
output; the WBS is included as part of the scope baseline output.
164         Chapter 3      Developing the Project Scope Statement



Planning Package
A planning package is situated below the control account on the WBS and above the
work package. It details information about the work required but does not track schedule
activities. Let's revisit our example from earlier in this chapter.
      10-1 Billy Bob's Bassoon
      10-2 Requirements Definition
          10-2-1 Control Account for Requirements Definition
      10-3 Game Requirements
          10-3-1 Character Definition
          10-3-2 Instruments Design
      10-4 Software Requirements
          10-4-1 Platform
          10-4-2 System Description
   We could insert a Planning Package directly after the Control Account or we
could insert a Planning Package directly after 10-3 Game Requirements and one
directly after 10-4 Software Requirements. Keep in mind that this example WBS is
abbreviated. An actual WBS for this project, and the levels pertaining to this deliv-
erable, would contain many more lines and many other work packages than what's
shown in this example.
   Planning packages are part of the control account and are always inserted below them.
A control account might contain one planning package or multiple planning packages.

WBS Dictionary
The WBS dictionary, an element of the scope baseline, is where work component descrip-
tions listed on the WBS are documented. According to the PMBOK(R) Guide, the WBS dic-
tionary should include the following elements for each component of the WBS:
      Code of accounts identifier
      Description of the work of the component
      Organization responsible for completing the component
      List of schedule milestones
      Schedule activities associated with the schedule milestones
      Required resources
      Cost estimates
      Quality requirements
      Criteria for acceptance
                                        Creating the Work Breakdown Structure               165



    Technical references
    Contract or agreements information
    Constraints and assumptions
   Let's look at an example of what some of the elements of a WBS dictionary entry might
look like. You'll use the work package level called Inspection and Identification defi ned in
the sidebar "The Lincoln Street Office Building" earlier. The WBS dictionary entry for this
might look like the following:

3.1 Inspection and Identification
    Description of work--Inspect the building for asbestos, and identify all areas where it's
    found. Update the plan for removal (WBS 3.2) with each location identified.
    Responsible organization --Adrian in facilities will hire and oversee a contractor to
    perform this work.
    Schedule milestones --Inspection and identification to start after contractor is identified
    and hired (no later than July 1). Work should be completed no later than September 15.
    Contract information --Two contractors have been identified as qualified and experi-
    enced in this type of work. Contract process should close no later than June 12.
   If the WBS and the WBS dictionary are constructed well, you've given yourself a huge
helping hand with the remaining Planning processes. The completion of many of the
remaining processes depends on the project scope statement and WBS being accurate and
complete. You'll use the work packages created here to further elaborate the work into
activities. From there, you can estimate costs, develop schedules, and so on. The WBS is an
essential tool for project planning, so keep it handy.

Project Documents Updates
Project documents updates might include updates to the requirements documentation,
which can come about as a result of changes that occur when you're creating the WBS.
You can see from the examples you've walked through in this chapter how new deliver-
ables or requirements might surface as a result of working on the WBS. These requested
changes should be reviewed and either approved or denied using your change control
processes. The assumption log will likely need to be updated as a result of this process
also. Any changes that occur require that documents are updated to reflect the ap-
proved changes.


                 I recommend reviewing Practice Standard for Work Breakdown Structures,
                 Second Edition, published by PMI(R) 2006, to see examples of industry-
                 specific WBS templates, or you can modify the templates for particular
                 business areas that may not be represented.

Project Case Study: New Kitchen Heaven Retail Store

The project charter kickoff meeting was held and well attended. You're ready to start
gathering requirements and writing the project scope statement, and you have a question
or two for Dirk. You knock on his door, and he invites you in.

"Shoot," he says.

"I'm ready to define the deliverables and requirements for this project. I want to make
sure I get the right folks involved in the meeting. Who are key stakeholders you recom-
mend I speak with?"

"I can think of a few people right off that you don't want to miss. There's Jake Peterson
over in facilities. He's in charge of store furnishings, shelving, things like that--any sup-
plies for the stores that aren't retail products. He can help out with store build-outs too.
He supervised our last eight stores and did a terrific job."

"Anyone else?" you ask.

"You should also talk to Jill Overstreet, the director in charge of retail products. She can
help with the initial store stocking, and once the store is open, her group will take over the
ongoing operations. All the district managers report to Jill."

You thank Dirk and tell him you're going to contact Jake and Jill and set up a brainstorm-
ing session to determine requirements.

A few days later.

You review your notes and reread the first draft of the project scope statement you've
prepared for the Kitchen Heaven retail store before looking for Dirk. After your meetings
with the stakeholders, you were better able to refine the project objectives and deliver-
ables.

"Dirk, I'm glad I caught you. I'd like to go over the project scope statement with you
before I give it to the stakeholders. Do you have a few minutes?"

"Sure," Dirk says. "Let's have it."

"The project objective is to open the 50th Kitchen Heaven store in Colorado Springs by
February 1. When I met with Jake, he confirmed it takes 120 days to do the store build-
out. That includes having the shelves set up and in place, ready to stock with inventory."

Dirk asks whether Jake told you about his store location idea.

"Yes, Jake gave me a contact name of the leasing agent, and I've left her a voicemail. The
sooner we can get that lease signed, the better. It takes Jake 120 days to do the build-out,
and Jill said she needs two weeks lead time to order the initial inventory and stock the
                                          Creating the Work Breakdown Structure               167




shelves. That puts us pretty close to our February 1 deadline, counting the time to get the
lease papers signed."

"Sounds good so far," Dirk replies. "What else?"

You continue, "I've included an updated description of the products and services the new
store will offer, based on the documentation that was written from the last store opening.
Jill reviewed the updates to the description, so we should be in the clear there. The store
will include some new lines that we've decided to take on--cookware from famous chefs,
that kind of thing.

"Jake has already made contact with a general contractor in Colorado Springs, and he is
ready to roll once we've signed the lease.

"One more thing, Dirk. Since we're including the big bash at the grand opening as part of
the deliverables, I talked to some of your folks in marketing to get some ideas. They are
thinking we should have some great giveaways as door prizes and that we will want the
food catered. They also thought having some live cooking demonstrations with some
local chefs would be a good attraction."

"Sounds like you're on the right track. So, what's next?" Dirk asks.

"Once you approve the scope statement, I'd like to send a copy to the stakeholders. My
next step is to break down the deliverables and requirements I've documented here into
the WBS so we can get rolling on the work of the project."

Project Case Study Checklist

The main topics discussed in the case study are as follows:

    Stakeholder analysis for requirements gathering: Jake Peterson and Jill Overstreet
    interviewed. Needs, wants, and expectations recorded and requirements prioritized
    Organizational structure: Functional organization with a separate project-oriented
    department
    Constraints: February 1 date to coincide with Garden and Home show
    Assumptions: These are the assumptions:
       A store build-out usually takes 120 days.
       Jill Overstreet will help with the initial store stocking.
       Jake Peterson will provide supplies for the stores that aren't retail products, such
       as store furnishings, shelving, and so on, and can help with the store build-out as
       well.
       The budget for the project will be between $1.5 million and $2 million.
168         Chapter 3      Developing the Project Scope Statement




The project scope statement includes the following:

      Project objectives: Open 50th store by February 1 in Colorado Springs.
      Project deliverables:
         Build out storefront, including shelving.
         Retail product line will be delivered two weeks prior to grand opening.
         Have grand opening party with cooking demos.

      Project requirements:
         Sign lease within 14 days.
         Offer new line of gourmet food products.
         Have classroom space in back of store for cooking demos and classes.

      Constraints: February 1 date will coincide with Garden and Home Show.
      Fund limitations: Spend no more than $2 million on the project.
      Assumptions: (These are the same as listed earlier.) Decomposed deliverables
      into a WBS
The WBS includes the following:

         Level one is the project.
         Level two is subprojects or deliverables.
         Level three is deliverables.
         Last level of WBS is the work package level, where time and cost estimates can be
         defined in the next process.




Understanding How This Applies
to Your Next Project
In this chapter, you dealt with the realities of life on the job. The reality is, many project
managers I know are managing several projects at once as opposed to one large project.
Although every concept presented in this chapter is a sound one, it's important to note that
you have to balance the amount of effort you'll put into project management processes
against the size and complexity of the project.
   As a manager who prides herself and her team on excellent customer service, I have once
or twice gotten my team into precarious situations because I was so focused on helping the
customer that I hurt them and our department in the process. If you're wondering how that
happened, it was because we didn't take the time to document the scope of the project and
the final acceptance criteria. In one case, in the interest of getting the project completed
                                                                       Summary            169




quickly because of our customer's own internal deadlines, we decided the project was
straightforward enough that we didn't need to document deliverables. The customer prom-
ised to work side by side with us as we produced the work of the project. Unfortunately,
that wasn't the case, and we didn't meet the expectations of our customer. Further, after
we did implement the project (two months behind schedule), we went through another six
weeks of "fixes" because of the miscommunication between the customer and the project
team on what constituted some of the features of the final product. There's always a great
reason for cutting corners--but they almost always come back to haunt you. My advice is
to always create a scope statement and a requirements document and get stakeholder sig-
natures on both. (In practice, small projects can include both the deliverables and require-
ments within the scope statement.)
    Decomposing the deliverables is the first step toward determining resource requirements
and estimates. A WBS is always a good idea, no matter the size of the project. I have to
admit I have cheated a time or two on small projects and used the project schedule as the
WBS. In all fairness, that worked out fine when the team was small and there weren't more
than three or four people working on the project. If you get many more than four people on
the project team, it can be a little cumbersome to track deliverables with a schedule only.
The WBS is the perfect tool to use to assign names to work packages, and it's the founda-
tion for determining estimates for the work of the project.
    The five-step process outlined by the PMBOK(R) Guide works very well. Starting with the
50,000-foot view, the team determines the major deliverables of the project. From there,
the deliverables are decomposed into ever smaller units of work. The trick here is to break
the work down into measurable units so that you can verify the status of the work and the
completion and acceptance of the work when you're finished. If you have "fuzzy" WBS
levels or work packages, you won't be able to determine status accurately. In the IT field,
we have a saying about the status of projects: "It's 90 percent complete." The problem is
it always seems that the last 10 percent takes twice as long to complete as the first 90 did.
If you've taken the time to document a WBS, you'll have a much better idea of what that
90 percent constitutes. The last step is the verification step where you determine whether
everything you've identified in the WBS is absolutely necessary to fulfill the work of the
project and whether it's decomposed enough to adequately describe the work. It has been
my experience that documenting the WBS will save you time later in the Planning pro-
cesses, particularly developing the project schedule and determining the project budget.
    I believe the most important idea to take from this chapter is a simple one: Always use a
scope statement and requirements document, and always get them signed.



Summary
This chapter started you on the road to project planning via the Develop Project Man-
agement Plan process, the Plan Scope Management process, the Collect Requirements
process, the Define Scope process, and the Create WBS process. We covered a lot of mate-
rial in this chapter. Everything you've learned so far becomes the foundation for further
project planning.
170        Chapter 3      Developing the Project Scope Statement



    The output of the Develop Project Management Plan process is the project management
plan, which is concerned with defining, coordinating, and integrating all the ancillary proj-
ect plans and baselines. The purpose of this plan is to define how the project is executed,
how it's monitored and controlled, and how it's closed.
    The primary output of the Plan Scope Management process is the scope management
plan. This plan is an element of the project management plan that describes how the project
team will go about defining project scope, validating the work of the project, and managing
and controlling scope.
    The Collect Requirements process involves gathering and documenting the requirements
of the project. It's important that requirements be measurable, traceable, testable, and so
on. Measurement criteria for project requirements are agreed upon by the stakeholders and
project manager. Additionally, requirements should be tracked in a traceability matrix that
documents where they originated, the results of the tests, the priority of the requirement,
and more.
    Constraints restrict or dictate the actions of the project team. Constraints usually
involve time, cost, and scope but can also include schedules, technology, quality, resources,
risk, and more. Assumptions are things believed to be true. You'll want to document proj-
ect assumptions and validate them as the project progresses. Both assumptions and con-
straints are documented in the assumption log.
    The project scope statement is produced during the Define Scope process. It describes
the project deliverables. The scope statement, along with the WBS, work packages, plan-
ning packages, and the WBS dictionary, form the scope baseline that you'll use to weigh
future project decisions, most particularly change requests. The scope statement contains a
list of project deliverables that will be used in future Planning processes.
    The project scope statement contains many elements, including product scope descrip-
tion, product acceptance criteria, deliverables, and exclusions from scope.
    A WBS is a deliverable-oriented hierarchy of project essentials. The highest levels of the
WBS are described using nouns, and the lowest levels are described with verbs. Each ele-
ment in the WBS has its own set of objectives and deliverables that must be met in order to
fulfill the deliverables of the next highest level and ultimately the project itself. In this way,
the WBS validates the completeness of the work.
    The lowest level of the WBS is known as the work package level. This breakdown allows
the project manager to determine cost estimates, time estimates, resource assignments, and
quality controls.



Exam Essentials
Be able to state the purpose of the Develop Project Management Plan process. It defines,
coordinates, and integrates all subsidiary project plans.
Understand the purpose of the project scope statement. The scope statement serves as a
common understanding of project scope among the stakeholders. The project objectives and
                                                                Exam Essentials           171




deliverables and their quantifiable criteria are documented in the scope statement and are
used by the project manager and the stakeholders to determine whether the project was com-
pleted successfully. It also serves as a basis for future project decisions.
Be able to define project constraints and assumptions. Project constraints limit the options
of the project team and restrict their actions. Sometimes constraints dictate actions. Time,
budget, and scope are the most common constraints. Assumptions are conditions that are
presumed to be true or real. They are both documented in the assumption log.
Be able to describe the purpose of the scope management plan. The scope management
plan has a direct influence on the project's success and describes the process for determin-
ing project scope, facilitates creating the WBS, describes how the product or service of the
project is validated and accepted, and documents how changes to scope will be handled. The
scope management plan is a subsidiary plan of the project management plan.
Be able to define a WBS and its components. The WBS is a deliverable-oriented hierarchy.
It uses the deliverables from the project scope statement or similar documents and decom-
poses them into logical, manageable units of work. The first level of decomposition is the
major deliverable level or subproject level, the second level of decomposition is a further
elaboration of the deliverables, and so on. The lowest level of any WBS is called a work
package.
Understand the difference between code of accounts identifiers and control accounts. Code
of accounts identifiers are assigned to all elements of a WBS. These are a unique numbering
system that ties the work elements to the code of accounts. A control account consists of two
or more work packages (each with their own code of accounts identifier) and/or one or more
planning package. A control account is inserted between a major deliverable and the work
package and it tracks cost, schedule, and scope and is also used to perform earned value
measurements. A planning package is inserted between the control account and the work
package level and does not include schedule activities.
Be able to name the components of the scope baseline. The scope baseline consists of the
approved project scope statement, WBS, work packages, planning packages, and the WBS
dictionary.

      A. They are forms of expert judgment used to help define and develop requirements and
         develop the project scope statement.
      B.   They are tools and techniques used to elaborate the product scope description.
      C.   They are decision-making techniques, which are a tool and technique of the Collect
           Requirements process.

           the Define Scope process.

9.    Your company, Kick That Ball Sports, has appointed you as project manager for its new
      Cricket product line introduction. This is a national effort, and all the retail stores across
      the country need to have the new products on the shelves before the media advertising blitz
      begins. The product line involves three new products, two of which will be introduced
      together and a third one that will follow within two years. You are ready to create the
      WBS. All of the following are true except for which one?
      A. The WBS may be structured using each product as a level one entry.
      B.   The WBS should be elaborated to a level where costs and schedule are easily estimated.
           This is known as the work package level.
      C.   Rolling wave refers to how all levels of the WBS collectively roll up to reflect the work
           of the project and only the work of the project.
      D.   Each level of the WBS represents verifiable products or results.

10. You are a project manager for Giraffe Enterprises. You've recently taken over for a project
    manager who lied about his PMI(R) certification and was subsequently fired. Unfortunately,
    he did a poor job of defining the scope. Which of the following could happen if you don't
    correct this?
      A. The stakeholders will require overtime from the project team to keep the project on
         schedule.
      B.   The poor scope definition will adversely affect the creation of the work breakdown
           structure, and costs will increase.
      C.   The project management plan's process for verification and acceptance of the deliver-
           ables needs to be updated as a result of the poor scope definition.
      D.   The project costs could increase, there might be rework, and schedule delays might
           result.
                                                                    Review Questions          175



11. You are the project manager for Lucky Stars nightclubs. They specialize in live country and
    western band performances. Your newest project is in the Planning processes group. You
    are working on the WBS. The finance manager has given you a numbering system to assign
    to the WBS. Which of the following is true?
    A. The numbering system is a unique identifier known as the WBS dictionary, which is
       used to assign quality control codes to the individual work elements.
    B.   The numbering system is a unique identifier known as the WBS dictionary, which is
         used to track the descriptions of individual work elements.
    C.   The numbering system is a unique identifier known as the control account, which is
         used to track time and resource assignments for individual work elements.
    D.   The numbering system is a unique identifier known as the code of accounts identifier,
         which is used to track the costs of the WBS elements.

12. You are a project manager working on a large, complex project. You've constructed the
    WBS for this project, and all of the work package levels are subprojects of this project.
    You've requested that the subproject managers report to you in three weeks with their indi-
    vidual WBSs constructed. Which statement is not true regarding your WBS?
    A. The work package level is decomposed to create the activity list.
    B.   The work package level is the lowest level in the WBS.
    C.   The work package level facilitates resource assignments.
    D.   The work package level facilitates cost and time estimates.

13. You are a project manager working on a new software product your company plans to
    market to businesses. The project sponsor told you that the project must be completed by
    September 1. The company plans to demo the new software product at a trade show in late
    September and, therefore, needs the project completed in time for the trade show. However,
    the sponsor has also told you that the budget is fixed at $85,000, and it would take an act
    of Congress to get it increased. You must complete the project within the given time frame
    and budget. Which of the following is the primary constraint for this project?
    A. Budget
    B.   Scope
    C.   Time

14. Which of the following statements about decomposition is the least true?
    A. Decomposition involves structuring and organizing the WBS so that deliverables are
       always listed at level one.
    B.   Decomposition requires a degree of expert judgment and also requires close analysis of
         the project scope statement.
    C.   Decomposition is a tool and technique used to create a WBS.

15. You are in the process of translating project objectives into tangible deliverables and
    requirements. All of the following are techniques used in the product analysis tool and tech-
    nique of the Define Scope process except which one?
      A. Value engineering and value analysis
      B.   Product configuration and specification analysis

16. You are a project manager for a documentary film company. In light of a recent regional
    tragedy, the company president wants to produce a new documentary on the efforts of the
    heroic rescue teams to air as soon as possible. She's looking to you to make this documen-
    tary the best that has ever been produced in the history of this company. She guarantees
    you free rein to use whatever resources you need to get this project done quickly. However,
    the best photographer in the company is currently working on another assignment. Which
    of the following is true?
      A. The primary constraint is time because the president wants the film done quickly. She
         told you to get it to air as soon as possible.
      B.   Resources are the primary constraint. Even though the president has given you free rein
           on resource use, you assume she didn't mean those actively assigned to projects.
      C.   The schedule is the primary constraint. Even though the president has given you free
           rein on resource use, you assume she didn't mean those actively assigned to projects.
           The photographer won't be finished for another three weeks on his current assignment,
           so schedule adjustments will have to be made.
      D.   The primary constraint is quality because the president wants this to be the best film
           ever produced by this company. She's given you free rein to use whatever resources are
           needed to get the job done.

17. Your project depends on a key deliverable from a vendor you've used several times before
    with great success. You're counting on the delivery to arrive on June 1. This is an example

19. Your company provides answering services for several major catalog retailers. The number
    of calls coming into the service center per month has continued to increase over the past
    18 months. The phone system is approaching the maximum load limits and needs to be
    upgraded. You've been assigned to head up the upgrade project. Based on the company's
    experience with the vendor who worked on the last phone upgrade project, you're confident
    they'll be able to assist you with this project as well. Which of the following is true?
    A. You've made an assumption about vendor availability and expertise. The project came
       about because of a business need.
    B.   Vendor availability and expertise are constraints. The project came about because of a
         business need.
    C.   You've made an assumption about vendor availability and expertise. The project came
         about because of a market demand.
    D.   Vendor availability and expertise are constraints. The project came about because of a
         market demand.

          Schedule

          The PMP(R) exam content from the
          Planning Performance domain
          covered in this chapter includes
          the following:

           Task 4: Develop the project schedule based on the
           approved project deliverables and milestones, scope, and
           resource management plans in order to manage timely
           completion of the project.

           Knowledge and Skills:
                 Estimation tools and techniques

                 Human resource planning

                 Lean and efficiency principles

                 Time management planning, including scheduling tools and
                 techniques

                 Workflow diagramming techniques
                                 The Planning process group has more processes than any other
                                 process group. As a result, a lot of time and effort goes into
                                 the Planning processes of any project. On some projects, you
might spend almost as much time planning the project as you do executing and controlling
it. This isn't a bad thing. The better planning you do up front, the more likely you'll have a
successful project. Speaking of planning, together the Planning, Executing, and Monitoring
and Controlling process groups account for almost 70 percent of the PMP(R) exam questions,
so plan on spending about the same percentage of your study time on these areas.
    This is another fun-filled, action-packed chapter. We'll start off by looking at an overview
of the Project Schedule Management Knowledge Area followed by defining the schedule
management plan, and then move on to the activities that become the work of the project.
The WBS will come in handy here, so keep it close. Then we'll sequence the activities in their
proper order, estimate the resources we'll need to complete the work, and estimate how long
each activity will take. Last but not least, we'll develop the project schedule.
    Everything you've done up to this point and the processes we'll discuss in this chapter will
help you create an accurate project schedule. You'll use these documents (along with several
other documents you've created along the way) throughout the Executing and Monitoring
and Controlling processes to help measure the progress of the project. Let's get going.


                  The process names, inputs, tools and techniques, outputs, and
                  descriptions of the project management process groups and related
                  materials and figures in this chapter are based on content from A Guide
                  to the Project Management Body of Knowledge (PMBOK (R) Guide), Sixth
                  Edition (PMI(R), 2017).




Overview of the Project Schedule
Management Knowledge Area
The main result of this Knowledge Area is to create a project schedule that represents
when the deliverables for the project will be completed. Of the six processes represented in
this Knowledge Area, five of them are devoted to the activities needed to create the schedule
and the last process concerns controlling the schedule once it's baselined and approved. The
schedule should be discussed at every project status meeting so stakeholders are informed of
progress and/or delays. It's a key communication tool for keeping stakeholders informed and
for keeping their expectations in alignment with reality.
              Overview of the Project Schedule Management Knowledge Area                  181




    The project team can construct the schedule using a few different methods. One of them
is the critical path method, which we'll cover in detail in this chapter. Another is an Agile
approach where the deliverables and requirements (also known as user stories in an
Agile methodology) are decomposed into backlog items that are prioritized and worked
on during each iteration. The iterative scheduling method (with backlog items) is similar to
rolling wave planning (discussed later in this chapter) where you elaborate the work of the
project to the level of detail you know at the time.
    Another method of constructing the schedule is called on-demand scheduling, which
is a type of Kanban methodology. Kanban is typically used on software development
technology projects where the work is balanced against available resources or available
capacity for work. It's based on Toyota's just-in-time production model and is a pull-based
concept where work progresses to the next step only when resources are available. Kanban
is a visual process where the work of an iteration is displayed on a board. Each user story
and/or work component is represented by a card or a sticky note on a board with columns
that depict workflow. The idea is that you can visually see where the bottlenecks in the
process are occurring so you can solve them and ultimately improve the process. Here's
a simplified example. Your organization has two software architects, twelve software
developers, and three quality assurance reviewers as represented in Figure 4.1. In any given
iteration or time period, the architects and the twelve developers can produce five backlog
items per time period. The quality assurance reviewers have the capacity to review and test
only three backlog items per week. The quality assurance area is the bottleneck since the
reviewers can't pull work into their team at the same rate their counterparts can produce
and complete the backlog items.

182        Chapter 4      Creating the Project Schedule



   As with all the Planning processes, it's up to the project manager to tailor the schedul-
ing processes for the project. Consider the life-cycle approach you're using for the project
(Agile, predictive, or hybrid), the resource availability of key team members, the project
complexity and/or any uncertainty surrounding the project, and the technology you'll use
to construct, store, and display the project schedule model.



Creating the Schedule
Management Plan
The Plan Schedule Management process describes how the project schedule will be
developed, executed, and controlled as well as how changes will be incorporated into the
project schedule. According to A Guide to the Project Management Body of Knowledge
(PMBOK(R) Guide), Sixth Edition, the primary benefit of this process is that it helps guide
and direct how the project schedule will be managed. The only output of this process is the
schedule management plan. Let's first look at the inputs and the tools and techniques of this
process and spend most of our time examining the schedule management plan itself.
   The inputs of this process include the project charter, project management plan
(scope management plan, development approach), enterprise environmental factors, and
organizational process assets.
   Enterprise environmental factors include the culture of the organization and avail-
ability of resources as well as the scheduling software, the guidelines for the tailoring
approach you'll use, and estimating data that might be found in commercial databases.
The organizational process assets that are important to this process are templates, change
control processes, historical information, control tools for managing schedules, and
reporting tools.
   We have seen all of the tools and techniques before. They are expert judgment, data
analysis (alternatives analysis), and meetings.
   The key to this process, as I stated earlier, is the schedule management plan, which is an
element of the project management plan. It is the only output of this process, and it serves
to describe how the project schedule will be developed, monitored, controlled, and changed.
According to the PMBOK(R) Guide, several elements make up the schedule management plan.
Be certain to review all of them. I have highlighted the most important elements here:
Schedule Model Development This refers to the methodologies and tools you'll use to
develop the schedule (for example, Oracle Primavera or Microsoft Project), along with
the data they contain. It may also describe how to maintain the schedule model along
with the reporting formats, links to the WBS, and guidelines for releases and iterations if
you are using an Agile approach.
Iteration Definition The Agile development approach is performed using iterations. Itera-
tions are time-bound and the schedule management plan should document the expected
length of an iteration.
                                                                 Defining Activities          183




Accuracy Levels This element describes the rounding you'll use when deriving activity
duration estimates. For example, you might round to the nearest week, day, or hour
depending on the complexity of the project.
Units of Measure This element also concerns activity duration estimates as well as schedule
activities. This describes what measure you'll use when developing the schedule, such as
hours, days, weeks, or some other measure.
Control Thresholds Control thresholds refer to the level of variance the schedule can
experience before you take action. Again, depending on the complexity of the project, this
might be a generous amount of time or a very limited amount of time. You can express
thresholds in terms of hours or days (as an example, a slippage of greater than three days
requires action) or, most typically, as a percentage of time.
Performance Measurement Rules This refers to where and what types of measures you'll
use to verify schedule performance such as schedule variance and schedule performance
index, or other earned value management techniques. This could include designating
levels on the WBS and/or determining what type of earned value measurement technique
you'll use.



Defining Activities
Now you're off and running toward the development of your project schedule. To develop
the schedule, you first need to define the activities, sequence them in the right order, estimate
resources, and estimate the time it will take to complete the tasks. I'll cover the Define Activi-
ties process here and the Sequence Activities process next, and I'll pick up with the estimat-
ing processes in the next section.


                  Define Activities and Sequence Activities are separate processes, each
                  with its own inputs, tools and techniques, and outputs. In practice,
                  especially for small to medium-sized projects, you can combine the Create
                  WBS process we talked about in Chapter 3, "Developing the Project Scope
                  Statement," with these processes and complete them all at once.

   The Define Activities process is a further breakdown of the work package elements
of the WBS. It documents the specific activities needed to fulfi ll the deliverables detailed
on the WBS and the project scope statement. Much as with the work package level of the
WBS, activities can be easily assigned, estimated, scheduled, and controlled. The Defi ne
Activities process might be performed by the project manager, or when the WBS is broken
down to the subproject level, this process (and all the activity-related processes that follow)
might be assigned to a project manager.
184          Chapter 4      Creating the Project Schedule




Define Activities Process Inputs
The following are inputs (including the key elements of each input) to the Define Activities
process:
      Project management plan (schedule management plan, scope baseline)
      Enterprise environmental factors (project management information systems,
      organizational culture, published commercial databases)
      Organizational process assets (existing standards and policies, templates, lessons
      learned knowledge base, and policies relating to activity planning)


Tools and Techniques for Defining Activities
The tools and techniques of the Define Activities process are as follows:
      Expert judgment
      Decomposition
      Rolling wave planning
      Meetings
    We covered most of these topics in the previous chapter. Decomposition in this process
involves breaking the work packages into smaller, more manageable units of work called
activities. These are not deliverables but the individual units of work that must be com-
pleted to fulfill the work packages and the deliverables listed in the WBS. Activities will
help in later Planning processes to define estimates and create the project schedule. Activity
lists (which are one of the outputs of this process) from prior projects can be used as tem-
plates in this process. Rolling wave planning involves planning near-term work in more
detail than future-term work. As we discussed in Chapter 3, this is a form of progressive
elaboration. Expert judgment, in the form of project team members with prior experience
developing project scope statements and WBSs, can help you define activities.



Exam Spotlight

The purpose of the Define Activities process is to decompose the work packages into
schedule activities where the basis for estimating, scheduling, executing, and monitoring
and controlling the work of the project is easily supported and accomplished.



Define Activities Outputs
Define Activities has five outputs:
      Activity list
      Activity attributes
                                                                  Defining Activities           185



    Milestone list
    Change requests
    Project management plan updates (schedule baseline, cost baseline)
   We'll look at the fi rst three of these outputs next.

Activity List
One primary output of the Define Activities process is an activity list. The activity list should
contain all the schedule activities that will be performed for the project, with a scope of
work description of each activity and an identifier (such as a code or number) so that team
members understand what the work is and how it is to be completed. The schedule activi-
ties are individual elements of the project schedule, and the activity list document is part of
the project documents. To keep your sanity, and that of your team members, make certain to
enter the activity names onto the schedule the same way they appear on the activity list.


                  The activity list will be updated during each iteration if you're using an
                  Agile development approach. If you're using rolling wave planning, the
                  activity list will be updated periodically throughout the project.



Activity Attributes
Activity attributes describe the characteristics of the activities and are an extension of the
activity list. Activity attributes will change over the life of the project as more information is
known. In the early stages of the project, activity attributes might include the activity ID, the
WBS identification code it's associated with, and the activity name. As you progress through
the project and complete other Planning processes, you might add predecessor and successor
activities, logical relationships, leads and lags, resource requirements, and constraints and
assumptions associated with the activity. According to the PMBOK(R) Guide, activity attri-
butes might help you understand where the work needs to take place for that activity, the
project calendar assignment for the activity, and the type of effort needed to complete
the work. Schedule development relies on activity attributes to help decide how to order and
prioritize activities. We'll cover these topics throughout the remainder of this chapter.
   The activity attributes are used as input to several processes, including the Develop
Schedule process that we'll talk about in the section "Developing the Project Schedule"
later in this chapter.


                  In practice, I like to tie the activity list to the WBS. Remember from
                  Chapter 3 that each WBS element has a unique identifier, just like
                  the activities in the activity list. When recording the identifier code for the
                  activity list, I'll use a system whereby the first three or four digits represent
                  the WBS element the activity is tied to and the remaining digits refer to the
                  activity itself.
186        Chapter 4      Creating the Project Schedule



Milestone Lists
Milestones are typically major accomplishments of the project and mark the completion
of major deliverables or some other key event in the project. For example, approval and
sign-off on project deliverables might be considered milestones. Other examples might be the
completion of a prototype, system testing, and contract approval. The milestone list records
these accomplishments and documents whether the milestone is mandatory or optional.
The milestone list is part of the project documentation and is also used to help develop the
project schedule.



Understanding the Sequence
Activities Process
Now that you've identified the schedule activities, you need to sequence them in a logical
order and find out whether dependencies exist among the activities. The interactivity of
logical relationships must be sequenced correctly in order to facilitate the development of a
realistic, achievable project schedule.
    Consider a classic example. Let's say you're going to paint your house but unfortunately
it's fallen into a little disrepair. The old paint is peeling and chipping and will need to be
scraped before a coat of primer can be sprayed on the house. After the primer dries, the
painting can commence. In this example, the primer activity depends on the scraping. You
can't--okay, you shouldn't--prime the house before scraping off the peeling paint. The
painting activity depends on the primer activity in the same way. You really shouldn't start
painting until the primer has dried.
    During Sequence Activities, you will use a host of inputs and tools and techniques to
produce the primary output and project schedule network diagrams. You've already seen
all the inputs to this process. They are the project management plan (schedule management
plan, scope baseline), project documents (activity list, activity attributes, milestone list,
assumption log), enterprise environmental factors, and organizational process assets.
    One of the enterprise environmental factors considered in this process that you should
know about for the exam is the work authorization system. A work authorization system
is a formal, documented procedure that describes how to authorize work and how to begin
that work in the correct sequence and at the right time. This system describes the steps
needed to issue a work authorization, the documents needed, the method or system you'll
use to record and track the authorization information, and the approval levels required to
authorize the work. You should understand the complexity of the project and balance the
cost of instituting a work authorization system against the benefit you'll receive from it.
This might be overkill on small projects, and verbal instructions might work just as well.
For purposes of the exam, understand that project work is assigned and committed via a
work authorization system and is used throughout the Executing processes.
                               Understanding the Sequence Activities Process              187




   Work is usually authorized using a form that describes the task, the responsible party,
anticipated start and end dates, special instructions, and whatever else is particular to
the activity or project. Depending on the organizational structure, the work is gener-
ally assigned and authorized by either the project manager or the functional manager.
Remember that the system includes documentation on who has the authority to issue work
authorization orders.
   We'll look at several new tools and techniques next.


Sequence Activities Tools and Techniques
Sequence Activities has four tools and techniques, all of which are new to you:
    Precedence diagramming method (PDM)
    Dependency determination and integration
    Leads and lags
    Project management information system
   I'll switch the order of these and cover dependency determination and integration first.
In practice, you'll define dependencies either before or while you're using the PDM to draw
your schedule network diagram. To make sure you're on the same page with the PMBOK(R)
Guide terminology regarding dependencies, I'll cover them first and then move on to the
other tools and techniques.

Dependency Determination and Integration
 Dependencies are relationships between the activities in which one activity is dependent on
another to complete an action, or perhaps an activity is dependent on another to start an ac-
tion before it can proceed. Dependency determination is a matter of determining where those
dependencies exist. Thinking back to the house-painting example, you couldn't paint until
the scraping and priming activities were completed. You'll want to know about four types of
dependencies for the exam:
    Mandatory dependencies
    Discretionary dependencies
    External dependencies
    Internal dependencies
  As you've probably guessed, the PMBOK(R) Guide defines dependencies differently
depending on their characteristics:
Mandatory Dependencies Mandatory dependencies, also known as hard logic or hard
dependencies, are defined by the type of work being performed. The scraping, primer, and
painting sequence is an example of mandatory dependencies. The nature of the work itself
dictates the order in which the activities should be performed. An activity with physical
limitations is a telltale sign that you have a mandatory dependency on your hands. The proj-
ect team defines and determines mandatory dependencies, and they do this when they are
performing the Sequence Activities process.
188        Chapter 4      Creating the Project Schedule



Discretionary Dependencies Discretionary dependencies are defined by the project
team. Discretionary dependencies are also known as preferred logic, soft logic, or preferential
logic. These are usually process- or procedure-driven or "best-practice" techniques based
on past experience. For example, both past experience and best practices on house-painting
projects have shown that all trim work should be hand-painted whereas the bulk of the main
painting work should be done with a sprayer. These activities could be performed at the
same time (therefore, they are not mandatory dependencies). One side of the house might be
spray painted while the other side is having the trim work done. Sometimes, depending on
the activity, it is likely more efficient and less risky to perform the activities in sequence.



Exam Spotlight

Discretionary dependencies have a tendency to create arbitrary total float values that will
limit your options when scheduling activities that have this type of dependency. If you
are fast-tracking to compress your schedule, you should consider changing or removing
these dependencies.


External Dependencies External dependencies are, well, external to the project. This might
seem obvious, but the PMBOK(R) Guide points out that even though the dependency is external
to the project (and, therefore, a nonproject activity), it impacts project activities. For example,
perhaps your project is researching and marketing a new drug. The FDA must approve the
drug before your company can market it. This is not a project activity, but the project cannot
move forward until approval occurs. That means FDA approval is an external dependency.
Internal Dependencies Internal dependencies, another somewhat obvious dependency, are
internal to the project or the organization. They may, however, still be outside of your con-
trol. For example, perhaps before implementing a new time tracking system in your mainte-
nance shop, the operations department has decided to study the business rules regarding time
tracking. Examining and updating the business rules and processes needs to be completed
before the time tracking system can be installed and your project can proceed.
   Keep in mind that these dependencies could coexist. For example, you may have a man-
datory external dependency and a discretionary internal dependency, and so on.
   Once you've identified the dependencies and assembled all the other inputs for the
Sequence Activities process, you'll take this information and produce a diagram--or sche-
matic display--of the project activities. The project schedule network diagram shows the
dependencies--or logical relationships--that exist among the activities. You can use one of
the other tools and techniques of this process to produce this output. You'll now examine
each in detail.

Precedence Diagramming Method (PDM)
The precedence diagramming method (PDM) is what most project management software
programs use to sequence activities into a schedule model. Precedence diagrams use boxes or
                                Understanding the Sequence Activities Process                 189




rectangles (called nodes) to represent the activities. The nodes are connected with arrows show-
ing the dependencies between the activities. This method is also called activity on node (AON).
   The minimum information that should be displayed on the node is the activity name, but
you might put as much information about the activity on the node as you'd like. Sometimes
the nodes are displayed with activity name, activity number, start and stop dates, due
dates, slack time, and so on. (I'll cover slack time in the section "Develop Schedule Tools
and Techniques" later in this chapter.)



Exam Spotlight

For the exam, remember that the PDM uses only one time estimate to determine duration.



   Figure 4.2 shows a PDM--or AON--of the house-painting example.


Figure 4.2         Example of a PDM or AON

              Project
                            Scrape         Prime                 Paint       Finish
               Start



                                                       Clean
                                                     Equipment


   The PDM is further defined by four types of logical relationships. The terms dependencies
and precedence relationships also are used to describe these relationships. You might
already be familiar with these if you've used Microsoft Project or similar project manage-
ment software. The four dependencies, or logical relationships, are as follows:
Finish-to-Start (FS) The finish-to-start relationship is the most frequently used relationship.
This relationship says that the predecessor--or from activity--must finish before the
successor--or to activity--can start. In PDM diagrams, this is the most often used logical
relationship.
Start-to-Finish (SF) The start-to-finish relationship says that the predecessor activity must
start before the successor activity can finish. This logical relationship is seldom used.
Finish-to-Finish (FF) The finish-to-finish relationship says that the predecessor activity
must finish before the successor activity finishes.
Start-to-Start (SS) I think you're getting the hang of this. The start-to-start relationship says
that the predecessor activity must start before the successive activity can start.
190        Chapter 4        Creating the Project Schedule




Exam Spotlight

For the exam, know that finish-to-start is the most commonly used dependency in the
PDM method and that start-to-finish is rarely used. Also remember that according to the
PMBOK (R) Guide, each activity on the network diagram is connected by at least one prede-
cessor and one successor activity except the first and last activity.



   Keep these logical relationships (or dependencies) in mind when constructing your
project schedule network diagram.

Other Diagramming Methods
The arrow diagramming method (ADM) is not a listed tool and technique of the Sequence
Activities process, but there is a possibility you could see a question on the exam regarding
it. It's an old technique that's rarely used anymore, but nonetheless you should have some
familiarity with it.
    The ADM is visually the opposite of the PDM. The arrow diagramming method places
activities on the arrows, which are connected to dependent activities with nodes. This
method is also called activity on arrow (AOA) and activity on line (AOL). This technique
isn't used nearly as often as the PDM, but some industries prefer the ADM to the PDM.
For the record, note that the ADM allows for more than one time estimate to determine
duration and uses only the finish-to-start dependency. There's one more unique note about
the ADM to tuck away: Sometimes dummy activities must be plugged into the diagram to
accurately display the dependencies. Dummy activities are commonly depicted using a dot-
ted arrow.
    Figure 4.3 shows the ADM method applied to the house-painting example.

Figure 4.3         Example of an ADM method

                    Start         Scrape           Prime    Paint      Finish


                                 Clean Equipment              Remove Masking




   There is one other diagramming method you could potentially see a question about on
the exam. It's called GERT, which stands for Graphical Evaluation and Review Technique.
What you should know for the exam is that this diagramming method allows for condi-
tions, branches, and loops.

Applying Leads and Lags
Leads and lags should be considered when determining dependencies. Lags occur when time
elapses between two activities, which delay successor activities (those that follow a prede-
cessor activity) from starting, and as a result, time is added either to the start date or to the
                                Understanding the Sequence Activities Process                 191




finish date of the activity you're scheduling. Leads, conversely, speed up the successor activi-
ties, and as a result, time needs to be subtracted from the start date or the finish date of the
activity you're scheduling.



exam Spotlight

Leads and lags speed up or delay successor activities but should not replace schedule
logic.


   Let's revisit the house-painting example to put all this in perspective. In order to paint,
you fi rst need to scrape the peeling paint and then prime. However, you can't begin paint-
ing until the primer has dried, so you shouldn't schedule priming for Monday and painting
for Tuesday if you need the primer to dry on Tuesday. Therefore, the priming activity gen-
erates the need for lag time at the end of the activity to account for the drying time needed
before you can start painting.
   Lead time works just the opposite. Suppose, for this example, you could start priming
before the scraping is fi nished. Maybe certain areas on the house don't require scraping, so
you don't need to wait until the scraping activity fi nishes to begin the priming activity. In
this example, lead time is subtracted from the beginning of the priming activity so that this
activity begins prior to the previous activity fi nishing.


                  You might also use schedule network templates in this process. These are
                  not a named tool and technique of this process but may come in handy
                  on your next project. Schedule network templates are like the templates
                  I've talked about in previous processes. Perhaps the project you're work-
                  ing on is similar to a project that has been completed in the past. You can
                  use a previous project schedule network diagram as a template for the
                  current project. Or you might be working on a project with several deliv-
                  erables that are fairly identical to projects you've performed in the past or
                  the deliverables on the existing project are fairly similar; in that case, you
                  can use the old schedule network diagrams, or even the same schedule
                  network diagrams, as templates for the project. Templates can be used for
                  certain portions of the project schedule or for the entire project. If you are
                  using templates for portions of the project schedule, they are known as
                  subnetwork templates or fragment network templates.




Project Management Information System (PMIS)
The project management information system (PMIS) is an automated system used to docu-
ment the project management plan and component plans, to facilitate the feedback process,
to revise the documents, to create reports, and to develop the schedule. It incorporates the
192        Chapter 4      Creating the Project Schedule



configuration management system and the change control system, both of which I'll cover
in Chapter 10, "Measuring and Controlling Project Performance." Later in the project, the
PMIS can be used to control changes to any of the plans. When you're thinking about the
PMIS as an input (that is, as part of the enterprise environmental factors), think of it as a
collection and distribution point for information as well as an easy way to revise and update
documents. When you're thinking about the PMIS as a tool and technique, think of it just
that way--as a tool to facilitate the automation, collection, and distribution of data and to
help monitor processes such as scheduling, resource leveling, budgeting, and web interfaces.


Sequence Activities Outputs
There are only two outputs of the Sequence Activities process: project schedule network
diagrams and project documents updates (activity attributes, activity list, assumption log,
milestone list). I've just spent a good deal of time describing the different types of project
schedule network diagrams you can construct using the PDM or ADM techniques. You
typically generate project schedule network diagrams on a computer. Like the WBS, these
diagrams are visual representations of the work of the project and might contain all the
project details, or they might contain only summary-level details, depending on the complex-
ity of the project. Summary-level activities are a collection of related activities, also known
as hammocks. Think of hammocks as a group of related activities rolled up into a summary
heading that describes the activities likely to be contained in that grouping.
    Keep in mind that the construction of these project schedule network diagrams might
bring activities to light that you missed when defining your activity list, or it might make
you break an activity down into two activities in places where you thought one activity
might work. If this is the case, you will need to update the activity list and the activity
attributes. The other project document update that may be required as a result of this pro-
cess is an update to the risk register. (We'll talk about the risk register in Chapter 6, "Risk
Planning.")
    After the activities are sequenced, the next steps involve estimating the resources and
estimating the durations of the activities so that they can be plugged into the project
schedule. We'll look at these topics in the next sections of this chapter.



Estimating Activity Resources
All projects, from the smallest to the largest, require resources. The term resources, in this
case, does not mean just people; it means all the physical resources required to complete the
project. The PMBOK(R) Guide defines resources as people, equipment, materials, and sup-
plies. In reality, this includes people, equipment, supplies, materials, software, hardware--
the list goes on depending on the project on which you're working. The Estimate Activity
Resources process is concerned with determining the types of resources needed (both human
and materials) and in what quantities for each schedule activity within a work package.
                                                   Estimating Activity Resources             193




                  The Estimate Activity Resources process is a part of the Project Resource
                  Management Knowledge Area. However, you need to know what resources
                  are needed for the project and their availability in order to complete the
                  schedule, so I'll describe this process next.

   The PMBOK(R) Guide notes that Estimate Activity Resources should be closely
coordinated with the Estimate Costs process (I'll talk about Estimate Costs in Chapter 5,
"Developing the Project Budget and Communicating the Plan"). That's because resources--
whether people or material or both--are typically the largest expense you'll have on any
project. Identifying the resources becomes a critical component of the project planning process
so that estimates--and ultimately the project budget--can be accurately derived.
You'll look at the inputs and tools and techniques that will help you document these
requirements next.


Estimate Activity Resources Inputs
The Estimate Activity Resources process has several inputs, most of which you already
know:
    Project management plan (resource management plan, scope baseline)
    Project documents (activity attributes, activity list, assumption log, cost estimates,
    resource calendars, risk register)
    Enterprise environmental factors
    Organizational process assets
   The only inputs you haven't seen before are resource calendars, risk register, and cost
estimates.


                  Resource calendars are an output of the Acquire Project Team process and
                  are updated as a result of performing other processes. Both of these pro-
                  cesses are performed during the Executing process group, so you may find
                  this input perplexing here. However, you may have some resource avail-
                  ability information (resource calendars) on a preliminary basis during the
                  Estimate Activity Resources process, and you'll further define the resource
                  calendar when resources are assigned to the project later in the Executing
                  processes. In practice, you may find that you perform the Acquire Project
                  Team process during the later stages of the Planning portion of the project
                  rather than in the Executing process as outlined in the PMBOK (R) Guide .

   The resource calendars input describes the time frames in which resources (both human
and material) are available. They outline work days, normal business hours, shift-work
hours if they apply, and days off such as holidays or non-work days like weekends. They
look at a particular resource or groups of resources and their skills, abilities, quantity, and
availability. Perhaps your project calls for a marketing resource and the person assigned
194        Chapter 4      Creating the Project Schedule



to the marketing activities is on an extended vacation in October. The resource calendar
would show this person's vacation schedule. Resource calendars also examine the quantity,
capability, and availability of equipment and material resources that have a potential to
impact the project schedule. For example, suppose your project calls for a hydraulic drill
and your organization owns only one. The resource calendar will tell you whether it's
scheduled for another job at the same time it's needed for your project.
   The risk register is an output of the Identify Risks process. It is a list of identified risks
and their potential responses. We will discuss the risk register in more depth in Chapter 6.
   Activity cost estimates are an output of the Estimate Costs process. These are the costs
that are determined for each activity. We will look at activity cost estimates in more depth
in Chapter 5.


Estimate Activity Resources Tools and Techniques
Your goal with the Estimate Activity Resources process is to determine the activity resource
requirements, including quantity and availability. This process has seven tools and tech-
niques to help accomplish this output: expert judgment, bottom-up estimating, analogous
estimating, parametric estimating, data analysis (alternatives analysis), project management
information systems, and meetings. We'll cover all the estimating techniques in the Estimate
Activity Durations process in the next section following this process. You already know what
expert judgment and meetings entail, so let's look at the nuances of the alternatives analysis
and PMIS for this process:
Data Analysis--Alternative Analysis Alternative analysis is used when thinking about the
methods you might use to accomplish the activities your resources have been assigned. Many
times, you can accomplish an activity in more than one way, and alternative analysis helps
decide among the possibilities. For example, a subcompact car drives on the same roads a
six-figure sports car travels. The sports car has a lot more features than the subcompact,
it's faster, it's probably more comfortable, and it has a visual appeal that the subcompact
doesn't. The sports car might be the valid resource choice for the project, but you should
consider all the alternatives. The same idea applies to human resources in that you might
apply senior-level resources versus junior-level resources, or you could add resources to
speed up the schedule. You may also use make-rent-or-buy analysis when determining
alternative resources.
Project Management Information System Project management software can help plan, or-
ganize, and estimate resource needs and document their availability. It might also help you to
produce resource breakdown structures, resource rates, resource calendars, and availability.


Estimate Activity Resources Outputs
The purpose of the Estimate Activity Resources process is to develop the resource require-
ments output. This output describes the types of resources and the quantity needed for each
activity associated with a work package. You should prepare a narrative description for this
                                                    Estimating Activity Durations           195




output that describes how you determined the estimate, including the information you used to
form your estimate and the assumptions you made about the resources and their availability.


                  Work package estimates are derived by taking a cumulative total of all the
                  schedule activities within the work package.

   You'll use the resource requirements in the next process (Estimate Activity Durations) to
determine the length of time each activity will take to complete. That, of course, depends
on the quantity and skill level of the resources assigned, which is the reason you estimate
resources before you try to determine duration.
   The other outputs of this process are basis of estimates, resource breakdown struc-
ture, and project documents updates (activity attributes, assumption log, lessons learned
register).
   The basis of estimates output contains all the supporting detail regarding the estimates.
This should include assumptions about the estimates, the methods used to derive the esti-
mate, constraints, what resources you used to help develop the estimates whether human or
database related, a confidence level of the estimate, and any risks associated with the esti-
mate that may change the estimate as the project progresses.
   The resource breakdown structure (RBS) is much like an organizational breakdown
structure, but the RBS lists the resources by category and type. You may have several
categories of resources, including labor, hardware, equipment, supplies, and so on. Type
describes the types of resources needed, such as skill levels or quality grades of the material
and so on.
   The project documents updates portion of this output refers to updating the activity
attributes, assumption log, and the lessons learned register with changes to any of the ele-
ments you've recorded here.
   You can see how these "Activity" processes have built on each other. First you defi ned
the activities, then you determined dependencies and sequenced them in the correct order,
and next you determined what types and quantities of resources are required to complete
the activities. Now you're ready to begin estimating the duration of these activities so that
you can plug them into the project schedule.



Estimating Activity Durations
The Estimate Activity Durations process attempts to estimate the work effort, resources,
and number of work periods needed to complete each activity. The duration estimates
are the primary output of this process. These are quantifiable estimates expressed as the
number of work periods needed to complete a schedule activity. Work periods are usually
expressed in hours or days. However, larger projects might express duration in weeks or
months. Work periods are the activity duration estimates, and they become inputs to the
Develop Schedule process.
196       Chapter 4      Creating the Project Schedule



   When estimating activity duration, be certain to include all the time that will elapse
from the beginning of the activity until the work is completed. For example, consider the
earlier example of the house-painting project. You estimate that it will take three days,
including drying time, to prime the house. Now, let's say priming is scheduled to begin
on Saturday, but your crew doesn't work on Sunday. The activity duration in this case is
four days, which includes the three days to prime and dry plus the Sunday the crew doesn't
work. Most project management software programs will handle this kind of situation auto-
matically once you've keyed in the project calendar and work periods.
   Progressive elaboration comes into play during this process also. Estimates typically
start at a fairly high level, and as more details are known about the deliverables and their
associated activities, the estimates become more accurate. You should rely on those folks
who have the most knowledge of the activities you're trying to estimate to help you with
this process.
   According to the PMBOK(R) Guide, there are a few factors you should consider when
determining duration estimates. The first consideration is that some activities will
dictate a certain duration. For example, new server hardware may require a burn in
period of a certain number of hours or days. No amount of effort can alter the duration
of this activity.
   You may think that adding more resources to the activity will help accomplish the work
faster. In some cases, adding too many resources will result in them stepping on each other
or actually taking more time to complete the activity because there are too many people
involved. This saying holds true in this case: "Nine women cannot have a baby in one
month."
   Another concept is the law of diminishing returns. Simply put, there is a point where the
energy expended does not produce enough benefit to warrant the level of effort you're put-
ting into the activity.
   Advances in technology should be taken into consideration when estimating resources.
New technologies may reduce the duration of an activity or require an adjustment in the
types or amounts of resources needed.
   Lastly, you should consider the motivation of the team members working on these activi-
ties. Procrastination may come into play and endanger the timeline because team members
wait until the day before the due date to perform the work and meet the deadline. This is
also known as Student Syndrome because many students are notorious for waiting until
the night before a paper is due to start writing it. Or the opposite effect may occur where
they slowly work toward the due date dragging out the work so they don't have to take
on more tasks (also known as Parkinson's Law.) You should also consider the number of
resources available. More resources on an activity is not necessarily a good thing and could
manifest in the law of diminishing returns. This simply means that at some point, addi-
tional resources will have the effect of degrading the duration of the activity rather than
improving it. When a team member tells you, "It will take me more time to show the new
resource how to perform this activity than it will for me to do it myself," you may have an
example of the law of diminishing returns. Advances in technology may help in improving
duration estimates and should be considered as well.
                                                    Estimating Activity Durations           197




Estimate Activity Durations Inputs
The inputs to this process include the project management plan (schedule management plan,
scope baseline), project documents (activity attributes, activity list, assumption log, lessons
learned register, milestone list, project team assignments, resource breakdown structure, re-
source calendars, resource requirements, risk register), enterprise environmental factors, and
organizational process assets.
   A few of the important elements regarding these inputs apply here as you've seen in
past processes: databases, productivity metrics, historical information regarding durations
on similar projects, project calendars, scheduling methodology, and lessons learned. The
project calendars (which list company holidays, shift schedules, and so on) are considered a
part of the organizational process assets, and activity resource requirements are especially
useful during this process.


Estimate Activity Durations Tools and Techniques
The Estimate Activity Durations process has several new tools and techniques:
    Expert judgment
    Analogous estimating
    Parametric estimating
    Three-point estimating
    Bottom-up estimating
    Data analysis (alternatives analysis, reserve analysis)
    Decision making
    Meetings
   You'll take a look at each of these tools and techniques next with the exception of meet-
ings which have been discussed previously.

Expert Judgment
The staff members who will perform activities will most accurately estimate them. In this
case, team members use expert judgment because of their experience with similar activities in
the past. You should be careful with these estimates, though, because they are subject to bias
and aren't based on any scientific means. Your experts should consider that resource levels,
resource productivity, resource capability, risks, and other factors can impact estimates. It's
good practice to combine expert judgment with historical information and use as many
experts as you can.

Analogous Estimating
Analogous estimating, also called top-down estimating, is a form of expert judgment. With
this technique, you will use the actual duration of a similar activity completed on a previous
198        Chapter 4      Creating the Project Schedule



project to determine the duration of the current activity--provided the information was
documented and stored with the project information on the previous project. This technique
is most useful when the previous activities you're comparing are similar to the activity you're
estimating and don't just appear to be similar. You want the folks who are working on the
estimate to have experience with these activities so they can provide reasonable estimates.
This technique is especially helpful when detailed information about the project is not avail-
able, such as in the early phases of the project.
   Top-down estimating techniques are also used to estimate total project duration, par-
ticularly when you have a limited amount of information about the project. The best way to
think about top-down techniques is to look at the estimate as a whole. Think about being
on a mountaintop where you can see the whole picture as one rather than all the individual
items that make up the picture.
   For instance, let's return to the house-painting example. You would compare a previous
house-painting project to the current house-painting project if the houses are of similar size
and the paint you're using is the same quality. You can use the first house-painting project
to estimate the project duration for the second house-painting project because of the simi-
larities in the project.
   Top-down techniques are useful when you're early in the project Planning processes and
are just beginning to flesh out all the details of the project. Sometimes during the project
selection process, the selection committee might want an idea of the project's duration. You
can derive a project estimate at this stage by using top-down techniques.



Exam Spotlight

The PMBOK (R) Guide states that analogous estimating is a gross value estimating tech-
nique. It also notes that you can use analogous estimating to determine overall project
duration and cost estimates for the entire project (or phases of the project). For the exam,
remember that the analogous technique is typically less time-consuming and less costly
than other estimating techniques, but it's also less accurate.



Parametric Estimating
Parametric estimating is a quantitatively based estimating method that multiplies the quan-
tity of work by the rate or uses an algorithm in conjunction with historical data to determine
cost, budget, or duration estimates. The best way to describe it is with an example. Suppose
you are working on a companywide network upgrade project. This requires you to run
new cable to the switches on every floor in the building. To come up with an estimate, you
can use parametric estimates to determine activity duration estimates by taking a known
element--in this case, the amount of cable needed--and multiplying it by the amount of time
it takes to install a unit of cable. In other words, suppose you have 10,000 meters of new
cable to run. You know from past experience it takes 1 hour to install 100 meters. Using this
measurement, you can determine an estimate for this activity of 100 hours to run the new
cable. Therefore, the cable activity duration estimate is 100 hours.

Exam Spotlight

The PMBOK (R) Guide states that you can also use parametric estimating to determine time
estimates for the entire project or portions of the project when you are using this tech-
nique in conjunction with other estimating techniques. For the exam, remember that a
statistical relationship exists between historical data and other variables (as explained in
the cable example earlier) when using parametric estimates and that this technique can
be highly accurate if the data you are using is reliable.



Three-Point Estimating
Three-point estimating, as you can probably guess, uses three estimates that, when averaged,
come up with a final estimate. The three estimates you'll use in this technique are the
most likely estimate (tM), an optimistic estimate (tO), and a pessimistic estimate (tP).
The most likely estimate assumes there are no disasters and the activity can be completed
as planned. The optimistic estimate is the fastest time frame in which your resource can
complete the activity. The pessimistic estimate assumes the worst happens, and it takes much
longer than planned to get the activity completed. You'll want to rely on experienced folks
to give you these estimates. Then you can choose to use one of two formulas to calculate the
expected duration estimate (tE). The first formula, called the triangular distribution, consists
of summing the optimistic (tO), the pessimistic (tP), and the most likely (tM) estimates and
then dividing that sum by 3. The formula looks like this:
                                    tE = (tO + tM + tP) / 3
   Use the triangular distribution when you don't have enough historical data to assist with
the estimates or you're using expert judgment to derive estimates.
   The second formula is called a beta distribution, which is taken from the program evalu-
ation and review technique (PERT) that we will review in depth in the Develop Schedule
process later in this process. The formula for beta distribution, or PERT, looks like this:
                                   tE = (tO + 4tM + tP) / 6
  The beta distribution method is preferred when you have a good set of historical data
and samples to base the estimates on.

Bottom-Up Estimating
Bottom-up estimating is performed by obtaining individual estimates for each project activ-
ity and then adding all of them up together to come up with a total estimate for the work
package. Bottom-up estimating is a good technique to use when you aren't confident about
the type or quantity of resources you'll need for the project. This is an accurate means of
estimating, provided the estimates at the schedule activity level are accurate. However, it
takes a considerable amount of time to perform bottom-up estimating because every activity
must be assessed and estimated accurately to be included in the bottom-up calculation. The
smaller and more detailed the activity, the greater the accuracy and cost of this technique.
200        Chapter 4      Creating the Project Schedule



Data Analysis--Reserve Analysis
Contingency reserves--also called buffers or time reserves in the PMBOK(R) Guide--means a
portion of time (or money when you're estimating budgets) that is added to the schedule to
account for risk or uncertainty. You might choose to add a percentage of time or a set num-
ber of work periods to the activity or the overall schedule or both. Contingency reserves are
calculated for known risks that have documented contingency or mitigation response plans
to deal with the risk event should it occur, but you don't necessarily know how much time
it will take to implement the mitigation plan and potentially perform rework. For example,
you know it will take 100 hours to run new cable based on the quantitative estimate you
came up with earlier. You also know that sometimes you hit problem areas when running
the cable. To make sure you don't impact the project schedule, you build in a reserve time of
10 percent of your original estimate to account for the problems you might encounter. This
brings your activity duration estimate to 110 hours for this activity. Contingency reserves
can be and should be modified as the project progresses. As you use the time, or find you
don't need the time, you will modify the reserve amounts.
   Management reserves are a type of reserve used for unknown events. Since they are
unknown, you have not identified them as risks. Management reserves are for that funny
feeling you have that something could come up that you haven't thought about during the
Planning process. Management reserves set aside periods of time for this unknown work
but are not included in the schedule baseline. Keep in mind this is not time that is available
to throw in extra deliverables that didn't make it into the scope statement. Management
reserves must be used for project work that is within scope. If you do use management
reserves during the project, you must change the schedule baseline to reflect the time used.



Exam Spotlight

Contingency reserves are included in the schedule baseline; management reserves are
not. Contingency reserves are for potential work identified during the Risk Planning
processes. Management reserves are for unknown circumstances that have not been
previously identified but require work that is within the scope of the project. Management
reserves that are used on the project require a change to the schedule baseline.



Decision-Making Techniques
Decision-making techniques include the voting techniques we discussed in Chapter 3 as well
as brainstorming, and the Delphi or nominal group techniques. These techniques get your
team members involved and will help improve the accuracy of your estimates. Brainstorming
is an age-old technique where all participants have an opportunity to speak up. No idea is
a bad idea with this technique, and it's essential that the facilitator not allow participants to
get into judging contests or debates on the merits of the ideas proposed during the brain-
storming session.

   The Delphi technique is similar to brainstorming in that you involve subject matter
experts in determining estimates. Their experiences with the organization and on simi-
lar past projects will help improve the accuracy of the estimates. Because you have them
involved in the process and they know that the estimates derived from this exercise will
be attached to the project schedule, they are likely to provide more accurate estimates and
work hard to meet or beat them.
   Another voting technique noted in the PMBOK(R) Guide is called the fist to five tech-
nique, which is commonly used on projects using the Agile methodology. This technique is
simple in that team members hold up a fist if they are not in agreement or will not support
the idea proposed (or activity duration in this case), or they can hold up five fingers if they
are in full support of the idea, or any number of fingers between a fist and five. If someone
holds up less than three fingers, they are called upon to discuss why they are opposed to the
idea and the issues they are concerned about if this idea is adopted. This technique is some-
times known as fist of five.



Estimate Activity Durations Outputs
Everything I've discussed to this point has brought you to the primary output of this process:
the duration estimates. You use the inputs and tools and techniques to establish these esti-
mates. As mentioned earlier, activity duration estimates are estimates of the required work
periods needed to complete the activity. This is a quantitative measure usually expressed in
hours, weeks, days, or months.
   One factor to note about your final estimates as an output to this process is that they
should contain a range of possible results. In the cable-running example, you would state
the activity duration estimates as "100 hours  10 hours" to show that the actual duration
will take at least 90 hours and might go as long as 110 hours--or you could use percent-
ages to express this range.
   The other outputs of Estimate Activity Durations are basis of estimates and project
documents updates. The information that may need to be revisited and updated as a result
of this process includes the activity attributes and the assumptions you made regarding
resource availability and skill levels, and the lessons learned register.
   Now that you have all the activity information in hand, along with a host of other
inputs, you're ready to develop the project schedule.



Exam Spotlight

Remember that you perform the Activity processes in this order: Define Activities,
Sequence Activities, Estimate Activity Resources, and Estimate Activity Durations.
Develop Schedule comes after you've completed all of these processes.
202        Chapter 4      Creating the Project Schedule




Desert State University (DSU)

DSU has hired a contract agency to create its new registration website. The website will
allow students in good academic standing to register for classes over the Internet. You
have been appointed as the project manager for the DSU side of this project. You'll be
working with Henry Lu from Websites International to complete this project.

Henry has given you an activity list and asked for time estimates that he can plug into the
project plan.

Your first stop is Mike Walter's desk. He's the expert on the mainframe registration
system and he'll be writing the interface programs to accept registration data from the
new website. Mike will also create the download that the Internet program will use to
verify a student's academic standing. Mike has created other programs just like this in the
past. His expertise and judgment are very reliable.

The next stop is Kate Langdon. She's the new team leader of the testing group. Kate has
been with DSU for only one month. Since she has no experience working with DSU data
and staff members, she tells you she'll get back to you within a week with estimates
for the testing activities. She plans to read through the project binders of some similar
projects and base her estimates against the historical information on similar projects.
She'll run the estimates by her lead tester before giving them to you.

You've asked both of your resources to provide you with three-point estimates. Mike
Walter's estimates are an example of using the tool and technique of expert judgment
to derive activity duration estimates. The estimates expected from Kate Langdon will be
derived using historical information (implied by the research she's going to do into past
similar projects) and expert judgment because she's involving her lead tester to verify
the estimates.




Developing the Project Schedule
The Develop Schedule process is the heart of the Planning process group. This is where you
lay out the schedule for your project activities, determine their start and finish dates, and
finalize activity sequences and durations. Develop Schedule, along with Estimate Activity Re-
sources and Estimate Activity Durations, is repeated several times before you come up with
the project schedule. Most project management software programs today can automatically
build a schedule for you once you've entered the needed information for the activities. The
project schedule, once it's approved, serves as the schedule baseline for the project that you
can track against in later processes.
                                                 Developing the Project Schedule             203




                  Remember that you cannot perform Develop Schedule until you have
                  completed at least the following processes in the Planning group (some of
                  these can be performed at the same time for smaller, less complex proj-
                  ects): Collect Requirements, Define Scope, Create WBS, Define Activities,
                  Sequence Activities, Estimate Activity Resources, Estimate Activity Dura-
                  tions, and Plan Resource Management. In practice, it's also beneficial
                  to perform Identify Risks, Perform Qualitative Risk Analysis, Perform
                  Quantitative Risk Analysis, Plan Risk Responses, and Plan Procurement
                  Management prior to developing the schedule.

    There is a lot of material to cover in this process, so grab a cup of coffee or a soda now.
I'll start with the inputs to the Develop Schedule process and then follow up with an in-
depth discussion of the tools and techniques of the process. These techniques will help you
get to the primary outputs of this process: the project schedule and the schedule baseline.


Develop Schedule Inputs
Develop Schedule has five inputs, several of which are outputs from other Planning
processes. The inputs are as follows:
    Project management plan (schedule management plan, scope baseline)
    Project documents (activity attributes, activity list, assumption log, basis of estimates,
    duration estimates, lessons learned register, milestone list, project schedule network
    diagrams, project team assignments, resource calendars, resource requirements, risk
    register)
    Agreements
    Enterprise environmental factors
    Organizational process assets
    You can see how important it is to perform all the Planning processes accurately because
the information you derive from almost every process in the Planning group is used some-
where else in Planning, many of them here. Your project schedule will reflect the informa-
tion you know at this point in time. If you have incorrectly estimated activity durations
or didn't identify the right dependencies, for example, the inputs to this process will be
distorted and your project schedule will not be correct. It's defi nitely worth the investment
of time to correctly plan your project and come up with accurate outputs for each of the
Planning processes.
    As with several other processes, you should pay particular attention to constraints and
assumptions when performing Develop Schedule. Constraints are with you throughout the
life of the project. The most important constraints to consider in the Develop Schedule pro-
cess are time constraints, and they fall into two categories: imposed dates and key events/
major milestones.
    Imposed dates restrict the start or fi nish date of activities. The two most common
constraints, start no earlier than and finish no later than, are used by most computerized
project management software programs. Let's look once again at the house-painting
204         Chapter 4      Creating the Project Schedule



example. The painting activity cannot start until the primer has dried. If the primer takes
24 hours to dry and is scheduled to be completed on Wednesday, this implies that the paint-
ing activity can start no earlier than Thursday. This is an example of an imposed date.
   Key events or milestones refer to the completion of specific deliverables by a specific
date. Stakeholders, customers, or management staff might request that certain deliverables
be completed or delivered by specific dates. Once you've agreed to those dates (even if the
agreement is only verbal), it's often cast in stone and difficult to change. These dates, there-
fore, become constraints.


                   Be careful of the delivery dates you commit to your stakeholders or cus-
                   tomers. You might think you're simply discussing the matter or throwing
                   out ideas, whereas the stakeholder might take what you've said as fact.
                   Once the stakeholder believes the deliverable or activity will be completed
                   by a specific date, there's almost no convincing them that the date needs
                   changing.




Develop Schedule Tools and Techniques
The primary outputs of Develop Schedule are the schedule baseline and the project
schedule. The schedule baseline is the approved version of the project schedule. You can
employ several tools and techniques to produce these outputs. The tools and techniques
you choose depend on the complexity of the project. For the exam, however, you'll need to
know them all.
   Develop Schedule has eight tools and techniques:
      Schedule network analysis
      Critical path method
      Resource optimization
      Data analysis (what-if scenarios, simulation)
      Leads and lags
      Schedule compression
      Project management information system
      Agile release planning
  A lot of information is packed into some of these tools and techniques, and you should
dedicate study time to each of them for the exam. We'll look at each one next.

Schedule Network Analysis
Schedule network analysis produces the project schedule model. It involves calculating early
and late start dates and early and late finish dates for project activities (as does the critical
path method). It uses a schedule model and other analytical techniques such as critical path
                                                Developing the Project Schedule             205




and critical chain method, what-if analysis, and resource leveling (all of which are other
tools and techniques in this process) to help calculate these dates and create the schedule.
These calculations are performed without taking resource limitations into consideration, so
the dates you end up with are theoretical. At this point, you're attempting to establish the
time periods within which the activities can be scheduled. Resource limitations and other
constraints will be taken into consideration when you get to the outputs of this process.

Critical Path Method
The critical path method (CPM) is a schedule network analysis technique that estimates
the minimum project duration. It determines the amount of float, or schedule flexibility, for
each of the network paths by calculating the earliest start date, earliest finish date, latest
start date, and latest finish date for each activity (without taking resource availability into
account). This is a schedule network analysis technique that relies on sequential networks
(one activity occurs before the next, a series of activities occurring concurrently is completed
before the next series of activities begins, and so on) and on a single duration estimate for
each activity. The precedence diagramming method (PDM) can be used to perform CPM.
Keep in mind that CPM is a method to determine schedule durations without regard to
resource availability.
    The critical path (CP) is generally the longest full path on the project. Any project activ-
ity with a float time that equals 0 or with negative float is considered a critical path task.
The critical path can change under a few conditions. When activities with float time use up
all their float, they can become critical path tasks. Or you might have a milestone midway
through the project with a finish no later than constraint that can change the critical path if
it isn't met.
     Float time is also called slack time, and you'll see these terms used interchangeably.
There are two types of float: total float and free float. Total float (TF) is the amount of time
you can delay the earliest start of a task without delaying the ending of the project. Free
float (FF) is the amount of time you can delay the start of a task without delaying the earli-
est start of a successor task.
    In the following section, you'll calculate the CP for a sample project, and I'll illustrate
how you derive all the dates, the CP, and the float times.

Gathering Activity and Dependency Information
Let's say you are the project manager for a new software project. Your team will be develop-
ing a custom application that manages, tracks, and analyzes charitable contributions to a
variety of organizations managed by your parent company. You need to devise a software
system that tracks all the information related to the contributions, the donors, and the re-
ceivers and also supplies the management team with reports that will help them make good
business decisions. For purposes of illustration, I'm showing only a limited portion of the
tasks that you would have on a project like this.
   You'll start this example by plugging information from the processes you've already
completed into a table (a complete example is shown later in Table 4.1 in the section
"Calculating the Critical Path"). The list of activities comes from the Define Activities
206        Chapter 4      Creating the Project Schedule



process. The durations for each activity are listed in the Duration column and were derived
during the Estimate Activity Durations process. The duration times are listed in days.
   The Dependency column lists the activities that require a previous activity to finish
before the current activity can start. You're using only finish-to-start relationships. For
example, you'll see that activity 2 and activity 4 each depend on activity 1 to finish before
they can begin. The dependency information came from the Sequence Activities process.
Now, you'll proceed to calculating the dates.

Calculating the Forward and Backward Pass
Project Deliverables is the first activity and, obviously, where the project starts. This activity
begins on April 1. Project Deliverables has a 12-day duration. So, take April 1 and add 12
days to this to come up with an early finish date of April 12. Watch out, because you need to
count day 1, or April 1, as a full workday. The simplest way to do this calculation is to take
the early start date, add the duration, and subtract 1. Therefore, the early finish date for the
first activity is April 12. By the way, we are ignoring weekends and holidays for this example.
Activity 2 depends on activity 1, so it cannot start until activity 1 has finished. Its earliest
start date is April 13 because activity 1 finished at the end of the previous day. Add the dura-
tion to this date minus 1 to come up with the finish date.
    You'll notice that since activity 4 depends on activity 1 finishing, its earliest start date is
also April 13. Continue to calculate the remaining early start and early finish dates in the
same manner. This calculation is called a forward pass.
    To calculate the latest start and latest finish dates, you begin with the last activity. The
latest finish for activity 9 is July 10. Since the duration is only one day, July 10 is also the
latest start date. You know that activity 8 must finish before activity 9 can begin, so activ-
ity 8's latest finish date, July 9, is one day prior to activity 9's latest start date, July 10.
Subtract the duration of activity 8 (three days) from July 9 and add one day to get the latest
start date of July 7. You're performing the opposite calculation that you did for the forward
pass. This calculation is called a backward pass, as you might have guessed. Continue cal-
culating the latest start and latest finish through activity 4.
    Activity 3 adds a new twist. Here's how it works: Activity 7 cannot begin until activity
3 and activity 6 are completed. No other activity depends on the completion of activity 3.
If activity 7's latest start date is June 29, activity 3's latest finish date must be June 28. June
28 minus eight days plus one gives you a latest start date of June 21. Activity 3 depends on
activity 2, so activity 2 must be completed prior to beginning activity 3. Calculate these
dates just as you did for activities 9 through 4.
    Activity 1 still remains. Activity 4 cannot start until activity 1 is completed. If activ-
ity 4's latest start date is April 13, the latest finish date for activity 1 must be April 12.
Subtract the duration of activity 1, and add 1 to come up with a latest start date of April 1.
Alternatively, you can calculate the forward pass and backward pass by saying the first task
starts on day 0 and then adding the duration to this. For example, activity number 1's earli-
est start date is April 1, which is day 0. Add 12 days to day 0, and you come up with an
earliest finish date of April 12.
    You determine the calculation for float/slack time by subtracting the earliest start date
from the latest start date. If the float time equals 0, the activity is on the critical path.
                                               Developing the Project Schedule             207




Calculating the Critical Path
To determine the CP duration of the project, add the duration of every activity with zero
float. You should come up with 101 days because you're adding the duration for all activities
except for activity 2 and activity 3. A critical path task is any task that cannot be changed
without impacting the project end date. By definition, these are all tasks with zero float.
   Another way to determine the critical path is by looking at the network diagram. If the
duration is included with the information on the node or if start and end dates are given, you
simply calculate the duration and then add the duration of the longest path in the diagram to
determine the CP. However, this method is not as accurate as what's shown in Table 4.1.

   Figure 4.4 shows the same project in diagram form. The duration is printed in the top-
right corner of each node. Add the duration of each path to determine which one is the
critical path.
   Remember that CP is usually the path with the longest duration. In Figure 4.4, path
1-2-3-7-8-9 equals 34 days. Path 1-4-5-6-7-8-9 equals 101 days; therefore, this path is the
critical path.

Calculating Expected Value Using PERT
Program Evaluation and Review Technique (PERT) is a method that the United States Navy
developed in the 1950s. The Navy was working on one of the most complex engineering
projects in history at the time--the Polaris Missile Program--and needed a way to man-
age the project and forecast the project schedule with a high degree of reliability. PERT was
developed to do just that.
   PERT and CPM are similar techniques. The difference is that CPM uses the most likely
duration to determine project duration, whereas PERT uses what's called expected value
(or the weighted average). Expected value is calculated using the three-point estimates for
activity duration (I talked about three-point estimates earlier in this chapter) and then find-
ing the weighted average of those estimates. If you take this one step further and determine
the standard deviation of each activity, you can assign a confidence factor to your project
estimates. Without getting too heavily involved in the mathematics of probability, under-
stand that for data that fits a bell curve--which is what you're about to calculate with the
PERT technique--the following is true:
      Work will finish within plus or minus three standard deviations 99.73 percent of the time.
      Work will finish within plus or minus two standard deviations 95.45 percent of the time.
      Work will finish within plus or minus one standard deviation 68.27 percent of the time.
                                                Developing the Project Schedule              209




Calculating Expected Value
The three-point estimates used to calculate expected value are the optimistic estimate, the
pessimistic estimate, and the most likely estimate. Going back to the software example, let's
find out what these three time estimates might look like for the activity called Write Code.
You get these estimates by asking the lead programmer, or key team member, to estimate the
optimistic, pessimistic, and most likely duration for the activity based on past experience.
Other historical information could be used to determine these estimates as well. Say in this
case that you're given 38 days for the optimistic time, 57 days for the pessimistic, and 45
days for the most likely. (Forty-five days was derived from the Estimate Activity Durations
process and is the estimate you used to calculate CPM.)
   The formula to calculate expected value is as follows:
                       [optimistic + pessimistic + (4 x mostlikely)] / 6
   The expected value for the Write Code activity is as follows:
                               [38 + 57 + (4 x 45)] / 6 = 45.83
   The formula for standard deviation, which helps you determine confidence level, is as
follows:
                                 (pessimistic - optimistic) / 6
   The standard deviation for your activity is as follows:
                                     (57 - 38) / 6 = 3.17
   You could say the following, given the information you now have:
    There is a 68.27 percent chance that the Write Code activity will be completed in
    42.66 days to 49 days.
    There is a 95.45 percent chance that the Write Code activity will be completed in 39.49
    days to 52.17 days.
   You calculated the range of dates for the 68.27 percent chance by adding and
subtracting one standard deviation, 3.17, from the expected value, 45.83. You calculated
the 95.45 percent chance by multiplying the standard deviation times 2, which equals 6.34,
and adding and subtracting that result from the expected value to come up with the least
number of days and the most number of days it will take to finish the activity. Generally
speaking, two standard deviations, or 95.45 percent, is a close enough estimate for most
purposes.

Determining Date Ranges for Project Duration
Let's bring your table of activities back and plug in the expected values and the standard
deviation for each (see Table 4.2).

                   The higher the standard deviation is for an activity, the higher the risk.
                   Because standard deviation measures the difference between the pessi-
                   mistic and the optimistic times, a greater spread between the two, which
                   results in a higher number, indicates a greater risk. Conversely, a low stan-
                   dard deviation means less risk.

    Now let's look at the total project duration using PERT and the standard deviation to
determine a range of dates for project duration. You should add only the tasks that are on
the critical path. Remember from the CPM example that activities 2 and 3 are not on the
critical path, so their expected value and standard deviation calculations have been left
blank in this table. When you add all the remaining tasks, the total expected value duration
is 102.99 days, or 103 days rounded to the nearest day.
                                                 Developing the Project Schedule              211




   Your next logical conclusion might be to add the Standard Deviation column to get the
standard deviation for the project. Unfortunately, you cannot add the standard deviations
because you will come out with a number that is much too high. Totaling the standard
deviations assumes that all the tasks will run over schedule, and that's not likely. It is likely
that a few tasks will run over but not every one of them. So now you're probably wondering
how to calculate the magic number.
   You might have noticed an extra column at the right called SD Squared (or variance).
This is the standard deviation squared--or for those of you with math phobias out there,
the standard deviation multiplied by itself.
   Once you have calculated the standard deviation squared for each activity, add the
squares, for a total of 14.98. There's one more step, and you're done. Take the square root
of 14.98 (you'll need a calculator) to come up with 3.87. This is the standard deviation you
will use to determine your range of projected completion dates. Here's a recap of these last
few calculations:
                                Total expected value = 103.00
                                  Sum of SD Squared = 14.98
                              Square root of SD Squared = 3.87
   You can now make the following predictions regarding your project:
    There is a 68.27 percent chance that the project will be completed in 99.13 days to
    106.87 days.
    There is a 95.45 percent chance that the project will be completed in 95.26 days to
    110.74 days.



Exam Spotlight

For the exam, I recommend that you know that one standard deviation gives you a 
68 percent (rounded) probability and two standard deviations give you a 95 percent
(rounded) probability. Also, know how to calculate the range of project duration dates
based on the expected value and standard deviation calculation. You probably don't need
to memorize how to calculate the standard deviation because most of the questions give
you this information. You should, however, memorize the PERT formula and know how
it works. It wouldn't hurt to memorize the standard deviation formula as well--you never
know what might show up on the exam.



   PERT is not used often today. When it is, it's used for very large, highly complex
 rojects. However, PERT is a useful technique to determine project duration when your
p
activity durations are uncertain. It's also useful for calculating the duration for individual
tasks in your schedule that might be complex or risky. You might decide to use PERT for a
212         Chapter 4       Creating the Project Schedule



handful of the activities (those with the highest amount of risk, for example) and use other
techniques to determine duration for the remaining activities.

Critical Chain Method
Although this is not an official tool and technique of this process, you should know the criti-
cal chain method for the exam. Critical chain method is a schedule network analysis tech-
nique that will modify the project schedule by accounting for limited or restricted resources,
or for unforeseen project issues, by adding buffers to any schedule path. First construct the
project schedule network diagram using the critical path method. You will apply the dura-
tion estimates, dependencies, and constraints and then enter resource availability. Buffers,
called feeding buffers, are added at this time as well. The idea behind feeding buffers is
similar to that of contingencies. Adding buffer activities (which are essentially nonwork
activities) to the schedule gives you a cushion of time that protects the critical path and thus
the overall project schedule from slipping. Feeding buffers are added to noncritical chain-
dependent tasks that feed into the critical chain. Project buffers are a type of buffer that
is added at the end of the critical chain. According to the PMBOK(R) Guide, after adding
these buffer activities you should schedule your critical path tasks at their latest start and
finish dates.
    Once this modified schedule is calculated, you'll often find that it changes the critical
path. The new critical path showing the resource restrictions and feeding buffers is called
the critical chain.
    Critical chain uses both deterministic (step-by-step) and probabilistic approaches. A few
steps are involved in the critical chain process:
      Construct the schedule network diagram using activity duration estimates (you'll use
      nonconservative estimates in this method).
      Define dependencies.
      Define constraints.
      Calculate critical path.
      Enter resource availability into the schedule.
      Recalculate for the critical chain.
   The critical chain method typically schedules high-risk tasks early in the project so that
problems can be identified and addressed right away. It allows for combining several tasks
into one task when one resource is assigned to all the tasks.



Exam Spotlight

CPM manages the total float of schedule network paths, whereas critical chain manages
buffer activity durations. Critical chain is built on CPM and protects the schedule from
slipping.

Resource Optimization Techniques
Earlier, I said that CPM and PERT do not consider resource availability. Now that you have
a schedule of activities and have determined the critical path, it's time to plug in resources
for those activities and adjust the schedule or resources according to any resource constraints
you discover. Remember that you identified resource estimates during the Estimate Activity
Resources process. Now during Develop Schedule, resources are assigned to specific activi-
ties. Usually, you'll find that your initial schedule has periods of time with more activities
than you have resources to work on them. You will also find that it isn't always possible to
assign 100 percent of your team members' time to tasks. Sometimes your schedule will show
a team member who is overallocated, meaning that individual is assigned to more work than
she can physically perform in the given time period. Other times, the team worker might
not be assigned enough work to keep her busy during the time period. This problem is easy
to fix. You can assign underallocated resources to multiple tasks to keep her busy. Adjust-
ing the schedule for overallocated resources is a harder problem to fix. We will look at three
techniques that optimize resources to prevent overallocation where possible: resource level-
ing, resource smoothing, and reverse resource allocation scheduling. You should use these
techniques with CPM-based schedules.

Resource Leveling
Resource leveling--also called the resource-based method--is used when resources are
overallocated, when they are only available at certain times, or when they are assigned to
more than one activity at a time. In a nutshell, resource leveling attempts to balance out
the resource assignments to get tasks completed without overloading the individual. You
accomplish this by adjusting the start and finish dates of schedule activities based on the
availability of resources. This typically means allocating resources to critical path tasks first,
which often changes the critical path and, in turn, the overall project end date.
   The project manager can accomplish resource leveling in a couple of other ways as well.
You might delay the start of a task to match the availability of a key team member, or you
might adjust the resource assignments so that more tasks are given to team members who
are underallocated. Generally speaking, resource leveling of overallocated team members
extends the project end date. If you're under a date constraint, you'll have to rework the
schedule after assigning resources to keep the project on track with the committed comple-
tion date. You can accomplish this with resource smoothing, which we'll look at next.

Resource Smoothing
Resource smoothing accommodates resource availability by modifying activities within their
float times without changing the critical path or project end date. That means you'll also
use this technique when you need to meet specific schedule dates and are concerned about
resource availability.
   There are several ways you can accomplish this. You can adjust the resource assign-
ments so that more tasks are given to team members who are underallocated. You could
also require the resources to work mandatory overtime--that one always goes over well!
Perhaps you can split some tasks so that the team member with the pertinent knowledge
214        Chapter 4      Creating the Project Schedule



or skill performs the critical part of the task and the noncritical part of the task is given
to a less-skilled team member. Other methods might include moving key resources from
noncritical tasks and assigning them to critical path tasks or adjusting assignments.
Reallocating those team members with slack time to critical path tasks to keep them on
schedule is another option. Don't forget, fast tracking is another way to keep the project on
schedule.

Reverse Resource Allocation Scheduling
Reverse resource allocation scheduling is a technique used when key resources--like a
thermodynamic expert, for example--are required at a specific point in the project and
they are the only resource, or resources, available to perform these activities. This technique
requires the resources to be scheduled in reverse order (that is, from the end date of the
project rather than the beginning) in order to assign this key resource at the correct time.



Exam Spotlight

Resource leveling can cause the original critical path to change and can delay the proj-
ect's completion date. Resource smoothing modifies activities within their floats without
changing the critical path or project end date. It's used when changes to the critical path
cannot or should not be made. Reverse resource allocation scheduling is used when spe-
cific resources are needed at certain times.



Data Analysis (What-if Scenario Analysis, Simulation)
Network modeling techniques typically include the use of what-if scenario analysis and
simulation.
    What-if scenario analysis uses different sets of activity assumptions to produce
multiple project durations. For example, what would happen if a major deliverable is
delayed or the weather prevents you from completing a deliverable on time? What-if
analysis asks the question, "What if (fill in the blank) happens on the project?" and
attempts to determine the potential positive and/or negative impacts to the project.
What-if questions help determine the feasibility of the project schedule under adverse
conditions. They are also useful to the project team in preparing risk responses or
contingency plans to address the what-if situations. Worst-case what-if scenarios may
result in a no-go decision.
    Simulation techniques use a range of probable activity durations for each activity (often
derived from the three-point estimates), and those ranges are then used to calculate a range
of probable duration results for the project itself. Monte Carlo is a simulation technique
that runs the possible activity durations and schedule projections many, many times to
come up with the schedule projections and their probability, critical path duration esti-
mates, and float time.

exam Spotlight

For the exam, remember that Monte Carlo is a simulation technique that shows the prob-
ability of all the possible project completion dates.



Leads and Lags
I talked about leads and lags earlier in this chapter. You'll recall that lags delay successor
activities and require time added either to the start date or to the finish date of the activity
you're scheduling. Leads require time to be subtracted from the start date or the finish date
of the activity. Keep in mind that as you go about creating your project schedule, you might
need to adjust lead and lag time to come up with a workable schedule.

Schedule Compression
Schedule compression is a form of mathematical analysis that's used to shorten the
project schedule duration without changing the project scope. Compression is simply
shortening the project schedule to accomplish all the activities sooner than estimated.
    Schedule compression might happen when the project end date has been predetermined or
if, after performing the CPM or PERT techniques, you discover that the project is going to take
longer than the original promised date. In the CPM example, you calculated the end date to be
July 10. What if the project was undertaken and a July 2 date was promised? That's when you'll
need to employ one or both of the duration compression techniques: crashing and fast tracking.

Crashing
Crashing is a compression technique that looks at cost and schedule trade-offs. Crashing
the schedule is accomplished by adding resources--from either inside or outside the
organization--to the critical path tasks. It wouldn't help you to add resources to noncritical
path tasks; these tasks don't impact the schedule end date anyway because they have float
time. Crashing could be accomplished by requiring mandatory overtime for critical path tasks
or requiring overnight deliveries of materials rather than relying on standard shipping times.
You may find that crashing the schedule can lead to increased risk or increased costs or both.


                  Be certain to check the critical path when you've used the crashing tech-
                  nique because crashing might have changed the critical path. Also con-
                  sider that crashing doesn't always come up with a reasonable result. It
                  often increases the costs of the project as well. The idea with crashing is
                  to try to gain the greatest amount of schedule compression with the least
                  amount of cost.

Fast Tracking
I talked about fast tracking in Chapter 1, "What Is a Project?" Fast tracking is performing
two tasks or project phases in parallel that were previously scheduled to start sequentially.
216        Chapter 4      Creating the Project Schedule



Fast tracking can occur for the entire duration of the task or phase or for a portion of the task
or phase duration. It can increase project risk and might cause the project team to have to
rework tasks. Fast tracking will work only for activities that can be overlapped. For example,
it is often performed in object-oriented programming. The programmers might begin writ-
ing code on several modules at once, out of sequential order and prior to the completion of
the design phase. However, if you remember our house-painting example, you couldn't start
priming and painting at the same time, so fast tracking isn't a possibility for those activities.

Project Management Information System (PMIS)
Given the examples you've worked through on Develop Schedule and resource leveling, you
have probably already concluded how much a scheduling tool, which is part of an overall
PMIS, might help you with these processes. They will automate the mathematical calcula-
tions (such as forward and backward pass) and perform resource-leveling functions for you.
Obviously, you can then print the schedule that has been produced for final approval and
ongoing updates. It's common practice to email updated schedules with project notes so that
stakeholders know what activities are completed and which ones remain to be done.
   It's beyond the scope of this book to go into all the various software programs avail-
able to project managers. Suffice it to say that scheduling tools and project management
software range from the simple to the complex. The level of sophistication and the types of
project management techniques that you're involved with will determine which software
product you should choose. Many project managers that I know have had great success
with Microsoft Project software and use it exclusively. It contains a robust set of features
and reporting tools that will serve most projects well.
   Don't forget that you are the project manager, and your good judgment should never be
usurped by the recommendation of a software product. Your finely tuned skills and experi-
ence will tell you whether relationship issues between team members might cause bigger
problems than what the resource-leveling function indicates. Constraints and stakeholder
expectations are difficult for a software package to factor in. Rely on your expertise when
in doubt. If you don't have the experience yet to make knowledge-based decisions, seek out
another project manager or a senior stakeholder, manager, or team member and ask him or
her to confirm whether you're on the right track. Here's a word of caution: Don't become so
involved with the software that you're managing the software instead of managing the proj-
ect. Project management software is a wonderful tool, but it is not a substitute for sound
project management practices or experience.

Agile Release Planning
You'll recall that in the Agile methodology, deliverables and requirements start out as back-
log items. Backlog items are then decomposed into user stories which are further decom-
posed into tasks. In order to accommodate large projects when using the Agile methodology,
it's helpful to define releases, which are usually a significant feature or portion of functional-
ity that will exist in the final product. The team also determines how many releases it will
take to complete the final product, service, or result of the project as well as how many itera-
tions (also known as sprints) it will take to complete each release.
                                                          Developing the Project Schedule       217




   This process starts at a high level with a product vision (think of this similar to a scope
description) that drives the roadmap for the project as well as the release plans.
   For example, let's say we are developing a mobile application that will track the number of
business miles driven, track the service record for the vehicle, and calculate reimbursement rates.
The product vision is a mobile app to track vehicle mileage and maintenance. The releases are:
    Release 1 = Business miles driven
    Release 2 = Vehicle maintenance tracking
    Release 3 = Reimbursement calculations
   Release 1 contains four iterations. Iteration 1 within Release 1 contains backlog items
that are decomposed into user stories and tasks. Each release has its own release plan with
the number of iterations required for that release. A visual example of Release 1 might look
like Figure 4.5.

Scheduling Process Outputs
The Develop Schedule process has seven outputs:
    Schedule baseline
    Project schedule
    Schedule data
    Project calendars
    Change requests
218         Chapter 4      Creating the Project Schedule



      Project management plan updates (schedule management plan, cost baseline)
      Project documents updates (activity attributes, assumption log, duration estimates, les-
      sons learned register, resource requirements, risk register)
   We'll take a look at a few of the outputs of this process next, starting with the project
schedule first. Take note that the two primary outputs from this process that will carry for-
ward throughout the rest of the project are the project schedule and the schedule baseline.




Sunny Surgeons, Inc.

Kate Newman is a project manager for Sunny Surgeons, Inc, is a software company that
produces software for handheld devices for the medical profession. The software allows
surgeons to keep notes regarding patients, upcoming surgeries, and ideas about new
medicines and techniques to research. Kate's latest project is to write an enhanced ver-
sion of the patient-tracking program with system integration capabilities to a well-known
desktop software product used by the medical industry.

The programming department has had some recent turnover. Fortunately, Stephen, the
senior programmer who led the development effort on the original version of the patient
tracker, still works for Sunny. His expertise with handheld technologies, as well as his knowl-
edge of the desktop software product, makes him an invaluable resource for this project.

Kate discovered a problem during the development of the project schedule. Stephen is
overallocated for three key activities. Kate decides to see what his take is on the situation
before deciding what to do.

Stephen, the eternal optimist programmer who loves his job and does all but sleep in his
office at night, says he can easily complete all the activities and that Kate shouldn't give
it a second thought. He also suggests to Kate that Karen Wong, a junior programmer on
his team who worked on the last project with him, might be able to handle the noncritical
path task on her own, with a little direction from Stephen.

Kate thinks better of the idea of overallocating her key project resource, even if he does
think he can do the entire thing single-handedly. She decides to try some resource level-
ing to see what turns up.

Kate discovers that rearranging the order of activities, along with assigning Karen to
handle the noncritical path activity, might be a possible solution. However, this scenario
lengthens the project by a total of eight days. Since Kate knows the primary constraint on
this project is quality, she's fairly sure she can get a buy-off from the project sponsor and
stakeholders on the later schedule date. She can also sell the resource-leveled schedule
as a low-risk option as opposed to assigning Stephen to all the activities and keeping
the project end date the same. Overallocating resources can cause burnout and stress-
related illnesses, which will ultimately have a negative impact on the project schedule.

Project Schedule
The purpose of the Develop Schedule process is to analyze most of the steps we've talked
about so far, including sequencing activities, determining their durations, considering sched-
ule constraints, and analyzing resource requirements. One of the primary outputs of this pro-
cess is the project schedule, which presents the start and finish dates for each of the project
activities, the duration of activities, dependencies among activities, milestones, and resources
in a project schedule model. Determining resource assignments occurs in the Acquire Project
Team process, and depending on the size and complexity of your project or your organiza-
tion's culture, this process might not be completed yet. If that's the case, the project schedule
is considered preliminary until the resources are assigned to the activities.


                  In PMBOK (R) Guide terms, the project schedule is considered preliminary
                  until resources are assigned. In reality, keep in mind that once you've pub-
                  lished the project schedule (even though it's in a preliminary state), some
                  stakeholders might regard it as the actual schedule and expect you to keep
                  to the dates shown. Use caution when publishing a schedule in its prelimi-
                  nary form.

    The project schedule should be approved by stakeholders and functional managers, who
should sign off on it. This assures you that they have read the schedule, understand the
dates and resource commitments, and will likely cooperate. You'll also need to obtain con-
fi rmation that resources will be available as outlined in the schedule when you're working
in a functional organization. The schedule cannot be fi nalized until you receive approval
and commitment for the resource assignments outlined in it.
    Once the schedule is approved, it will become your baseline for the remainder of
the project. Project progress and task completion will be monitored and tracked against the
project schedule to determine whether the project is on course as planned.



exam Spotlight

For the exam, remember that the project schedule is based on the timeline (derived from
the activity estimates we calculated earlier in this chapter), the scope document (to help
keep track of major milestones and deliverables), and resource plans. These plans are all
used as references when creating the schedule.



   According to the PMBOK(R) Guide, the schedule models are called presentations. You
can present the schedule in a variety of ways, some of which are variations on what you've
already seen. Project schedule network diagrams, like the ones discussed earlier, will
work as schedule diagrams when you add the start and fi nish dates to each activity. These
220        Chapter 4         Creating the Project Schedule



diagrams usually show the activity dependencies and critical path. Figure 4.6 shows a sam-
ple portion of a project schedule network diagram highlighting the programming activities.

    Gantt charts are easy to read and commonly used to display schedule activities.
Depending on the software you're using to produce the Gantt chart, it might also show
activity sequences, activity start and end dates, resource assignments, activity dependen-
cies, and the critical path. Figure 4.7 is a simple example that plots various activities against
time. These activities do not relate to the activities in the tables or other figures shown so
far. Gantt charts are also known as bar charts.

    Milestone charts are another way to depict schedule information. Milestones mark
the completion of major deliverables or some other key events in the project. For example,
                                                   Developing the Project Schedule         221




approval and sign-off on project deliverables might be considered a milestone. Other exam-
ples might be completion of a prototype, system testing, and contract approval.
   Milestone charts might show the key events and their start or completion dates in a bar
chart form similar to a Gantt chart. Or they can be written in a simple table format with
milestones listed in the rows and expected schedule dates in one column and actual comple-
tion dates in another, as shown in Table 4.3. As the milestones are met, the Actual Date
column is fi lled in. This information can be included with the project status reports.

                   Milestone charts are an ideal way to present information to the executive
                   team. They are high-level, easy to read, and to the point. Bar charts (or
                   Gantt charts) are great for presenting the schedule to the management
                   level. They have a bit more detail and are a quick way to see at a glance
                   what resources are required when.

Schedule Baseline
The schedule baseline is the final, approved version of the project schedule with baseline
start and baseline finish dates and resource assignments. The approved project schedule
becomes a part of the project management plan we talked about in Chapter 3 and, once ap-
proved, must follow change control procedures if changes are needed.
   As I've noted during discussions of some of the other Planning processes, project plan-
ning and project management are iterative processes. Rarely is anything cast in cement. You
will continue to revisit processes throughout the project to refi ne and adjust. Eventually,
processes do get put to bed. You wouldn't want to return to the Planning process at the
conclusion of the project, for example, but keep in mind that the Planning, Executing, and
Monitoring and Controlling process groups are iterative, and it's not unusual to have to
revisit processes within these process groups as you progress on the project.
222         Chapter 4      Creating the Project Schedule



   In practice, for small to medium-sized projects, you can complete Define Activities,
Sequence Activities, Estimate Activity Resources, Estimate Activity Durations, and Develop
Schedule at the same time with the aid of a project management software tool. You can
produce Gantt charts; you can produce the critical path, resource allocation, and activ-
ity dependencies; you can perform what-if analysis; and you can produce various reports
after plugging your scheduling information into most project management software tools.
Regardless of your methods, be certain to obtain sign-off on the project schedule and
provide your stakeholders and project sponsor with regular updates. Keep your schedule
handy--there will likely be changes and modifications as you go. While you're at it, be cer-
tain to save a schedule baseline for comparative purposes. Once you get into the Executing
and Monitoring and Controlling processes, you'll be able to compare what you planned to
do against what actually happened.

Schedule Data
The schedule data refers to documenting the supporting data for the schedule. The minimum
amount of information in this output includes the milestones, schedule activities and activity
attributes, and the assumptions and constraints regarding the schedule. You should docu-
ment any other information that doesn't necessarily fit into the other categories. Always err
on the side of too much documentation rather than not enough.
   You will have to be the judge of what other information to include here because it will
depend on the nature of the project. The PMBOK(R) Guide suggests that you might include
schedule contingencies, alternative schedules, cash-flow projections, and resource histo-
grams. Chapter 7, "Planning Project Resources," contains an example of a resource histo-
gram if you want to peek ahead. Resource histograms typically display hours needed on
one axis and period of time (days, weeks, months, years) on the other axis. You might also
include alternative schedules or contingency schedule reserves in the schedule data section.

Project Documents Updates
As with many of the other processes you've seen in this chapter, creating the project sched-
ule may require updates to the activity resource requirements document, activity attributes,
project calendars, resource calendars, change requests, and the risk register.




Project Case Study: New Kitchen Heaven Retail Store

You worked with the stakeholders to document the activity list last week. After creating
the first draft of the project schedule network diagram, you went back to each of them to
ask for time estimates for each of the activities. Ricardo's estimates are shown here:

1.    Procure the T1 connection. This takes 30 to 45 days. This activity can be done concur-
      rently with the other activities listed here. Ricardo will perform this activity.
                                                 Developing the Project Schedule                 223




2.   Run Ethernet cable throughout the building. This activity depends on the lease being
     signed and must finish before the build-out can start. The estimated time to com-
     plete is 16 hours, which was figured using parametric estimating techniques. Ricardo
     has one person on staff who can complete this specialized activity. His first available
     date is October 5.

3.   Purchase the router, switch, server, and rack for the equipment room and the four point-
     of-service terminals. Delivery time is two weeks. Ricardo will perform this activity.

4.   Install the router and test the connection. Testing depends on the T1 installation at
     demarcation. The time estimate to install is eight hours. Ricardo's staff will perform
     this activity.

5.   Install the switch. Based on past experience, the time estimate to install is two hours.
     Ricardo's staff will do this activity.

6.   Install the server and test. The testing depends on the T1 connection installation.
     Based on past experience, the time estimate to install is six hours. Ricardo's staff will
     do this activity.

7.   The web team will add the new store location and phone number to the lookup func-
     tion on the Internet site. The time estimate is two hours. Ricardo will assign his appli-
     cations programming manager to this activity. This activity depends on the lease
     being signed.

Jake and Jill have each written similar lists with estimates and potential resource assign-
ments. You begin to align all the activities in sequential order and discover a problem.
Jill needs 14 days to hire personnel and stock shelves, meaning that the build-out must
be finished by January 16. Build-out takes approximately 120 days and can't start before
September 20 because of the contractor's availability. This is a problem because Ricar-
do's Ethernet cable expert isn't available until October 5, and he needs 2 days to complete
the cabling. This pushes out the build-out start date by almost 2 weeks, which means the
project completion date, or store-opening date, is delayed by 2 weeks.

After gathering more information from Ricardo, you head to Dirk's office.

"So, Dirk," you conclude after filling him in on all the details, "we have two options. Hire
a contractor to perform the cable run since Ricardo's person isn't available or push the
store opening out by two weeks."

Dirk asks, "How much will the contractor charge to run the cable, and are they available
within the time frame you need?"

"Yes, they are available, and I've already requested that Ricardo book the week of Sep-
tember 18 to hold this option open for us. They've quoted a price of $10,000."

"Okay, let's bring in the contractor. At this point, $10,000 isn't going to break the budget.
How is that planning coming anyway? Signed a lease yet?"
224        Chapter 4      Creating the Project Schedule




"Yes, we've signed the lease. Jake has been meeting with Gomez Construction on the
build-out. We've used Gomez on three out of the last five new stores and have had good
luck with them."

You spend the next couple of days working on the project schedule in Microsoft Project,
clarifying tasks and activities with Jake, Ricardo, and Jill. You decide that a Gantt chart
will work excellently for reporting status for this project. You stare intensely at the prob-
lem you see on the screen. The Grand Opening task is scheduled to occur 13 days later
than when you need it! The grand opening must happen February 1 and 2, not February
14 and 15 as the schedule shows. You trace the problem back and see that the Grand
Opening task depends on Train Store Personnel, which itself depends on several other
tasks, including Hire Store Personnel and Install and Test Hardware. Digging deeper,
build-out can't begin until the Ethernet cable is run throughout the building. Ricardo
already set up the time with the contractor to run the cable on September 18. This date
cannot move, which means build-out cannot start any sooner than September 20, which
works with Gomez's availability.

You pick up the phone and dial Jake's number. "Jake," you say into the receiver, "I'm
working on the project schedule, and I have some issues with the Gomez activity."

"Shoot," Jake says.

"Gomez Construction can't start work until the Ethernet cable is run. I've already con-
firmed with Ricardo that there is no negotiation on this. Ricardo is hiring a contractor for
this activity, and the earliest they can start is September 18. It takes them two days to run
the cable, which puts the start date for build-out at September 20."

"What's the problem with the September 20 date?" Jake asks.

"Jill wants to have the build-out finished prior to hiring the store personnel. During the
last store opening, those activities overlapped, and she said it was unmanageable. She
wants to hire folks and have them stock the shelves in preparation for store opening but
doesn't want contractors in there while they're doing it. A September 20 start date for
Gomez puts us at a finish date of January 26, which is too late to give Jill time to hire and
stock shelves. My question is this: Is 120 days to finish a build-out a firm estimate?"

"Always--I've got this down to a science. Gomez has worked with me on enough of these
build-outs that we can come within just a couple of days of this estimate either way,"
Jake says.

You pick up your schedule detail and continue: "I've scheduled Gomez's resource cal-
endar as you told me originally. Gomez doesn't work Sundays, and neither do we. Their
holidays are Labor Day, a couple of days at Thanksgiving, Christmas, and New Year's, but
this puts us too far out on the schedule. Our February 1 opening must coincide with the
Home and Garden Show dates."
                                                  Developing the Project Schedule                225




"I can't change the 120 days. Sounds like you have a problem."

"I need to crash the schedule," you say. "What would the chances be of Gomez agreeing
to split the build-out tasks? We could hire a second contractor to come in and work along-
side Gomez's crew to speed up this task. That would shorten the duration to 100 days,
which means we could meet the February 1 date."

"Won't happen. I know Gomez. They're a big outfit and have all their own crews. We typi-
cally work with them exclusively. If I brought another contractor into the picture, I might
have a hard time negotiating any kind of favors with them later if we get into a bind."

"All right," you say. "How about this? I'm making some changes to the resource calendar
while we're talking. What if we authorize Gomez's crew to work six 10-hour days, which
still leaves them with Sundays off, and we ask them to work on Labor Day and take only
one day at Thanksgiving instead of two?"

"I think Gomez would go for that. You realize it's going to cost you?"

"Project management is all about trade-offs. We can't move the start date, so chances are
the budget might take a hit to accommodate schedule changes or risk. Fortunately, I'm
just now wrapping up the final funding requirements, so if you can get me the increased
cost from Gomez soon, I'd appreciate it. This change will keep us on track and resolve
Jill's issues too."

"I don't think Gomez's crew will mind the overtime during the holiday season. Everyone
can use a little extra cash at that time of year, it seems. I'll have the figures for you in a
day or two."

Understanding How This Applies to
Your Next Project
The schedule management plan documents how you will define, monitor, control, and
change the project schedule. It is the only output of the Plan Schedule Management pro-
cess. Define Activities and Sequence Activities are the first two processes in the "Activity"
sequence you'll complete on the road to Develop Schedule. You perform Estimate Activity
Resources to determine the resource requirements and quantity of resources needed for each
schedule activity. For small to medium-sized projects, I've found that you can perform this
process at the same time as the Estimate Activity Durations process. If you work in an or-
ganization where the same resource pool is used for project after project, you already know
the people's skills sets and availability, so you can perform this process at the same time
you're creating the project schedule. The same logic holds for projects where the material
resources are similar for every project you conduct. If you don't have the need to perform
this process, I recommend that you create a resource calendar at a minimum so that you can
note whether team members have extended vacations or family issues that could impact the
project schedule. Needless to say, if you're working on a large project or your project teams
are new for every project, you should perform the Estimate Activity Resources process rather
than combining it with Develop Schedule. It will come in handy later when you're ready to
plug names into the activities listed on the project schedule.
   Estimate Activity Durations is a process you'll perform for most projects on which you'll
work. For larger projects, I'm a big fan of PERT estimates. PERT gives you estimates with a
high degree of reliability, which are needed for projects that are critical to the organization,
projects that haven't been undertaken before, or projects that involve complex processes or
scope. It's easy to create a spreadsheet template to automatically calculate these estimates
for you. List your schedule activities in each row, and in the individual columns to the
right, record the most likely, pessimistic, and optimistic estimates. The final column can
hold the calculation to perform the weighted average of these three estimates, and you can
transfer the estimates to your schedule. You can easily add columns to calculate standard
deviation as well.
   In theory, if you've performed all the "Activity" processes, the schedule should almost
be a no-brainer. You can plug the activity list, resources, estimates, and successor and
                                                                           Summary                227




predecessor tasks into the schedule. From there, you will want to take the next step and
determine the critical path. The critical path is, well, critical to your project's success. If
you don't know which activities are on the critical path, you won't know what impacts
delays or risk events will have on the project. No matter how big or small the project, be
sure you know and understand the critical path activities.



Summary
Great job! You've made it through the Planning activities associated with the Project Sched-
ule Management Knowledge Area. I covered several processes in this chapter, including Plan
Schedule Management, Define Activities, Sequence Activities, Estimate Activity Resources,
Estimate Activity Durations, and Develop Schedule.
    Define Activities uses the scope baseline (which includes the project scope statement,
WBS, and WBS dictionary) to help derive activities. Activities are used to help derive a
basis for estimating and scheduling project work during the Planning processes and for
executing and monitoring and controlling the work of the project in later processes.
    The Sequence Activities process takes the activities and puts them in a logical, sequential
order based on dependencies. Dependencies exist when the current activity relies on some
action from a predecessor activity or it impacts a successor activity. Four types of depen-
dencies exist: mandatory, discretionary, external, and internal. PDM (also known as AON)
and ADM (also known as AOA) are two methods for displaying project schedule network
diagrams. PDM has four logical relationships, or dependencies: finish-to-start, start-to-
finish, finish-to-finish, and start-to-start.
    The Estimate Activity Resources process considers all the resources needed and the
quantity of resources needed to perform project activities. This information is determined
for each activity and is documented in the resource requirements output. Remember that
this process belongs to the Project Resource Management Knowledge Area.
    Duration estimates are produced as a result of the Estimate Activity Durations process.
Activity duration estimates document the number of work periods needed for each activ-
ity, including their elapsed time. Analogous estimating--also called top-down estimat-
ing or gross value estimating--is one way to determine activity duration estimates. You
can also use top-down techniques to estimate project durations and total project costs.
Parametric estimating techniques multiply a known element--such as the quantity of mate-
rials needed--by the time it takes to install or complete one unit of materials. The result is
a total estimate for the activity. Three-point estimates use two formulas to calculate esti-
mates, including triangular distributions (an average estimate based on the most likely esti-
mate, a pessimistic estimate, and an optimistic estimate) and beta distributions (the PERT
formula). Reserve analysis takes schedule risk into consideration by adding a percentage of
time or another work period to the estimate just in case you run into trouble.
    PERT calculates a weighted average estimate for each activity by using the optimistic,
pessimistic, and most likely times. It then determines variances, or standard deviations, to
228        Chapter 4      Creating the Project Schedule



come up with a total project duration within a given confidence range. Work will
finish within plus or minus one standard deviation 68.27 percent of the time. Work
will finish within plus or minus two standard deviations 95.45 percent of the time.
   Develop Schedule is the process in which you assign beginning and ending dates to
activities and determine their duration. You might use CPM to accomplish this. CPM cal-
culates early start, early finish, late start, and late finish dates. It also determines float time.
All tasks with zero float are critical path tasks. The critical path is the longest path of tasks
in the project.
   Schedules sometimes need to be compressed to meet promised dates or to shorten the
schedule times. Crashing looks at cost and schedule trade-offs. Adding resources to criti-
cal path tasks or approving over time are two ways to crash the schedule. Fast tracking
involves performing tasks (or phases) in parallel that were originally scheduled to start one
after the other. Crashing may change the critical path; fast tracking does not. Fast tracking
usually increases project risk. You can use Monte Carlo analysis, a what-if scenario tech-
nique, in the Develop Schedule process to determine multiple, probable project durations.
   Resource leveling is used when resources are overallocated and may create changes to
the critical path and project end date. Resource smoothing modifies activities within their
floats without changing the critical path or project end date.
   The project schedule presents the activities in graphical form through the use of project
schedule network diagrams with dates, Gantt charts, milestone charts, and project schedule
network diagrams.



Exam Essentials
Be able to describe the purpose of the Estimate Activity Resources process. The purpose of
Estimate Activity Resources is to determine the types of resources needed (human, equip-
ment, and materials) and in what quantities for each schedule activity within a work
package.
Be familiar with the tools and techniques of Estimate Activity Durations. The tools and
techniques of Estimate Activity Durations are expert judgment, analogous estimating, para-
metric estimating, three-point estimating, bottom-up estimating, data analysis (alternatives
analysis, reserve analysis) decision making, and meetings.
Know the difference between analogous estimating and bottom-up estimating. Analogous
estimating is a top-down technique that uses expert judgment and historical information.
Bottom-up estimating performs estimates for each work item and rolls them up to a total.
Be able to calculate the critical path. The critical path includes the activities with durations
that add up to the longest path of the project schedule network diagram. Critical path is
calculated using the forward pass, backward pass, and float calculations.
Be able to define a critical path task. A critical path task is a project activity with zero or
negative float.
                                                                   Exam Essentials           229




Be able to describe and calculate PERT duration estimates. This is a weighted average
technique that uses three estimates: optimistic, pessimistic, and most likely. The formula is as
follows: [optimistic + pessimistic + (4 x most likely)] / 6.
Be able to describe the difference between resource leveling and resource smoothing. Re-
source leveling can change the critical path and project end date. Resource smoothing does
not change the critical path or project end date.
Be familiar with the duration compression techniques. The duration compression tech-
niques are crashing and fast tracking.
Be able to describe a critical chain. The critical chain is the new critical path in a modified
schedule that accounts for limited resources and feeding buffers.
Know the key outputs of the Develop Schedule process. The key outputs are the project
schedule and schedule baseline.

                 Stakeholder management planning
                                Two of the most important documents you'll prepare for any
                                project are the project schedule and the project budget. You'll
                                use the schedule and budget documents throughout the Execut-
ing and Monitoring and Controlling processes to measure progress and determine if the
project is on track. I believe the budget is easier to prepare after the activities have been de-
fined and the resource estimates calculated. So now that we have the schedule in hand, we're
going to spend our time in this chapter developing the budget. We'll start with an overview
of the Project Cost Management Knowledge Area and then move into the budgeting process-
es. There are three processes we'll perform that will lead us to the cost baseline output. The
cost baseline is the authorized budget. The processes are Plan Cost Management, Estimate
Costs, and Determine Budget. We'll cover several tools and techniques in these processes that
you'll want to understand for the exam. Before we get into the details of the Estimate Costs
and Determine Budget processes, we'll talk about the cost management plan and its impor-
tance in guiding the development of the budget.
    Next, we'll talk about the stakeholder engagement plan, which documents stakeholder
interests and needs and their potential impacts to the project. We'll wrap up the chapter
by discussing how project information is documented and communicated. I've talked a
lot about documentation so far, and I will discuss it more in this chapter. Documentation
is something you will do throughout the remainder of the project, and the Plan
Communications Management process details how to collect information, how to store it,
and when and how to distribute it to stakeholders.


                  The process names, inputs, tools and techniques, and outputs and the
                  descriptions of the project management process groups and related
                  materials and figures in this chapter are based on content from A Guide
                  to the Project Management Body of Knowledge (PMBOK (R) Guide),
                  Sixth Edition (PMI(R), 2017).




Overview of the Project Cost
Management Knowledge Area
As you learned in Chapter 2, "Creating the Project Charter," activities in the Project Cost
Management Knowledge Area establish cost estimates for resources, establish budgets, and
keep watch over those costs to ensure that the project stays within the approved budget.
                   Overview of the Project Cost Management Knowledge Area                  237




The earlier you can develop and agree on the scope of the project, the earlier you can
estimate costs.



Exam Spotlight

Costs are more easily influenced early in the project. For this reason, it's essential
that you define scope as soon as possible so that you can estimate and influence
project costs.


   The primary focus for costs on most projects is resources. Resources, both human and
materials and supplies, are typically the most expensive elements of any project. That
doesn't mean you should not consider other costs such as support and maintenance costs,
for example, or other costs associated with maintaining the final product, service, or result
of the project. Doing so is imperative if you work in an organization that does budget plan-
ning months, if not years in advance. Be certain you add in ongoing support costs in your
budget requests.
   You'll use two techniques in this Knowledge Area to decide among alternatives and
improve the project process: life-cycle costing and value engineering. Please see Chapter 2 if
you need a refresher on these techniques.
   As we've discussed previously, it might be practical to combine processes in this
Knowledge Area for smaller projects. For example, you might determine cost estimates at
the same time you're developing the budget. You should tailor the processes to match proj-
ect complexity, your organizational culture, the knowledge base of both business and team
members, estimating and budgeting techniques used in your organization or PMO, and
whether your organization (or PMO) uses earned value management to manage
project costs.
   The project estimating techniques we'll cover in this chapter are not feasible or applica-
ble when using an Agile development methodology. You could certainly apply all that you'll
learn in this chapter, but generally on an Agile project, you want high-level, quick estimates
of costs due to the changing nature of the requirements and the project. You could get into
more detail for short-term planning, such as a release in a Kanban approach (which may
account for several iterations), but detailed planning any further out would have to be
repeated once you get to the next release.

Project costs are always a constraint on any project. Know and understand your stake-
holders' view of costs, how they are calculated, and when and how the costs are recog-
nized from an accounting perspective.
238        Chapter 5      Developing the Project Budget and Communicating the Plan




Creating the Cost Management Plan
You now have an exhaustive breakdown of project activities, and you have some pretty
good duration estimates. Now here's the question that's forever on the mind of the executive
management staff: How much is it going to cost? The purpose of the Estimate Costs process
is to answer that question.
    Every project has a budget, and part of completing a project successfully is completing it
within the approved budget. Sometimes project managers are not responsible for the bud-
get portion of the project. Instead, this function is assigned to a functional manager who
is responsible for tracking and reporting all the project costs. I believe project managers
will have more and more responsibility in this area as the project management discipline
evolves. Keep in mind that if you, as the project manager, don't have responsibility for the
project budget, your performance evaluation for the project should not include budget or
cost measurements.
    Before diving into the Estimate Costs and Determine Budget process particulars, you
should know that these processes are governed by a cost management plan that is created
when you perform the Plan Cost Management process. You should know a couple of facts
about this process and the plan for the exam.


Performing Plan Cost Management
The purpose of the Plan Cost Management process is to produce the cost management plan,
and we will look at that in detail in the next section. Stakeholders are almost always con-
cerned about costs. And remember that each of them, or the departments they represent,
may have a different perspective on the costs of the project, including accounting for costs at
different times in the project and in differing ways.
   Let's take a quick look at the inputs and tools and techniques of this process.
   This process has four inputs: project charter, project management plan (schedule man-
agement plan, risk management plan), enterprise environmental factors, and organizational
process assets. The PMBOK (R) Guide doesn't mention the scope statement as an input. In
reality, you'll also want to reference this document when developing the cost management
plan. Make certain all of your documents and the schedule baseline are accurate and kept
up-to-date.
   The tools and techniques of the Plan Cost Management process are expert judg-
ment, data analysis, and meetings. Data analysis, in the form of alternatives analysis, is
used to choose methods of funding (funding with debt or equity or using funds from the
project itself) and whether items should be leased or purchased.


Creating the Cost Management Plan
The only output of this process is the cost management plan. The cost management plan
establishes the policies and procedures you'll use to plan and execute project costs. It also

documents how you will estimate, manage, and control project costs. You will use docu-
ments such as the approved project charter, the project scope statement, the project sched-
ule, resource estimates, and the risk management plan to help in developing this plan and
managing project costs. Like all the other management plans, the cost management plan is a
subsidiary of the project management plan.
   According to the PMBOK (R) Guide, this plan includes, but is not limited to, the following
elements:
Level of Precision and Accuracy This refers to the precision level you'll use to round ac-
tivity estimates--for example, hundreds, thousands, and so on. Level of accuracy is based
on the scope and complexity of the activities and the project itself. It also describes the
acceptable ranges for establishing cost estimates (for example, plus or minus 5 percent).
Units of Measure This refers to the unit of measure you'll use to estimate resources--for
example, hours, days, weeks, or a lump sum amount.
Organizational Procedures Links In Chapter 3, "Developing the Project Scope Statement,"
we talked about the WBS and the identifiers associated with each component of the WBS.
These identifiers are called the code of accounts. A control account (CA) is a point where
several factors such as actual cost, schedule, and scope can be used to determine earned
value performance measures. (We'll talk more about earned value in Chapter 10, "Measur-
ing and Controlling Project Performance.") The control account is used in the Project Cost
Management Knowledge Area to monitor and control project costs. The control account is
typically associated with the work package level of the WBS, but control accounts could be
established at any level of the WBS. The control account also has a unique identifier that's
linked to the organization's accounting system, sometimes known as a chart of accounts.



Exam Spotlight

The cost management plan is established using the WBS and its associated control
accounts.



Control Thresholds Most actual project costs do not match the estimate exactly. The
control threshold refers to the amount of variance the sponsor or stakeholders are willing to
allow before action is required. Document the threshold amount as a percentage of deviation
allowed from the cost baseline.
Rules of Performance Measurement This component of the cost management plan refers
to how you will set the earned value management measurements. It's here you'll document
where the control accounts exist within the WBS, the earned value management (EVM)
techniques you'll use to measure performance, and the equations you'll use for calculating
estimate at completion (EAC) forecasts and other measurements.
Reporting Formats This refers to the types of cost reports you'll produce for this project
and how often they'll be created.
240        Chapter 5      Developing the Project Budget and Communicating the Plan



Additional Details This refers to any other information you might want to capture regard-
ing cost activities, including items such as who will perform the cost activities, how a cost is
recorded, and a description of the funding alternatives and choices used for the project.
   The key to determining accurate cost estimates (and accurate time estimates as you dis-
covered in Chapter 4, "Creating the Project Schedule") is the WBS. Next, we'll look at how
to determine cost estimates for the WBS components.



Estimating Costs
The Estimate Costs process develops a cost estimate for the resources (human and material)
required for each schedule activity. This includes weighing alternative options and examining
risks and trade-offs. Some alternatives you may consider are make-versus-buy, buy-versus-
lease, and sharing of resources across either projects or departments.
    Let's look at an example of trade-offs. Many times software development projects take
on a life of their own. The requested project completion dates are unrealistic; however, the
project team commits to completing the project on time and on budget anyway. How do
they do this? They do this by cutting things such as design, analysis, and documentation.
In the end, the project might get completed on time and on budget, but was it really? For
example, the costs associated with the extended support period, because of a lack of design
and documentation and the hours needed by the software programmers to fi x the reported
bugs, weren't included in the original cost of the project (but they should have been).
Therefore, the costs actually exceed what was budgeted. You should examine trade-offs
such as these when determining cost estimates.
    When you are determining cost estimates, be certain to include all the costs required
to complete the work of the project over its entire life cycle. Additionally, the project team
should take into consideration the costs of ongoing support or recurring costs such as
maintenance, support, and service costs after the project is complete. As in the preceding
example, software projects often have warranty periods that guarantee bug fi xes or prob-
lem resolution within a certain time frame. After the warranty period expires, you move
into the yearly maintenance and support period. These costs are typically calculated as a
percentage of the total software cost. The management team should be made aware that
these costs will continue to recur for the length of time the customer owns the software.
It's also good practice to understand these costs prior to making go/no-go project decisions.


                  Don't confuse pricing with Estimate Costs. If you are working for a com-
                  pany that performs consulting services on contract, for example, the price
                  you will charge for your services is not the same as the costs to perform
                  the project. The costs are centered on the resources needed to produce
                  the product, service, or result of the project. The price your company
                  might charge for the service includes not only these costs but a profit
                  margin as well.
                                                                  Estimating Costs            241




Estimate Costs Inputs
Many of the inputs of the Estimate Costs process are already familiar to you. We talked
about the cost management plan earlier in this chapter. We'll look briefly at the other inputs
next so you can see the key elements that should be considered when creating the project
budget. The inputs to this process are as follows:
    Project management plan (cost management plan, quality management plan,
    scope baseline)
    Project documents (lessons learned register, project schedule, resource requirements,
    risk register)
    Enterprise environmental factors
    Organizational process assets

Scope Baseline
It's pop quiz time. Do you remember the elements of the scope baseline? They are the
project scope statement, the WBS, and the WBS dictionary. You'll want to consider a few
key elements from the project scope statement in this process, including key deliverables,
constraints, assumptions, and acceptance criteria. I can safely say that every project I've
ever worked on had a limited budget, which is a classic example of a project constraint. You
should also understand other constraints that have the potential to impact costs, such as re-
quired delivery dates or availability of resources. Project assumptions regarding costs might
include whether to include indirect costs in the project estimate. We'll talk more about this in
the section "Determine Budget Inputs" later in this chapter.
    The WBS, as we've discussed, serves as the basis for estimating costs. It contains all
the project deliverables and the control accounts that are typically established at the work
package level (but can be assigned to any level of the WBS). The WBS dictionary describes
the deliverables, work components, and other elements of the WBS.
    When you're considering deliverables, think about those that may have contractual obli-
gations that should be considered when determining cost estimates. Perhaps you have deliv-
erables that have legal or governmental regulations that will require additional expenses to
fulfill. Health, safety, security, licenses, performance, intellectual property rights, and envi-
ronmental factors are some of the other elements of the scope baseline you should consider
when estimating costs, according to the PMBOK (R) Guide.



Exam Spotlight

Scope definition is a key component of determining the estimated costs and should be
completed as early in the project as possible because it's easier to influence costs in the
beginning phases of the project. But you can't influence costs if you don't understand the
project scope.

Project Schedule
We determined the types and quantities of resources we needed in Chapter 4 using the Esti-
mate Activity Resources (this process is closely associated with the Estimate Costs process,
according to the PMBOK (R) Guide) and Estimate Activity Durations processes. Resource
requirements and duration estimates are the key outputs you should consider when
estimating costs.
    Be aware that duration estimates can affect costs. For example, you must account for
costs such as interest charges when you're financing the work of the project. Also consider
fluctuations in costs that can occur due to seasonal or holiday demands or collective bar-
gaining agreements. Watch for duration estimates that are calculated for resources who are
scheduled to work for a per-unit period of time. These duration estimates can be incorrect
(not too far off, you hope) and can end up costing you more. For example, I recently bought
a new home requiring a move of about eight miles. The moving company told me that the
work was performed on a per-hour basis. The person providing the estimate assured me he
had been doing this for over 25 years and his estimates were typically right on the money.
Unfortunately, I swallowed that line and the estimate I was given was wildly incorrect.
It took them almost twice the amount of time I was quoted, and you guessed it, the total
ended up being almost twice the original estimate.

Risk Register
The risk register is an output of the Identify Risks process that we'll discuss in Chapter 6,
"Risk Planning." When developing project cost estimates, you should consider the cost of
implementing risk response plans (identified in the risk register), particularly those with
negative impacts to the project. Generally, negative risk events that occur early in the project
are more costly than those that occur later in the project.

Enterprise Environmental Factors
According to the PMBOK (R) Guide, the enterprise environmental factors you should consider
in this process are market conditions, published commercial information, and exchange rates
and inflation. Market conditions help you understand the materials, goods, and services
available in the market and what terms and conditions exist to procure those resources.
Published commercial information refers to resource cost rates. You can obtain these rates
from commercial databases or published seller price lists. Currency exchange rates can work
to the organization's benefit...or not.

Organizational Process Assets
The organizational process assets considered in the process are similar to those we've seen
before. Historical information and lessons learned on previous projects of similar scope and
complexity can be useful in determining estimates for the current project--particularly if
the past projects occurred recently. Your organization's business office or PMO may also
have cost estimating templates you can use to help with this process and/or cost estimating
                                                                  Estimating Costs         243




policies that you should consider. You could use cost-estimating worksheets from past proj-
ects as templates for the current project as well.


Tools and Techniques to Estimate Costs
The Estimate Costs process has eight tools and techniques used to derive estimates:
    Expert judgment
    Analogous estimating
    Parametric estimating
    Bottom-up estimating
    Three-point estimating
    Data analysis (alternatives analysis, reserve analysis, cost of quality)
    Project management information system
    Decision making (voting)
   I covered expert judgment, analogous estimating, parametric estimating, three-point
estimating, reserve analysis, and decision-making techniques in previous chapters. The
majority of these are also tools and techniques of the Estimate Activity Durations process
used to help determine schedule estimates. All of the information we discussed in Chapter
4 applies here as well, except you're using the tools and techniques to derive cost estimates.
Three-point estimates (triangular distribution, a simple averaging or weighted averaging,
and beta distribution [PERT] formulas) are used in this process when you want to improve
your estimates and account for risk and estimation uncertainty. In the case of reserve
analysis, you're adding cost reserves (or contingencies), not schedule reserves, during this
process. Contingency reserves, like schedule reserves, might be calculated for the whole
project, one or more activities, or both and may be calculated as a percentage of the cost
or as a fixed amount. Contingency reserves are used for known-unknown risk or issues
that may impact the project. The risk is known, but the consequences are unknown. And
as with the schedule reserve, you should add contingency reserves to the cost baseline but
should not add management reserves to the cost baseline. Management reserves are consid-
ered a part of the project budget. You could aggregate these cost contingencies and assign
them to a schedule activity or a WBS work package level. As more information becomes
known further into the project, you may be able to reduce the contingency reserves, turn
them back to the organization, or eliminate them altogether.
   The project management information system can help you quickly determine estimates
given different variables and alternatives. Some systems are quite sophisticated and use sim-
ulation and statistical techniques to determine estimates, whereas others are less complex.
A simple spreadsheet program can do the trick much of the time. We'll look at the remain-
ing tools and techniques next.
244        Chapter 5       Developing the Project Budget and Communicating the Plan




Exam Spotlight

According to the PMBOK (R) Guide, if the Project Cost Management Knowledge Area
includes predicting the potential financial performance of the product of the project, or if
the project is a capital facilities project, you may also use additional tools and techniques
in the process, such as return on investment, discounted cash flow, and payback period.
We talked about these techniques in Chapter 2.



Bottom-Up Estimating
You learned about this technique in Chapter 4, but there are a few pointers to consider for
this process. This technique estimates costs associated with every activity individually and
then rolls them up to derive a total project cost estimate. You wouldn't choose this technique
to provide a cost estimate for the project during Initiating if one were requested because you
don't have enough information at that stage to use it. Instead, use the top-down estimating
technique (analogous estimating) when a project cost estimate is needed early in the project
selection stage. Bottom-up estimating will generally provide you with the most accurate cost
estimates, but it is the most time-consuming estimating technique of all those mentioned
here. However, the size and complexity of the project impacts the accuracy you can achieve
using this technique.

Cost of Quality
The cost of quality (COQ) is the total cost to produce the product or service of the project
according to the quality standards. Cost of quality is a topic that we will cover when we look
at the quality topics in more depth in later chapters. For this process, understand that quality
is not free and you will need to include cost of quality estimates in your final project budget.



Exam Spotlight

For the exam, make sure you're familiar with all the Estimate Costs tools and techniques,
their benefits, and under what conditions you use them.



Estimate Costs Process Outputs
The primary output of the Estimate Costs process is cost estimates. These are quantitative
amounts--usually stated in monetary units--that reflect the cost of the resources needed
to complete the project activities. The tools and techniques I just described help you de-
rive these estimates. Resources in this case include human resources, material, equipment,
services, information technology needs, facilities, leases, rentals, exchange rates (if it applies),
financing and/or interest costs (if it applies), and so on, as well as any contingency reserve
amounts and inflation factors (if you're using them).
                                                                Estimating Costs             245




    Estimates should be updated throughout the course of the project as more information
comes to light. Estimates are performed at a given period of time with a limited amount of
information. As more information becomes available, your cost estimates, and therefore
your overall project estimate, will become more accurate and should be updated to reflect
this new information. According to the PMBOK (R) Guide, the accuracy of estimates during
the Initiating phase of a project have a rough order of magnitude (ROM) of -25% to +75%,
and as more information becomes available over the course of the project, the definitive
estimate moves to a range of -5% to +10%.
    The remaining outputs of the Estimate Costs process are the basis of estimates and proj-
ect documents updates. The basis of estimates is the supporting detail for the activity cost
estimates and includes any information that describes how the estimates were developed,
what assumptions were made during the Estimate Costs process, and any other details you
think are needed. According to the PMBOK (R) Guide, the basis of estimates should include
at least the following:
    A description of how the estimate was developed or the basis for the estimate
    A description of the assumptions made about the estimates or the method used to
    determine them
    A description of the constraints
    A description of risks regarding cost estimating
    A range of possible results. You should state the cost estimates within ranges such as
    $5,000  10%.

This Older House

Janie is an accomplished project manager. She and her husband recently purchased an
80-year-old home in need of several repairs and modern updates. She decided to put her
project management skills to work on the house project. First, they hired a general con-
tractor to oversee all the individual projects needed to bring the house up-to-date. Janie
worked with the general contractor to construct a WBS, and she ended up with 23 work
packages. With each work package (or multiple work packages in some cases) assigned
to a subcontractor, it was easy to track who was responsible for completing the work and
for determining duration estimates. Janie and the general contractor worked together to
determine schedule dependencies and make certain the work was performed in the cor-
rect order and that each subcontractor knew when their activity was to begin and end.

Some of the cost estimates for certain work packages were easy to determine using the
parametric estimating method. Others required expert judgment and the experience of
the general contractor (analogous techniques) to determine a cost estimate. Resource
246        Chapter 5      Developing the Project Budget and Communicating the Plan




rates for laborers for some of the work packages were agreed to when the subcontractors
bid on the work. Once Janie had all the cost estimates, she used the bottom-up estimat-
ing technique to come up with an overall cost estimate for the project. She added a con-
tingency reserve in addition to the overall estimate for unforeseen risk events.


   The last output of this process is project documents updates. Cost variances will occur
and estimates will be refi ned as you get further into your project. As a result, new assump-
tions or constraints may come to light so you'll need to update the assumption log. The
lessons learned register should be updated with the techniques you used to develop cost
estimates for this project, and the risk register may also require an update after cost esti-
mates are complete.
   Estimate Costs uses several techniques to make an accurate assessment of the project
costs. In practice, using a combination of techniques is your best bet to come up with the
most reliable cost estimates. The cost estimates will become an input to the Determine
Budget process, which allows you to establish a baseline for project costs to track against.



Establishing the Cost Baseline
The next process involves determining the authorized cost baseline, which is the primary
output of the Determine Budget process. The Determine Budget process aggregates the cost
estimates of activities and establishes a cost baseline for the project that is used to measure
performance of the project throughout the remaining process groups. Only the costs associ-
ated with the project become part of the authorized project budget. For example, future pe-
riod operating costs are not project costs and therefore aren't included in the project budget.
    The cost baseline is the total expected cost for the project. According to the PMBOK (R)
Guide, the cost baseline is a time-phased budget, and it must be approved by the project
sponsor (and key stakeholders if appropriate for your project). As discussed earlier, the cost
baseline does not include management reserves. And if the cost baseline is not approved,
it is not valid. When you're using earned value management techniques to measure project
performance, the cost baseline is also known as the performance measurement baseline
(PMB). We'll talk about budget at completion and earned value management techniques
in detail in Chapter 11, "Controlling Work Results." Remember that costs are tied to the
fi nancial system through the chart of accounts--or code of accounts--and are assigned to
project activities at the work package level or to control accounts at various points in the
WBS. The budget will be used as a plan for allocating costs to project activities.


                  As I've discussed with several other processes, in practice you can some-
                  times perform the Estimate Costs and Determine Budget processes at the
                  same time.
                                                   Establishing the Cost Baseline               247




Determine Budget Inputs
Outputs from other Planning processes, including the Create WBS, Develop Schedule, and
Estimate Costs processes, must be completed prior to working on Determine Budget because
some of their outputs become the inputs to this process. The inputs for Determine Budget are
as follows:
Project Management Plan (Cost Management Plan, Resource Management Plan, Scope
Baseline) The cost management plan documents how the project costs will be developed,
managed, and controlled throughout the project. The resource management plan documents
how the resources will be defined, staffed, managed and controlled, and released from the
project when their work is completed. The scope baseline includes the project scope statement,
the WBS, and the WBS dictionary. The scope statement describes the constraints of the project
you should consider when developing the budget. The WBS shows how the project deliverables
are related to their components, and the work package level typically contains control account
information (although control accounts can be assigned at any level of the WBS).
Project Documents (Basis of Estimates, Cost Estimates, Project Schedule, Risk Register)
The basis of estimates and cost estimates are outputs of the Estimate Costs process. Cost
estimates are determined for each activity within a work package and then summed to deter-
mine the total estimate for a work package. The basis of estimates contains all the support-
ing detail regarding the estimates. You should consider assumptions regarding indirect costs
and whether they will be included in the project budget. Indirect costs cannot be directly
linked to any one project. They are allocated among several projects, usually within the de-
partment or division in which the project is being performed. Indirect costs can include items
like building leases, management and administrative salaries (those not directly assigned
full time to a specific project), and so on. The project schedule contains information that is
helpful in developing the budget, such as start and end dates for activities, milestones, and
so on. Based on the information in the schedule, you can determine budget expenditures for
calendar periods.
The risk register contains a list of risks that could occur on the project. Risks with a high
impact and/or high probability of occurring will likely have response plans that could add
costs to the project, so you should review them before preparing the budget.
Business Documents (Business Case, Benefits Management Plan) The business case docu-
ments the reason the project came about, the critical success factors, and financial factors
such as cost-benefit analysis. The benefits management plan outlines the benefits to the
organization if they undertake the project, including financial benefits, and when they will be
realized.
Agreements Agreements include cost information for purchased goods or services that you
should include in the overall project budget.
Enterprise Environmental Factors The EEFs you should consider in this process are cur-
rency exchange rates and fluctuations in currency rates over time if the project is a multiyear
project.

Organizational Process Assets The organizational process assets that will assist you with
the work of this process include cost budgeting tools, the policies and procedures your
organization (or PMO) may have regarding budgeting exercises, historical information and
lessons learned, and reporting methods.


Determine Budget Tools and Techniques
The Determine Budget process has six tools and techniques, including two you haven't
seen before:
      Expert judgment
      Cost aggregation
      Data analysis (reserve analysis)
      Historical information review
      Funding limit reconciliation
      Financing
   I've covered expert judgment previously. Let's look at the remaining tools and
techniques.
Cost Aggregation Cost aggregation is the process of tallying the activity cost estimates
at the work package level and then totaling the work package levels to higher-level WBS
component levels (such as the control accounts). Then all of the costs can be aggregated to
obtain a total project cost.
Data Analysis (Reserve Analysis) We talked about reserve analysis in the "Performing Plan
Cost Management" section of this chapter. Reserve analysis works the same for the Deter-
mine Budget process. Contingency costs are considered and included in the aggregation of
control accounts for both activity cost estimates and work package estimates. Management
reserves are not included as part of the cost baseline (an output of this process) but should
be included in the project budget. Management reserves are also not considered when calcu-
lating earned value measurements.


                   Reserve analysis should also contain appropriations for risk responses. I'll
                   talk about several categories and tools of Plan Risk Responses in Chapter
                   6. Additionally, you'll want to set aside money for management reserves
                   for unknown risks. This is for the unforeseen, unplanned risks that might
                   occur. Even with all the time and effort you spend on planning, unexpected
                   issues do crop up. It's better to have the money set aside and not need it
                   than to need it and not have it.

Historical Information Review Analogous estimates and parametric estimates can be used
to help determine total project costs. Remember from Chapter 4 that analogous estimates
are a form of expert judgment. Actual costs from previous projects of similar size, scope,
                                                   Establishing the Cost Baseline            249




and complexity are used to estimate the costs for the current project. This is helpful when
detailed information about the project is not available or it's early in the project phases and
not much information is known.
Parametric estimates are quantitatively based and, for example, multiply the amount of time
needed to perform an activity by the resource rate to determine total cost. Quantifiable mea-
sures used with the parametric method are easily defined and are easily scalable from large
to small projects. Analogous and parametric estimating techniques are more accurate when
the historical data you're using is accurate.
Funding Limit Reconciliation Funding limit reconciliation involves reconciling the amount
of funds to be spent with the amount of funds budgeted for the project. The organization
or the customer sets these limits. Reconciling the project expenses will require adjusting the
schedule so that the expenses can be smoothed. You do this by placing imposed date con-
straints (I talked about these in the Develop Schedule process in Chapter 4) on work pack-
ages or other WBS components in the project schedule.
Financing This refers to obtaining funding for the project and taking into account how
that funding will be tracked, reported, and used throughout the project. For example, it's
common for state governments to obtain funding for a project from the federal government
in the form of grants, transportation funds, healthcare funds, and so on. Those federal funds
come with pretty steep accounting and reporting requirements. If the agency fails to adhere
to those requirements, or it spends the money on items other than those intended to fulfill
the objectives of the project, they face the loss of future funding and may also have to pay
back the funds already granted.


Determine Budget Process Outputs
The goal of Determine Budget is to develop a cost baseline (an output of this process) for
the project that you can use in the Executing and Monitoring and Controlling processes to
measure performance. You now have all the information you need to create the cost baseline.
In addition, you'll establish the project funding requirements.
   The following are the outputs of the Determine Budget process:
    Cost baseline
    Project funding requirements
    Project documents updates (cost estimates, project schedule, risk register)
   We've covered the project documents updates in other processes. For Determine Budget,
you may need to update the risk register, cost estimates, and/or the project schedule. Let's
look at the other two outputs next.

Documenting the Cost Baseline
You develop the cost baseline, the first output of Determine Budget, by aggregating the costs
of the WBS work packages, including contingency reserves, into control accounts. All the
250        Chapter 5      Developing the Project Budget and Communicating the Plan



control accounts are then aggregated, and together they make up the cost baseline. Most
projects span some length of time, and most organizations time the release of funding with
the project. In other words, you won't get all the funds for the project at the beginning of
the project; they'll likely be disbursed over time. The cost baseline provides the basis for
measurement, over time, of the expected cash flows (or funding disbursements) against
the requirements, including contingency reserves. This is also known as the project's
time-phased budget.


                   Management reserves are part of the project budget, but they are not
                   included in the cost baseline.

   The project budget consists of several components: the activity costs plus contingency
reserves (these are aggregated to the work package level), the work package costs plus
contingency reserves (these are aggregated to the control accounts), and the management
reserves for the cost baseline.
   Figure 5.1 depicts all of the elements contained in the project budget.

   Cost baselines can be displayed graphically, with time increments on one axis and
dollars expended on the other axis, as shown in Figure 5.2 . The costs shown on this graph
are cumulative costs, meaning that what you spent this period is added to what was spent
last period and then charted. Many variations of this graph exist showing dollars budgeted
against dollars expended to date and so on. Cost budgets can be displayed using this type
of graph as well, by plotting the sum of the estimated costs expected per period.

   The cost baseline should contain the costs for all of the expected work on the project.
You would have identified these costs in the Estimate Costs process. You'll find most proj-
ects' largest expense is resource costs (as in labor and materials costs). In the case of projects
where you're purchasing the final product, the purchase price is the largest cost.



exam spotlight

For the exam, remember that cost baselines are displayed as an S curve. The reason for
this is that project spending starts out slowly, gradually increases over the project's life
until it reaches a peak, and then tapers off again as the project wraps up. Large projects
are difficult to graph in this manner because the timescale isn't wide enough to accu-
rately show fluctuations in spending. Also remember that the cost baseline does not
include management reserves but the project budget does include them.




                  Large projects might have more than one cost baseline. For example, you
                  might be required to track human resources costs, material costs, and con-
                  tractor costs separately.

  You'll revisit the cost baseline when you learn about the Control Costs process and
examine different ways to measure costs in Chapter 10.
252          Chapter 5      Developing the Project Budget and Communicating the Plan



Gathering the Project Funding Requirements
Project funding requirements describe the need for funding over the course of the project,
and they are derived from the cost baseline. Funding for a project is not usually released all
at once. Some organizations may release funds monthly, quarterly, or in annual increments
or other increments that are appropriate for your project.
   As I said earlier, spending usually starts out slowly on the project and picks up speed as
you progress. Sometimes, the expected cash flows don't match the pace of spending. Project
funding requirements account for this by releasing funds in increments based on the cost
baseline plus management reserves that may be needed for unanticipated events. Figure 5.3
shows the cost baseline, the funding requirements, and the actual expenses plotted on the
S curve. You can see in this figure that actual costs have exceeded the authorized cost base-
line. The difference between the funding requirements and the cost baseline at the end of
the project is the management reserve.

   We've now completed two critical components of the project management plan: the
project schedule and the project budget. Several times throughout the book I've mentioned
the need for documenting, publishing, and communicating project information. As you can
imagine, the PMBOK (R) Guide has a process for communications. We'll discuss it next.



Understanding Stakeholders
The Plan Stakeholder Engagement process (a part of the Project Stakeholder Management
Knowledge Area) focuses on effectively engaging stakeholders, understanding their needs
and interests, understanding the good and bad things they might bring to the project, and
                                                    Understanding Stakeholders              253




recognizing how the project will impact them. The only output of this process is the stake-
holder engagement plan, which documents all of the items I just mentioned.
   Stakeholder management is almost a full-time job. Stakeholders are a diverse group
with their own personalities, interests, expectations, and more. It is critical to the success
of the project that you, as the project manager, understand all of the key stakeholders'
needs and devise a plan to engage them in the project and manage their expectations. In
my experience, the most successful projects are those where the key stakeholders and I have
established a strong, professional relationship. That means we trust each other, are able to
ask questions, and can discuss constructive alternative ideas without feeling threatened. It
also means that I often need to put myself in their shoes and understand how the project
impacts them and their departments and devise ways to work together to meet their day-to-
day needs while also completing the work of the project.
   Stakeholder involvement will vary as the project progresses. I make it a point to meet
with the key stakeholders as early in the project as possible. Their involvement early on is
important because you'll need them to make decisions about scope, budgets, and timelines
and, more important, to help smooth the way and remove obstacles that are impeding
progress. As the work gets under way and the project progresses, their involvement may
lessen, but it's important to note that their continued engagement, even on a limited level, is
critical to the success of the project.



Exam Spotlight

For the exam, remember that stakeholder involvement must occur throughout the life of
the project and is a critical success factor for overall project success.


   We have seen most of the inputs to this process before. They are project charter, project
management plan (resource management plan, communications management plan, risk
management plan), project documents (assumption log, change log, issue log, project sched-
ule, risk register, stakeholder register), agreements, enterprise environmental factors, and
organizational process assets. We'll cover the communications management plan later in
this chapter, and the risk management plan in Chapter 6.
   Next we'll take a look at the tools and techniques of this process.


Analyzing Stakeholders
There are several tools and techniques of this process: expert judgment, data gathering
(benchmarking), data analysis (assumption and constraint analysis, root cause analysis
[RCA]), decision making (prioritization/ranking), data representation (mind mapping, stake-
holder engagement assessment matrix), and meetings.
   Expert judgment, as you recall, means meeting with others who know something about
the project. In this case, that likely includes senior managers, key stakeholders, other
project managers who have worked with your key stakeholders in the past, consultants,
254          Chapter 5      Developing the Project Budget and Communicating the Plan



industry experts, and more. We've covered benchmarking previously, and assumption and
constraint analysis should be self-explanatory.
   Root cause analysis in this process refers to understanding your stakeholders at a level that
you can ensure they are engaged and involved and you can choose the optimal strategy to
maintain their engagement throughout the project. The 5 Why's questioning technique we will
discuss in Chapter 6, "Risk Planning" is a great technique in determining root cause analysis.
   Decision making in the form of prioritization and ranking is used to understand stake-
holder requirements and rank them according to their needs. You will also use this tool
and technique to rank the stakeholders themselves. Typically, the project sponsor holds the
number one ranking among stakeholders, followed by those stakeholders with the most
influence on the project, and so on in descending order.
   Data representation techniques allow you to classify the engagement levels of your
stakeholders and monitor and modify them throughout the project. According to the
PMBOK (R) Guide, there are five levels of classifications of stakeholder engagement:
Unaware Stakeholders are not engaged in the project.
Resistant Stakeholders are not supportive of the project and may actively resist engaging.
Neutral Stakeholders are neither supporting nor resisting the project and may be minimally
engaged.
Supportive    Stakeholders have positive expectations of the project and are supportive and
engaged.
Leading Stakeholders are actively engaged in the project and helping to ensure its success.
   The purpose behind the classification is to document what levels of engagement your
stakeholders are at during each phase of the project. It helps you to plan what levels are
needed for coming phases and to create action plans for those stakeholders who are not
at the desired level of engagement for the given phase of the project. There are a couple
of methods you can use to determine engagement. Mind mapping diagrams are simple
to construct; each branch of the mind map represents a stakeholder and their interests
and engagement levels. You might construct a simple spreadsheet like the one shown in
Table 5.1 to indicate and document the level of engagement of each stakeholder. Or, you
could hold meetings with groups of stakeholders, or one-on-one, to determine levels of
engagement.

Stakeholder Engagement Plan
The only output of this process is the stakeholder engagement plan. This plan documents
the engagement levels of stakeholders (the stakeholder engagement table we talked about
in the last section gets documented here). According to the PMBOK (R) Guide, the following
elements are among those that might be a part of this plan and include but are not limited to
the following:
    Relationships between and among stakeholders
    Communication requirements for stakeholders engaged in the current phase of the
    project
    Details regarding the distribution of information, such as the language of the various
    stakeholders, the format of the information, and the level of detail needed
    Reasons for distributing the information, including how the stakeholders may react
    and/or the potential for changing their level of engagement
    Timing of the information distributions and their frequency
    The process for updating and modifying the stakeholder engagement plan due to the
    changing needs of the stakeholders and changes as the project progresses
   The stakeholder engagement plan is a subsidiary of the project management plan.



Exam Spotlight

For the exam, remember that the stakeholder engagement plan documents the engage-
ment level of the stakeholders and is also used to manage stakeholders' expectations and
engage them in project decisions. To create this plan, you will work with them to analyze
their needs and interests and to understand the potential impacts each one of them could
have on the project.




Overview of the Project Communication
Management Knowledge Area
Communication is critically important on your project, and poor (or limited) communica-
tion is a common reason projects struggle to succeed. It is the mechanism you use to convey
information to your project team, stakeholders, and contractors. It involves providing proj-
ect status, alerting others to risks, and well, you get the picture.
   A few key points are in order in this section to frame up communications throughout the
project. First, communication should be clear, concise, and tailored to the audience so that
they can understand the message you are sending. Things like spelling and grammar do
256        Chapter 5      Developing the Project Budget and Communicating the Plan



make a difference (thank you to language teachers everywhere!). Remember that your team
may consist of members from other countries and cultures. For example, English is usually
the common language utilized when there are team members from multiple countries on
the project. If your grammar is awkward and you are not phrasing your requests properly,
someone who is reading (or listening) who is not a native English speaker could misinter-
pret your message. This scenario is equally true for whatever language you're using as the
native language for the project, so be clear, concise, and accurate in your use of language.
    Another pet peeve--I mean pointer for clear communications--is logical progres-
sion and flow. I have in the past worked with team members who are all over the place in
describing a problem or issue, and I find I have to ask several clarifying questions to get to
the root of the issue. Start at the beginning and progress through the message in a logical
manner so that one fact unfolds from another.
    Common courtesy applies here as it does to much of life. Be polite, don't interrupt others
when they're talking, listen actively and intently (instead of formulating your response in
your head before the other person has finished her thought), and follow up with clarifying
questions or an indication of some sort that you heard them speak and you understand.
    Considerations for tailoring communication and the communication processes include
geographic locations of your team members, stakeholders' relationship to the project
(including those external to the organization), the technology you'll use to perform commu-
nications, and the language you'll use as the standard for the project.
    Communication in Agile environments typically occurs more frequently due to the
nature of how the Agile process works. The product owner is involved in every iteration
and typically up to speed on the status of the project and the upcoming work for the next
iteration. If your project is conducted in a waterfall or hybrid methodology, practice com-
municating as though you were using an Agile approach. It's better to over-communicate
than not communicate enough--although there is a fine line, which we'll talk about when
we discuss the communication processes throughout the remainder of the book.



Communicating the Plan
I've talked a good deal about documentation so far, and this topic will continue to come
up throughout the remainder of the book. "Is that documented?" should be an ever-present
question on the mind of the project manager. Documentation can save your bacon, so
to speak, later in the project. Documentation is only one side of the equation, though--
communication is the other. You and your stakeholders need to know who gets what
information and when.
   The Plan Communications Management process involves determining the communica-
tion needs of the stakeholders by defining the types of information needed, the format for
communicating the information, how often it's distributed, and who prepares it. All of
this is documented in the communications management plan, which is an output of this
process.
                                                         Communicating the Plan             257




                  Pop quiz: Do you remember where else the communications management
                  plan belongs? I'll give you the answer later in the section "Plan Communi-
                  cations Management Outputs."


Plan Communications Management Inputs
The inputs to the Plan Communications Management process will look familiar to you. They
are as follows:
    Project charter
    Project management plan (resource management plan, stakeholder engagement plan)
    Project documents (requirements documentation, stakeholder register)
    Enterprise environmental factors
    Organizational process assets
   You'll recall that the project management plan defi nes how the subsidiary plans will be
defi ned and integrated into the overall project management plan. As such, it's rich with
constraints and assumptions that you should review as they pertain to stakeholder commu-
nication needs.
   The PMBOK (R) Guide notes that all the elements described in the enterprise environ-
mental factors and in the organizational process assets influence this process. Enterprise
environmental factors include personnel administration, stakeholder risk thresholds,
established communication channels, geographic locations, and organization culture.
Take special note of the lessons learned and historical information elements of the orga-
nizational process assets input. Information you learn as you're progressing through the
project is documented as lessons learned. This information is helpful for future projects
of similar scope and complexity. Historical information is also useful to review when
starting the Plan Communications Management process. Either of these documents might
contain information about communication decisions on past projects and their results.
Why reinvent the wheel? If something didn't work well on a past project, you'd want to
know that before implementing that procedure on this project, so review past project
documentation.



exam spotlight

The PMBOK (R) Guide notes that there is a difference between effective and efficient
communication. Effective communication refers to providing the information in the
right format for the intended audience at the right time. Efficient communication refers
to providing the appropriate information at the right time--that is, only the information
that's needed at the time.
258         Chapter 5      Developing the Project Budget and Communicating the Plan




Tools and Techniques for Plan Communications
Management
The Plan Communications Management process concerns defining and documenting the
types of information you're going to deliver, the format it will take, to whom it will be
delivered, and when. The process consists of eight tools and techniques to help determine
these elements: expert judgment, communication requirements analysis, communication
technology, communication models, communication methods, interpersonal team skills
(communication styles assessment, political awareness, cultural awareness), data representa-
tion (stakeholder engagement assessment matrix), and meetings. Expert judgment in this
process involves using people who have special skills or knowledge of the political climate of
the organization, its culture and customers, change management practices, communications
technologies within the organization, industry knowledge regarding the project outcomes,
and other stakeholders. Data representation refers to the stakeholder engagement assessment
matrix that we discussed earlier in this chapter. Meetings, the last tool and technique of this
process, are used to help gather information to determine the communication needs of the
stakeholders and other information for the communications management plan. We'll look at
the remainder of the tools and techniques for this process next.

Communications Requirements Analysis
Communications requirements analysis involves analyzing and determining the communica-
tion needs of the project stakeholders. According to the PMBOK (R) Guide, you can examine
several sources of information to help determine these needs, including the following:
      Company and departmental organizational charts
      Stakeholder responsibility relationships
      Other departments and business units involved in the project
      The number of resources involved on the project and where they're located in relation
      to project activities
      The number of communication channels
      Internal needs that the organization may need to know about the project
      Development approach used on the project (Agile, waterfall, or hybrid)
      Legal requirements
      External needs that organizations such as the media, government, or industry groups
      might have that require communication updates
      Stakeholder information, including communication needs, engagement levels, and more
      (This was documented in the stakeholder register, an output of Identify Stakeholders,
      and the stakeholder engagement plan, the output of the Plan Stakeholder Engagement
      process.)
   This tool and technique requires an analysis of the items in the preceding list to make cer-
tain you're communicating information that's valuable to the stakeholders. Communicating
                                                          Communicating the Plan             259




valuable information doesn't mean you always paint a rosy picture. Communications to
stakeholders might consist of either good or bad news--the point is that you don't want to
bury stakeholders in too much information but you want to give them enough so that they're
informed and can make appropriate decisions.
   Project communication will always involve more than one person, even on the tiniest of
projects. As such, communication network models have been devised to explain the rela-
tionships between people and the number or type of interactions needed between project
participants. What you need to remember for the exam is that network models consist of
nodes with lines connecting the nodes that indicate the number of communication chan-
nels, also known as lines of communication. Figure 5.4 shows an example of a network
communication model with six participants and 15 channels of communication.

Figure 5.4        Network communication model



                                          1


                           6                              2




                           5                              3


                                          4


                       Nodes = Participants
                       Lines = Lines of Communication between Participants

   The nodes are the participants, and the lines show the connections between them all.
You'll need to know how to calculate the number of communication channels when you
take the exam. You could draw them out as in this example and count up the lines, but
there's an easier way. The formula for calculating the lines of communication is as follows:
[number of participants x (number of participants less 1)] divided by 2.
   Here's the calculation in mathematical terms:
                                          n (n - 1)/2
   Figure 5.4 shows six participants, so let's plug that into the formula to determine the
lines of communication:
                                        6(6 - 1)/2 = 15
260        Chapter 5      Developing the Project Budget and Communicating the Plan




Exam Spotlight

I recommend you memorize the communications channel formula before taking
the exam.




Stakeholder Relationships

Bill is an information technology manager working on an enterprise resource planning
project. He's one of the key stakeholders on this project. Bill reports to the CIO, who in
turn reports to the executive vice president, who also happens to be the project spon-
sor. Bill is close friends with the human resources director but doesn't get along so well
with the accounting department director. This project requires heavy involvement from
the accounting department and medium-level involvement from the human resources
department.

You are the project manager for this project and are new to the organization. You know
Bill's relationship with both the accounting and human resources directors. What you
don't know is the relationship the two directors have with each other. Because all three
stakeholders are key to the success of this project, it's important that all three communi-
cate with you as well as with each other. You set up an interview with each of these stake-
holders to determine several pieces of information: other departments that might need to
be involved on the project, stakeholder communication needs and timing, external needs,
timing of status updates for the company newsletter, and other department members
aside from the stakeholders who need to be involved in the project. You also plant a few
surreptitious questions that will give you insight into the relationships the stakeholders
have with each other and with the project sponsor.

You discover that the human resources and accounting directors have known each other
for several years and worked together at another organization prior to coming to work
here. This tells you that if you can get one of them to buy in on project decisions, the
other will likely follow suit. They both have the utmost respect for Bill and his technical
capabilities, even though the accounting director doesn't care for his abrupt, direct com-
munication style. You also learn that although they both have respect for the position of
the executive vice president, they don't believe the person filling that role is competent
to do the job. They question his decision-making ability--or lack thereof--and warn you
that you need to write down his answers and direction so that he doesn't change his story
halfway through the project. Although you won't formally document this valuable piece
of information, you'll definitely put it into action right away.
                                                       Communicating the Plan            261




Communication Technology
The second tool and technique of this process is communication technology. This examines
the methods (or technology) used to communicate the information to, from, and among the
stakeholders. Methods of communicating can take many forms, such as written, spoken,
email, formal status reports, meetings, online databases, online schedules, and so on.
This tool and technique examines the technology elements that might affect project
communications.
    You should consider several factors before deciding what methods you'll choose to trans-
fer information. The timing of the information exchange or need for updates is the first
factor. The availability of the technology you're planning on using to communicate project
information is important as well. Do you need to procure new technology or systems, or
are systems already in place that will work? Staff experience with the technology is another
factor. Are the project team members and stakeholders experienced at using this technol-
ogy, or will you need to train them? Consider the duration of the project and the project
environment. Will the technology you're choosing work throughout the life of the project,
or will it have to be upgraded or updated at some point? How does the project team func-
tion? Are the members located together or spread out across several campuses or locations?
Is the information you're distributing confidential or sensitive in nature? If so, consider
what security measures should be put in place to protect the information and ensure that it
is delivered only to the intended recipients.
    The answers to these questions should be documented in the communications manage-
ment plan output.

Communication Models
Communication models depict how information is transmitted from the sender and how it's
received by the receiver. According to the PMBOK (R) Guide, a basic sender/receiver communi-
cation model includes the following key components:
    Encode
    Transmit
    Decode
   Encoding the message simply means putting the information or your thoughts or ideas
into a language that the receiver will understand. The message is the result, or output, of
the encoding.
   The sender transmits the message using any number of methods, including written, oral,
email, and so on. Barriers can exist that compromise this information, such as cultural dif-
ferences, distance the message must travel, technology used to transmit and receive, and
more. Any barrier, including those just mentioned, that keeps the message from being either
transmitted or understood is called noise.
   Decode is performed by the receiver, and it refers to translating the information that
was sent.
262        Chapter 5      Developing the Project Budget and Communicating the Plan



   An interactive communication model includes all of the elements just described plus two
more: acknowledge, and feedback/response.
   Acknowledge is when the receiver lets the sender know they have received the message.
This is not an indication of agreement.
   Last but not least, feedback/response is provided after the receiver has decoded the
original message. Then, the receiver encodes their response and sends it back to the sender,
starting the cycle all over again.
   The sender is responsible for encoding the message, transmitting the message, and
decoding the feedback message. They are also responsible for making certain the informa-
tion is clear and complete, and they should ensure the receiver understands the information.
The receiver is responsible for decoding the original message from the sender, ensuring they
understand the message, and encoding and sending the feedback message.
   Many factors will influence how messages are encoded, received, and understood. These
factors include age, culture, nationality, and ethnicity, among others. It's the responsibil-
ity of both the sender and receiver to make certain the information is communicated in a
way that both parties understand it and so that the information is clear and interpreted
accurately.

Communication Methods
Communication methods refer to how the project information is shared among the stake-
holders. According to the PMBOK (R) Guide, there are three classifications of communication
methods. We'll briefly look at each of them:
Interactive Communication Interactive communication involves multidirectional commu-
nication where two or more parties must exchange thoughts or ideas. This method includes
videoconferencing, phone or conference calls, meetings, and so on.
Push Communications Push communications is one way and refers to sending information
to intended receivers. It includes methods such as letters, memos, reports, emails, voicemails,
and so on. This method ensures that the communication but the sender is responsible for
ensuring it was received and understood by the intended receivers.
Pull Communications This is the opposite of push communications. The likely recipients of
the information access the information themselves using methods such as websites, e-learn-
ing sites, knowledge repositories, shared network drives, and so on.
   There are many methods you can use to communicate, including in person in a face-
to-face setting (or on the telephone); in small groups; using a speaker to communicate to
an audience of people; using mass communication methods such as newsletters, media,
reports, and other publications; using network methods such as instant messaging, email,
and videos; or using social networks.


                  We'll discuss communication models and communication methods
                  in more detail in Chapter 9, "Conducting Procurements and Sharing
                  Information."
                                                         Communicating the Plan              263




Interpersonal and Team Skills
We've seen this tool and technique in other processes. In the Plan Communications Man-
agement process, you should consider the communication styles of your stakeholders and
team members, the political environment of your organization, and the culture of your
organization.
    When assessing your stakeholders for the stakeholder register you created earlier, you
could easily add information regarding their communication styles and their preferred
method of communication. Some stakeholders like email, whereas some detest it and prefer
to use the phone. Make note of these preferences so that when you need to contact that
stakeholder, particularly when you need their support on an issue, you use their preferred
method of communication.
    As we've discussed before, it's important that the project manager understands the
stakeholder's position in the organization in terms of the power and influence they exercise
(or in other words, political awareness). You may have stakeholders who are one level down
(or more) in a functional hierarchy who actually have more power and influence than more
senior managers or those higher up the org chart.
    The culture of every organization is unique. Some examples of organizational culture
that I've worked under include autocratic where the big boss makes the decision and there
is no discussion. You step up and salute and make things happen. I've also worked in orga-
nizations that have a culture of democracy where decisions are made by committee. All
the senior leaders provide their input on the project or issue, each get an equal say in the
outcome, and decisions are made by consensus. This, in my opinion, is often a difficult
culture to work in. There is also a hybrid between these two extremes where a small hand-
ful of key executives, rather than one person at the top, have the power and authority to
make decisions. Perhaps they seek input and consider other opinions before making the
decision, but they have the authority to say "go" and set things in motion. Again, you must
understand the culture of your organization so you can navigate effectively and communi-
cate appropriately.


Plan Communications Management Outputs
There are three outputs to the Plan Communications Management process. They are the
communications management plan, project management plan updates, and project docu-
ments updates. The project management plan updates that may be required as a result of
performing this process is the stakeholder engagement plan. The project documents updates
might include the project schedule and the stakeholder register. Let's take a closer look at the
details of the communications management plan.
   All projects require sound communication plans, but not all projects will have the same
types of communication or the same methods for distributing the information. The
communications management plan documents the types of information needs the stakeholders
have, when the information should be distributed, how the information will be delivered,
and how communications will be monitored and controlled throughout the project. This
plan is developed by taking the organizational structure (we talked about this in Chapter 1
264         Chapter 5      Developing the Project Budget and Communicating the Plan



"What Is a Project?") and stakeholder requirements into consideration. The answer to the
pop quiz posed earlier in this chapter is that the communications management plan is a
subsidiary plan of the project management plan discussed in Chapter 3.


                   According to the PMBOK (R) Guide, the communications management plan
                   defines how communications will be formulated, executed, and monitored
                   for effectiveness throughout the project.

   The type of information you will typically communicate includes project status, project
scope statements and scope statement updates, project baseline information, risks, action
items, performance measures, deliverables acceptance, and so on. What's important to
know for this process is that the information needs of the stakeholders should be deter-
mined as early in the Planning process group as possible so that as you and your team
develop project planning documents; you already know who should receive copies of them
and how they should be delivered.
   According to the PMBOK (R) Guide, the communications management plan typically
describes the following elements:
      The communication requirements of each stakeholder or stakeholder group
      Purpose for communication
      Frequency of communications, including time frames for distribution
      Escalation process
      Name of the person responsible for communicating information along with the person
      responsible for authorizing the communication and the recipients
      Format of the communication and method of transmission
      Method for updating the communications management plan
      Flowcharts
      Glossary of common terms
      Constraints that might impact communication such as legislation, technology, or
      organizational policies


                   I've included only some of the most important elements of the communi-
                   cations management plan in the list of elements for it. I recommend you
                   review the entire list in the PMBOK (R) Guide .

   The information that will be shared with stakeholders and the distribution methods are
based on the needs of the stakeholders, the project complexity, and the organizational poli-
cies. Some communications might be informal--a chat by the coffeemaker, for instance--
whereas other communications are more formal and are kept with the project fi les for later
reference. The communications management plan may also include guidelines for conduct-
ing status meetings, team meetings, and so on.
                                                          Communicating the Plan                265




   You might consider setting up an intranet site for your project and posting the appro-
priate project documentation there for the stakeholders to access anytime they want. If
you use this method, be sure to document it in the communications management plan and
notify your stakeholders when updates or new communications are posted.



Exam Spotlight

For the exam, know that the communications management plan documents how the
communication needs of the stakeholders will be met, including the types of informa-
tion that will be communicated, who will communicate it, who receives the communi-
cation, the methods used to communicate, the timing and frequency, the method for
updating this plan as the project progresses, the escalation process, and a glossary of
common terms.




Project Case Study: New Kitchen Heaven Retail Store

After creating the first draft of the project schedule network diagram, you went back to
each stakeholder to ask for cost estimates for each of the activities. Ricardo's estimates
are shown here with the activities he gave you last time:

1.   Procure the T1 connection. This takes 30 to 45 days and will have ongoing costs of
     $3,000 per month. Procurement costs are covered in the monthly expense.

2.   Run Ethernet cable throughout the building. The estimated time to complete
     is 16 hours at $100 per hour, which was figured using parametric estimating
     techniques.

3.   Purchase the router, switch, server, and rack for the equipment room and four point-
     of-service terminals. The estimated costs are $17,000.

4.   Install the router and test the connection. Testing depends on the T1 installation at
     demarcation. The time estimate to install is eight hours. Ricardo's staff will perform
     this activity at an average estimated cost of $78 per hour.

5.   Install the switch. Based on past experience, the time estimate to install is two hours.
     Ricardo's staff will perform this activity at an average estimated cost of $78 per hour.

6.   Install the server and test. Based on past experience, the estimate to install is
     six hours at $84 per hour.

7.   The web team will add the new store location and phone number to the lookup func-
     tion on the Internet site. The time estimate is two hours at $96 per hour.

Jake and Jill have each written similar lists with time and cost estimates. Using this infor-
mation, you create the activity cost estimates and are careful to document the basis of
estimates. The following list includes some of the information you document in the basis
of estimates:

      Ricardo's use of parametric estimates for his cost estimates
      Jake's use of both analogous and parametric estimating techniques
      Jill's use of reserve analysis to include contingencies for unplanned changes involv-
      ing vendor deliveries
      Assumptions made about vendor deliveries and availability of the T1 and assump-
      tions made regarding when lease payments begin
      The range of possible estimates is stated as plus or minus 10 percent.

You also document the cost management plan and the cost baseline along with the proj-
ect funding requirements. Since this project will occur fairly quickly, only two funding
requirement periods are needed.

The stakeholder engagement plan is written and describes the relationships between the
stakeholders, their communication requirements, and the format, reasons, and timing of
the distribution of information.

The communications management plan is also complete, and you've asked the key stake-
holder to review it before posting it to the intranet site for the project. You want to make
certain you've identified stakeholder communication needs, the method of communica-
tion, and the frequency with which communications will occur.

Understanding How This Applies
to Your Next Project
In a previous job working in state government, I had to perform the Plan Cost Management
and Estimate Costs processes rather early in the project because of the long procurement
cycle. Our cost management plan (the policies and procedures used to plan and execute
project costs) was set in legislation and government rulings, so there wasn't a lot of flexibility
around this process in my situation. The way our funding request process worked is that I
had to have an estimated cost for the project before I could request funding. If funding was
approved, the project was approved. If I was not awarded funding, the project died and we
moved on to the next one.
   I rely on expert judgment and parametric estimating techniques to determine activity
and total project costs. I often engage vendors and my own project team to help determine
the costs. When I have a large project that must go out for bid, I have a well-defined scope
and some idea of schedule dates and overall costs, but I won't complete the schedule until
after the contract is awarded. In an ideal world, I would prefer to create the schedule prior
to determining cost estimates and budgets...but we don't live in an ideal world and some-
times Planning processes have to be performed out of order.
   The authorized project budget becomes one of the key measurements of project success.
In a later chapter, we'll talk about monitoring the budget to determine whether we're track-
ing with our estimates.
   I generally create a stakeholder engagement plan and a communications management
plan together as one document (I call it a communications plan). The reason for this is that
the stakeholder engagement plan contains a lot of information about communication needs,
timing, distribution methods, distribution formats, and so on. I find it easier to keep this
information together in one plan. This plan is a must-have for every project. I can't stress
268        Chapter 5      Developing the Project Budget and Communicating the Plan



enough how often I've seen the root cause of project issues end up being communication
problems. Never assume keeping the stakeholders informed or engaged is an easy job. Even
if you know the stakeholders well, always create a communication plan. Document how
you'll communicate status, baseline information, risks, and deliverables acceptance. That
way, there's no question as to how information will be relayed, who's going to receive it, or
when it will be delivered.



Summary
The cost management plan is the only output of the Plan Cost Management process. This
documents the policies and procedures you'll use to plan and execute project costs as well
as how you will estimate, manage, and control project costs. The Estimate Costs process
determines how much the project resources will cost, and these costs are usually stated in
monetary amounts. Some of the techniques used specifically for estimating costs are analo-
gous estimating, parametric estimating, bottom-up estimating, three-point estimates, and
reserve analysis. You can also use bottom-up estimating for total project cost estimates. This
involves estimating the cost of each activity and then rolling these up to come up with a total
work package cost. The primary outputs of this process include the cost estimates and the
basis of estimates that details all the support information related to the estimates.
    The tools and techniques of the Determine Budget process include cost aggregation, data
analysis (reserve analysis), expert judgment, historical information review, funding limit
reconciliation, and financing. These tools together help you produce the final, authorized
project budget known as the cost baseline, which is an output of this process. You will use
the cost baseline throughout the remainder of the project to measure project expenditures,
variances, and project performance. The cost baseline is graphically displayed as an S
curve.
    The cost baseline is also known as a performance measurement baseline (PMB) when
you're calculating earned value management formulas. PMBs are management controls
that should change only infrequently. Examples of the performance measurement baselines
you've looked at so far are the scope, schedule, and cost baselines. The completed project
plan itself also becomes a baseline. If changes in scope or schedule do occur after Planning
is complete, you should go through a formalized process to implement the changes.
    The Plan Stakeholder Engagement process focuses on effectively engaging stakeholders,
understanding their needs and interests, understanding the good and bad things they might
bring to the project, and understanding how the project will impact them. The primary
output of this process is the stakeholder engagement plan.
    The purpose of the communications management plan is to determine and document
the communication needs of the stakeholders by defining the types of information needed, the
format for communicating the information, how often it's distributed, and who prepares it.
This plan is a subsidiary plan of the project management plan and is created in the Plan
Communications Management process.

Exam Essentials
Be able to state the purpose of the cost management plan. The cost management plan is the
only output of the Plan Cost Management process. It establishes policies and procedures for
planning and executing project costs and documents the processes for estimating, managing,
and controlling project costs.
Be able to identify and describe the primary output of the Estimate Costs process. Cost
estimates are the primary output of Estimate Costs. These estimates are quantitative
amounts--usually stated in monetary units--that reflect the cost of the resources needed to
complete the project activities.
Be familiar with the tools and techniques of the Estimate Costs process. The tools and
techniques of Estimate Costs are expert judgment, analogous estimating, parametric estimat-
ing, bottom-up estimating, three-point estimating, data analysis (alternatives analysis, reserve
analysis, cost of quality), project management information system, and decision making
(voting).
Be able to identify additional general management techniques that can be used in the Project
Cost Management Knowledge Area. Some of the general management techniques that can
be used in this Knowledge Area are return on investment, discounted cash flow, and payback
analysis.
Know the tools and techniques of the Determine Budget process. The tools and techniques
of Determine Budget are cost aggregation, data analysis (reserve analysis), expert judgment,
historical information review, funding limit reconciliation, and financing.
Be able to describe the cost baseline. The cost baseline is the authorized, time-phased cost
of the project when using budget-at-completion calculations. The cost baseline is displayed
as an S curve.
Be able to describe project funding requirements. Project funding requirements are one
output of the Determine Budget process. They detail the funding requirements needed on the
project by time period (monthly, quarterly, annually).
Be able to describe the purpose of the Plan Stakeholder Engagement process. The Plan
Stakeholder Engagement process concerns effectively engaging stakeholders, understand-
ing their needs and interests, understanding how they may help or hurt the project, and
understanding how the project will impact them. The primary output of this process is the
stakeholder engagement plan.
Be able to describe the primary purpose of the stakeholder engagement plan. The stake-
holder engagement plan documents engagement levels of the stakeholders.
Be able to describe the purpose of the communications management plan. The communica-
tions management plan determines the communication needs of the stakeholders. It docu-
ments what information will be distributed, how it will be distributed, to whom, and the
timing of the distribution.

                  Sixth Edition (PMI(R), 2017).




Planning for Risks
Every one of us takes risks on a daily basis. Just getting out of bed in the morning is a risk.
You might stub your toe in the dark on the way to the light switch or trip over the dog and
break a leg. These events don't usually happen, but the possibility exists. The same is true
for your project. Risk exists on all projects, and the potential that a particular risk event will
occur depends on the nature of the risk.
   Risk, like most of the elements of the other Planning processes, changes as the project
progresses and should be monitored throughout the project. As you get close to a risk
event, that's the time to reassess your original assumptions about it and your plans to deal
with it and make any adjustments as required.
   Not all risks are bad. Risks can present future opportunities as well as future threats
to a project. Risk events may occur due to one reason or several reasons, and they may
have multiple impacts. All risks have causes, and if the risk event occurs during a project,
there are consequences. Those consequences will likely impact one or more of the project
objectives, and you'll need to know whether the consequences have positive or negative
impacts.
                    Overview of the Project Risk Management Knowledge Area                      277




   Risk is, after all, uncertainty. The more you know about risks and their impacts before-
hand, the better equipped you will be to handle a risk event when it occurs. The processes
that involve risk, probably more than any other project Planning process, concern balance.
You want to find that point where you and the stakeholders are comfortable with the risk
based on the benefits you can potentially gain. In a nutshell, you're balancing the action of
taking a risk against avoiding the consequences or impacts of a risk event or enjoying the
benefits it may bring. The rest of this chapter will deal with finding out what risk events
might occur (and how to deal with risks that are unknown), determining an organization's
threshold for risk taking, and developing action plans for risks you've determined have
hefty impacts. The first step is performing the Plan Risk Management process. Here, you
determine the approach you'll use for risk management activities and document your plans
for them in a risk management plan. You'll look at that process now.



Exam Spotlight

According to the PMBOK (R) Guide, once a negative risk event occurs, it's considered an
issue and is no longer a risk.




Overview of the Project Risk
Management Knowledge Area
Risk is inherent on all projects. The Project Risk Management Knowledge Area is concerned
with identifying the risks to the project; analyzing, ranking, and prioritizing them; develop-
ing response plans to deal with the risk should it occur; and monitoring and controlling
risks throughout the project. Time and again I've seen projects fail because the project team
did not take the time to perform the risk processes. Ignoring the potential for risks will not
make them go away. Take the time to identify and analyze risks so that you are prepared. It
is also important that the project manager and project team be on the lookout for potential
risks throughout the project life cycle. These processes should be repeated in all phases of
the project life cycle. As you get closer to the end of the project, the likelihood of a risk event
occurring lessens, but you should still be watching for them.
    Risks may come about as an individual event (or individual risk), or the project itself as
a whole could present a risk due to the uncertain nature of the project outcome. Failing to
address individual or project risks could cause financial loss, damage the organization's
reputation, extend the project timeline, or have any number of other unpleasant outcomes.
    Most of the processes outlined in this Knowledge Area tend to focus on individual risks,
but you should keep in mind the overall project risk as well. Your organization might be
taking on more than it can accomplish, or the complexity of the project is such that your
organization doesn't have resources with skills or experience to perform the project. This
278        Chapter 6      Risk Planning



could cause negative impacts to the organization and should be considered when undertak-
ing the project.
    You'll need to tailor the risk processes according to the size, complexity, and importance
of the project, as well as for the development life cycle you're using to manage the project.
For example, if you're using an Agile life-cycle approach, you'll need to perform the risk
planning processes at the beginning of every iteration. This exercise will be quicker and
more condensed than performing the same processes in a waterfall life-cycle approach. The
changing nature of an Agile project means you will have to make certain that knowledge is
shared across the team. That way, team members understand risks and risk impacts so that
they can be managed during each iteration. It also means you can easily update the require-
ments and adapt them as necessary to account for risks during each iteration.
    In the waterfall approach, you will spend much more time identifying and analyzing
risks during the Planning process group up front, attempting to identify everything pos-
sible, good or bad, that could occur on the project. This will be repeated throughout the
life of the project but not to the initial extent you will go through in the Planning pro-
cess group.



Planning Your Risk Management
Risks come about for many reasons. Some are internal to the project, and some are external.
The project environment, the planning process, the project management process, inadequate
resources, and so on can all contribute to risk. Some risks you'll know about in advance and
plan for during this process; other risk events will occur unannounced during the project.
The Plan Risk Management process determines how you'll prepare for and perform risk
management activities on your project.



Exam Spotlight

The PMBOK (R) Guide contends that the Plan Risk Management process should begin as
soon as the project begins, and it should be concluded early in the Planning processes. It
may need to be updated or repeated if the scope of the project changes dramatically and/
or you are starting a new phase of the project. The risk management plan, the only output
of this process, ensures that the appropriate amount of resources and the appropriate
time are dedicated to risk management. "Appropriate" is determined based on the levels,
the importance, and the types of risks. The most important function the risk management
plan serves is that it's an agreed-upon baseline for evaluating project risk.


   To document the risk management plan, you need to gather some inputs that will help
you determine your organization's risk policies and threshold for risk. You'll look at those
inputs next.
                                                 Planning Your Risk Management               279




Plan Risk Management Inputs
Risks associated with a project are generally concerned with any number and combination
of four project objectives--time, cost, scope, and quality. As you might have guessed, the
project management plan is an input to this process, and it includes the scope statement,
which describes your project deliverables. The inputs of this process are as follows:
    Project charter
    Project management plan (any component)
    Project documents (stakeholder register)
    Enterprise environmental factors
    Organizational process assets
   The risk attitude of the organization and the stakeholders is a key element of the enter-
prise environmental factors input. Risk attitude consists of two elements:
Risk Appetite Risk appetite is the level of uncertainty the stakeholders are willing to accept
in exchange for the potential positive impacts of the risk. For example, let's say your organi-
zation is a multinational manufacturing firm that is implementing a new inventory system.
The end users are grumbling and have expressed their concerns for the new system. The old
system does everything they want it to do, and they are not interested in this new technol-
ogy. There is a potential for the represented employees to protest this new system, and such
a reaction could impact production. Your stakeholders are willing to accept this risk even
though they don't know if, or to what extent, production may be impacted because the ben-
efits of the new system far outweigh the potential unknown impacts of employees protesting.
Risk Threshold Risk thresholds are measures or levels of uncertainty or impact the organi-
zation is willing to operate within. For example, a monetary risk threshold might state if the
risk poses a threat that could cost more than 5 percent of the total project budget, the risk
should not be accepted. If it's below 5 percent, it may be accepted.
Risk threshold is that balance I talked about earlier where stakeholders are comfortable
taking a risk because the known benefits to be gained outweigh what could be lost--or just
the opposite. They will avoid taking a risk because the cost or impact is too great given the
amount of benefit that can be derived. Here's an example to describe risk threshold: Suppose
you're a 275-pound brute who's surrounded by three bodyguards of equal proportion ev-
erywhere you go. Chances are, walking down a dark alley in the middle of the night doesn't
faze you in the least. That means your risk threshold for this activity is high. However, if
you're a petite 90-pounder without the benefit of bodyguards or karate lessons, performing
this same activity might give you cause for concern. Your risk threshold is low, meaning you
wouldn't likely do this activity. The higher your threshold for risk, the more you're willing to
take on risk and its consequences.
    Risk threshold is different from risk appetite because risk appetite concerns the amount
of uncertainty you are willing to take on to gain a benefit, whereas risk threshold concerns
the amount of risk, and hence the potential consequences or benefits you might gain or lose
if the risk event occurs.
280         Chapter 6      Risk Planning




                   Organizations and stakeholders, as well as individuals, all have different
                   thresholds for risk. One organization might believe that the risk of a
                   potential 7 percent cost overrun is high, whereas another might think it's
                   low. However, either one of these organizations might decide to accept
                   the risk if it believes the risk is in balance with the potential rewards. It's
                   important for the project manager to understand the threshold level that
                   the organization and the stakeholders have for risk before evaluating and
                   ranking risk.

   Remember that organizational process assets include policies and guidelines that might
already exist in the organization. Your organization's risk categories, risk statement for-
mats, and risk templates should be considered when planning for risks. Also, when devel-
oping the risk management plan, consider the defi ned roles and responsibilities and the
authority levels the stakeholders and project manager have for making decisions regarding
risk planning.
   The project management plan includes all of the subsidiary plans and baselines for
the project. This is the first place you'll start looking when identifying risks, and it should
be considered when determining the process you'll use to evaluate risks. The risk manage-
ment plan (the only output of this process) will also become part of the project
management plan.


Tools and Techniques for Plan Risk Management
The Plan Risk Management process has three tools and techniques: expert judgment, data
analysis (stakeholder analysis), and meetings.
   Data analysis in the form of stakeholder analysis in this case involves understanding
stakeholder risk appetites and thresholds, developing a method for scoring risks, and deter-
mining the risk exposure of the project. We will cover these topics in more depth through-
out the remainder of this chapter.
   The purpose of meetings--which are held with project team members, stakeholders,
functional managers, and others who might have involvement in the risk management
process--is to contribute to the risk management plan. During these meetings, the funda-
mental plans for performing risk management activities will be discussed and determined
and then documented in the risk management plan.
   The key outcomes of performing these planning meetings are as follows:
      Risk cost elements are developed for inclusion in the project budget.
      Schedule activities associated with risk are developed for inclusion in the project
      schedule.
      Risk responsibilities are assigned.
      The risk contingency reserve process is established or reviewed.
      Templates for risk categories are defined or modified for this project.
                                                 Planning Your Risk Management                281



    Definitions of terms (probability, impact, risk types, risk levels, and so on) are
    developed and documented.
    The probability and impact matrix is defined or modified for this project.


                  I'll discuss risk responsibilities, define the terms associated with risk
                  management, and help you construct your own probability and impact
                  matrix in the remaining sections of this chapter.




do we need a Risk Management Plan?

Julia is the project manager for a small project her department is undertaking. The proj-
ect objective is to give customers the ability to take virtual tours of the properties her
organization has listed for lease. Two programmers from the information technology
department will be working on the updates to the website, programming the links for
the tours, and so on. The project sponsor wants to fast-track this project. She'd like to
skip most of the Planning processes, and she sees no need for a risk management plan.
Julia explains to the sponsor that the risk management plan for a project this size might
be only a paragraph or two long. She emphasizes the importance of documenting how
they'll identify risks, how they'll quantify them, and how they'll monitor the risks as the
project progresses. Julia has project management experience on projects of all sizes
and knows firsthand that ignoring this step could bring some unexpected surprises to
the sponsor later in the project. She explains a bad past experience where this step was
ignored and then assures the sponsor that they can probably agree to the plan, identify
and quantify the risks, and determine response plans in an hour and a half or less. The
sponsor now understands the issues and agrees to the meeting.


   Ultimately, your goal for this process is documenting the risk management plan. This
document is the basis for understanding the remaining risk processes. Because the risk
management plan encompasses a wealth of information, I've given this topic its own
section. Let's get to it.


Creating the Risk Management Plan
The purpose of the Plan Risk Management process is to create a risk management plan,
which describes how you will define, monitor, and control risks throughout the project.
This involves identifying risks, analyzing and prioritizing them, and developing risk response
strategies so that you can manage both uncertainty and opportunity throughout the life of
the project. The risk management plan is a subsidiary of the project management plan, and
it's the only output of this process.
282         Chapter 6      Risk Planning



   The risk management plan details how risk management processes (including Identify
Risks, Perform Qualitative Risk Analysis, Perform Quantitative Risk Analysis, Plan Risk
Responses, Implement Risk Responses, and Monitor Risks) will be implemented, moni-
tored, and controlled throughout the life of the project. It details how you will manage
risks but does not attempt to defi ne responses to individual risks.


                   I'll talk about how to develop the risk response plans in the section
                   "Developing a Risk Response Plan" later in this chapter.

   According to the PMBOK(R) Guide, the risk management plan should include the
following elements:
      Risk strategy
      Methodology
      Roles and responsibilities
      Funding
      Timing
      Risk categories
      Definitions of risk probability and impact
      Probability and impact matrix
      Stakeholder risk appetite
      Reporting formats
      Tracking



exam spotlight

It's important to spend time developing the risk management plan because it's an input
to every other risk-planning process and it enhances the probability of risk management
success.


   You'll take a look at most of these elements next. However, risk categories, probability
and impact, and probability and impact matrix are pretty meaty topics, so I'll cover those
in their own sections following this one:
Risk Strategy Strategy refers to the approach you'll use in managing risks, and risk events
that occur on the project.
Methodology Methodology is a description of how you'll perform risk management,
including elements such as methods, tools, and where you might find risk data that you can
use in the later processes.
                                                 Planning Your Risk Management                283




Roles and Responsibilities Roles and responsibilities describe the people who are responsible
for managing the identified risks and their responses for each type of activity identified in the
risk management plan. These risk teams might not be the same as the project team. Risk analy-
sis should be unbiased, which might not be possible when project team members are involved.
Funding The budget for risk management is included in the plan as well. With this
category, you'll assign resources and estimate the costs of risk management and its methods,
including contingency reserves. These costs are then included in the project's cost baseline.
Timing Timing documents the timing of the risk management processes (including when
and how often they'll be performed on the project) and includes the activities associated with
risk management in the project schedule.
Stakeholder Risk Appetite This is just as it implies. As you proceed through the risk man-
agement processes, you might find that risk appetites will change. Document those new risk
threshold levels in the risk management plan.
Reporting Formats Reporting formats describe the content of the risk register and the for-
mat of this document. (I'll talk more about the risk register later in this chapter.) Reporting
formats also detail how risk management information will be maintained, updated, analyzed,
and reported to project participants.
Tracking This includes a description of how you'll document the history of the risk activi-
ties for the current project and how the risk processes will be audited. You can reference this
information when you're performing risk-planning processes later in the current project or
on future projects. This information is also helpful for lessons learned, which I'll cover in
Chapter 9, "Conducting Procurements and Sharing Information."

Risk Categories
Risk categories are a way to systematically identify risks and provide a foundation for un-
derstanding. When determining and identifying risks, the use of risk categories helps improve
the process by giving everyone involved a common language or basis for describing risk.
   Risk categories should be identified during this process and documented in the risk
management plan. These categories will assist you in making sure the next process, Identify
Risks, is performed effectively and produces a quality output. The following list includes
some examples of the categories you might consider during this process (or modify based
on previous project information):
    Technical, quality, and performance risks
    Project management risks
    Organizational risks
    External risks
    You can go about describing categories of risk in a couple of ways. One way is simply
listing them. You could, and should, review prior projects for risk categories and then tailor
them for this project.
    You could also construct a risk breakdown structure (RBS), which lists the categories
and subcategories. Figure 6.1 shows a sample of an RBS.

                   The organizational process assets input might include an RBS that you can
                   reference for this project. Don't forget your PMO. The project management
                   office might have templates or an RBS already developed.

   Risk categories might reflect the type of industry or application area in which the project
exists. For example, information technology projects will likely have many risks that fall
into the technical category, whereas construction projects might be more subject to risks
that fall into the external risks category. The categories do not have to be industry specific,
however. Keep in mind that project management, for example, is a risk for every project in
every industry. You can fi nd a description of each of the categories next:
Technical/Quality/Performance Risks Technical, quality, and performance risks include
risks associated with unproven technology, complex technology, or changes to technology
anticipated during the course of the project. Performance risks might include unrealistic per-
formance goals. Perhaps one of the project deliverables concerns a component manufactured
to specific performance standards that have never been achieved. That's a performance risk.
                                                 Planning Your Risk Management                   285




Project Management Risks The project management risk category includes improper sched-
ule and resource planning, poor project planning, and improper or poor project management
disciplines or methodologies.
Organizational Risks The organizational risk category can include resource conflicts
because of multiple projects occurring at the same time in the organization; scope, time, and
cost objectives that are unrealistic given the organization's resources or structure; and lack of
funding for the project or diverting funds from this project to other projects.
External Risks The external risk category includes those aspects that are external to the
project, such as new laws or regulations, labor issues, weather, changes in ownership, and
foreign policy for projects performed in other countries. Catastrophic risks--known as
force majeure--are usually outside the scope of Plan Risk Management and instead require
disaster recovery techniques. Force majeure includes events such as earthquakes, meteorites,
volcanoes, floods, civil unrest, terrorism, and so on.
   In addition to risk categories, you'll want to consider other trends in risk management
when planning for risks. According to the PMBOK(R) Guide, these trends include non-event
risks, project resilience, and integrated risk management. Let's take a look at each.
Non-Event Risks This almost sounds like risks that won't occur, but that's not exactly
right. Non-event risks are risks that are event-based and generally outside the control of
the organization (although this is not always true). For example, customers may decide to
significantly modify the project requirements after seeing a prototype, or contractors may be
acquired by another organization during the project.
According to the PMBOK(R) Guide, there are two types of non-event risks: variability and
ambiguity. Variability risk is uncertainty as it pertains to the event or activity. An example
might include unexpected weather events, unexpected resource availability that impacts
productivity, and so on.
Monte Carlo analysis is a great technique to use when dealing with variability risks. Monte
Carlo analysis is a simulation technique that helps you to predict the range of outcomes (or
impacts) of a risk event and the probability of those outcomes should the risk event occur.
This simulation is performed using a range of values. The first value (or impact in our case)
is plugged into the model and the first result is produced. This simulation is repeated for
hundreds or even thousands of values to determine a range of possible outcomes ranging
from conservative to the most outlandish. Monte Carlo analysis is used in many industries.
Ambiguity is general uncertainty about the project due to the unknown or due to the lack
of knowledge about how or what is required to fulfill the project objectives. Examples here
include technology and governmental or industry regulations. Ambiguity risks are addressed
using a gap analysis approach. For example, let's say the technical solution you're using has
elements to it that are only partially known. You'll want to document what is known and
then identify what is unknown or what's not understood about the technology. Work with
experts in the industry, outside of the organization, and/or use benchmarking to help fill in
those gaps in knowledge and come to a better understanding of the technology and the risks
it may pose.
286           Chapter 6      Risk Planning



Resilience Project resilience is the ability to cope with unknown risks as they occur while
still fulfilling the goals of the project. Developing project resilience involves several skills,
including these:
      Accounting for correct levels of budget and schedule contingency
      Developing processes that are flexible enough to cope with risks yet still work toward
      completing the project goals
      Allowing your team members the freedom to perform their activities as they see fit while
      adhering to the schedule and overall goals
      Making it a practice to watch for and identify emerging risks
      Working with stakeholders to adjust project scope where needed when emerging risks
      are present
Integrated Risk Management If you work in an organization that uses a PMO to manage
projects, you are probably already practicing integrated risk management. Risk exists on an
individual level, the project level, the program level, the portfolio level, and on an organiza-
tional level. Best practices encourage an integrated, enterprise-wide approach to managing
risks across all of these levels.

Defining Probability and Impact
When you're writing the risk management plan, you'll want to document the definitions for
probability and impact as they relate to potential negative risk events and their impacts on
the four project objectives. Probability describes the potential for the risk event occurring,
whereas impact describes the effects or consequences the project will experience if the risk
event occurs. This definition can be sophisticated or simple. For example, you might use
numeric values to define probability and impact or simply assign a high-medium-low rating
to each risk. What's important to note now is that you don't use these probability and im-
pact definitions here. You use these definitions later in the Perform Qualitative Risk Analysis
process. (I'll talk in depth about probability and impact in the section "Analyzing Risks Us-
ing Qualitative Techniques" later in this chapter.) But you should define and document them
here in the risk management plan.

Probability and Impact Matrix
A probability and impact matrix prioritizes the combination of probability and impact
scores and helps you determine which risks need detailed risk response plans. For example, a
risk event with a high probability of occurring and a high impact will likely need a response
plan. This matrix is typically defined by the organization, but if you don't have one, you'll
need to develop this now--during your planning meetings (a tool and technique of this
process). You'll use this matrix in the Perform Qualitative Risk Analysis process, and I'll talk
more in depth about it in the section "Analyzing Risks Using Qualitative Techniques" later in
this chapter. Again, you want to define (or modify) and document the probability and impact
matrix in the risk management plan.
                                                          Identifying Potential Risk          287




                  The key point about this process is that you'll define what the probability
                  and impact tools look like now during Plan Risk Management so that the
                  team has an agreed-upon basis for evaluating the identified risks later dur-
                  ing the Perform Qualitative Risk Analysis process.

   To recap, the steps associated with these last few elements of the risk management plan
are as follows:
1.   Define the risk categories (these will assist the risk team in the Identify Risks process).
2.   Determine how probability and impact will be defined (to be used in the Perform
     Qualitative Risk Analysis process).
3.   Develop or modify the probability and impact matrix (to be used in the Perform
     Qualitative Risk Analysis process).
   Doing all these steps, together with the other elements of the risk management plan,
gives you and the risk management team a common understanding for evaluating risks
throughout the remainder of the project.



Identifying Potential Risk
The Identify Risks process involves identifying all the risks that might impact the project,
documenting them, and documenting their characteristics. Identify Risks is an iterative
process that continually builds on itself. As you progress through the project, more risks
might present themselves. Once you've identified or discovered a potential new risk, you
should analyze it to determine whether a response plan is needed. You can see that the risk
management cycle starts again with Identify Risks and progresses through the remaining risk
processes to determine what to do about them.
   You can include several groups of folks to help identify risks, including project team
members, risk team members, stakeholders, subject matter experts, users of the fi nal prod-
uct or service, and anyone else who you think might help in the process. Perhaps in the fi rst
round of Identify Risks you could include just the project team and subject matter experts
and then bring in the stakeholders or risk management team to further flesh out risks dur-
ing the second round of identification. Risk events can occur at any time during the proj-
ect, and all project participants should be encouraged to continually watch for and report
potential risk events.


                  Remember that you are identifying both individual risks and overall project
                  risks in this process.


  Risks might or might not adversely affect the project. Some risks have positive conse-
quences, whereas others have negative consequences. However, you should identify all risk
288         Chapter 6         Risk Planning



events and their consequences. Here's a partial list to get you thinking about where risk
might be found:
      Budgets/funding
      Schedules
      Scope or requirements changes
      Project plan
      Project management processes
      Technical issues
      Personnel issues
      Hardware
      Contracts
      Political concerns
      Business processes
      Legal processes and activities
      Environmental concerns
      Reputation
      Management policies, processes, and attitudes
   This is by no means an exhaustive list. Remember that risk is uncertainty, and realize
that risk (uncertainty) is lurking almost anywhere on your project. It's your job to discover
as many of the potential risks as possible using the tools and techniques of this process and
to document these risks.


Identify Risks Inputs
The inputs to the Identify Risks process are as follows:
      Project management plan (requirements management plan, schedule management plan,
      cost management plan, quality management plan, resource management plan, risk
      management plan, scope baseline, schedule baseline, cost baseline)
      Project documents (assumption log, cost estimates, duration estimates, issue log,
      lessons learned register, requirements documentation, resource requirements,
      stakeholder register)
      Agreements
      Procurement documentation
      Enterprise environmental factors
      Organizational process assets
  We have covered each of these inputs previously, with the exception of the quality
management plan and the resource management plan. We'll talk about both of these inputs
                                                         Identifying Potential Risk         289




in Chapter 7, "Planning Project Resources," where we will discuss quality planning and
human resource planning in depth. For purposes of the Identify Risks process, understand
that the quality management process, identified in the quality management plan, has the
potential to produce or prevent risks itself. We'll touch on a few of the key elements of some
of these other inputs also.
   You should pay particular attention to the roles and responsibilities section of the risk
management plan and the budget and schedule for risk activities. Don't forget to examine
the categories of risks as well. This is a great place to start when you get the team together
and begin brainstorming your list of risks.
   The assumption log contains a list of project assumptions. You'll recall that assumptions
are things believed to be true. During the risk-planning stages of your project and through-
out the work of the project, it's imperative to revisit and revalidate your project assump-
tions. At the time you recorded an assumption about vendor deliveries, for example, the
vendor had a great track record and never missed a date. Months later on the project, that
vendor merges with one of its competitors. Now you'll need to reexamine your assumptions
about delivery times and determine whether the assumption is still valid or whether you
have a risk on your hands.
   The cost, schedule, and resource management plans can be helpful sources when iden-
tifying risks. You should also consider network diagrams, baselines, work performance
reports, and other project information during this process.
   The enterprise environmental factors input concerns aspects from outside the project
that might help you determine or influence project outcomes. Be certain to check for indus-
try information (commercial databases, checklists, benchmarking studies, and so on) or
academic research that might exist for your application areas regarding risk information.
   As always, don't forget about historical information such as previous project experi-
ences via the project fi les. You might fi nd risk templates and lessons learned in these fi les
that will help with the current project. Project team knowledge is another form of historical
information.


                  Although the PMBOK (R) Guide doesn't mention it, I've found that other
                  elements of your project are helpful when identifying risk, such as the
                  work breakdown structure (WBS), the resource management plan, project
                  team assignments, and resource availability. In practice, you should
                  examine the outputs of most of the Planning processes when attempting
                  to identify risks.


Tools and Techniques for Identify Risks
The Identify Risks process is undertaken using several tools and techniques:
    Expert judgment
    Data gathering (brainstorming, checklists, interviews)
    Data analysis (root cause analysis, assumption and constraint analysis, SWOT analysis,
    document analysis)
290         Chapter 6      Risk Planning



      Interpersonal and team skills (facilitation)
      Prompt lists
      Meetings
  You'll learn more about most of these in the following sections. We covered facilitation
and meetings previously.

Expert Judgment
Experts for risk identification purposes can include anyone who has experience work-
ing on similar projects, experience working in the business area for which the project was
undertaken, or specific industry experience. When using this technique, you should consider
any bias your experts may have regarding the project or potential risk events and take that
into account when performing the risk processes.

Data Gathering
Data gathering encompasses several techniques, including brainstorming, the Delphi tech-
nique (a form of brainstorming), checklists, and interviewing. The goal of these techniques is
to end up with a comprehensive list of risks at the end of the meeting. Let's take a quick look
at each of these techniques.

Brainstorming
Brainstorming is probably the most often used technique of the Identify Risks process.
You've probably used this technique many times for many purposes. Brainstorming involves
getting subject matter experts, team members, risk management team members, and anyone
else who might benefit the process in a room and asking them to start identifying possible
risk events. The trick here is that one person's idea might spawn another idea, and so on, so
that by the end of the session you've identified all the possible risks. The facilitator could
start the group off by going through the categories of risks, and/or using RBS to get everyone
thinking in the right direction. Edward de Bono devised a method of brainstorming called
Six Thinking Hats (based on his book by the same name) that you might want to investigate.
You may recall that Edward de Bono is also noted for lateral thinking techniques, which we
discussed in Chapter 3, "Developing the Project Scope Statement."



Nominal Group Technique

The Nominal Group technique is not included as part of the information gathering tech-
niques in the PMBOK (R) Guide. However, it's possible you may see a question about it on
the exam. The Nominal Group technique is a brainstorming technique, or it can be con-
ducted as a mass interview technique.

This technique requires the participants to be together in the same room. Each partici-
pant has paper and pencil in front of them, and they are asked to write down what risks
                                                         Identifying Potential Risk           291




they think the project faces. Using sticky notes is a good way to do this. Each piece of
paper should contain only one risk. The papers are given to the facilitator, who sticks
them up on a wall or whiteboard. The panel is then asked to review all the risks posted,
rank them and prioritize them (in writing), and submit the ranking to the facilitator. Once
this is done, you should have a complete list of risks.



Delphi Technique
The Delphi technique is a lot like brainstorming, except that the people participating in the
meeting don't know one another. In fact, the people participating in this technique don't all
have to be located in the same place and usually participate anonymously. You can use email
to facilitate the Delphi technique easily.
    What you do is assemble your experts, from both inside and outside the company,
and provide them with a questionnaire to identify potential risks. The questionnaire is
often designed with forced choices that require the experts to select between various
options. The questionnaire asks participants about risks associated with the project, the
business process, and the product of the project, and it asks the readers to rank their
answers in regard to the potential impacts of the risks. They in turn send their responses
back to you (or to the facilitator of this process). All the responses are organized by con-
tent and sent back to the Delphi members for further input, additions, or comments. The
participants then send their comments back one more time, and the facilitator compiles
a final list of risks.
    The Delphi technique is a great tool that allows consensus to be reached quickly. It also
helps prevent one person from unduly influencing the others in the group and, therefore,
prevents bias in the outcome because the participants are usually anonymous and don't nec-
essarily know how others in the group responded.

Checklists
Checklists used during the Identify Risks process are usually developed based on historical
information and previous project team experience. You may also obtain risk checklists from
sources that are specific to your industry. If you typically work on projects that are similar
in nature, begin to compile a list of risks. You can then convert this to a checklist that will
allow you to identify risks on future projects quickly and easily. However, don't rely solely
on checklists for Identify Risks because you might miss important risks. It isn't possible for a
single checklist to be an exhaustive source for all projects. You can improve your checklists
at the end of the project by adding the new risks that were identified.

Interviews
Interviews are question-and-answer sessions held with others, including other project man-
agers, subject matter experts, stakeholders, customers, the management team, project team
members, and users. These folks provide you with possible risks based on their past experi-
ences with similar projects.
292        Chapter 6      Risk Planning



   This technique involves interviewing those folks with previous experience on projects
similar to yours or those with specialized knowledge or industry expertise. Ask them to tell
you about any risks that they've experienced or that they think might happen on your proj-
ect. Show them the WBS and your list of assumptions to help get them started thinking in
the right direction.



Exam Spotlight

Be aware that there might be questions about any of the techniques I've shown here.
Understand the difference between the various data gathering techniques for the exam.



Data Analysis
Data analysis also involves several techniques including root cause analysis (RCA), assump-
tion and constraint analysis, SWOT analysis, and document analysis. We'll look at each as
they pertain to this process.

Root Cause Analysis (RCA)
Did you ever hear someone say you're looking at the symptoms and not at the problem?
That's the idea here. Root cause analysis involves digging deeper than the risk itself and
looking at the cause of the risk. This helps define the risk more clearly, and it also helps you
later when it's time to develop the response plan for the risk. A great technique you can use
for RCA is called 5 Why's. This was originally developed by Toyota. The idea is that you
keep asking "why" in succession five times to help understand the root cause of the problem.
For example, let's say that your organization is considering reducing the amount of health
insurance premiums it pays on behalf of employees. The first question to ask is "Why." The
answer is the current benefits package is expensive and the organization is paying 80 percent
of the premium for its employees. The next question is "Why." It's expensive because the
rates have gone up consistently over the last few years. "Why?" Because there were more ex-
pensive claims filed over the past two years than previous years. "Why?" Because employees
are not practicing healthy lifestyle habits. "Why?" Because the organization has experienced
significant growth over the last few years and employees are working a significant number
of hours and are not taking time off. Ah, we've arrived at the root cause of the problem.
Employees are working so many hours that they are not taking care of themselves. This is
leading to more health insurance claims than in past years--which is driving up the cost of
health insurance. Once the root cause has been determined, you can brainstorm alternative
solutions to address the root cause.

Assumption and Constraint Analysis
Assumption and constraint analysis is a matter of validating the assumptions and constraints
you identified and documented during the course of the project-planning processes. Assump-
tions should be accurate, complete, and consistent. Examine all your assumptions for these
qualities. Assumptions are also used as jumping-off points to further identify risks.
                                                         Identifying Potential Risk          293




   The important point to note about the project assumptions is that all assumptions are
tested against two factors:
    The strength of the assumption or the validity of the assumption
    The consequences that might impact the project if the assumption turns out to be false
   All assumptions that turn out to be false should be evaluated and scored just as risks.
   Constraints are examined to determine if they are valid and accurate and to determine
which ones could bring about risk. Examine the constraints that could bring about positive
risks to see if the risks could be enhanced by softening the restrictions caused by the con-
straint or if the constraint should be eliminated altogether.

Strengths, Weaknesses, Opportunities, and Threats (SWOT)
Strengths, weaknesses, opportunities, and threats (also known as SWOT analysis) is a tech-
nique that examines the project from each of these viewpoints. It also requires examining
the project from the viewpoint of the project itself and from project management processes,
resources, the organization, and so on to identify risks, including those that are generated
internally to the project. Strengths and weaknesses are generally related to issues that are
internal to the organization. Strengths are what your organization does well according to
your customers, or the marketplace. Weaknesses are areas the organization could improve
upon. Typically, negative risks are associated with the organization's weaknesses and posi-
tive risks are associated with its strengths. Opportunities and threats are usually external
to the organization. SWOT analysis is sometimes known as internal-external analysis and
can be used in combination with brainstorming techniques to help discover and document
potential risks.

Document Analysis
Document analysis involves reviewing project plans, assumptions, procurement documents,
and historical information about previous projects from both a total project perspective and
from the individual deliverables and activities level. This review helps the project team iden-
tify risks associated with the project objectives. Pay attention to the quality of the plans (is
the content complete, or does it seem to lack detail?) and the consistency between plans. An
exceptionally documented schedule is great, but if the budget isn't as well documented, you
might have some potential risks.

Prompt List
A prompt list is somewhat similar to a checklist in that you have a defined set of risk cat-
egories you can use to determine both individual risks and overall project risks. You can use
the lowest level of the RBS to construct a prompt list for individual risks. According to the
PMBOK(R) Guide, you could consult strategic analysis tools to assist in determining overall
project risk such as PESTLE, TECOP, or VUCA.
   PESTLE analysis examines political, economic, social, technological, legal, and envi-
ronmental factors to see if they may have an overall project impact. For example, let's say
your project involves new oil and gas drilling procedures. When examining risks from the
perspective of PESTLE, environmental factors should jump right out as a potential area for
294          Chapter 6      Risk Planning



overall project risk. The team should explore this area in depth to determine and identify
the risks that could impact the project.
   TECOP analysis looks at technical, environmental, commercial, operational, and politi-
cal risks. Like in the earlier example, you should examine each of these elements to deter-
mine if there are overall project risks that could impact the project.
   VUCA analysis looks at volatility, uncertainty, complexity, and ambiguity.


Identify Risks Outputs
The outputs of the Identify Risks process are the risk register, the risk report, and project
documents updates. Project documents that may need updating after performing this process
include the assumption log, issue log, and lessons learned register. We'll look at the risk
register and its components next.
   Everything you've done in this process up to this point will get documented in the risk
register. It contains the following elements:
      List of identified risks
      Potential risk owners
      List of potential responses
    The risk register also often contains warning signs, or triggers, although they aren't
listed as an official part of the register. You'll take a look at all of these elements next.
Understand that all risks should be documented, tracked, reviewed, and managed through-
out the project.

List of Identified Risks
Risks are all the potential events and their subsequent consequences that could occur as
identified by you and others during this process. You might want to consider logging your
risks in a risk database or tracking system to organize them and keep a close eye on their
status. This can easily be done in spreadsheet format or whatever method you choose. List
the risks, assign each risk a tracking number, and note the potential cause or event and the
potential impact. This list gives you a means to track the risks, their occurrence, and the
responses implemented.

Potential Risk Owners
Risk owners are the departments or individuals responsible for monitoring the risks, imple-
menting risk response plans if the risk event occurs, and updating the project team on status.

List of Potential Responses
You might identify potential responses to risks at the same time you're identifying the risks.
Sometimes just identifying a risk will tell you the appropriate response. Document those
responses here. You'll refer to them again in the Plan Risk Responses process a little later in
this chapter.
                                                         Identifying Potential Risk          295




   A sample risk register is shown in Table 6.1. As you progress through the risk planning
processes, and through the project itself, more risks may be identified and more informa-
tion will become known about the risks. You should update the risk register with new
information as it becomes known.

Triggers
Triggers are warning signs or symptoms that a risk event is about to occur. For ex-
ample, if you've ever suffered from a hay fever attack, you can't mistake the itchy,
runny nose and scratchy throat that can come on suddenly and send you into a sneezing
frenzy. Signals like this are known as triggers, and they work the same way when you're
determining whether a risk event is about to occur. For example, if you're planning an
outdoor gathering and rain clouds start rolling in from the north on the morning of the
activity, you probably have a risk event waiting to happen. A key team member hinting
about job hunting is a warning sign that the person might be thinking of leaving, which
in turn can cause schedule delays, increased costs, and so on. This is another example of
a trigger.
   Triggers are not listed as one of the risk register elements until the Plan Risk Responses
process is carried out, but in practice this is an appropriate time to list them. You will
likely encounter questions on the exam about triggers, so don't say I didn't warn you. Also,
throughout the remainder of the project, be on the alert for triggers that might signal that a
risk event is about to occur.

Risk Report
The risk report is created and elaborated on as you work through the risk processes in the
Planning process group. It documents all the sources of overall project risk, including those
that have the highest potential for impacting the project. It also contains high-level informa-
tion about the potential individual risks that exist on the project, including the number of
risks, types of risk categories represented by the risks, and so on.
296         Chapter 6      Risk Planning




Analyzing Risks Using Qualitative
Techniques
The Perform Qualitative Risk Analysis process involves determining what impact the identi-
fied risks will have on the project objectives and the probability they'll occur. It also ranks
the risks in priority order according to their effect on the project objectives so that you can
spend your time efficiently by focusing on the high-priority risks. This helps the team deter-
mine whether Perform Quantitative Risk Analysis should be performed or whether you can
skip right to developing response plans. The Perform Qualitative Risk Analysis process also
considers risk threshold levels, especially as they relate to the project constraints (scope, time,
cost, and quality) and the time frames of the potential risk events.
   The Perform Qualitative Risk Analysis process should be performed throughout the
project. If you're using an Agile approach, you'll perform this process at the beginning of
each iteration. This process is the one you'll find you'll use most often when prioritizing
project risks because it's fast, relatively easy to perform, and cost effective. The PMBOK(R)
Guide notes that you should identify and manage the risk attitudes of those assisting with
this process because risk perceptions will introduce bias. You'll need to watch for bias,
evaluate it, and correct it if necessary. Usually, simply conducting the Perform Qualitative
Risk Analysis process and evaluating the impact and probability of risks will help to keep
bias at a minimal level.


Perform Qualitative Risk Analysis Inputs
The Perform Qualitative Risk Analysis process has four inputs:
      Project management plan (risk management plan)
      Project documents (assumption log, risk register, stakeholder register)
      Enterprise environmental factors
      Organizational process assets
   The risk management plan documented the roles and responsibilities of risk team mem-
bers, budget and schedule factors for risk activities, the stakeholder risk thresholds, the
definitions for probability and impact, and the probability and impact matrix, all of which
should be utilized when prioritizing risks. You'll examine probability and impact more
closely in the next section, "Tools and Techniques for Perform Qualitative Risk Analysis."
   Although it's not mentioned as part of the project management plan input, you should
consider the scope baseline when working through this process. The scope baseline
describes the deliverables of the project, and from there you should be able to determine
whether you're dealing with a high level of uncertainty or a project that's similar in size and
scope to one you've performed before. Projects with high levels of uncertainty or that are
more complex than what the team has undertaken before require more diligence during the
Perform Qualitative Risk Analysis process.
                                  Analyzing Risks Using Qualitative Techniques               297




   As with the Identify Risks process, you should examine historical information and les-
sons learned from past projects as a guide for prioritizing the risks for this project. Risk
databases from your industry or application area can be used here as well. The real key
to this process lies in the tools and techniques you'll use to prioritize risks. Hold on tight
because you're going in the deep end.


Tools and Techniques for Perform Qualitative
Risk Analysis
The Perform Qualitative Risk Analysis process's tools and techniques are primarily con-
cerned with discovering the probability of a risk event and determining the impact (or
consequences) the risk will have if it does occur. The output of this process is project docu-
ments updates (that will include risk register and risk report updates) where you'll document
the prioritized risks you've scored using these tools and techniques. All the information you
gather regarding risks and probability needs to be as accurate as possible. It's also important
that you gather unbiased information so that you don't unintentionally overlook risks with
great potential or consequences.
   The purpose of this process is to determine risk event probability and risk impact and to
prioritize the risks and their responses. You'll use the tools and techniques of this process
to establish risk scores, which is a way of categorizing the probability and risk impact. The
Perform Qualitative Risk Analysis process includes the following tools and techniques:
    Expert judgment
    Data gathering (interviews)
    Data analysis (risk data quality assessment, risk probability and impact assessment,
    assessment of other risk parameters)
    Interpersonal and team skills (facilitation)
    Risk categorization
    Data representation (probability and impact matrix, hierarchical charts)
    Meetings
   We'll look at the new tools and techniques of this process next and touch one more time
on expert judgment.

Expert Judgment
Because this process determines qualitative values, by its very nature you must rely on
expert judgment to determine the probability, impact, and other information we've derived
so far. The more knowledge and similar experience your experts have, the better your as-
sessments will be. Interviews and facilitated workshops are two techniques you can use in
conjunction with expert judgment to perform this process. As with the Identify Risks pro-
cess, make certain to take into account any bias your experts have and to correct it when
necessary.
298         Chapter 6      Risk Planning



Risk Data Quality Assessment (Data Analysis)
The risk data quality assessment involves determining the usefulness of the data gathered
to evaluate risk. Most important, the data must be unbiased and accurate. You will want to
examine elements such as the following when using this tool and technique:
      The quality of the data used
      The availability of data regarding the risks
      How well the risk is understood
      The reliability and integrity of the data
      The accuracy of the data
   Low-quality data will render the results from the Perform Qualitative Risk Analysis pro-
cess almost useless. Spend the time to validate and verify the information you've collected
about risks so that your prioritization and analysis is as accurate as it can be. If you find
that the quality of the data is questionable, you guessed it--go back and get better data.

Risk Probability and Impact Assessment (Data Analysis)
This tool and technique assesses the probability that the risk events you've identified will
occur, and it determines the effect their impacts have on the project objectives, including time,
scope, quality, and cost. Analyzing risks in this way allows you to determine which risks
require the most aggressive management. When determining probabilities and impacts, you'll
refer to the risk management plan element called "definitions of risk probability and impact."

Probability
Probability is the likelihood that an event will occur. The classic example is flipping a coin.
There is a 0.50 probability of getting heads and a 0.50 probability of getting tails on the flip.
Note that the probability that an event will occur plus the probability that the event will not
occur always equal 1.0. In this coin-flipping example, you have a 0.50 chance that you'll get
heads on the flip. Therefore, you have a 0.50 chance you will not get heads on the flip. The
two responses added together equal 1.0. Probability is expressed as a number from 0.0--
which means there is no probability of the event occurring--to 1.0--which means there is
100 percent certainty the event will occur.
   Determining risk probability can be difficult because it's most commonly accomplished
using expert judgment. In nonproject management terms, this means you're guessing (or
asking other experts to guess) at the probability a risk event will occur. Granted, you're
basing your guess on past experiences with similar projects or risk events, but no two risk
events (or projects) are ever the same. It's best to fully develop the criteria for determining
probability and get as many experts involved as you can. Carefully weigh their responses to
come up with the best probability values possible.

Impact
Impact is the amount of pain (or the amount of gain) the risk event poses to the project. The
risk impact scale can be a relative scale (also known as an ordinal scale) that assigns values
such as high, medium, or low (or some combination of these) or a numeric scale known as
                                  Analyzing Risks Using Qualitative Techniques             299




a cardinal scale. Cardinal scale values are actual numeric values assigned to the risk impact.
Cardinal scales are expressed as values from 0.0 to 1.0 and can be stated in equal (linear) or
unequal (nonlinear) increments.
   Table 6.2 shows a typical risk impact scale for cost, time, and quality objectives based
on a high-high to low-low scale. You'll notice that each of the high-medium-low value com-
binations on this impact scale has been assigned a cardinal value. I'll use these in the sec-
tion coming up on the probability and impact matrix.

                                          proceed



   When you're using a high-medium-low scale, it's important that your risk team under-
stands what criteria were used to determine a high score versus a medium or low score and
how they should be applied to the project objectives.

Assessing Probability and Impact
The idea behind both probability and impact values is to develop predefined measurements
that describe what value to place on a risk event.



Exam Spotlight

For the exam, don't forget that you define probability and impact values during the Plan
Risk Management process and document them in the risk management plan.


   If the risk impact scale has not been previously defined, develop one for the project as
early in the Planning processes as possible. You can use any of the techniques I talked about
earlier in the section "Tools and Techniques for Identify Risks," such as brainstorming or
the Delphi technique, to come up with the values for probability and impact.
300          Chapter 6      Risk Planning



   During the Perform Qualitative Risk Analysis process, you'll determine and assess prob-
ability and impact for every risk identified during the Identify Risks process. You could
interview or hold meetings with project team members, subject matter experts, stakehold-
ers, or others to help assess these factors. During this process, you should document not
only the probability and impact but also the assumptions your team members used to arrive
at these determinations.

Assessment of Other Risk Parameters (Data Analysis)
According to the PMBOK(R) Guide, there are several other factors you can consider in addi-
tion to probability and impact when determining how you'll prioritize the risks at the end of
this process. These factors include the following:
Urgency      Determining how quickly a response needs to be implemented
Proximity     Determining how quickly the risk will impact one or more of the project
objectives
Dormancy The period of time between the risk occurrence and discovery of the risk
Manageability     How well the risk owner manages the risk event
Controllability The ability of the risk owner to control the impact of the risk
Detectability The ability to detect a risk trigger and understanding that a risk event is
about to occur
Connectivity The relationship between the individual risks
Strategic impact The impact to the organization's strategic goals if the risk event occurs
Propinquity The stakeholder's perception of the risk significance
   Let's walk through an example of how you would use these risk parameters to priori-
tize risk. Perhaps you have a potential financial risk on the project that, if it occurs, could
cost the organization hundreds of thousands in penalties and fees. Your response plan will
adequately address the risk event, and you will avoid the penalties and fees provided the
response plan is put into place within 12 hours of the risk event occurring. This describes
a high urgency level for this risk, and you will likely prioritize this risk close to the top of
your risk ranking to make certain it is being monitored and dealt with should it occur.

Risk Categorization
This tool and technique is used to determine the effects risk has on the project. You can ex-
amine not only the categories of risk determined during the Plan Risk Management process
(and described in the RBS), but also the project phase and the WBS to determine the ele-
ments of the project that are affected by risk. By grouping risks into categories, you can see
at a glance those that may have the greatest potential for impact to the project.

Probability and Impact Matrix (Data Representation)
Earlier in this chapter we talked about probability and impact values. The probability and
impact matrix takes the probability and impact values one step further by assigning an

overall risk score classification to each of the project's identified risks. The combination of
probability and impact results in a classification usually expressed as high, medium, or low.
Typically, high risks are considered a red condition, medium risks are considered a yellow
condition, and low risks are considered a green condition. This type of ranking is known as
an ordinal scale because the values are ordered by rank from high to low. (In practice, ordi-
nal values might also include ranking by position. In other words, the risks are listed in order
by rank as the first, the second, the third, and so on.)
   Remember that probability and impact can be determined for the risk as a whole, or
for components of the project the risk may affect, such as the project schedule, cost, and
quality.



Exam Spotlight

The PMBOK (R) Guide notes that risk rating rules and the probability and impact matrix val-
ues and steps are usually set by the organization and/or key stakeholders.


   Now let's look at an example. You have identified a risk event that could impact project
costs, and your experts believe costs could increase by as much as 9 percent. According to
the risk impact rating matrix in Table 6.2, this risk carries a medium impact, with a value
of 0.40. Hold on to that number because you're going to plug it into the probability impact
matrix--along with the probability value--to determine an overall risk value next.
   You'll remember from the discussion earlier that probability values should be assigned
numbers from 0.0 to 1.0. In this example, the team has determined that there is a 0.2 prob-
ability of this risk event occurring. The risk impact scale shows a medium, or 0.40, impact
should the event occur.
   Now, to determine whether the combination of the probability and impact of this risk is
high, medium, or low, you'll need to check the probability impact matrix. Table 6.3 shows
a sample probability and impact matrix.

   First, look at the Probability column. Your risk event has a probability of .2. Now, follow that
row across until you find the column that shows the impact score of .40 (it's the Medium col-
umn). According to your probability and impact matrix values, this risk carries an overall score
of .08 and falls in the low threshold, so this risk is assigned a low (or green condition) value.
   The values assigned to the risks determine how Plan Risk Responses are carried out for
the risks later during the risk-planning processes. Obviously, risks with high probability
and high impact are going to need further analysis and formal responses. Remember that
the values for this matrix (and the probability and impact scales discussed earlier) are deter-
mined prior to the start of this process and documented in the risk management plan. Also
keep in mind that probability and impact do not have to be assigned the same values I've
assigned here. You might use 0.8, 0.6, 0.4, and 0.2 for probability, for example, and assign
.05, 0.1, .3, 0.5, and 0.7 for impact scales.




Screen Scrapers, Inc.

Screen Scrapers is a software-manufacturing company that produces a software
product that looks at your mainframe screens, commonly called green screens, and
converts them to browser-based screens. The browser-based screens look like any other
Windows-compatible screens with buttons, scroll bars, and drop-down lists.

Screen Scrapers devised this product for companies that use mainframe programs to
update and store data because entry-level workers beginning their careers today are not
familiar with green screens. They're cumbersome and difficult to learn, and no consis-
tency exists from screen to screen or from program to program. Pressing the F5 key in
one program might mean go back one page, whereas pressing F5 in another program
might mean clear the screen. New users are easily confused, make a lot of mistakes, and
have to write tablets full of notes on how to navigate all the screens.

Your company has purchased the Screen Scraper product and has appointed you as the
project manager over the installation. This project consists of a lot of issues to address,
and you've made great headway. You're now at the Identify Risks and Perform Qualitative
Risk Analysis stage. You decide to use the Delphi technique to assist you in identifying
risk and assigning probability and impact rankings. Some experts are available in your
company to serve on the Delphi panel, as well as some folks in industry organizations you
belong to outside the company.

You assemble the group, set up a summary of the project, and send it out via email,
requesting responses to your questions about risk. After the first pass, you compile the
list of risks as follows (this list is an example and isn't exhaustive because your list will be
project specific):

      Vendor viability (Will the software company stay in business?)
      Vendor responsiveness with problems after implementation
                                  Analyzing Risks Using Qualitative Techniques              303




    Software compatibility risks with existing systems
    Hardware compatibility risk
    Connection to the mainframe risk
    Training IT staff members to maintain the product

You send this list back to the Delphi members and ask them to assign a probability of 0.0
to 1.0 and an impact of high-high, high, medium, low, or low-low to each risk. The Delphi
members assign probability and impact based on a probability scale and an impact scale
designed by the risk management team. The values of the impact scale are as follows:

    High-high = 0.8
    High = 0.6
    Medium = 0.4
    Low = 0.2
    Low-low = 0.05

The results are compiled to determine the following probability and impact values:

    Vendor viability = 0.6 probability, high impact
    Vendor responsiveness = 0.4 probability, medium impact
    Software compatibility = 0.4 probability, medium impact
    Hardware compatibility = 0.6 probability, high-high impact
    Mainframe connection = 0.2 probability, high-high impact
    Training = 0.2 probability, low-low impact

The probability and impact matrix you used to assign the overall risk scores was derived
from the probability and impact matrix shown in the following table.

Based on the probability and impact matrix thresholds, the project risks are assigned the
following overall probabilities:

    Vendor viability = high
    Vendor responsiveness = medium
    Software compatibility = medium
    Hardware compatibility = high
    Mainframe connection = medium
    Training = low

Hierarchical Charts (Data Representation)
Hierarchical charts are a way to graphically represent risks that are categorized using more
than two factors. Probability and impact, as we saw in the last section, uses two parameters
to categorize risk. But what if you wanted to use some of the other risk assessment factors
such as urgency, proximity, and impact? Figure 6.2 shows a sample bubble chart plotting
urgency and proximity where the bubbles represent impact. The values range from 1 to 10,
where 1 is low and 10 is high. You can see that based on these factors, risks A and C have
the highest impact to the project.

Ranking Risks in the Risk Register
The goal of the Perform Qualitative Risk Analysis process is to rank the risks and determine
which ones need further analysis and, eventually, risk response plans. Project documents
updates are the output of this process. This almost always involves updating the risk register
and may include updates to the risk report, the assumption log, and the issue log. According
to the PMBOK(R) Guide, you'll update the risk register with the following information:
    Risk priority level for the identified risks
    Risk scores
    Risk owner
    Updated probability and impact analysis
    Risk urgency information
    List of risks that need additional analysis and response
    Watch list of low-priority risks
    Each element becomes a new entry in the risk register. For example, risk ranking assigns
the risk score or priority you determined using the probability and impact matrix to the list
of identified risks previously recorded in the risk register. I discussed the categories and the
list of risks requiring near-term responses earlier. Note these in the risk register.
    You should also note those risks that require further analysis (including using the
Perform Quantitative Risk Analysis process). You'll create a list of risks that have low risk
scores to review periodically, and you should note any trends in Perform Qualitative Risk
Analysis that become evident as you perform this process.
    The risk report should be updated to show the risks with the highest risk score along
with a prioritized list of risks. The assumptions log is another project document that should
be updated as new information is discovered throughout this process. Assumptions and
constraints can and do change throughout the course of the project, and the process of
identifying and prioritizing risks may require updates to the assumption log.



Quantifying Risk
The Perform Quantitative Risk Analysis process evaluates the impacts of risk prioritized dur-
ing the Perform Qualitative Risk Analysis process. This process is not needed on every proj-
ect, but when you do use it, it is typically performed for risks identified in Perform Qualita-
tive Risk Analysis that could have a significant impact on the project. Perform Quantitative
Risk Analysis quantifies the aggregate risk exposure for the project by assigning numeric
probabilities to risks and their impacts on project objectives. This quantitative approach is
accomplished using techniques such as Monte Carlo simulation and decision tree analysis.
To paraphrase the PMBOK(R) Guide, the purpose of this process is to perform the following:
    Quantify the project's possible outcomes and probabilities.
    Determine the probability of achieving the project objectives.
306         Chapter 6      Risk Planning



      Identify risks that need the most attention by quantifying their contribution to overall
      project risk.
      Identify realistic and achievable schedule, cost, or scope targets.
      Determine the best project management decisions possible when outcomes are
      uncertain.
   Perform Quantitative Risk Analysis--like Perform Qualitative Risk Analysis--examines
risk and its potential impact on the project objectives. You might choose to use both of
these processes to assess all risks or only one of them, depending on the complexity of the
project and the organizational policy regarding risk planning. The Perform Quantitative
Risk Analysis process follows the Perform Qualitative Risk Analysis process. If you use this
process, be sure to repeat it every time the Plan Risk Responses process is performed and
as part of the Control Risks process so that you can determine whether overall project risk
has decreased.
   I've already covered many of the inputs to the Perform Quantitative Risk Analysis pro-
cess in previous sections of this chapter. They are as follows:
      Project management plan (risk management plan, scope baseline, schedule baseline,
      cost baseline)
      Project documents (assumption log, basis of estimates, cost estimates, cost forecasts,
      duration estimates, milestone list, resource requirements, risk register, risk report,
      schedule forecasts)
      Environmental enterprise factors
      Organizational process assets
   The elements of the enterprise environmental factors you'll want to pay close attention
to as an input to this process are risk databases and risk specialists' studies performed on
similar projects. The elements of the organizational process assets input include historical
information from previous projects of a similar nature.


Tools and Techniques for Perform Quantitative
Risk Analysis
The Perform Quantitative Risk Analysis process includes five tools and techniques: expert
judgment, data gathering (interviews), interpersonal and team skills (facilitation), representa-
tions of uncertainty, and data analysis (simulations, sensitivity analysis, decision tree analy-
sis, influence diagrams). You learned about facilitation in earlier chapters. We'll take a look
at the remaining tools and techniques next.

Expert Judgment
I've talked about this tool and technique before. Experts can come from inside or outside
the organization and should have experience that's applicable to your project. For example,
if your project involves manufacturing a new product or part, you might want to consider
experts such as engineers or statisticians. If you're dealing with sensitive data in an informa-
tion technology project, consider bringing in a security expert. When evaluating risk, use
                                                                  Quantifying Risk              307




experts who understand the tools associated with analyzing risk, including the benefits and
drawbacks of the tools or methods you'll use.

Data-Gathering Techniques
The data-gathering technique used in this process is interviews. This technique is like the
interviewing technique discussed earlier when I talked about the Identify Risks process.
Project team members, stakeholders, and subject-matter experts are prime candidates for risk
interviews. Ask them about their experiences on past projects and about working with the
types of technology or processes you'll use during this project.


                  For the exam, remember that interviewing is a tool and technique of the
                  Perform Quantitative Risk Analysis process. Although you can use this
                  technique in the Identify Risks process, keep in mind that it's part of the
                  data-gathering tool and techniques in both processes and not a named
                  tool and technique itself.

   When using this technique, you should fi rst determine what methods of probability dis-
tribution (described next in the representations of uncertainty tool and technique) you'll use
to analyze your information. The technique you choose will dictate the type of information
you need to gather. For example, you might use a three-point scale that assesses the low,
high, and most likely risk scenarios or take it a step further and use standard deviations
calculations.
   Make certain you document how the interviewees decided on the risk ranges, the criteria
they used to place risks in certain categories, and the results of the interview. This informa-
tion will help you later in developing risk responses.



exam spotlight

For the exam, you should know that several types of probability distributions exist that
are useful in determining and displaying risk information. The type of distribution you use
determines the type of information you should gather during the interviewing process.




Representations of Uncertainty
Representations of uncertainty deal with probability distributions. Probability distribu-
tion may contain a range of values, particularly when cost, resource estimates, and duration
estimates for activities are ambiguous. It's beyond the scope of this book to delve into prob-
ability distributions and calculations, so I'll point out a few aspects of them that you should
remember for the exam.
   Continuous probability distributions (particularly beta and triangular distributions) are
commonly used in Perform Quantitative Risk Analysis. According to the PMBOK(R) Guide,
continuous probability distributions include normal, lognormal, triangular, beta, and
308        Chapter 6      Risk Planning



uniform distributions. Distributions are graphically displayed and represent both the prob-
ability and time or cost elements.
   Triangular distributions use estimates based on the three-point estimate (the pessimistic,
most likely, and optimistic values). This means that during your interviews, you'll gather
these pieces of information from your experts. Then you'll use them to quantify risk for
each WBS element.
   Normal and lognormal distributions use mean and standard deviations to quantify risk,
which also require gathering the optimistic, most likely, and pessimistic estimates.
   Discrete distributions represent possible scenarios in a decision tree (we'll discuss this in
a bit), outcomes of a test, results of a prototype, and other uncertain events.

Data Analysis
For the exam, you should know the four data analysis and modeling techniques within the
Quantitative Risk Analysis tool and technique: sensitivity analysis, decision tree analysis,
simulations, and influence diagrams. Expected monetary value (EMV) analysis is not men-
tioned in the Data Analysis tool and technique list, but this is an important concept you may
need to know for the exam. Let's take a brief look at each of them.

Sensitivity Analysis
Sensitivity analysis is a quantitative method of analyzing the potential impact of risk events
on the project and determining which risk event (or events) has the greatest potential for
impact by examining all the uncertain elements at their baseline values. One of the ways
sensitivity analysis data is displayed is a tornado diagram. Figure 6.3 shows a sample
tornado diagram.

   You can see by the arrangement of horizontal bars (each representing a sensitivity vari-
able) how the diagram gets its name. The idea is that each sensitivity bar displays the low
and high value possible for the element the bar represents. It's beyond the scope of this
book to explain how these values are determined. The questions you might encounter on
the exam are focused on the context of this type of analysis. The variables with the greatest
effect on the project appear at the top of the graph and decrease in impact as you progress
down through the graph. This gives you a quick overview of how much the project can be
                                                                    Quantifying Risk        309




affected by uncertainty in the various elements. It also allows you to see at a glance which
risks might have the biggest impacts on the project and will require carefully crafted,
detailed response plans. You can use tornado diagrams to determine sensitivity in cost,
time, and quality objectives or for risks you've identified during this process. Sensitivity
analysis can also be used to determine stakeholder risk threshold levels.

Expected Monetary Value (EMV) Analysis
Expected monetary value is not a named tool and technique of this process, but you should
have some understanding of this technique since it can be used as a component of decision
tree analysis and simulations.
   Expected monetary value (EMV) analysis is a statistical technique that calculates the
average, anticipated future impact of the decision. EMV is calculated by multiplying
the probability of the risk by its impact for two or more potential outcomes (for example, a
good outcome and a poor outcome) and then adding the results of the potential outcomes
together. EMV is used in conjunction with the decision tree analysis technique, which is
covered next. I'll give you an example of the EMV formula using a decision tree in the next
section. Positive results generally mean the risks you're assessing pose opportunities to the
project, whereas negative results generally indicate a threat to the project.

Decision Tree Analysis
Unfortunately, this isn't a tree outside your office door that produces "yes" and "no" leaves
that you can pick to help you make a decision. Decision trees are diagrams that show the se-
quence of interrelated decisions and the expected results of choosing one alternative over the
other. Typically, more than one choice or option is available when you're faced with a deci-
sion or, in this case, potential outcomes from a risk event. The available choices are depicted
in tree form, starting at the left with the risk decision branching out to the right with pos-
sible outcomes. Decision trees are usually used for risk events associated with time or cost.
    Figure 6.4 shows a sample decision tree using expected monetary value (EMV) as one of
its inputs.

   The expected monetary value of the decision is a result of the probability of the risk
event multiplied by the impact for two or more potential outcomes and then summing their
results. The squares in this figure represent decisions to be made, and the circles represent
the points where risk events might occur.
   The decision with an expected value of $7,000 is the correct decision to make because
the resulting outcome has the greatest value.

Simulation techniques are often used for schedule risk analysis and cost analysis. For ex-
ample, simulations allow you to translate the potential risks at specific points in the project
into their impacts so you can determine how the project objectives are affected. Simulation
techniques compute the project model using various inputs, such as cost estimates or activ-
ity durations, to determine a probability distribution for the variable chosen. (Cost risks
typically use either a work breakdown structure or a cost breakdown structure as the input
variable. Schedule risks always use the schedule network diagram and duration estimates as
the input variable.) If you used simulation techniques to determine project cost and use the
cost of the project elements as the input variable, a probability distribution for the total cost
of the project would be produced after running the simulation numerous times. Simulation
techniques examine the identified risks and their potential impacts on the project objectives
from the perspective of the whole project.
    Monte Carlo analysis is an example of a simulation technique. Monte Carlo analysis is
replicated many times, typically using cost or schedule variables. Every time the analysis is
performed, the values for the variable are changed using a probability distribution for each
variable. Monte Carlo analysis can also be used during the Develop Schedule process.



Exam Spotlight

Simulation techniques are recommended for predicting schedule or cost risks because
they're more powerful than EMV and less likely to be misused. For the exam, remember
that simulation techniques are used to predict schedule or cost risks.


   Simulation analysis is displayed as histograms or S-curve diagrams. Histograms show
the number of times the risk or impact produced the same result during the simulation.
S-curves display the cumulative probability distribution of the risk impact occurring over
the life of the project. You may recall that S-curves also represent cost baselines because
spending starts out small on the project, grows and expands during the project, and then
tapers off at the end when the project wraps up. Simulation technique results will behave in
a similar fashion when displayed graphically because risk is smallest at the beginning of the
project and grows during the work of the project, where risk would have the most signifi-
cant impact, and finally tapers off toward the end as the work completes.
   Criticality analysis involves determining which risks have the most significant impact on
the critical path activities of the project. You'll recall that the critical path is the longest full
                                                                   Quantifying Risk           311




path through the project and is made up of activities with zero float. Risks that impact the
critical path activities will affect the project schedule and could also impact project cost.
   Criticality analysis is performed by calculating an index for each risk that impacts activi-
ties on the critical path. The more activities the risk impacts, the higher the index. This
index is used as an input to the simulation (it's usually noted as a percentage calculated
based on the number of times the risk impacts critical path tasks). The final result of criti-
cality analysis highlights the risks that are likely to impact the overall schedule. The project
team should focus their efforts on creating response plans to these risks since they will have
the most significant impact to the schedule.

Influence Diagrams
According to the PMBOK(R) Guide, influence diagrams typically show the causal influences
among project variables, the timing or time ordering of events, and the relationships among
other project variables and their outcomes. Simply put, they visually depict risks (or deci-
sions), uncertainties, or impacts and how they influence each other. Monte Carlo analysis or
other simulation techniques are used to analyze the influence diagram to determine which
risks will have the greatest impact on the overall project. Figure 6.5 shows an influence
diagram for a product introduction decision. The weather is a variable that could impact
delivery time, and delivery time is a variable that can impact when revenues will occur.

The output of the Perform Quantitative Risk Analysis process is--I'll bet you can guess--
project documents updates. You'll record the following new elements in the risk report:
Assessment of Overall Project Risk Exposure Using the tools and techniques of Perform
Quantitative Risk Analysis allows you to create an overall probability of the project com-

results are displayed as S-curves, tornado diagrams, and criticality analysis. You'll include a
summary of the results here as well as determine the amount of contingency reserve (includ-
ing a confidence level), identify the individual risks with the greatest impact on the critical
path, and identify the overall project risks with the greatest effect to the project overall and
its outcomes.
Prioritized List of Risks The risks included on this list are those identified during sensitiv-
ity analysis as having the greatest effect on the project outcomes. It should include risks that
pose both the greatest threats and the greatest opportunities to the project.
Trends in Quantitative Risk Analysis Results Trends in quantitative risk analysis will likely
appear as you repeat the risk analysis processes. This information is useful as you progress,
making those risks with the greatest threat to the project more evident, which gives you the
opportunity to perform further analysis or go on to develop risk response plans.
Recommended Risk Responses The risk report should include a high-level recommenda-
tion for those risks that pose the greatest threat or opportunity to the project. The recom-
mendation may include high-level ideas on how to respond and/or identify those risks that
require a response plan. The response plan itself is documented in the Plan Risk Response
process, which is up next.

Developing a Risk Response Plan
The Plan Risk Responses process is the last process covered in this chapter. (I hear you cheer-
ing out there!) Plan Risk Responses is a process of deciding what actions to take to reduce
threats and take advantage of the opportunities discovered during the risk analysis processes.
This process also includes assigning risk owners; they may be departments or individual staff
members who are responsible for carrying out the risk response plans you'll outline in this
process.


                  The more effective your risk response plans are, the better your chances
                  for a successful project. Well-developed and well-written risk response
                  plans will likely decrease overall project risk.

   Generally, you'll want to develop risk response plans for risks with a combination of
high probability of occurrence and significant impact to the project, those ranked high
                                                   Developing a Risk Response Plan            313




(or red) on the probability/impact matrix, or those ranked high as a result of Perform
Quantitative Risk Analysis. Developing risk response plans for risks of low severity or
insignificant impact is not an efficient or good use of the project team's time. Spend your
time planning responses that are appropriate given the impact the risk itself poses (or the
opportunity the risk presents), and don't spend more time, money, or energy to produce a
response than the risk event itself would produce if it occurred.
   The inputs you'll use to assist you in this process are as follows:
    Project management plan (resource management plan, risk management plan, cost
    baseline)
    Project documents (lessons learned register, project schedule, project team assignments,
    resource calendars, risk register, risk report, stakeholder register)
    Enterprise environmental factors
    Organizational process assets
   Several strategies are used in this process to reduce or control risk. It's important that
you choose the right strategy for each risk so that the risk and its impacts are dealt with
effectively. After deciding on which strategy to use, you'll develop an action plan to put this
strategy into play should the risk event occur. You might also choose to designate a second-
ary or backup strategy.



Exam Spotlight

The rank of the risk will dictate the level at which Plan Risk Responses should be per-
formed. For example, a risk with low severity wouldn't warrant the time it takes to
develop a detailed risk response plan. Risk responses should be cost effective--if the cost
of the response is more than the consequences of the risk, you might want to examine a
different risk response. Risk responses should also be timely, agreed to by all the project
stakeholders, and assigned to an individual (risk owner) who is responsible for monitor-
ing and carrying out the risk response plan if needed.




Tools and Techniques for Plan Risk Responses
The Plan Risk Responses process consists of nine tools and techniques. They are as follows:
    Expert judgment
    Data gathering (interviews)
    Interpersonal and team skills (facilitation)
    Strategies for threats
    Strategies for opportunities
    Contingent response strategies
314         Chapter 6      Risk Planning



      Strategies for overall project risk
      Data analysis (alternatives analysis, cost-benefit analysis)
      Decision making (multicriteria decision analysis)
  You'll take a look at strategies for threats, opportunities, contingent response strategies,
and strategies for overall project risk next.

Strategies for Threats
Five strategies exist to deal with negative risks or threats to the project objectives: escalate,
avoid, transfer, mitigate, and accept. Accept is a strategy you can use for positive risks or
opportunities as well.

Escalate
Risks that require escalation are generally outside the boundaries of the project, or the risk
response plan is beyond the authority of the project manager to implement and resolve.
However, the project manager is responsible for notifying the appropriate person or business
unit that there is a threat or opportunity they need to address.
   Escalated risks are not managed at a project level. They are generally managed at a
program or portfolio level. When a risk is escalated, it involves alerting the risk owner and
handing off the management of the risk to the risk owner. Once a risk is escalated, it is no
longer the responsibility of the project manager or project team and should be monitored
and managed by the risk owner.

Avoid
To avoid a risk means you'll evade it altogether by eliminating the cause of the risk event
or by changing the project management plan to protect the project objectives from the risk
event. Let's say you're going to take a car trip from your home to a point 800 miles away.
You know--because your friends who just took the same trip told you--that there is a long
stretch of construction on one of the highways you're planning on using. To avoid the risk
of delay, you plan the trip around the construction work and use another highway for that
stretch of driving. In this way, you change your plans, avoid the risk of getting held up in
construction traffic, and arrive at your destination on time.
   With risk avoidance, you essentially eradicate the risk by eliminating its cause. Here's
another example: Suppose your project was kicked off without adequate scope definition
and requirements gathering. You run a high probability of experiencing scope creep--
ever-changing requirements--as the project progresses, thereby impacting the project
schedule. You can avoid this risk by adequately documenting the project scope and require-
ments during the Planning processes and taking steps to monitor and control changes to
scope so it doesn't get out of hand.
   Risks that occur early in the project might easily be avoided by improving communica-
tions, refining requirements, assigning additional resources to project activities, refining the
project scope to avoid risk events, and so on.
   This technique is generally used for risks with high impact and high probability of
occurring.
                                                Developing a Risk Response Plan              315




Transfer
The idea behind a risk transfer is to transfer the risk and the consequences of that risk to a
third party. The risk hasn't gone away, but the responsibility for the management of that risk
now rests with another party. Most companies aren't willing to take on someone else's risk
without a little cash thrown in for good measure. This strategy will impact the project bud-
get and should be included in the cost estimate exercises if you know you're going to use it.
    Transfer of risk can occur in many forms but is most effective when dealing with finan-
cial risks. Insurance is one form of risk transfer. You are probably familiar with how insur-
ance works. Car insurance is a good example. You purchase car insurance so that if you
come upon an obstacle in the road and there is no way to avoid hitting it, the cost to repair
the damage to the car is paid by the insurance company...okay, minus the deductible and
all the calculations for the age of the car, the mileage, the color and make of the car, the
weather conditions the day you were driving--but I digress.
    Another method of risk transfer is contracting. Contracting transfers specific risks to the
vendor, depending on the work required by the contract. The vendor accepts the responsi-
bility for the cost of failure. Again, this doesn't come without a price. Contractors charge
for their services, and depending on the type of contract you negotiate, the cost might be
quite high. For example, in a fixed-price contract, which I'll talk more about in Chapter 7,
the vendor (or seller) increases the cost of the contract to compensate for the level of risk
they're accepting. A cost-reimbursable contract, however, leaves the majority of the risk
with you, the buyer. This type of contract might reduce costs if project changes occur mid-
way through the project.
    Keep in mind that contracting isn't a cure-all. You might just be swapping one risk for
another. For example, say you hire a driver to go with you on your road trip, and that per-
son's job is to do all the driving. If the driver becomes ill or in some way can't fulfill their
obligation, you aren't going to get to your destination on time. You've placed the risks asso-
ciated with the trip on the contract driver; however, you've taken on a risk of delay because
of nonperformance, which means you've just swapped one risk for another. You'll have to
weigh your options in cases like this and determine which side of the risk coin your organi-
zation can more readily accept.
    Other forms of transference include warranties, guarantees, and performance bonds.

Mitigate
When you mitigate a risk, you attempt to reduce the probability of a risk event occurring
or reduce its impacts to an acceptable level. This strategy is a lot like defensive driving. You
see an obstacle in the road ahead, survey your options, and take the necessary steps to avoid
the obstacle and proceed safely on your journey. Seeing the obstacle ahead (identifying risk)
allows you to reduce the threat by planning ways around it or planning ways to reduce its
impact if the risk does occur (mitigation strategies).
   According to the PMBOK(R) Guide, the purpose of mitigation is to reduce the probability
that a risk will occur and/or reduce the impact of the risk to a level where you can accept
the risk and its outcomes. It's easier to take actions early on that will reduce the probability
of a risk event or its consequences than it is to fix the damage once it has occurred. Some
examples of risk mitigation include performing more tests, using less complicated processes,
creating prototypes, and choosing more reliable vendors.
316        Chapter 6      Risk Planning



Accept
The acceptance strategy is used when you aren't able to eliminate all the threats on the
project and/or you are willing to accept the impacts of the risk. Acceptance of a risk event is
a strategy that can be used for risks that pose either threats or opportunities to the project
and is generally used for low-impact risk events. There are two alternatives to the acceptance
strategy. Passive acceptance means you won't make any plans to try to avoid or mitigate the
risk. You're willing to accept the consequences of the risk should it occur. This strategy is
often used when it's more cost-effective to accept the impacts of the risk than to spend time
or resources developing plans to deal with the consequences. Passive acceptance might also
be used because the project team was unable to come up with an adequate response strategy
and must accept the risk and its consequences. Active acceptance is the second strategy and
might include developing contingency plans and reserves to deal with risks should they oc-
cur. (You'll look at contingency reserves in the Contingency Planning section.)
   Let's revisit the road trip example. You could plan the trip using the original route and
just accept the risk of running into construction. If you get to that point and you're delayed,
you'll just accept it. This is passive acceptance. You could also go ahead and make plans to
take an alternative route but not enact those plans until you actually reach the construction
and know for certain that it is going to impede your progress. This is active acceptance and
might involve developing a contingency plan.

New Convention Center Wing

You work for a small hotel and resort in western Colorado. Your company has taken on a
project to expand the convention center by adding another wing. This wing will add six
more meeting rooms (four of which can be combined into a large room by folding back
the movable walls to accommodate large groups). This is a popular resort, and one of the
risks identified with this project was an increase in demand for conference reservations
after the construction finishes. The marketing team members decide they'll mitigate this
risk by contacting the organizations who've reserved space with them over the past three
years and offer them incentives on their next reservation if they book their convention
before the construction is completed. That way, their most important customers won't be
turned away when the new reservations start pouring in.

Strategies for Opportunities
Five strategies exist to deal with opportunities or positive risks that might present themselves
on the project: escalate, exploit, share, enhance, and accept. We already covered escalate and
accept, so we'll look at the remaining strategies next.

Exploit
When you exploit a risk event, you're looking for opportunities for positive impacts. This
is the strategy of choice when you've identified positive risks that you want to make certain
will occur on the project. Examples of exploiting a risk include reducing the amount of time
to complete the project by bringing on more qualified resources, by providing even better
quality than originally planned, or taking advantage of new technologies or technology up-
grades that will reduce costs and allow you to complete the project sooner than planned.

Share
The share strategy is similar to transferring because you'll assign the risk to a third-party
owner who is best able to bring about the opportunity the risk event presents. For example,
perhaps what your organization does best is investing. However, it isn't so good at market-
ing. Forming a joint venture with a marketing firm to capitalize on a positive risk will make
the most of the opportunities.

Enhance
The enhance strategy closely watches the probability or impact of the risk event to ensure
that the organization realizes the benefits. The primary point of this strategy is to attempt
to increase the probability and/or impact of positive risks. This entails watching for and
emphasizing risk triggers and identifying the root causes of the risk to help enhance impacts
or probability.

Contingency Planning
Contingent response strategy, better known as contingency planning, involves planning
alternatives to deal with certain risks (such as those with accept strategies) should they occur.
This is different from mitigation planning in that mitigation looks to reduce the probabil-
ity of the risk and its impact, whereas contingency planning doesn't necessarily attempt to
reduce the probability of a risk event or its impacts.
    Contingency comes into play when the risk event occurs. This implies that you need to
plan for your contingencies well in advance of the threat or opportunity occurring. After
the risks have been identified and quantified, contingency plans should be developed and
kept at the ready.
    Contingency reserves are a common contingency response. We talked about this topic in
the last chapter as well. Contingency reserve strategies for risk events are similar to those
for cost and activity durations. This may include setting aside funding or resources or add-
ing contingency time to the project schedule.
    Fallback plans should be developed for risks with high impact or for risks with identi-
fied strategies that might not be the most effective at dealing with the risk. Fallback plans
318        Chapter 6      Risk Planning



are not contingency plans. For example, in the information technology field, we often
have high-impact risks associated with upgrading operating systems or implementing new
applications. A contingency plan may include calling the vendor to assist in the middle
of the night (that's always when things fall apart) when we can't figure out a solution.
A fallback plan in this case may describe how we are going to bring the old system back
online so that users can still do their work while we figure out what went wrong with the
implementation.
   In practice, you'll fi nd that identifying, prioritizing, quantifying, and developing
responses for potential threats might happen simultaneously. In any case, you don't want to
be taken by surprise, and that's the point of the risk processes. If you know about potential
risks early, you can often mitigate them or prepare appropriate response plans or contin-
gency plans to deal with them.

Strategies for Overall Project Risk
Risks and risk strategies in practice are typically dealt with on most projects at an individual
level. It is also important to consider overall project risks and consider developing response
plans for high-impact, high-probability risks. You can use most of the same strategies we've
discussed for both threats and opportunities when preparing responses to overall project
risks. Avoid, exploit, transfer (or share), mitigate (or enhance), and accept are all appropriate
strategies for overall project risk.


Plan Risk Responses Outputs
As you've no doubt concluded, the purpose of the Plan Risk Responses process is to develop
risk responses for those risks with the highest threat to or best opportunity for the project
objectives. The Plan Risk Responses process has three outputs: change requests, project man-
agement plan updates, and project documents updates. Change requests may come about
after performing this process that will impact the cost and schedule baselines. These changes,
like all changes, need to be processed through the Perform Integrated Change Control pro-
cess. Let's look at the other two outputs next.


                  Remember that you might need to revisit other Planning processes after
                  performing Plan Risk Responses to modify project plans as a result of
                  risk responses.



Project Management Plan Updates
As we've discussed throughout the book, the management plans created to document
how the schedule, budget, quality, procurement, and human resources will be defined,
managed, and controlled on the project become subsidiary plans to the project manage-
ment plan. All of these management plans may require updates after you perform the
risk processes. In addition, the WBS, the scope baseline, the schedule baseline, and cost
                                              Developing a Risk Response Plan               319




baseline may require updates as well. Specifically, these project management plan updates
are listed in the PMBOK(R) Guide:
    Schedule management plan
    Cost management plan
    Quality management plan
    Resource management plan
    Procurement management plan
    Scope baseline
    Schedule baseline
    Cost baseline

Project Documents Updates
For this output, you may need to update the assumption log, cost forecasts, lessons
learned register, project schedule, project team assignments, risk register, and risk report.
The risk register is updated at the end of this process with the information you've dis-
covered during this process. The response plans are recorded in the risk register. You'll
recall that the risk register lists the risks in order of priority (those with the highest
potential for threat or opportunity first), so it makes sense that the response plans you
have for these risks will be more detailed than the remaining lists. Some risks might not
require response plans at all, but you should put them on a watch list and monitor them
throughout the project.
   Let's take a look at what the risk register should contain at this point. According to
the PMBOK(R) Guide, after Identify Risks, Perform Qualitative Risk Analysis, Perform
Quantitative Risk Analysis, and Plan Risk Responses are performed, the following elements
should appear in the risk register:
    Prioritized list of identified risks, including their descriptions, what WBS element
    (or area of the project) they impact, categories (RBS), root causes, and how the risk
    impacts the project objectives
    Risk ranking
    Risk owners and their responsibility
    Agreed-upon response strategies
    Actions needed to implement response plans
    Risk triggers
    Cost and schedule activities needed to implement risk responses
    Contingency plans
    Fallback plans
    List of residual and secondary risks
    Contingency reserves
320        Chapter 6       Risk Planning



    The only elements in the preceding list I haven't talked about so far are residual and
secondary risks. A residual risk is a leftover risk, so to speak. After you've implemented a
risk response strategy--mitigation, for example--some minor risk might still remain. The
contingency reserve is set up to handle situations like this.
    Secondary risks are risks that come about as a result of implementing a risk response.
The example given previously where you transferred risk by hiring a driver to take you to
your destination but the person became ill along the way is an example of a secondary risk.
The driver's illness delayed your arrival time, which is a risk directly caused by hiring the
driver or implementing a risk response. When planning for risk, identify and plan responses
for secondary risks.
    Risks exist on all projects, and risk planning is an important part of the project Planning
processes. Just the act of identifying risks and planning responses can decrease their impact
if they occur. Don't take the "What I don't know won't hurt me" approach to risk plan-
ning. This is definitely a case where not knowing something can be devastating. Risks that
are easily identified and have planned responses aren't likely to kill projects or your career.
Risks that you should have known about but ignored could end up costing the organiza-
tion thousands or millions of dollars, causing schedule delays, causing loss of competitive
advantage, or ultimately killing the project. There could be a personal cost as well, because
cost and schedule overruns due to poor planning on your part are not easily explained.




Project Case Study: New Kitchen Heaven Retail Store

Ricardo knocks on your office door and asks whether you have a few minutes to talk. "Of
course," you reply, and he takes a seat on one of the comfy chairs at the conference table.
You have a feeling this might take a while.

"I think you should know that I'm concerned about the availability of the T1 line. I've
already put in the call to get us on the list because, as I said last week, there's a 30- to
45-day lead time on these orders."

"We're only partway through the Planning processes. Do you need to order the T1 so
soon? We don't even know the store location yet," you say.

"Even though they say lead time is 30 to 45 days, I've waited as long as five or six months
to get a T1 installed in the past. I know we're really pushing for the early February store
opening, so I thought I'd get the ball rolling now. What I need from you is the location
address, and I'll need that pretty quick."

"We're narrowing down the choices between a couple of properties, so I should have that
for you within the next couple of weeks. Is that soon enough?"

"The sooner, the better," Ricardo replies.

"Great. I'm glad you stopped by, Ricardo. I wanted to talk with you about risk anyway, and
you led us right into the discussion. Let me ask you, what probability would you assign to
the T1 line installation happening six months from now?"

"I'd say the probability for six months is low. It's more likely that if there is a delay, it
would be within a three- to four-month time frame."

"If they didn't get to it for six months, would it be a showstopper? In other words, is there
some other way we could transfer Jill's data until the T1 did get installed?"

"Sure, we could use other methods. Jill won't want to do that for very long, but work-
arounds are available."

"Good. Now, what about the risk for contractor availability and hardware availability and
delivery schedules?" you ask.

You and Ricardo go on to discuss the risks associated with the IT tasks. Later, you ask Jill
and Jake the same kinds of questions and compile a list of risks. In addition, you review
the project information for the Atlanta store opening because it's similar in size and scope
to this store. You add the risks from that store opening to your list as well. You divide
some of the risks into the following categories: IT, Facilities, and Retail. A sample portion
of your list appears as follows, with overall assignments made based on Perform Qualita-
tive Risk Analysis and the probability and impact matrix:

    Category: IT
        T1 line availability and installation. Risk score: Low
        Contractor availability for Ethernet installation. Risk score: Medium
        POS and server hardware availability. Risk score: Medium
    Category: Facilities
        Desirable location in the right price range. Risk score: High
        Contractor availability for build-out. Risk score: Low
        Availability of fixtures and shelving. Risk score: Low
    Category: Retail
        Product availability. Risk score: Medium
        Shipment dates for product. Risk score: Medium

After examining the risks, you decide that response plans should be developed for the
last two items listed under the IT source, the first item under Facilities, and both of the
risks listed under Retail.

Ricardo has already mitigated the T1 connection and installation risk by signing up sev-
eral months ahead of the date when the installation is needed. The contractor availability
322          Chapter 6      Risk Planning




can be handled with a contingency plan that specifies a backup contractor should the first
choice not be available. For the POS terminals and hardware, you decide to use the trans-
fer strategy. As part of the contract, you'll require these vendors to deliver on time, and if
they cannot, they'll be required to provide and pay for rental equipment until they can get
your gear delivered.

The Facilities risk and Retail risks will be handled with a combination of acceptance,
contingency plans, and mitigation.

You've calculated the expected monetary value for several potential risk events. Two of
them are detailed here.

Desirable location has an expected monetary value of $780,000. The probability of choos-
ing an incorrect or less than desirable location is 60 percent. The potential loss in sales is
the difference between $2.5 million in sales per year that a high-producing store gener-
ates versus $1.2 million in sales per year that an average store generates.

The expected monetary value of the product availability event is $50,000. The probability
of the event occurring is 40 percent. The potential loss in sales is $125,000 for not open-
ing the store in conjunction with the Home and Garden Show.

Understanding How This Applies
to Your Next Project
Risk management, and all the processes it involves, is not a process I recommend you skip
on a project of any size. This is where the Boy Scouts of America motto, "Be Prepared,"
is wise advice. If you haven't examined what could be lurking around the corner on your
project and come up with a plan to deal with it, then you can be assured you're in for some
surprises. Then again, if you like living on the edge, never knowing what might occur next,
you'll probably find yourself back on the job-hunting scene sooner than you planned (oh,
wait, you didn't plan because you're living on the edge).
    In all seriousness, as with most of the Planning processes I've discussed so far, risk
management should be tailored to match the complexity and size of your project. If you're
working on a small project with a handful of team members and a short timeline, it doesn't
make sense to spend a lot of time on risk planning. However, it does warrant spending
some time identifying project risk, determining impact and probability, and documenting a
plan to deal with the risk.
    My favorite Identify Risks technique is brainstorming. I like its cousin, the Nominal
Group technique, too. Both techniques help you quickly get to the risks with the great-
est probability and impact because, more than likely, these are the first risks that come to
mind. Identify Risks can also help the project team find alternative ways of completing
the work of the project. Further digging and the ideas generated from initial identification
might reveal opportunities or alternatives you wouldn't have thought about during the
regular Planning processes.
    After you've identified the risks with the greatest impact to the project, document
response plans that are appropriate for the risk. Small projects might have only one or two
risks that need a response plan. The plans might consist of only a sentence or two, depend-
ing on the size of the project. I would question a project where no risks require a response
plan. If it seems too good to be true, it probably is.
    The avoid, transfer, and mitigate strategies are the most often used strategies to deal
with risk, along with contingency planning. Of these, mitigation and contingency planning
are probably the most common. Mitigation generally recognizes that the risk will likely
occur and attempts to reduce the impact.
    I have used brainstorming and the Nominal Group technique to strategize response
plans for risks on small projects. When you're working on a small project, you can typically
identify, quantify, and create response plans for risks at one meeting.
    Identifying positive risk, in my experience, is fairly rare. Typically, when my teams per-
form Identify Risks, it's to determine what can go wrong and how bad the impact will be if
it does. The most important concept from this chapter that you should apply to your next
project is that you and your team should identify risks and create response plans to deal
with the most significant ones.

Summary
Congratulations! You've completed another fun-filled, action-packed chapter, and all of it
on a single topic--risk. Risk is inherent in all projects, and risks pose both threats to and
opportunities for the project. Understanding the risks facing the project better equips you
to determine the appropriate strategies to deal with those risks and helps you develop the
response plans for the risks (and the level of effort you should put into preparing those
plans).
    The Plan Risk Management process determines how you will plan for risks on your proj-
ect. Its only output is the risk management plan, which details how you'll define, monitor,
and control risks throughout the project. The risk management plan is a subsidiary of the
project management plan.
    The Identify Risks process seeks to identify and document the project risks using data-
gathering and data analysis techniques such as brainstorming, the Delphi technique, inter-
viewing, and root cause analysis. This list of risks gets recorded in the risk register, the
primary output of this process.
    Perform Qualitative Risk Analysis and Perform Quantitative Risk Analysis involve
evaluating risks and assigning probability and impact values to them. Many tools and tech-
niques are used during these processes, including expert judgment, interviews, risk data
quality assessment, risk probability and impact assessment, assessment of other risk param-
eters, facilitation, risk categorization, probability and impact matrix, hierarchical charts,
and meetings.
    A probability and impact matrix uses the probability multiplied by the impact value to
determine the risk score. The threshold of risk based on high, medium, and low tolerances
is determined by comparing the risk score based on the probability level to the probability
and impact matrix.
    Monte Carlo simulation is a technique used to quantify schedule or cost risks in the
Perform Quantitative Risk Analysis. Decision trees graphically display decisions and their
various choices and outcomes, and they are typically used in combination with expected
monetary value.
    The Plan Risk Responses process is the last Planning process and culminates with an
update to the risk register documenting the risk response plans. The risk response plans
detail the strategies you'll use to respond to risk and assign individuals to manage each risk
response. Risk response strategies for threats include escalation, avoidance, mitigation, and
transference. Risk strategies for opportunities include escalate, exploit, share, and enhance.
Acceptance is a strategy for both negative and positive risks.
    Contingency planning involves planning alternatives to deal with risk events should they
occur. Contingency reserves are set aside to deal with risks associated with cost and time
according to the stakeholder threshold levels.
                                                                     Exam Essentials             325




Exam Essentials
Be able to define the purpose of the risk management plan. The risk management plan
describes how you will define, monitor, and control risks throughout the project. It details
how risk management processes (including Identify Risks, Perform Qualitative Risk Analysis,
Perform Quantitative Risk Analysis, Plan Risk Responses, Implement Risk Responses, and
Monitor Risks) will be implemented, monitored, and controlled throughout the life of the
project. It describes how you will manage risks but does not attempt to define responses to
individual risks. The risk management plan is a subsidiary of the project management plan,
and it's the only output of the Plan Risk Management process.
Be able to name the purpose of Identify Risks. The purpose of the Identify Risks process is
to identify all risks that might impact the project and then document them and identify their
characteristics.
Be able to define the purpose of Perform Qualitative Risk Analysis. Perform Qualitative
Risk Analysis determines the impact the identified risks will have on the project and the
probability they'll occur, and it puts the risks in priority order according to their effects on
the project objectives.
Be able to define the purpose of Perform Quantitative Risk Analysis. Perform Quantitative
Risk Analysis evaluates the impacts of risk prioritized during the Perform Qualitative Risk
Analysis process and quantifies risk exposure for the project by assigning numeric probabili-
ties to each risk and their impacts on project objectives.
Be able to define the purpose of the Plan Risk Responses process. Plan Risk Responses is
the process where risk response plans are developed using strategies such as escalate, avoid,
transfer, mitigate, accept, exploit, share, enhance, develop contingent response strategies,
and apply expert judgment. The risk response plan describes the actions to take should the
identified risks occur. It should include all the identified risks, a description of the risks, how
they'll impact the project objectives, and the people assigned to manage the risk responses.
Be able to define the risk register and some of its primary elements. The risk register is an
output of the Identify Risks process, and updates to the risk register occur as an output of
every risk process that follows this one. By the end of the Plan Risk Responses process, the
risk register contains these primary elements: identified list of risks, risk owners, risk triggers,
risk strategies, contingency plans, and contingency reserves.

15. You work for a large manufacturing plant. You are working on a new project to release an
    overseas product line. This is the company's first experience in the overseas market, and it
    wants to make a big splash with the introduction of this product. The stakeholders are a
    bit nervous about the project and historically proceed cautiously and take a considerable
    amount of time to examine information before making a final decision. The project
    entails producing your product in a concentrated formula and packaging it in smaller
    containers than the US product uses. A new machine is needed to mix the ingredients into a
    concentrated formula. After speaking with one of your stakeholders, you discover this will
    be the first machine your organization has purchased from your new supplier. Which of the
    following statements is true given the information in this question?
    A. The question describes risk threshold levels of the stakeholders, which should be
       considered when performing the Plan Risk Management process.
    B.   This question describes the interviewing tool and technique used during the Identify
         Risks process.
    C.   This question describes risk triggers that are derived using interviewing techniques and
         recorded in the risk register during the Perform Qualitative Risk Analysis process.
    D.   This question describes a risk that requires a response strategy from the positive risk
         category.

                              We're closing in on finishing up the Planning group pro-
                              cesses. We're at a place where we need to talk about some
                              processes that aren't necessarily related to each other but need
to be completed before you can construct the project schedule and budget. So, we'll start out
this chapter by discussing resources.
   All projects require resources. Some may require materials or goods, but all projects
require human resources to perform the activities to bring them to completion. We'll dis-
cuss an overview of the Project Procurement Knowledge Area and then dive right into the
Plan Procurement Management process, which deals with the goods and services procure-
ments. Then we'll move on to Plan Resource Management, where you will develop the
resource management plan. This plan will help guide you later when acquiring your project
team members in the Executing processes.
   We'll wrap up the chapter with the Plan Quality Management process. This process
focuses on determining the quality standards that are necessary for the project and for
documenting how you'll go about meeting them. Let's get going.


                 The process names, inputs, tools and techniques, outputs, and
                 descriptions of the project management process groups and related
                 materials and figures in this chapter are based on content from A
                 Guide to the Project Management Body of Knowledge (PMBOK (R) Guide),
                 Sixth Edition (PMI(R), 2017).




Overview of the Project Procurement
Management Knowledge Area
Procurement is sometimes a world unto its own. It has its own language, rules, regulations,
and generally a small army of personnel to manage it all. Project managers need to work in
close coordination with the procurement officers, and the roles and responsibilities of each
should be clearly understood. In all but the smallest of organizations, a project manager
does not usually have the authority to enter into a procurement agreement. In fact, after the
procurement has been handed off to the procurement officer, the project manager isn't usu-
ally allowed to engage with the organizations (or people) who are bidding on the work until
the process moves into the selection process. It's very important for you to understand what
                                                          Procurement Planning              333




authority you have as the project manager (if any) in a procurement process and to under-
stand who has the authority to sign and administer contract documents. I've seen more than
one manager during the course of my career terminated for not following procurement rules.
   We've discussed tailoring several times and the concept applies in the procurement pro-
cesses as well. Procurements can be complex or simple. The project management processes
you use will depend on the complexity of the purchase as well as factors such as the physi-
cal location where the goods or services will be delivered or performed, the availability
of contractors, and government or regulatory compliance. If your project involves funds
provided by the federal government, you'll have an additional set of procurement rules (and
ongoing reporting requirements) to follow.
   Procurements in an Agile environment require close attention to timelines so the pur-
chases are lined up with the Agile iterations. You can help mitigate timing and delivery
issues by including the sellers as part of the Agile team.



Procurement Planning
Plan Procurement Management is a process of identifying what goods or services you're
going to purchase from outside the organization and which needs the project team can meet.
Part of what you'll accomplish in this process is determining whether you should purchase
the goods or services and, if so, how much, when, and from which sellers. Keep in mind that
I'm discussing the procurement from the buyer's perspective, because this is the approach
used in the PMBOK(R) Guide.
    The Plan Procurement Management process can influence the project schedule, and the
project schedule can influence this process. For example, the availability of a contractor or
special-order materials might have a significant impact on the schedule. Conversely, your
organization's business cycle might have an impact on the Plan Procurement Management
process if the organization is dependent on seasonal activity. The Estimate Activity
Resources process can also be influenced by this process, as can make-or-buy decisions
(I'll get to those shortly).


                 You need to perform each process in the Project Procurement Manage-
                 ment Knowledge Area (beginning with Plan Procurement Management and
                 ending with Control Procurements) for each product or service that you're
                 buying outside the organization. If you're procuring all your resources from
                 within the organization, the only process you'll perform in this Knowledge
                 Area is the Plan Procurement Management process.

  Sometimes, you'll procure all the materials and resources for your project from a ven-
dor. In cases like these, the vendor will have a project manager assigned to the project.
Your organization might have an internal project manager assigned as well to act as the
conduit between your company and the vendor and to provide information and monitor
334         Chapter 7      Planning Project Resources



your organization's deliverables. When this happens, the vendor or contracting company
is responsible for fulfilling all the project management processes as part of the contract. In
the case of an outsourced project, the seller--also known as the vendor, supplier, service
provider, or contractor--manages the project and the buyer becomes the stakeholder. If
you're hiring a vendor, don't forget to consider permits or professional licenses that might
be required for the type of work you need them to perform.
    Several inputs are needed when planning for purchases. You'll look at them next.


Plan Procurement Management Inputs
The Plan Procurement Management process has six inputs:
      Project charter
      Business documents (business case, benefits management plan)
      Project management plan (scope management plan, quality management plan, resource
      management plan, scope baseline)
      Project documents (milestone list, project team assignments, requirements documenta-
      tion, requirements traceability matrix, resource requirements, risk register, stakeholder
      register)
      Enterprise environmental factors
      Organizational process assets
    The important component of the project management plan for this process is the scope
baseline. You will recall that the scope baseline includes the project scope statement that
describes the need for the project and lists the deliverables and the acceptance criteria
for the product or service of the project. Obviously, you'll want to consider these when
thinking about procuring goods and services. You'll also want to consider the constraints
(issues such as availability and timing of funds, availability of resources, delivery dates,
and vendor availability) and assumptions (issues such as reliability of the vendor, assuming
availability of key resources, and adequate stakeholder involvement). The product scope
description is included in the project scope statement as well and might alert you to special
considerations (services, technical requirements, and skills) needed to create the project's
product.
    As part of the scope baseline, the WBS and WBS dictionary identify the deliverables and
describe the work required for each element of the WBS.
    The risk register, which includes risk-related contract decisions, will guide you in deter-
mining the types of services or goods needed for risk management. For example, the trans-
ference strategy might require the purchase of insurance. You should review each of these
elements when determining which goods and services will be performed within the project
and which will be purchased. Marketplace conditions are the key element of enterprise
environmental factors you should consider for this process. The organization's guidelines
and organizational policies (including any formal procurement policies), along with the
organization's supplier system that contains prequalified sellers, are the elements of the
organizational process assets you should pay attention to here.
                                                              Procurement Planning              335




                  Many organizations have procurement departments that are responsible
                  for procuring goods and services and writing and managing contracts.
                  Some organizations also require that all contracts be reviewed by their
                  legal department prior to signing. These are organizational process assets
                  that you should consider when you need to procure goods and services.

Organizational Process Assets
It's important for the project manager to understand organizational policies (a component
of organizational process assets) because they might impact many of the Planning processes,
including the procurement planning processes. For example, the organization might have
purchasing approval processes that must be followed. Perhaps orders for goods or services
that exceed certain dollar amounts need different levels of approval. As the project manager,
you need to be aware of policies like this so you're certain you can execute the project smoothly.
It's frustrating to find out later that you should have followed a certain process or policy
and now, because you didn't, you've got schedule delays or worse. You could consider using
the "Sin now, ask forgiveness later" technique in extreme emergencies, but you didn't hear
that from me. (By the way, that's not a technique that's authorized by the PMBOK(R) Guide.)
    The project manager and the project team will be responsible for coordinating all the
organizational interfaces for the project, including technical, human resources, purchasing,
and fi nance. It will serve you well to understand the policies and politics involved in each of
these areas in your organization.


                  I previously worked for an agency within state government, and we were
                  steeped in policy. (A government organization steeped in policy? Go fig-
                  ure!) It was so steeped in policy that we had to request the funds for large
                  projects at least two years in advance. There were mounds and mounds of
                  request forms, justification forms, approval forms, routing forms--you get
                  the idea. My point is, if you miss one of the forms or don't fill out the infor-
                  mation correctly, you can set your project back by a minimum of a year,
                  if not two. Then once the money is awarded, there are more forms to fill
                  out and policies to follow. Again, if you don't follow the policies correctly,
                  you can jeopardize future project funds. Many organizations have a prac-
                  tice of not giving you all the project money up front in one lump sum. In
                  other words, you must meet major milestones or complete a project phase
                  before they'll fund your next phase. Know what your organizational poli-
                  cies are well ahead of time. Talk to the people who can walk you through
                  the process and ask them to check your work to avoid surprises.

   Keep in mind that if you are a seller, you may be managing the sale of your goods or
services as a project. If that's the case, you will be following all of the processes in all of the
Knowledge Areas and will want to ensure that you thoroughly understand the terms and
conditions of the procurement documents (contracts, purchase orders, statement of work,
and so on) associated with the project.
   Teaming agreements are not an official input of any of the processes. However, teaming
agreements by themselves are an input to the Planning process group. Teaming agreements
336         Chapter 7      Planning Project Resources



are contractual agreements between multiple parties that are forming a partnership or joint
venture to work on the project. Teaming agreements are often used when two or more ven-
dors form a partnership to work together on a particular project. If teaming agreements are
used on the project, typically the scope of work, requirements for competition, buyer and
seller roles, and other important project concerns should be predefined.
    Be aware that when teaming agreements are in force on a project, the planning pro-
cesses are significantly impacted. For example, the teaming agreement predefines the scope
of work, and that means that elements such as the requirements and the deliverables may
change the completion dates, thereby impacting the project schedule, or they may affect the
project budget, quality, human resources availability, procurement decisions, and so on.
    Another component of organization process assets you should understand for the exam
is contract types. We'll look at that next.

Contract Types
A contract is a compulsory agreement between two or more parties and is used to acquire
products or services from outside the organization. Typically, money is exchanged for the
goods or services. Contracts are enforceable by law and require an offer and an acceptance.
Generally speaking, most organizations require a more extensive approval process for con-
tracts than for other types of procurements. For example, contracts may require a signature
from someone in the legal department, an executive in the organization, the chief financial
officer, the procurement director, and the senior manager from the department that is having
the work performed.
   There are different types of contracts for different purposes. The PMBOK(R) Guide
divides contracts into three categories:
      Fixed price
      Cost reimbursable
      Time and materials (T&M)
    Within the fixed-price and cost-reimbursable categories are different types of contracts.
You'll look at each in the following sections. Keep in mind that several factors will deter-
mine the type of contract you should use. The product requirements (or service criteria)
might drive the contract type. The market conditions might drive availability and price--
remember back in the dot-com era when trying to hire anyone with programming skills
was next to impossible? Also, the amount of risk--for the seller, the buyer, and the project
itself--will help determine contract type.



Exam Spotlight

Contract types help determine the risk the buyer and seller will bear during the life of
the contract. The project manager should take this into consideration when purchasing
goods and services outside the organization and make certain it is in keeping with the risk
attitudes of the organization and stakeholders. (We talked about this in Chapter 6, "Risk
Planning.") There could always be an exam question or two regarding contract types, so
spend some time getting familiar with them.
                                                             Procurement Planning             337




Fixed-Price Contracts
Fixed-price contracts can either set a specific, firm price for the goods or services rendered
(known as a firm fixed-price contract, or FFP contract) or include incentives for meeting or
exceeding certain contract deliverables.
   Fixed-price contracts can be disastrous for both the buyer and the seller if the scope of
the project is not well defined or the scope changes dramatically. It's important to have
accurate, well-defined deliverables when you're using this type of contract. Conversely,
fixed-price contracts are relatively safe for both buyer and seller when the original scope is
well defined and remains unchanged. They typically reap only small profits for the seller
and force the contractor to work productively and efficiently. This type of contract also
minimizes cost and quality uncertainty. For the exam, you should know three types of
fixed-price contracts:
Firm Fixed-Price (FFP) In the FFP contract, the buyer and seller agree on a well-defined
deliverable for a set price. The good news for the buyer is the price never goes up. Howev-
er, if the deliverables are not well defined, the buyer can incur additional costs in the form of
change orders. It's important that you clearly describe the work to avoid additional cost.
In this kind of contract, the biggest risk is borne by the seller. The seller--or contractor--
must take great strides to assure they've covered their costs and will make a comfortable
profit on the transaction. The seller assumes the risks of increasing costs, nonperformance,
or other problems. However, to counter these unforeseen risks, the seller builds in the cost
of the risk to the contract price. This is the most common type of contract and the most
often used.
Fixed-Price Incentive Fee (FPIF) Fixed-price incentive fee (FPIF) contracts are another type
of fixed-price contract. The difference here is that the contract includes an incentive--or
bonus--for early completion or for some other agreed-upon performance criterion that
meets or exceeds contract specifications. The criteria for early completion, or other perfor-
mance enhancements, are typically related to cost, schedule, or technical performance and
must be spelled out in the contract so both parties understand the terms and conditions. The
fixed price, much like the FFP, is set and never goes up. The seller assumes the risk for com-
pleting the work no matter the cost.
Another aspect of fixed-price incentive fee contracts to consider is that some of the risk is
borne by the buyer, unlike the firm fixed-price contract where most of the risk is borne by
the seller. The buyer takes some risk, albeit minimal, by offering the incentive to, for exam-
ple, get the work done earlier. Suppose the buyer would like the product delivered 30 days
prior to when the seller thinks they can deliver. In this case, the buyer assumes the risk for
the early delivery via the incentive.
Fixed-Price with Economic Price Adjustment (FP-EPA) There's one more type of fixed-price
contract, known as a fixed-price with economic price adjustment (FP-EPA) contract. This
contract allows for adjustments due to changes in economic conditions such as cost increases
or decreases, inflation, and so on. These contracts are typically used when the project spans
many years. This type of contract protects both the buyer and seller from economic condi-
tions that are outside of their control.
338        Chapter 7      Planning Project Resources




Exam Spotlight

The economic adjustment section of an FP-EPA contract should be tied to a known
financial index.



Cost-Reimbursable Contracts
Cost-reimbursable contracts are as the name implies. The allowable costs--allowable is
defined by the contract--associated with producing the goods or services are charged to
the buyer. All the costs the seller takes on during the project are charged back to the buyer;
therefore, the seller is reimbursed.
   These contracts carry the highest risk to the buyer because the total costs are uncertain.
As problems arise, the buyer has to shell out even more money to correct the problems.
However, the advantage to the buyer with this type of contract is that scope changes are
easy to make and can be made as often as you want--but it will cost you.
   Cost-reimbursable contracts have a lot of uncertainty associated with them. The contrac-
tor has little incentive to work efficiently or be productive. This type of contract protects the
contractor's profit because increasing costs are passed to the buyer rather than taken out of
profits, as would be the case with a fixed-price contract. Be certain to audit your statements
when using a contract like this so that charges from some other project the vendor is work-
ing on don't accidentally end up on your bill.
   Cost-reimbursable contracts are used most often when the project scope contains a lot
of uncertainty, such as for cutting-edge projects and research and development. They are
also used for projects that have large investments early in the project life. Incentives for
completing early, or not so early, or meeting or exceeding other performance criteria may
be included in cost-reimbursable contracts much like the FPIF. We'll look at four types of
cost-reimbursable contracts:
Cost Plus Fixed Fee (CPFF) Cost plus fixed fee (CPFF) contracts charge back all allowable
project costs to the buyer and include a fixed fee upon completion of the contract. This is
how the seller makes money on the deal; the fixed fee portion is the seller's profit. The fee is
always firm in this kind of contract, but the costs are variable. The seller doesn't necessarily
have a lot of motivation to control costs with this type of contract, as you can imagine, and
one of the strongest motivators for completing the project is driven by the fixed fee portion
of the contract.
Cost Plus Incentive Fee (CPIF) The next category of cost-reimbursable contract is cost plus
incentive fee (CPIF). This is the type of contract in which the buyer reimburses the seller for
the seller's allowable costs and includes an incentive for meeting or exceeding the perfor-
mance criteria laid out in the contract. An incentive fee actually encourages better cost per-
formance by the seller, and a possibility of shared savings exists between the seller and buyer
if performance criteria are exceeded. The qualification for exceeded performance must be
written into the contract and agreed to by both parties, as should the definition of allowable
costs; the seller can possibly lose the incentive fee if agreed-upon targets are not reached.
                                                               Procurement Planning               339




There is moderate risk for the buyer under the cost plus incentive fee contract, and if well
written, it can be more beneficial for both the seller and the buyer than a cost-reimbursable
contract.
Cost Plus Percentage of Cost (CPPC) In the cost plus percentage of cost (CPPC) contract,
the seller is reimbursed for allowable costs plus a fee that's calculated as a percentage of the
costs. The percentage is agreed upon beforehand and documented in the contract. Because
the fee is based on costs, the fee is variable. The lower the costs, the lower the fee, so the seller
doesn't have a lot of motivation to keep costs low. This is not a commonly used contract type.
Cost Plus Award Fee (CPAF) The cost plus award fee (CPAF) contract is the riskiest of the
cost plus contracts for the seller. In this contract, the seller will recoup all the costs expended
during the project but the award fee portion is subject to the sole discretion of the buyer. The
performance criteria for earning the award is spelled out in the contract, but these criteria
can be subjective and the awards are not usually contestable.

Time and Materials (T&M) Contracts
Time and materials (T&M) contracts are a cross between fixed-price and cost-reimbursable
contracts. The full amount of the material costs is not known at the time the contract is
awarded. This resembles a cost-reimbursable contract because the costs will continue to
grow during the contract's life and are reimbursable to the contractor. The buyer bears the
biggest risk in this type of contract.
   T&M contracts can resemble fixed-price contracts when unit rates are used, for
example. Unit rates might be used to preset the rates of certain elements or portions of the
project. For example, a contracting agency might charge you $150 per hour for a .NET
programmer, or a leasing company might charge you $2,000 per month for the hardware
you're leasing during the testing phase of your project. These rates are preset and agreed
upon by the buyer and seller ahead of time. T&M contracts are most often used when you
need human resources with specific skills and when you can quickly and precisely define
the scope of work needed for the project.

Understand the difference between fixed-price, cost-reimbursable, and time and materi-
als contracts for the exam. Also know when each type of contract should be used, and
know which party bears the most risk under each type of contract.



Tools and Techniques for Plan Procurement Management
The Plan Procurement Management process consists of five tools and techniques. They are
expert judgment, data analysis (make-or-buy analysis), data gathering (market research),
source selection analysis, and meetings. I've already covered expert judgment and meet-
ings, so you'll look at make-or-buy analysis followed by market research and then source
selection analysis.
340        Chapter 7      Planning Project Resources



Make-or-Buy Analysis (Data Analysis)
The main decision you're trying to get to in make-or-buy analysis is whether it's more cost
effective to buy the products and services or more cost effective for the organization to
produce the goods and services needed for the project. Costs should include both direct costs
(in other words, the actual cost to purchase the product or service) and indirect costs, such
as the salary of the manager overseeing the purchase process or ongoing maintenance costs.
Costs don't necessarily mean the cost to purchase. In make-or-buy analysis, you might weigh
the cost of leasing items against the cost of buying them. For example, perhaps your project
requires using a specialized piece of hardware that you know will be outdated by the end of
the project. In a case like this, leasing might be a better option so that when the project is
ready to be implemented, a newer version of the hardware can be tested and put into pro-
duction during rollout.
   Some of the analysis tools we discussed earlier in the book such as discounted cash flow,
net present value, internal rate of return, benefit-cost analysis, and return on investment
are useful in deriving a make-or-buy decision.
   Other considerations in make-or-buy analysis might include elements such as capacity
issues, skills, availability, and trade secrets. Strict control might be needed for a certain
process, and therefore, the process cannot be outsourced. Perhaps your organization has
the skills in-house to complete the project but your current project list is so backlogged that
you can't get to the new project for months, so you need to bring in a vendor.
   Make-or-buy analysis, a type of data analysis tool and technique, is considered a general
management technique and concludes with the decision to do one or the other.

Market Research (Data Gathering)
Market research can consist of a variety of methods to assist you or the team in deter-
mining vendors and their capabilities, and experience. My first go-to is using my favorite
search engine. This can reveal information about experience, market presence, customer
reviews, and more. Conferences are my second favorite method of discovering new
vendors or new services from vendors I know. I am generally concerned with a few key
items when engaging vendor services. First, I need to know their experience levels with my
particular project or industry. I also want to know the team members they are proposing
for the project and the depth and breadth of knowledge they have in the subject matter.
I want to interview them before they start work on the project and learn the financial
stability of the company.

Source Selection Analysis
Source selection analysis, also known as evaluation criteria, is usually determined when
developing the procurement details and is included with the procurement documents so your
bidders know how you will evaluate the proposal and help choose the winning bid. Accord-
ing to the PMBOK(R) Guide, source selection analysis may include the following:
Low Cost This one is obvious. The selection team will evaluate the proposals and choose
the one with the lowest cost. This evaluation technique is generally used for commodity type
items that are widely available in the marketplace.
                                                            Procurement Planning             341




Qualifications Qualifications criteria include elements such as the bidder's experience,
references, and expertise in the area of the service or goods you are seeking. This evaluation
technique is typically used for small procurements and when you don't need to, or do not
have the time to, perform a full-fledged procurement process.
Quality-Based and Highest Technical Score This evaluation method is based on the qual-
ity of the solution proposed by the bidders along with the bidder with the highest technical
score. This method is used when quality and technical criteria are more important than cost.
However, cost may still be considered when using this evaluation criteria (and cost infor-
mation should be requested from bidders) but would likely come into play only when two
or more bidders have the same technical score and the quality of the proposed solution is
relatively equal among the bidders.
Quality and Cost This evaluation method should also be relatively obvious. The evaluation
is based on the quality of the proposed solution along with cost.
Sole Source A sole source evaluation method is used when you have justification for
engaging only one vendor in the bidding process. For example, you may have a software
system that requires an upgrade and your organization wishes to continue to use the existing
system. A sole source could be used in this case since you need to ensure that the existing
system is upgraded by the same vendor who already supports the system.
Fixed Budget Fixed budget is just as it sounds. The total budget for the project or goods
is published with the procurement documents. This alerts your bidders that they need to
conform their bid, the scope of work, the quality of the solution, and resources, to the avail-
able budget. This type of procurement requires a detailed statement of work and assurance
that no changes to scope will be introduced during the project. Funding is limited in a fixed
budget scenario and can't be exceeded.


Plan Procurement Management Outputs
The Plan Procurement Management process consists of ten outputs. The first is the
procurement management plan. You've seen a few of the other outputs of this process
before, so you're probably already ahead of me on this one. But hold the phone--I'll be
sure to touch on the important points. The other outputs are the procurement strategy, bid
documents, procurement statement of work, source selection criteria, make-or-buy decisions,
independent cost estimates, change requests, project documents updates (lessons learned
register, milestone list, requirements documentation, requirements traceability matrix,
risk register, stakeholder register), and organizational process assets updates.

Procurement Management Plan
The procurement management plan details how the procurement process will be managed. The
procurement management plan is based primarily on the project scope, budget, and schedule,
and it ensures that the resources you'll need throughout the project are available at the right
time. According to the PMBOK(R) Guide, it includes the following information:
    The types of contract to use
    The authority of the project team and other stakeholders in the procurement process
342         Chapter 7      Planning Project Resources



      How the procurement process will be integrated with other project processes
      Where to find standard procurement documents (provided your organization uses
      standard documents)
      How the procurement process will be coordinated with other project processes, such as
      performance reporting and scheduling
      How the constraints and assumptions might be impacted by purchasing
      How independent estimates will be used during these processes
      Coordinating scheduled dates in the contract with the project schedule
      Time line for procurement activities
      The currency to be used for payments
      The legal jurisdiction that presides over the contract
      Identification of prequalified sellers (if known)
      Risk management issues
      Procurement metrics for managing contracts and for evaluating sellers
  The procurement management plan, like all the other management plans, is a compo-
nent of the project management plan.




Streamlining Purchases

Russ is a project manager for a real estate development company in Hometown, USA.
Recently he transferred to the office headquarters to develop a process for streamlining
purchases and purchase requests for the construction teams in the field. His first step
was to develop a procurement management plan for the construction managers to use
when ordering materials and equipment. Russ decided the procurement management
plan could be used as a template for all new projects. That meant the project managers
in the field didn't have to write their own procurement management plans when starting
new construction projects. They could use the template, which had many of the fields
prepopulated with corporate headquarters processes, and then they could fill in the infor-
mation specific to their project. For example, the Types of Contracts section states that all
equipment and materials purchases require fixed-price contracts. When human resources
are needed for the project on a contract basis, a T&M contract should be used with the
unit rates stated in the contract. A "not to exceed" amount should also be written into the
contract so that there are no surprises as to the total amount of dollars the company will
be charged for the resources.


   Remember earlier in the chapter I said the procurement department has the primary
role in procuring goods and services. The project team will be responsible for some steps
(such as preparing a statement of work), and the procurement team will handle others.
                                                          Procurement Planning             343




Your procurement management plan should include the action items needed to prepare the
procurement, and I recommend including the responsible party and due dates. Table 7.1
includes the action items outlined in the PMBOK(R) Guide with sample responsibilities for the
tasks. Be certain to check with your procurement department. You've been duly warned!

Procurement Strategy
Procurement strategy involves determining the contract type that will be used to procure the
goods or services, the delivery methods to use, and the procurement phases you'll use on
the project.
   The delivery methods for a services contract may include either using or restricting the
use of subcontractors, coming to an understanding of what services the vendor will provide
versus the organization procuring the services, and whether the seller can act as a represen-
tative of the buyer. It is common practice to engage professional services from consultants
who will act as a representative for your organization. Their job is to put the best interest
344        Chapter 7      Planning Project Resources



of your organization fi rst. They will help direct the work of the vendor who is performing
the services requested in the contract and ensure your organization is getting their money's
worth and that the requirements in the statement of work are being fulfi lled. The organiza-
tion's representative and the vendor performing the work should not be employed by the
same outside fi rm.
   Delivery methods for construction or industrial projects may use industry specific tech-
niques such as design build, design bid operate, build own operate, and turnkey.
   Procurement phases are defi ned so the team knows what sequence to perform the pro-
curement. This may also defi ne procurement milestones, a plan for monitoring the phases,
and criteria for moving from one phase to the next.

Bid Documents
Bid documents are used to solicit vendors and suppliers to bid on your procurement needs.
You're probably familiar with some of the titles of procurement documents. They might be
called request for proposal (RFP), request for information (RFI), invitation for bid (IFB),
request for quotation (RFQ), and so on.
   Bid documents should clearly state the description of the work requested, they should
include the contract SOW, and they should explain how sellers should format and submit
their responses. These documents are prepared by the buyer to ensure as accurate and com-
plete a response as possible from all potential bidders. Any special provisions or contractual
needs should be spelled out as well. For example, many organizations have data concerning
their marketing policies, new product introductions planned for the next few years, trade
secrets, and so on. The vendor will have access to this private information, and to guar-
antee that they maintain confidentiality, you should require that they sign a nondisclosure
agreement.
   A few terms that you should understand are used during this process; they are usually
used interchangeably even though they have distinct defi nitions. When your decision is
going to be made primarily on price, the terms bid and quotation are used, as in IFB or
RFQ. When considerations other than price (such as technology or specific approaches
to the project) are the deciding factors, the term proposal is used, as in RFP. These terms
are used interchangeably in practice, even though they have specific meanings in the
PMBOK(R) Guide.


                 In my organization, most solicitation requests are submitted as RFPs, even
                 though our primary decision factor is price.

or quotations are used when price is the only deciding factor among bidders. Proposals
are used when there are considerations other than price.

  Bid documents are posted or advertised according to your organizational policies. This
might include ads in newspapers and magazines or ads/posts on the Internet.

Procurement Statement of Work
A procurement statement of work (SOW) contains the details of the procurement item in
clear, concise terms. It includes the following elements:
    The project objectives
    A description of the work of the project and any post-project operational support
    needed
    Concise specifications of the products or services required
    The project schedule, time period of services, and work location
   The procurement SOW might be prepared by either the buyer or the seller. Buyers might
prepare the SOW and give it to the sellers, who in turn rewrite it so that they can price the
work properly. If the buyer does not know how to prepare an SOW or the seller would be
better at creating the SOW because of their expertise about the product or service, the seller
might prepare it and then give it to the buyer to review. In either case, the procurement
statement of work is developed from the project scope statement and the WBS and WBS
dictionary.
   The seller uses the SOW to determine whether they are able to produce the goods or ser-
vices as specified. In addition, it wouldn't hurt to include a copy of the WBS with the SOW.
Any information the seller can use to properly price the goods or services helps both sides
understand what's needed and how it will be provided.
   Projects might require some or all of the work of the project to be provided by a vendor.
The Plan Procurement Management process determines whether goods or services should
be produced within the organization or procured from outside, and if goods or services are
procured from outside, it describes what will be outsourced and what kind of contract to
use and then documents the information in the SOW and procurement management plan.
The SOW will undergo progressive elaboration as you proceed through the procurement
processes. There will likely be several iterations of the SOW before you get to the actual
contract award.


                 You used an SOW during the Develop Project Charter process. You can use
                 that SOW as the procurement SOW during this process if you're contract-
                 ing out the entire project. Otherwise, you can use just those portions of the
                 SOW that describe the work you've contracted.

   Another document similar to the SOW can be used when you are contracting for profes-
sional services. It's called a term of reference (TOR). The TOR contains similar elements
as the SOW. You'll want to include the tasks the vendor will complete, any standards that
apply to the project, a description of what should be submitted for approval by the buyer, a
schedule for reviews and approval, and so on.
346          Chapter 7      Planning Project Resources



Source Selection Criteria
The term source selection criteria refers to the method your organization will use to choose a
vendor from among the proposals you receive. The criteria might be subjective or objective.
In some cases, price might be the only criterion, and that means the vendor that submits the
lowest bid will win the contract. You should use purchase price (which should include costs
associated with purchase price, such as delivery and setup charges) as the sole criterion only
when you have multiple qualified sellers from which to choose.
    Other projects might require more extensive criteria than price alone. In this case,
you might use scoring models as well as rating models, or you might use purely subjec-
tive methods of selection. I described an example weighted-scoring method in Chapter 2,
"Creating the Project Charter." You can use this method to score vendor proposals.
    Sometimes, the source selection criteria are made public in the procurement process so
that vendors know exactly what you want in a vendor. This approach has pros and cons. If
the organization typically makes known the source selection criteria, you'll find that almost
all the vendors that bid on the project meet every criterion you've outlined (in writing, that
is). When it comes time to perform the contract, however, you might encounter some sur-
prises. The vendor might have done a great job of writing the bid based on your criteria,
but in reality they don't know how to put the criteria into practice. On the other hand, hav-
ing all the criteria publicly known beforehand gives ground to great discussion points and
discovery later in the procurement processes.
    The following list includes some of the criteria you can consider using for evaluating
proposals and bids:
      Comprehension and understanding of the needs of the project as documented in the
      contract SOW
      Cost, up front as well as total cost of ownership over the life of the product or service
      Technical ability of vendor and its proposed team
      Technical approach
      Risk
      Experience on projects of similar size and scope, including references
      Project management approach
      Management approach
      Business type and size
      Financial stability and capacity
      Production capacity
      Warranty or guarantee
      Reputation, references, and past performance
      Intellectual and proprietary rights
  You could include many of these in a weighted scoring model and rate each vendor on
how well they responded to these issues.
                                                            Procurement Planning                347




                  When considering business type and size, also consider whether the
                  business is a small business, a disadvantaged or minority-owned business,
                  or a women-owned business. Government organizations in particular may
                  require awarding a certain percentage of procurements to businesses that
                  fall within these categories.




The customer Relationship Management system Response

Ryan Hunter is preparing the source selection criteria for an RFP for a customer relationship
management (CRM) software system. After meeting with key stakeholders and other
project managers in the company who've had experience working on projects of this size
and scope, he devised the first draft of the source selection criteria. A partial list is as
follows:

    Successful bidder's response must detail how business processes (as documented in
    the RFP page 24) will be addressed with their solution.
    Successful bidder must document their project management approach, which must
    follow the PMBOK (R)Guide project practices. They must provide an example project
    management plan based on a previous project experience of similar size and scope
    to the one documented in the RFP.
    Successful bidder must document previous successful implementations, including
    integration with existing organization's telephony system and network operating sys-
    tem, and must provide references.
    Successful bidder must provide financial statements for the previous three years.



Make-or-Buy Decisions
The make-or-buy decision is a document that outlines the decisions made during the process
regarding which goods and/or services will be produced by the organization and which will
be purchased. This can include any number of items, such as services, products, insurance
policies, performance, and performance bonds.

Independent Cost Estimates
Your procurement department might conduct independent estimates (also known as should
cost estimates) of the costs of the proposal and compare these to the vendor prices. If there
are large differences between the independent estimate and the proposed vendor cost, one of
two things is happening: Either the statement of work (SOW) or the terms of the contract,
or both, are not detailed enough to allow the vendor to come up with an accurate cost, or
348        Chapter 7      Planning Project Resources



the vendor simply failed to respond to all the requirements laid out in the contract or SOW.
Independent estimates can also be used to verify schedule estimates and other project esti-
mates. The independent estimate can be prepared by internal resources, or you could engage
outside experts or professional estimators to come up with the independent estimate.

Change Requests
As you perform the Plan Procurement Management process, the project management plan,
including its subsidiary plans, may require changes due to vendor availability, vendor capa-
bility, or the vendor's proposed solution, as well as cost and quality considerations. Change
requests must be processed through the Perform Integrated Change Control process that
we'll discuss in Chapter 10, "Measuring and Controlling Project Performance."

Project Documents Updates
We've seen this output several times before. Some of the documents that may require updat-
ing as a result of the procurement processes are the lessons learned register, milestone list,
requirements documentation, the requirements traceability matrix, the risk register, the
stakeholder register, and others as needed.
   Now we'll switch our focus to the human resource needs for the project and discuss the
Plan Resource Management process next.



Overview of the Project Resource
Management Knowledge Area
I will cover all the aspects of the Project Resource Management Knowledge Area in the com-
ing chapters. In this section, I will focus on the tailoring considerations for resource man-
agement and the characteristics of this Knowledge Area when you're using an Agile project
management approach.
   Resources may be as varied and unique as your project. As the project manager, you'll
want to tailor the resource processes to the size and complexity of the project. According
to the PMBOK(R) Guide, you should also specifically consider the diversity of the team,
their physical location during the course of the project, and resources that may need to
be acquired who have industry-specific knowledge and experience. You'll also tailor the
acquisition of team resources to your organization's processes and will need to determine
whether resources come from inside or outside the organization (or both), and whether
you will need full-time or part-time resources. The management of the team will also be
tailored to the team itself. This will depend on the diversity of the team members, training
needs, organizational tools that may be needed, and so on.
   Remember that we discussed earlier in the book that Agile teams are self-organized
teams. If you're working in an Agile environment, the project manager serves more as the
coordinator and doesn't direct the work of the team. Self-organized teams require members
                                    Developing the Resource Management Plan                  349




with strong communication, collaboration, and problem-solving skills. Agile environ-
ments can also sometimes involve engaging different team members for different iterations
throughout the project. This will require close coordination with your human resources
and/or procurement department so that resources are available at the right time.



Developing the Resource
Management Plan
All projects require resources, from the smallest project to the largest. The Plan Resource
Management process documents human resources, as well as how to acquire, estimate, and
manage the physical resources, equipment, materials, and so on needed for the project.
   The human resources portion of the resource management plan documents the roles
and responsibilities of individuals or groups, and it documents the reporting relationships
for each. Reporting relationships can be assigned to groups as well as to individuals, and
the groups or individuals might be internal or external to the organization or a combina-
tion of both. Plan Communications Management goes hand in hand with Plan Resource
Management because the organizational structure affects the way communications are car-
ried out among project participants and the project interfaces.
   When developing the resource management plan, the primary output of this process,
you'll have to consider factors such as the availability of resources, skill levels, training
needs, and more. Remember that availability of resources applies to physical resources as
well as human resources. If you need a specialized piece of equipment to perform work on
the project, for example, you'll want to ensure that it is available at the time indicated on
the project schedule. If you are working with a contractor to obtain or lease the equipment,
be certain to document the functions the equipment must perform and the specific time
frame it's needed in the SOW. Each of these factors can have an impact on the project cost,
schedule, and quality and may introduce risks not previously considered.


                  For the exam, remember that the Estimate Activity Resources process
                  is part of the Project Resource Management Knowledge Area that we're
                  discussing in this section. You will recall that activity resource estimates
                  are needed to construct the project schedule so we covered Estimate
                  Activity Resources in Chapter 4, "Creating the Project Schedule."


Plan Resource Management Inputs
Plan Resource Management has five inputs: project charter, project management plan (qual-
ity management plan, scope baseline), project documents (project schedule, requirements
documentation, risk register, stakeholder register), enterprise environmental factors, and
organizational process assets. We'll look at the key elements of several of these inputs next.
350        Chapter 7      Planning Project Resources



Project Management Plan
The project management plan consists of many of the subsidiary plans and baselines we have
already discussed. During this process, you might want to consider several of them, including
the quality management plan and scope baseline. The quality management plan will help you
identify the resources needed to fulfill the quality metrics defined for the project. The scope
baseline describes the deliverables and WBS elements needed to satisfy the objectives of the
project. These will help you define the skill sets and capabilities your project resources need
to complete the work.

Project Documents
Project documents such as the project schedule, requirements documents, the risk register,
and stakeholder register will help you to determine the makeup of the project team. The
schedule tells you when milestones and deliverables are due. You'll need resources who are
available to work during those time frames. The stakeholder register document describes
the communication needs of the stakeholders and could be helpful in determining team
members. Another document to consider is the risk register. It lists the risk owners and their
responsibility, so be certain to check this document when outlining roles and responsibilities
for team members.

Key Enterprise Environmental Factors
Enterprise environmental factors play a key role in determining human resource roles and
responsibilities. The type of organization you work in, the reporting relationships, and the
technical skills needed to complete the project work are a few of the factors you should
consider when developing the staffing management plan, which is a subset of the human
resource management plan. Here is a list of some of the factors you should consider during
this process:
Organizational Factors Consider what departments or organization units will have a role
in the project, the interactions between and among departments, organizational culture, and
the level of formality among these working relationships.
Existing Resources and Availability The existing base of resources that are employed by, or
available to, the organization should be considered when developing the resource manage-
ment plan as well as the availability of other resources, materials, and supplies.
Location and Logistics Consider where the project team is physically located and whether
they are all located together or at separate facilities (or cities or countries). Consider where
facilities and materials and supplies are located and their logistics.
Marketplace Conditions Marketplace conditions will dictate the availability of resources
you're acquiring outside the organization and their costs or rate.
   In addition to these factors, you should consider constraints that pertain to project
teams, including the following:
Organizational Structures Organizational structures can be constraints. For example, a
strong matrix organization provides the project manager with much more authority and
                                     Developing the Resource Management Plan                     351




power than the weak matrix organization does. Functional organizations typically do not
empower their project managers with the proper authority to carry out a project. If you
work in a functional organization as I do, it's important to be aware that you'll likely face
power struggles with other managers and, in some cases, a flat-out lack of cooperation.
Don't tell them I said this, but functional managers tend to be territorial and aren't likely to
give up control easily. Here's the best advice I have for you in this case:
         Establish open communications early in the project.
         Include all the functional managers with key roles in important decisions.
         Get the support of your project sponsor to empower you (as the project manager)
         with as much authority as possible. It's important that the sponsor makes it clear
         to the other managers that their cooperation on project activities is expected.
Collective Bargaining Agreements Collective bargaining agreements are actually contrac-
tual obligations of the organization to the employees. Collective bargaining is typically
associated with unions and organized employee associations. Other organized employee
associations or groups might require specialized reporting relationships as well--especially
if they involve contractual obligations. You will not likely be involved in the negotiations of
collective bargaining agreements, but if you have an opportunity to voice opinions regarding
employee duties or agreements that would be helpful to your project or future projects, by
all means take it.
Economic Conditions These conditions refer to the availability of funds for the project
team to perform training, hire staff, and travel. If funds are severely limited and your project
requires frequent trips to other locations, you have an economic constraint on your hands.



Exam Spotlight

For the exam, understand the key environmental factors (organizational factors, existing
human resources and market conditions, personnel policies, technical factors, interper-
sonal factors, location and logistics, and political factors) and the three constraints (orga-
nizational structures, collective bargaining agreements, and economic conditions) that
can impact the Plan Human Resource Management process.



Organizational Process Assets
You should consider several elements of the organizational process assets input during this
process. They are human resource policies and procedures, templates and checklists, histori-
cal information, safety and security policies, and physical resource management policies and
procedures. You may also consider escalation procedures for the team and the organization
as a whole if your organization has these documented. Be certain you have an understanding
of the personnel policies in the organization regarding hiring, firing, and tasking employees,
along with the organization's holiday schedules, leave time policies, and so on.
   The term templates, in this case, refers to documentation such as project descriptions,
organizational charts, performance appraisals, and the organization's conflict management
352        Chapter 7      Planning Project Resources



process. Checklists might include elements such as training requirements, project roles and
responsibilities, skills and competency levels, and safety issues.



Exam Spotlight

Using templates and checklists is one way to ensure that you don't miss any key respon-
sibilities when planning the project and will help reduce the amount of time spent on
project planning.



Plan Resource Management Tools and Techniques
The Plan Resource Management process consists of four tools and techniques. Remem-
ber that your goal is to produce the resource management plan output of this process that
includes a description of the team's roles and responsibilities, organizational charts, and a
project team resource plan. You'll see that the tools and techniques of this process directly
contribute to the components of the resource management plan. They are expert judgment,
data representation (hierarchical-type charts, responsibility assignment matrix, text-oriented
formats), organizational theory, and meetings. We've discussed expert judgment and meet-
ings previously, so let's take a look at the remaining tools and techniques next.

Data Representation (Hierarchical-Type Charts, Responsibility
Assignment Matrix, Text-Oriented Formats)
Data representation consists of hierarchical-type charts, responsibility assignment matrix
(RAM), and text-oriented formats. We'll look at each of these next.
Hierarchical-Type Charts Hierarchical charts, like a WBS, are designed in a top-down for-
mat. An organization chart is a type of hierarchical chart that lists your position, your boss,
your boss's boss, your boss's boss's boss, and so on. Typically, the organization chart shows
the organization or department head at the top, the management employees who report to
the organization head are next, and so on, descending down the structure. An organization
breakdown structure (OBS) is a form of organization chart that shows the departments,
work units, or teams within an organization (rather than individuals) and their respective
work packages.
A resource breakdown structure (RBS) is another type of hierarchical chart that breaks
down the work of the project according to the types of resources needed. (RBS also stands
for risk breakdown structure, as you learned in the previous chapter.) For example, you
might have programmers, database analysts, and network analysts as resource types on the
RBS. However, they won't all necessarily work on the project team. You might have pro-
grammers reporting to the project team, the finance department, and the customer service
department, for example. An RBS can help track project costs because it ties to the organiza-
tion's accounting system. Let's suppose you have programming resources in the RBS at the
junior, advanced, and senior levels. Each of these levels of programmer has an average hourly
                                          Developing the Resource Management Plan         353




salary recorded in the accounting system that makes it easy for you to track project costs.
Ten senior programmers, 14 advanced programmers, and 25 junior-level programmers are
easy to calculate and track.
Responsibility Assignment Matrix (RAM) Matrix-based charts are used to show the type
of resources and the responsibility they have on the project. Many times a project manager
will use a responsibility assignment matrix (RAM) to graphically display this information.
A RAM is usually depicted as a chart with resource names listed in each row (for example,
programmers, testers, and trainers) and project phases or WBS elements listed as the col-
umns. (It can also be constructed using team member names.) Indicators in the intersections
show where the resources are needed. However, the level of detail is up to you. One RAM
might be developed showing only project phases; another RAM might show level-two WBS
elements for a complex project, with more RAMs subsequently produced for the additional
WBS levels; or a RAM might be constructed with level-three elements only.



Exam Spotlight

The RAM relates the OBS to the WBS to ensure that every component of the work of the
project is assigned to an individual.


Table 7.2 shows a type of RAM called an RACI chart for a software development team. In
this example, the RACI chart shows the level of accountability each of the participants has
on the project. The letters in the acronym RACI are the designations shown in the chart:
   R = Responsible for performing the work
   A = Accountable, the one who oversees producing the deliverable or work package,
   approves or signs off on the work, and makes decisions regarding the work
   C = Consult, someone who has input to the work or decisions
   I = Inform, someone who must be informed of the decisions or results

Ta b l e 7. 2      Sample RACI* chart, a type of RAM


                             Olga                  Rae         Jantira          Nirmit

Design                       R                     A           C                C

Test                         I                     R           C/I              A

Implement                    C                     I           R/A              C

Review                       R/A                   C           C/I              C/I

*R = Responsible, A = Accountable, C = Consult, I = Inform
354         Chapter 7        Planning Project Resources



In this example, Olga is responsible for design, meaning she creates the software program-
ming design document, but Rae is accountable and is the one who must make sure the work
of the project is completed and approved. She will also make decisions regarding issues that
arise involving this task. Jantira is both responsible and accountable for the implement task
and should be consulted and informed regarding the test task. A RACI chart is a great tool
because it shows at a glance not only where a resource is working but what that resource's
responsibility level is on the project.
Keep in mind that this is only one type of RAM chart. You may choose to use other designa-
tions in place of R-A-C-I.
Text-Oriented Formats Text-oriented formats are used when you have a significant amount
of detail to record. These are also called position descriptions or role-responsibility-authority
forms. These forms detail (as the name implies) the role, responsibility, and authority of the
resource, and they make great templates to use for future projects.

Organizational Theory
Organizational theory refers to all the theories that attempt to explain what makes people,
teams, and work units perform the way they do. I'll talk more about motivation techniques
(which are a type of organizational theory) in Chapter 8, "Developing the Project Team."
Organizational theory improves the probability that planning will be effective and helps
shorten the amount of time it takes to produce the Plan Resource Management outputs.
   While the topic is not specifically mentioned in the PMBOK(R) Guide, I would recom-
mend brushing up on your networking skills as well--that is, you know someone who
knows someone and you can share information, learn new techniques, and interact with
each other. Several types of networking activities exist, including proactive communica-
tion, lunch meetings (my personal favorite), informal conversations (ah, the information
you learn by hanging out at the espresso machine), and trade conferences (another favorite
because they get you out of the office). Networking might help when you have a specific
resource need on the project but can't seem to locate someone with that set of skills.


Plan Resource Management Outputs
The Plan Resource Management process has three outputs: the resource management plan,
team charter, and project documents updates (assumption log, risk register). According to
the PMBOK(R) Guide, the resource management plan, a subsidiary or component of the
project management plan, documents how resources should be defined, staffed, managed
and controlled, and released from the project when their activities are complete. It also helps
in establishing an effective project team by defining the types of resources needed during
the project, documenting when they're needed, and providing direction regarding how the
resources should be managed.
   This output has several components:

      Acquiring resources
                                       Developing the Resource Management Plan                  355



    Roles and responsibilities
    Project organizational charts
    Project team resource management
    Training
    Team development
    Resource control
    Recognition plan
   The resource management plan will help you to create the project organizational struc-
ture. This structure will be documented using project organizational charts. I've already
covered this in detail, so we'll look at a few of the other components of the resource man-
agement plan now. Several of these components are put into action during the Executing
processes and have processes of their own. We'll discuss most of these elements in detail in
Chapter 8.

Acquiring Resources
This describes how team members are acquired (from inside or outside the organization),
where they're located, and the costs for specific skills and expertise. It also describes the
process for acquiring the physical resource needs for the project.

Roles and Responsibilities
This component of the resource management plan is the list of roles and responsibilities for
the project team. It can take the form of the RAM or RACI chart I talked about earlier, or
the roles and responsibilities can be recorded in text format. According to the PMBOK(R)
Guide, the following are the key elements you should include in the roles and responsibilities
documentation:
Role Describes the parts of the project for which the individuals or teams are accountable.
This should also include a description of authority levels, responsibilities, and what work is
not included as part of the role.
Authority Describes the amount of authority the resource has to make decisions, dictate
direction, and approve the work.
Responsibility     Describes the work the person is required to perform to complete the proj-
ect activities.
Competency        Describes the skills and ability needed to perform the project activities.

Resource Management
This output refers to how you'll staff the team, manage the team, and release team members.
Attention should be given to how you'll release project team members at the end of their
assignments. You should have reassignment procedures in place to move folks on to other
projects or back to assignments they had before the project. This reduces overall project
356        Chapter 7               Planning Project Resources



costs because you pay them only for the time they work and then release them. You won't
have a tendency to simply keep them busy between assignments or until the end of their
scheduled end date if they complete their activities early. Having these procedures in place
will also improve morale because everyone will be clear about how reassignment will occur.
This should reduce anxiety about their opportunities for employment at the conclusion of
the project or their assignments.
   Resource management involves determining when resources are available to work on
the project and when the recruitment process should begin. The resources can be described
individually, by teams, or by function (programmers, testers, and so on). A resource histo-
gram can be used to graphically display when resources are required. This is usually drawn
in chart form, with project time along the horizontal axis and hours needed along the verti-
cal axis. Figure 7.1 is an example of a histogram that shows the hours needed for an asphalt
crew on a construction project.

Training Needs and Team Development
This describes any training plans needed for team members who don't have the required
skills or abilities to perform project tasks. You should also consider and document team
development techniques you'll use during the project to keep team members motivated and
engaged.

Resource Control
This component deals with the management of physical resources on the project such as
equipment, supplies, and materials, and making certain that the resources are procured and
available when needed throughout the project.

Recognition and Rewards
This describes the systems you'll use to reward and reinforce desired behavior.

Be sure you understand the roles and responsibilities along with the other elements of
the resource management plan for the exam.



Team Charter
This document is best if it's developed by the team members themselves. They come up with
the ground rules for team behavior, communication guidelines, codes of conduct, conflict res-
olution, and more. There are several benefits of having the team develop a set of team values
and expectations and document them. It keeps team member disagreements or misunder-
standings to a minimum, increases productivity, and ensures buy-in from the team members,
and thus more likelihood of adhering to the agreements, because they developed the rules of
engagement and agreements on their own.



Exam Spotlight

Ground rules (a tool and technique of the Manage Stakeholder Engagement process) are
defined in the team charter.


   In the next section, we'll shift our focus once again but to a completely new topic. We'll
look at quality and its effect on the project planning processes.



Project Quality Management Knowledge
Area Overview
Quality is an important element of all projects. You can work hard, produce results, meet
timelines, and stay on budget. But your stakeholders will immediately notice if quality is not
up to expectations. Customer expectations are key in managing quality. The quality process-
es help you define, manage, and control all aspects of quality associated with the project.
   We'll discuss several aspects of quality in this chapter and future chapters as well.
One of those involves continuous improvement. You'll recall we talked about the Plan-
Do-Check-Act cycle in Chapter 1, "What Is a Project?" This is one method you can use
to improve quality. Others quality methodologies include total quality management, Six
Sigma, and Lean Six Sigma.
   Quality considerations will depend on the type of project you're managing and the deliv-
erables of the project. As with all the other Knowledge Areas, you'll want to tailor the way
358         Chapter 7      Planning Project Resources



these processes are used throughout the project. For example, you may have regulatory
compliance considerations or standards regulations to consider that will dictate to what
level you need to apply the quality processes.
    In an Agile methodology, quality is almost built-in because each sprint retrospective
examines what went well (or not) and the quality of the process and deliverables. The
beauty of an iteration is that you are working on only a small portion of the deliverable at a
time and quality issues will become apparent early on, allowing the team to correct future
iterations without losing a lot of time or causing harm to the end product.



Quality Planning
Quality is affected by the triple constraints (project scope, schedule, and cost), and quality
concerns are found in all projects. Quality typically defines whether stakeholder expectations
were met. Being on time and on budget is one thing; if you deliver the wrong product or an
inferior product, on time and on budget suddenly don't mean much.
   The Plan Quality Management process is concerned with targeting quality standards
that are relevant to the project at hand and devising a plan to meet and satisfy those stan-
dards. It describes how quality will be managed and how quality will be verified through-
out the course of the project. The quality management plan is an output of this process that
describes how the quality policy will be implemented by the project management team dur-
ing the course of the project. Everything discussed in this section, including the inputs and
tools and techniques of this process, will be used to help develop this primary output.



Exam Spotlight

Plan Quality Management is a key process performed during the Planning processes and
when developing the project management plan. It should be performed in conjunction
with other Planning processes. According to the PMBOK (R) Guide, quality should be
planned, designed, and built-in--not just inspected.



Plan Quality Management Inputs
The Plan Quality Management process has several inputs:
      Project charter
      Project management plan (requirements management plan, risk management plan,
      stakeholder engagement plan, scope baseline)
      Project documents (assumption log, requirements documentation, requirements trace-
      ability matrix, risk register, stakeholder register)
      Enterprise environmental factors
      Organizational process assets
                                                                 Quality Planning          359




   One of the key components of the project management plan is the scope baseline. We
talked about the scope baseline in Chapter 3, "Developing the Project Scope Statement";
recall that the scope baseline consists of the approved project scope statement, the WBS,
and the WBS dictionary. For the exam, remember that the scope baseline is based on the
project scope and requirements. The other baselines you should consider are the sched-
ule baseline, which includes the project and activity start and finish dates, and the cost
baseline.
   The two key elements I'll cover regarding inputs are standards and regulations, which
are part of the enterprise environmental factors input, and the quality policy, which is part
of the organizational process assets input.

Standards and Regulations
The project manager should consider any standards, regulations, guidelines, or rules that
exist concerning the work of the project when writing the quality plan. A standard is some-
thing that's approved by a recognized body and that employs rules, guidelines, or charac-
teristics that should be followed. For example, the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA)
has established standards for web page designers that outline alternative viewing options of
web pages for people with disabilities. PMI(R) guidelines regarding project management are
another example of standards.
   Standards aren't legally mandatory, but it's a good idea to follow them. Many organi-
zations (or industries) have standards in place that are proven best practice techniques.
Disregarding accepted standards can have significant consequences. For example, if you're
creating a new software product that ignores standard protocols, your customers won't be
able to use it. Standards can be set by the organization, independent bodies, organizations
such as the International Organization for Standardization (ISO), and so on. ISO develops
and publishes international standards on various subjects, including mathematics, infor-
mation technology, railway engineering, construction materials and building, and much
more. More than 160 countries have participating members (one member per country) in
ISO's national standards institutes. ISO is not a government organization, but it works
closely with government and the private sector to establish standards in many disciplines to
meet the needs of business and society. You can find out more about ISO at www.iso.org.
According to the PMBOK(R) Guide, the Project Quality Management Knowledge Area is
designed to be in alignment with the ISO.
   A regulation is mandatory. Regulations are almost always imposed by governments or
institutions such as the American Medical Association. Organizations might have their
own self-imposed regulations that you should be aware of as well. Regulations require
strict adherence, particularly in the case of government-imposed regulations, or stiff penal-
ties and fines could result--maybe even jail time if the offense is serious enough. Hmm, it
might be tough to practice project management from behind bars--not a recommended
career move.
   If possible, it's a good idea to include information from the quality policy (I'll cover
this in the next section) and any standards, regulations, or guidelines that affect the
project in the quality management plan. If it's not possible to include this information in
360         Chapter 7      Planning Project Resources



the quality management plan, then at least refer to the information and where it can be
found. It's the project management team's responsibility to be certain all stakeholders are
aware of and understand the policy issues and standards or regulations that might impact
the project.


                   Contracts might have certain provisions for quality requirements that you
                   should account for in the quality management plan. If the quality manage-
                   ment plan was written prior to the Plan Procurement Management pro-
                   cess, you should update the quality management plan to reflect it.


Quality Policy
The quality policy is part of the organization's quality management system, which is part of
the organizational process assets input. It's a guideline published by executive management
that describes what quality policies should be adopted for projects the company undertakes.
It's up to the project manager to understand this policy and incorporate any predetermined
company guidelines into the quality plan. If a quality policy does not exist, it's up to the
project management team to create one for the project.



exam spotlight

It is the responsibility of the project management team to ensure that all key project
stakeholders are aware of and have received copies of the quality policy.



Tools and Techniques for Plan Quality Management
The Plan Quality Management process has seven tools and techniques used to help construct
the quality management plan:
      Expert judgment
      Data gathering (benchmarking, brainstorming, interviews)
      Data analysis (cost-benefit analysis, cost of quality)
      Decision making (multicriteria decision analysis)
      Data representation (flowcharts, logical data model, matrix diagrams, mind mapping)
      Test and inspection planning
      Meetings
   We'll take a look at the key tools and techniques of this process, along with some other
tools and techniques that are not mentioned in this process but will be beneficial in the
quality planning process.
                                                                  Quality Planning          361




Expert Judgment
Expert judgment is important when developing a quality management plan. You'll want
people who have experience or knowledge of several quality techniques including: quality
assurance, quality control, how to perform quality measurements, how to improve quality,
and quality systems.

Benchmarking
Benchmarking is a process of comparing previous similar activities to the current proj-
ect activities to provide a standard to measure performance against. This comparison will
also help you derive ideas for quality improvements on the current project. For example,
if your current printer can produce 8 pages per minute and you're considering a new
printer that produces 14 pages per minute, the benchmark is 8 pages per minute.

Cost-Benefit Analysis (Data Analysis)
You've seen the cost-benefit analysis technique before in the Initiating process group. In the
case of quality management, you'll want to consider the trade-offs of the cost of quality. It's
cheaper and more efficient to prevent defects in the first place than to spend time and money
fixing them later. The benefits of meeting quality requirements are as follows:
    Stakeholder satisfaction is increased.
    Costs are lower.
    Productivity is higher.
    There is less rework.
  The primary cost of meeting quality requirements for a project is the expense incurred
while performing project quality management activities.

Cost of Quality (Data Analysis)
The cost of quality (COQ) is the total cost to produce the product or service of the project
according to the quality standards and/or the cost to make a product or service that does not
meet the quality requirements. These costs include all the work necessary to meet the prod-
uct requirements whether the work was planned or unplanned. It also includes the costs of
work performed due to nonconforming quality requirements, assessing whether the product
or service meets requirements, and rework.
   Three costs are associated with the cost of quality:
Prevention Costs Prevention means keeping defects out of the hands of customers. Prevention
costs are the costs associated with satisfying customer requirements by creating a product
without defects. These costs are manifested early in the process and include aspects such as
Plan Quality Management, training, equipment, documenting, and taking the time to do
things right.
Appraisal Costs Appraisal costs are the costs expended to examine the product or pro-
cess and make certain the requirements are being met. Appraisal costs might include costs
362           Chapter 7      Planning Project Resources



associated with aspects such as inspections and testing. Prevention and appraisal costs are
often passed on to the acquiring organization because of the limited duration of the project.
Failure Costs Failure costs are what it costs when things don't go according to plan. Failure
costs are also known as cost of poor quality. Two types of failure costs exist:
      Internal Failure Costs These result when customer requirements are not satisfied while
      the product is still in the control of the organization. Internal failure costs might include
      corrective action, rework, scrapping, and downtime.
      External Failure Costs External failure costs, unfortunately, are when the customer de-
      termines that the requirements have not been met. Costs associated with external failure
      costs might include inspections at the customer site, warranty work, returns, liabilities,
      lost business, and additional customer service costs.
   There are two categories of costs within COQ: the cost of conformance and the cost
of nonconformance. Conformance costs are associated with activities undertaken to
avoid failures, whereas nonconformance costs are those undertaken because a failure has
occurred. All of the types of costs of quality we just covered fall into one of these catego-
ries. Table 7.3 is a quick reference.

Ta b l e 7. 3       Cost of conformance and nonconformance


Conformance costs                                          Nonconformance costs

Prevention costs                                           Internal failure costs

Appraisal costs                                            External failure costs




                     The cost of quality can be affected by project decisions. Let's say you're
                     producing a new product. Unfortunately, the product scope description
                     or project scope statement was inadequate in describing the functionality
                     of the product. The project team created the product exactly as specified
                     in the project scope statement, the WBS, and other planning documents.
                     Once the product hit the store shelves, the organization was bombarded
                     with returns and warranty claims because of the poor quality. Therefore,
                     your project decisions impacted the cost of quality. Recalls of products can
                     also impact the cost of quality.

   Cost of quality is a topic you'll likely encounter on the exam. The following sections will
discuss some of the pioneers in this field. To make sure the product or service meets stake-
holders' expectations, quality must be planned into the project and not inspected in after
the fact.
                                                                   Quality Planning           363




   Four people in particular are responsible for the rise of the modern quality manage-
ment movement and the theories behind the cost of quality: Philip B. Crosby, Joseph M.
Juran, W. Edwards Deming, and Walter Shewhart. Each of these men developed steps
or points that led to commonly accepted quality processes that we use today and either
developed or were the foundation for the development of quality theories such as Total
Quality Management, Six Sigma, cost of quality, and continuous improvement. I'll also
cover a quality technique called the Kaizen approach that originated in Japan and discuss
Capability Maturity Model Integration.

Philip B. Crosby
Philip B. Crosby devised the zero defects practice, which means, basically, do it right the first
time. (Didn't your dad used to tell you that?) Crosby says that costs will increase when quality
planning isn't performed up front, which means you'll have to engage in rework, thereby
affecting productivity. Prevention is the key to Crosby's theory. If you prevent the defect
from occurring in the first place, costs are lower, conformance to requirements is easily met,
and the cost measurement for quality becomes the cost of nonconformance rather than the
cost of rework.

Joseph M. Juran
Joseph M. Juran is noted for his fitness for use premise. Simply put, this means the stake-
holders' and customers' expectations are met or exceeded. This says that conformance to
specifications--meaning the product of the project that was produced is what the project
set out to produce--is met or exceeded. Fitness for use specifically reflects the customers' or
stakeholders' view of quality and answers the following questions:
    Did the product or service produced meet the quality expectation?
    Did it satisfy a real need?
    Is it reliable and safe?
   Juran also proposed that there could be grades of quality. However, you should not con-
fuse grade with quality. Grade is a category for products or services that are of the same
type but have differing technical characteristics. Quality describes how well the product or
service (or characteristics of the product or service) fulfills the requirements. Low quality is
usually not an acceptable condition; however, low grade might be. For example, your new
Dad's Dollars Credit Card software tracking system might be of high quality, meaning it
has no bugs and the product performs as advertised, but of low grade, meaning it has few
features. You'll almost always want to strive for high quality, regardless of the acceptable
grade level.

364       Chapter 7      Planning Project Resources



W. Edwards Deming
W. Edwards Deming suggested that as much as 85 percent of the cost of quality is manage-
ment's problem and responsibility. Once the quality issue has hit the floor, or the worker
level, the workers have little control. For example, if you're constructing a new highway
and the management team that bid on the project proposed using inferior-grade asphalt, the
workers laying the asphalt have little control over its quality. They're at the mercy of the
management team responsible for purchasing the supplies.
   Deming also proposed that workers cannot figure out quality on their own and, there-
fore, cannot perform at their best until they are shown what acceptable quality is. He
believed that workers need to be shown what acceptable quality is and that they need to be
made to understand that quality and continuous improvement are necessary elements of
any organization--or project, in your case.
   Many consider Deming to be a major contributor to the Total Quality Management
(TQM) theory. TQM, like Deming, says that the process is the problem, not people. Every
person and all activities the company undertakes are involved with quality. TQM stipulates
that quality must be managed in and that quality improvement should be a continuous way
of doing business, not a onetime performance of a specific task or process.



Exam Spotlight

There is some controversy surrounding who is the actual founder of TQM. Some say
Deming, but others say Armand V. Feigenbaum. For the exam, I recommend knowing
that Feigenbaum is the founder of TQM and Deming believes quality is a management
issue. Six Sigma is a quality management approach that is similar to TQM and is typically
used in manufacturing and service-related industries. Six Sigma is a measurement-based
strategy that focuses on process improvement and variation reduction, which you can
achieve by applying Six Sigma methodologies to the project. There are two Six Sigma
methodologies. The first is known as DMADV (define, measure, analyze, design, and ver-
ify) and is used to develop new processes or products at the Six Sigma level. The second
is called DMAIC (define, measure, analyze, improve, and control) and is used to improve
existing processes or products. Another tidbit you should know about Six Sigma is that
it aims to eliminate defects and stipulates that no more than 3.4 defects per million are
produced.


Walter Shewhart
Some sources say that Walter Shewhart is the grandfather of TQM, which was further
popularized by Feigenbaum and Deming. Shewhart developed statistical tools to examine
when a corrective action must be applied to a process. He invented control chart tech-
niques (control charts are a tool and technique of the Control Quality process) and was
also the inventor of the Plan-Do-Check-Act cycle that I talked about in Chapter 1.
                                                                 Quality Planning         365




Kaizen Approach
The Kaizen approach is a quality technique from Japan. In fact, Kaizen means continuous
improvement in Japanese. With this technique, all project team members and managers
should be constantly watching for quality improvement opportunities. The Kaizen approach
states that you should improve the quality of the people first and then the quality of the
products or service.
   Continuous improvement involves everyone in the organization watching for ways to
improve quality, whether incrementally or by incorporating new ideas into the process.
This involves taking measurements, improving processes by making them repeatable
and systemized, reducing variations in production or performance, reducing defects, and
improving cycle times. TQM and Six Sigma are examples of continuous improvement.

Capability Maturity Model Integration
The Capability Maturity Model Integration (CMMI) is used to help organizations assess and
improve performance. CMMI is used in many areas such as engineering, project manage-
ment, organizational development, and more. CMMI models are based on five stages of
development, ranging from almost no formal processes to the fifth stage, where a state of
continuous, sustained improvements is reached. You may have heard about CMMI as it
relates to project management. There are differing measures and stages of development
depending on the industry, but most CMMI models have the following stages:
1.   No formal processes are in place.
2.   Basic processes exist but aren't standardized across the organization.
3.   Best practices are in place and are standardized across the organization.
4.   Best practices are in place and standardized across the organization, and they are mea-
     surable using quantifiable methods.
5.   Continuous, sustained improvements are realized.
   You can measure your organization's maturity regarding project management practices
as a whole, or you can take it one step further and measure maturity in each of the 10
Knowledge Areas. Since we're discussing quality in this chapter, remember that CMMI can
also be used to measure quality processes.



Exam Spotlight

For the exam, understand each of these theories on the cost of quality. Here's a key to
help you remember:

     Crosby = Zero defects and prevention of rework results.
     Juran = Fitness for use, conformance. Quality by design.
     Deming = Quality is a management problem.
     Feigenbaum = Founder of TQM.
366         Chapter 7      Planning Project Resources




      Shewhart = Plan-Do-Check-Act cycle.
      TQM = Quality must be managed and must be a continuous process.
      Six Sigma = Six Sigma is a measurement-based strategy; no more than 3.4 defects
      per million opportunities.
      Kaizen = Continuous improvement; improve quality of people first.
      Continuous improvement = Watch continuously for ways to improve quality.
      CMMI = Assesses and improves performance by measuring the maturity levels of the
      organization.



Decision Making
We've discussed multicriteria decision making previously. This tool identifies alternatives that
can be prioritized and applied to quality elements of the project.
   Force field analysis is another decision-making technique that examines the drivers and
resistors of a decision. You could use the old T-square approach and list all the drivers
down the left column and all the resistors in the right. Determine which of the elements in
the list are barriers and which are enablers to the project. Assign a priority or rank to each,
and develop strategies for leveraging the strengths of the high-priority enablers while mini-
mizing the highest-ranked barriers.

Data Representation (Flowcharts, Logical Data Model,
Matrix Diagrams, Mind Mapping)
You will recall from Chapter 6 that a flowchart graphically depicts the relationships between
and among steps. They typically show activities, decision points, and the flow or order of
steps in a process. Flowcharts may point out possible quality issues and are a great tool for
the project team to use when reviewing quality results. They can also be helpful in deter-
mining the cost of quality by estimating the expected costs of conformance and nonconfor-
mance.
   Matrix diagrams can show the relationships between various causes or other factors
by examining the rows and columns in the matrix. Recall from earlier in this chapter
that a RACI diagram is a matrix type chart. According to the PMBOK(R) Guide, sev-
eral matrix diagrams are used in the quality processes, including an L, T, Y, X, C, and
roof-shaped.
   We've discussed mind mapping previously as well. This is a diagramming method
that allows you to brainstorm ideas and then associate and group like ideas together.
This is useful for determining quality requirements, identifying quality constraints, and
determining relationships or dependencies that exist among and between quality ele-
ments and the project. These might be related to deliverables, quality policies, regula-
tions, and so on.
                                                                   Quality Planning             367




Test and Inspection Planning
Test and inspection criteria are developed during the Plan Quality Management process and
will be used throughout the remainder of the project to determine if the quality standards
are being met. Testing and inspection will vary depending on the type of project you're
working on. For example, construction projects may require testing to determine weight
limits or durability. Manufacturing projects may require inspection to determine if parts are
being produced according to the specifications. Software projects require testing throughout
their development and a final user acceptance test to determine if the system performs as
designed.
   Statistical sampling is a type of inspection technique that involves taking a sample num-
ber of parts from the whole population and inspecting them to determine whether they fall
within acceptable variances.

Design of Experiments
Design of experiments (DOE) is not a named tool and technique of this process, but you
should know this technique for the exam. DOE is a statistical technique that identifies the
elements--or variables--that will have the greatest effect on overall project outcomes. It
is used most often concerning the product of the project but can also be applied to project
management processes to examine trade-offs. DOE designs and sets up experiments to de-
termine the ideal solution for a problem using a limited number of sample cases. It analyzes
several variables at once, allowing you to change all (or some of) the variables at the same
time and determine which combination will produce the best result at a reasonable cost.



Exam Spotlight

For the exam, remember that the key to DOE is that it equips you with a statistical framework
that allows you to change the variables that have the greatest effect on overall project
outcomes at once instead of changing one variable at a time.



Plan Quality Management Outputs
Plan Quality Management uses many techniques to determine the areas of quality improve-
ment that can be implemented, controlled, and measured throughout the rest of the project,
as you've seen. These are recorded in the primary output of this process, which is called the
quality management plan. The following list includes all the outputs of this process:
    Quality management plan
    Quality metrics
    Project management plan updates (risk management plan, scope baseline)
    Project documents updates (lessons learned register, requirements traceability matrix,
    risk register, stakeholder register)
368        Chapter 7      Planning Project Resources



 We'll look at the quality management plan and quality metrics outputs of Plan Quality
Management next.

Quality Management Plan
The quality management plan describes how the project management team will carry out the
quality policy. It should document the resources needed to carry out the quality management
plan, the responsibilities of the project team in implementing quality, and all the processes
and procedures the project team and organization should use to satisfy quality requirements,
including quality control, quality assurance techniques, and continuous improvement pro-
cesses. This plan should also address the quality standards for both the project and the prod-
ucts produced by the project. As with other plans, you should consider project scope, risks,
and requirements when writing this plan so that quality defects can hopefully be avoided,
also allowing you to have better control of the cost of quality.
   The project manager, in cooperation with the project staff, writes the quality manage-
ment plan. You can assign quality actions to the activities listed on the WBS based on the
quality plan requirements. Isn't that WBS a handy thing? Later in the Control Quality pro-
cess, measurements will be taken to determine whether the quality to date is on track with
the quality standards outlined in the quality management plan.



Exam Spotlight

The Project Quality Management Knowledge Area, which includes the Plan Quality
Management, Manage Quality, and Control Quality processes, involves the quality
management of the project as well as the quality aspects of the product or service the
project was undertaken to produce. We'll discuss Manage Quality and Control Quality
in later chapters.




Candy Works

Juliette Walters is a contract project manager for Candy Works. She is leading a project
that will introduce a new line of hard candy drops in various exotic flavors: cafe latte, hot
buttered popcorn, and jalapeno spice, just to name a few.

Juliette is writing the quality management plan for this project. After interviewing stake-
holders and key team members, she has found several quality factors of importance to
the organization. Quality will be measured by the following criteria:

Candy Size Each piece should measure 3 mm.

Appearance No visible cracks or breaks should appear in the candy.
                                                                   Quality Planning           369




Flavor Flavor must be distinguishable when the candy is taste tested.

Number Produced The production target is 9,000 pieces per week. The current machine
has been benchmarked at 9,200 candies per week.

Intensity of Color There should be no opaqueness in the darker colors.

Wrappers Properly fitting wrappers cover the candies, folding over twice in back and
twisted on each side. There is a different wrapper for each flavor of candy, and they must
match exactly.

The candy is cooked and then pulled into a long cylinder shape roughly 6' long and 2" in
diameter. This cylinder is fed into the machine that molds and cuts the candy into drops.
The cylinders vary a little in size because they're hand-stretched by expert candy mak-
ers, who then feed the candies into the drop maker machine. As a result, the end of one
flavor batch--the cafe latte flavor--and the beginning of the next batch--the hot but-
tered popcorn flavor--merge. This means the drops that fall into the collection bins are
intermingled during the last run of the first flavor batch. In other words, the last bin of
the cafe latte flavor run has some hot buttered popcorn drops mixed in. There is no way
to separate the drops once they've hit the bin. From there, the drops go on to the candy-
wrapping machine, where brightly colored wrappers are matched to the candy flavor.
According to the quality plan, hot buttered popcorn drops cannot be wrapped as cafe
latte drops. Juliette ponders what to do.

As she tosses and turns that night thinking about the problem, it occurs to her to present
this problem to the company as an opportunity rather than as a problem. To keep produc-
tion in the 9,000 candies per week category, the machines can't be stopped every time
a new batch is introduced. So, Juliette comes up with the idea to wrap candies from the
intermixed bins with wrappers that say "Mystery Flavor." This way, production keeps
pace with the plan and the wrapper/flavor quality problem is mitigated.




Quality Metrics
A quality metric, also known as an operational definition, describes what is being measured
and how it will be measured during the Control Quality process. For example, let's say
you're managing the opening of a new restaurant in July of next year. Perhaps one of the de-
liverables is the procurement of flatware for 500 place settings. The operational definition in
this case might include the date the flatware must be delivered and a counting or inventory
process to ensure that you received the number of place settings you ordered. Measurements
of this variable consist of actual values, not "yes" or "no" results. In our example, receiving
the flatware is a "yes" or "no" attribute result (you have it or you don't), but the date it was
delivered and the number of pieces delivered are actual values. Failure rates are another type
of quality metric that is measurable, as are reliability, availability, test coverage, and defect
density measurements.

                 One of the results of the Plan Quality Management process is that your
                 product or process might require adjustments to conform to the quality
                 policy and standards. These changes might result in cost changes and
                 schedule changes. You might also discover that you'll need to perform
                 risk analysis techniques for problems you uncover or when making
                 adjustments as a result of this process.




Bringing It All Together
Believe it or not, you have officially completed the Planning process group. Along the way,
I've mentioned gaining approvals for portions of the project plan such as the schedule and
budget.
    The project management plan is the approved, formal, documented plan that's used to
guide you throughout the project Executing process group. The plan consists of all the out-
puts of the Planning process group, including the component plans and baselines. It's the
map that tells you where you're going and how to perform the activities of the project plan
during the Direct and Manage Project Work process. It serves several purposes, the most
important of which is tracking and measuring project performance through the Executing
and Monitoring and Controlling processes and making future project decisions. The proj-
ect management plan is critical in all communications you'll have from here forward with
the stakeholders, management, and customers. The project management plan also docu-
ments all project planning assumptions, all project planning decisions, and important man-
agement reviews needed.
    The project management plan encompasses everything I've talked about up to now and
is represented in a formal document, or collection of documents. This document contains
the project scope statement, deliverables, constraints, assumptions, risks, WBS, milestones,
project schedule, resources, and more. It becomes the baseline you'll use to measure and
track progress against. It's also used to help you control the components that tend to stray
from the original plan so you can get them back in line.

Performance measurement baselines are management controls that should change
only infrequently. Examples of the performance measurement baselines you've looked
at so far are budget, scope, and schedule baselines. However, the project management
plan itself also becomes a baseline. If changes in scope or schedule do occur after the
Planning processes are complete, you should go through a formalized process (which I'll
cover in Chapter 10) to implement the changes.
                                                            Bringing It All Together           371




   The project management plan is used as a communication and information tool for
stakeholders, team members, and the management team. They will use the plan to review
and gauge progress as well.
   Don't forget that sign-off on the project management plan is important to the project's
success. It isn't necessary for the sponsor and key stakeholders to sign off on every individ-
ual project document, but you should obtain signatures on the project management plan. I
would never embark on a project of any size without sign-off from at least the project spon-
sor as well as a few key stakeholders, the latter depending on the size, risk, and complexity
of the project. If they've been an integral part of the Planning processes all along (and I
know you know how important this is), obtaining sign-off on the project management plan
should simply be a formality. Once you obtain sign-off, you have the approval to move into
the Executing processes.
   The project management plan consists of several components, and I've recapped them
here for your reference. You can find the differences between project management plan
components and project documents in a handy table (Table 4-1) in the PMBOK(R) Guide
in Chapter 4:
    Change Management Plan
    Communications Management Plan
    Configuration Management Plan
    Cost Management Plan
    Cost Baseline
    Development Approach
    Performance Measurement Baseline
    Procurement Management Plan
    Project Life Cycle Description

    Requirements Management Plan
    Resource Management Plan
    Risk Management Plan
    Schedule Baseline
    Schedule Management Plan
    Scope Baseline
    Scope Management Plan
    Stakeholder Engagement Plan
   "But wait," I hear you saying, "we didn't discuss the configuration management plan."
In a nutshell, configuration management is similar to change management, but configura-
tion changes deal with the components of the product of the project, such as functional
ability or physical attributes, rather than the project process itself. I will cover these topics
in much more depth in Chapter 10.
372        Chapter 7      Planning Project Resources



   You may also be wondering about the development approach. This refers to the devel-
opment approach you'll use for the project whether waterfall, iterative, hybrid, Agile, and
so on.
   Note that you will use all the management plans I discussed during the Planning
processes--all those just listed--throughout the Executing process group to manage the
project and keep the performance of the project on track with the project objectives. If
you don't have a project management plan, you'll have no way of managing the process.
You'll find that even with a project management plan, project scope has a way of changing.
Stakeholders and others tend to sneak in a few of the "Oh, I didn't understand that before"
statements and hope that they slide right by you. With that signed, approved project man-
agement plan in your files, you are allowed to gently remind them that they read and agreed
to the project plan and you're sticking to it.




Project Case Study: New Kitchen Heaven Retail Store

You're just finishing a phone conversation with Jill, and you see Dirk headed toward your
office.

Dirk walks in, crosses his arms over his chest, and stands next to your desk with an "I'm
here for answers" look.

"I thought I'd drop by and see whether you have signed a lease and gotten Jake started
on that build-out yet," says Dirk.

"I just got off the phone with Jill," you reply. "The real estate agent found a great
location, and we've set up a tour for tomorrow."

"What has been the holdup?" Dirk asks. "I thought we'd be ready to start the build-out
about now."

"I've been working on the project plans."

"Project plans," Dirk interrupts. "We already have a plan. That schedule thing and risk
stuff and the budget you drew up over the last couple of weeks spelled things out pretty
clearly."

"I'm almost finished with the project plans. I'd like you to take a look at the human
resource management plan after I review with you what we've done to date."

"I don't understand why you're wasting all this time planning. We all know what the
objectives are."

"Dirk," you reply, "if we put the right amount of effort and time into planning, the actual
work of the project should go pretty smoothly. Planning is probably one of the most
                                                            Bringing It All Together             373




important things we can do on this project. If we don't plan correctly, we might miss
something very important that could delay the store opening. That date is pretty firm,
I thought."

"Yes, the date is firm. But I don't see how we could miss anything. You and I have met
several times, and I know you've met with Jill and Jake. They're the other key players
on this."

"Let me finish," you reply. "I have met with all the key stakeholders, and after you review
these last few documents I have for you, we're finished with the planning phase of this
project. Ricardo drafted a procurement statement of work. He needs to hire some exter-
nal resources--and I noted that in the human resource management plan by the way--to
help run Ethernet cable, procure a T1 line, and purchase some routers and switches. The
purchase of the routers and switches will be accomplished using a fixed-price contract,
and the human resources he needs will be procured using a time and materials contract.
Jill also drew up a procurement statement of work for the gourmet and cookware lines
purchase. I documented a lot of the resource management plan when we worked through
the activity estimating and duration exercise and put some finishing touches on it yes-
terday. It includes an RACI chart for all our project key deliverables." You sneak in a quick
breath because you don't want Dirk to interrupt. "And the quality management plan is
complete. After your review, I'll distribute it to the key stakeholders. The quality manage-
ment plan describes how we'll implement our quality policy. You know the old saying,
`Do it right the first time.' I took the time to write down the specific quality metrics we're
looking for, including the lease signing date (this one must start and finish on time) and
the IT equipment specifications, and Jill has documented the gourmet products and the
cookware line specifications."

Dirk looks impressed, but you can't tell for sure.

"After I look at the last of these planning documents, are we ready to actually start
working?"

"Yes, as soon as the lease is signed. I anticipate that happening by the end of this week.
Tomorrow's tour is the fifth location Jill will look at. She's very happy with the third prop-
erty she saw but wants to look at this last property before she makes her final decision."

"Great. Let's take a look at that human plan or whatever it is."

After reviewing the last of the planning documents, Dirk signs off on the project plan.

Understanding How This Applies
to Your Next Project
In my organization, the Plan Procurement Management process comes right after finalizing
project scope because it takes a great deal of time and effort to procure goods and services.
That means we have to start procuring resources as early in the project as possible in order
to meet the project deadlines.
   In all the organizations I've worked in, someone has always been responsible for
procurement--whether it was a single person or an entire department. Typically, the pro-
curement department defines many elements of the procurement management plan. Sure,
the project team determines how many vendors need to be involved and how they'll be
managed along with the schedule dates, but many other elements are predetermined, such
as the type of contract to use, the authority of the project team regarding the contract, how
multiple vendors will be managed, and the identification of prequalified sellers.
   The procurement department also determines what type of procurement document you
should use depending on the types of resources you're acquiring and the amount of money
you're spending. Typically, they'll have a template for you to use with all the legalese sec-
tions prepopulated, and you'll work on the sections that describe the work or resources you
need for the project, milestones or schedule dates, and evaluation criteria.
   Don't make the mistake of thinking your procurement department will take care of all
the paperwork for you. At a minimum, you will likely be responsible for writing the state-
ment of work, writing the RFP, writing the contract requirements (as they pertain to the
work of the project), creating the vendor selection criteria, and determining the schedule
dates for contract work.
                                                                         Summary             375




   Plan Resource Management is a process you might not need to complete, depending on
the size and complexity of the project. I typically work with the same team members over
and over again, so I know their skills, capabilities, and availability. However, if you're hir-
ing contract resources for the project or you typically work with new team members on
each project, I recommend creating a resource management plan.
   The quality management plan is another important element of your project manage-
ment plan. You should take into consideration the final result or product of the project and
the complexity of the project to determine if you need a multipage document with detailed
specifications or if the plan can be more informal and broad in nature. Again, depending
on the project complexity, the measurements or criteria you'll use to determine the quality
objective could be a few simple sentences or bullet items or a more formal, detailed docu-
ment. The quality baseline should be documented during this process as well.



Summary
This chapter's focus was on planning for project resources. Several aspects are involved in
these planning activities, including procuring goods and services, planning human resources,
and defining the activities in which human resources will be involved.
   This chapter started with the Plan Procurement Management process. This process
identifies the goods or services you're going to purchase from outside the organization and
determines which goods or services the project team can make or perform. This involves
tools and techniques such as make-or-buy decisions, expert judgment, source selection
analysis, and contract types. The procurement management plan is one of the outputs of
this process and describes how procurement services will be managed throughout the proj-
ect. The procurement SOW (another output of this process) describes the work that will be
contracted.
   In our discussion of contract types, we covered fixed-price, cost plus, and time and
materials contracts and the benefits and risks of using them.
   The Plan Resource Management process identifies and assigns roles and responsibili-
ties and reporting relationships. Many times the roles and responsibilities assignments are
depicted in a responsibility assignment matrix (RAM) or an RACI chart. The resource
management plan describes how resources should be defined, staffed, managed and con-
trolled, and released from the project when their activities are complete. Plan Quality
Management targets the quality standards that are relevant to your project. The quality
management plan outlines how the project team will enact the quality policy.
   You need to take into account the cost of quality when considering stakeholder needs.
Four men led to the rise of the cost of quality theories. Crosby is known for his zero defects
theory, Juran for the fitness for use theory, Deming for attributing 85 percent of cost of
quality to the management team, and Shewhart for the Plan-Do-Check-Act cycle. The
Kaizen approach says that the project team should continuously be on the lookout for ways
to improve the process and that people should be improved first and then the quality of
the products or services. TQM and Six Sigma are examples of continuous improvement
techniques.
376        Chapter 7      Planning Project Resources



   Cost of quality involves three types of costs: prevention, appraisal, and failure costs; the
latter is also known as the cost of poor quality. Failure costs include the costs of both inter-
nal and external failures.
   Cost-benefit analysis considers trade-offs in the Plan Quality Management process.
Benchmarking compares previous similar activities to the current project activities to pro-
vide a standard to measure performance against. Design of experiments is an analytical
technique that determines what variables have the greatest effect on the project outcomes.
This technique equips you with a statistical framework, allowing you to change all the
important variables at once instead of changing one variable at a time.



Exam Essentials
Be able to name the purpose of the Plan Procurement Management process. The purpose
of the Plan Procurement Management process is to identify which project needs should
be obtained from outside the organization. Make-or-buy analysis is used as a tool and
technique to help determine this.
Be familiar with the contract types and their usage. Contract types are a tool and technique
of the Plan Procurement Management process and include fixed-price and cost-reimbursable
contracts. Use fixed-price contracts for well-defined projects with a high value to the com-
pany, and use cost-reimbursable contracts for projects with uncertainty and large invest-
ments early in the project life. The three types of fixed-price contracts are FFP, FPIF, and
FP-EPA. The four types of cost-reimbursable contracts are CPFF, CPIF, CPF (or CPPC), and
CPAF. Time and materials contracts are a cross between fixed-price and cost-reimbursable
contracts.
Know the outputs of the Plan Procurement Management process. The outputs of Plan
Procurement Management are procurement management plan, procurement strategy, bid
documents, procurement statement of work, source selection criteria, make-or-buy decisions,
independent cost estimates, change requests, project documents updates, and organizational
process assets updates.
Be able to name the purpose of the Plan Resource Management process. Plan Resource
Management involves documenting both human and physical resources needed for the
project. Regarding human resources, it documents roles and responsibilities, reporting rela-
tionships for the project, and creates the resource plan, which describes how team members
are acquired and the criteria for their release. Physical resource needs and time frames are
documented here as well.
Be able to list the benefits of meeting quality requirements. The benefits of meeting quality
requirements include increased stakeholder satisfaction, lower costs, higher productivity, and
less rework and are discovered during the Plan Quality Management process.
                                                                Exam Essentials           377




Be able to define the cost of quality. The COQ is the total cost to produce the product or
service of the project according to the quality standards. These costs include all the work
necessary to meet the product requirements for quality. The three costs associated with
cost of quality are prevention, appraisal, and failure costs (also known as cost of poor
quality).
Be able to name four people associated with COQ and some of the techniques they helped
establish. The four are Crosby, Juran, Deming, and Shewhart. Some of the techniques they
helped to establish are TQM, Six Sigma, Lean Six Sigma, cost of quality, and continuous
improvement. The Kaizen approach concerns continuous improvement and says people
should be improved first.
Be able to name the tools and techniques of the Plan Quality Management process. The
Plan Quality Management process consists of expert judgment, data gathering, data analysis
(cost-benefit analysis, cost of quality), decision making, data representation, test and
inspection planning, and meetings.

    A. An increase in stakeholder satisfaction
    B.   Less rework
    C.   Lower risk
    D.   Higher productivity

    B.   The quality metrics and tolerances and what will be measured
    C.   The responsibilities the project team has in implementing quality
    D.   The processes to use to satisfy quality requirements

18. You work for a furniture manufacturer. Your project is going to design and produce a new
    office chair. The chair will have the ability to function as a regular chair and also the abil-
    ity to move its occupant into an upright, kneeling position. The design team is trying to
    determine the combination of comfort and ease of transformation to the new position that
    will give the chair the best characteristics while keeping the costs reasonable. Several differ-
    ent combinations have been tested. This is an example of which of the following tools and
    techniques of Plan Quality Management?
    A. Benchmarking
    B.   Quality metrics
    C.   COQ
    D.   DOE
382          Chapter 7      Planning Project Resources



19. Which of the following best characterizes Six Sigma?
      A. Stipulates that quality must be managed in
      B.   Focuses on process improvement and variation reduction by using a measurement-
           based strategy
      C.   Asserts that quality must be a continuous way of doing business
      D.   Focuses on improving the quality of the people first, then improving the quality of the
           process or project

20. Your organization is embarking on a long-term project that will require additional human
    resources on a contract basis to complete the work of the project. Since the project will span
    several years, you know one vendor probably can't supply all the resources you'll need over
    the course of the contract. However, you want to work with only one vendor throughout
    the project to minimize the amount of procurement documents you'll have to produce. So,
    you'll specify in your procurement documents that contractors will have to form partner-
    ships to work on this project. You know all of the following are true regarding this question
    except for which one?
      A. You will use an RFP, which is part of the procurement documents output of the Plan
         Procurement Management process, as your procurement document for this project.
      B.   You'll use an FP-EPA contract because this project spans several years.
      C.   You should consider teaming agreements, which are an input to the Plan Procurement
           Management process.
      D.   Some of the quality metrics you'll use for this project include on-time performance,
           failure rates, budget control, and test coverage. Quality metrics are an output of the
           Plan Quality Management process.

          Project Team

          The PMP(R) exam content from the
          Executing the Project Performance
          domains covered in this chapter
          includes the following:

           Task 1: Acquire and manage project resources by following
           the human resource and procurement management plans
           in order to meet project requirements.

           Task 2: Manage task execution based on the project
           management plan by leading and developing the project
           team in order to achieve project deliverables.

           Task 5: Implement approved actions by following the risk
           management plan in order to minimize the impact of the
           risks and take advantage of opportunities on the project.

           Knowledge and Skills:
                 Interdependencies among project elements

                 Vendor management techniques
                                This chapter begins the project Executing process group. I'll
                                cover five of the processes in this chapter: Direct and Manage
                                Project Work, Acquire Resources, Develop Project Team,
Manage Project Team, and Implement Risk Responses. I'll cover the remaining Executing
processes in the next chapter.
   Direct and Manage Project Work is the action process. This is where you'll put the plans
into action and begin working on the project activities. Execution also involves keeping the
project in line with the original project management plan and bringing wayward activities
back into alignment.
   The Acquire, Develop, and Manage Project Team processes are all interrelated, as you
can imagine, and work together to help obtain the best project team available.
   Implement Risk Responses, oddly enough, is about putting those risk response plans
you created in the Planning processes into action.
   Several things happen during the Executing processes. The majority of the project bud-
get will be spent during this process group, and often the majority of the project time is
expended here as well. The greatest confl icts you'll see during the project Executing pro-
cesses are schedule confl icts. In addition, the product description will be fi nalized here and
contains more detail than it did in the Planning processes.
   There might be several exam questions from every process within the Executing
process group. Don't skip studying these processes and the ones in Chapter 9,
"Conducting Procurements and Sharing Information," because 31 percent of the exam
questions concern the Executing process group. Are you ready to dive into Executing?
Let's go.


                  The process names, inputs, tools and techniques, outputs, and descriptions
                  of the project management process groups and related materials are based
                  on content from A Guide to the Project Management Body of Knowledge
                  (PMBOK (R) Guide), Sixth Edition (PMI(R), 2017).




Directing and Managing Project Work
The purpose of the Direct and Manage Project Work process is to carry out the project
management plan and perform the work of the project. This is where your project comes to
life and the work of the project happens. The work is authorized to begin and activities are
performed. Resources are committed and people carry out their assigned activities to create
                                            Directing and Managing Project Work                385




the product, result, or service of the project. Funds are spent to accomplish project objec-
tives. Performing project activities, training, selecting sellers, collecting project data, utiliz-
ing resources, and so on are all integrated with or are part of this process.
   Direct and Manage Project Work is where the rubber meets the road. If you've done a
good job planning the project, things should go relatively smoothly for you during this pro-
cess. The deliverables and requirements are agreed on, the resources have been identified
and are ready to go, and the stakeholders know exactly where you're headed because you
had them review, agree to, and approve the project plan.
   Some project managers think this is the time for them to kick back and put their feet
up. After all, the project management plan is done, everyone knows what to do and what's
expected of them, and the work of the project should almost carry itself out because your
plan is a work of genius, right? Wrong! You must stay involved. Your job now is a matter
of overseeing the actual work, producing deliverables, communicating, issuing change
requests, implementing approved changes, managing the schedule, managing risks, manag-
ing stakeholders, staying on top of issues and problems, and keeping the work lined up with
the project management plan. Direct and Manage Project Work will be performed from
now throughout the remainder of the project.


Exam Spotlight

The project management plan serves as the project baseline. During the Executing pro-
cesses, you should continually compare and monitor project performance against the
baseline so that corrective actions can be taken and implemented at the right time to
prevent disaster. This information will also be fed into the Monitoring and Controlling
processes for further analysis.



   One of the most difficult aspects of this process is coordinating and integrating all the
elements of the project. Although you do have the project management plan as your guide,
you still have a lot of balls in the air. You'll find yourself coordinating and monitoring
many project elements--occasionally all at the same time--during the course of the Direct
and Manage Project Work process. You might be negotiating for team members at the
same time you're negotiating with vendors at the same time you're working with another
manager to get a project component completed so your deliverables stay on schedule. You
should monitor risks and risk triggers closely. The Plan Procurement Management process
might need intervention or cause you delays. The organizational, technical, and interper-
sonal interfaces might require intense coordination and oversight. Of course, you should
always be concerned about the pulse of your stakeholders. Are they actively involved in the
project? Are they throwing up roadblocks now that the work has started?
   According to the PMBOK(R) Guide, this process also requires implementing corrective
actions to bring the work of the project back into alignment with the project management
plan, preventive actions to reduce the probability of negative consequences, and defect
repairs to correct product defects discovered during the quality processes.
386         Chapter 8      Developing the Project Team



   As you can see, your work as project manager is not done yet. Many elements of the
project require your attention, so let's get to work.


                   Later in this chapter I'll also talk about Develop Team because this is an
                   integral part of the Direct and Manage Project Work process as well. You'll
                   want to lead and develop the project team and monitor their performance,
                   the status of their work, and their interactions with you and other team
                   members as you execute the project management plan in order to achieve
                   the project deliverables.


Direct and Manage Project Work Inputs
Direct and Manage Project Work has five inputs:
      Project management plan (any component)
      Project documents (change log, lessons learned register, milestone list, project commu-
      nications, project schedule, requirements traceability matrix, risk register, risk report)
      Approved change requests
      Enterprise environmental factors
      Organizational process assets
   The project management plan documents the collection of outputs of the Planning
processes and describes and defi nes how the project should be executed, monitored,
controlled, and closed. The project management plan documents the goals of the project
and the actual work you and the team will execute in order to meet those goals. Once the
project management plan is complete, you will know all of the work and actions needed to
meet the deliverables of the project and will have a plan for executing those actions. Most
components of the project management come into play in this process.
   The project documents listed as inputs to this process will assist in determining when
resources are needed, milestone due dates, what changes may impact the work already
completed or soon to be performed, and the project communications you'll be reporting on
during this process. Let's take a brief look at each of the other inputs next.

Approved Change Requests
Approved change requests come about as a result of the approved change requests output
of the Perform Integrated Change Control process. (We'll cover this process in Chapter 10,
"Measuring and Controlling Project Performance.") Change requests are approved or denied
during this process, and once the decision has been made, approved changes come back
through the Direct and Manage Project Work process for the project team to implement.
   Approved changes might either expand or reduce project scope and may also cause revi-
sions to project budgets, schedules, procedures, the project management plan, and so on.
Change requests can be internal or external to the project or organization. For example,
you may need to make changes because of a new law that affects your project.

Enterprise Environmental Factors
When performing this process, you will need to consider several enterprise environmental
factors, including the company culture and organizational structure, the facilities available
to the project team, risk tolerance levels of your stakeholders, and management structures.

Organizational Process Assets
As with many of the other processes we've covered, historical information from past proj-
ects, organizational guidelines, and work processes are some of the organizational process
assets you should consider when performing this process. In addition, measurement data-
bases and issue and defect databases can be used in this process to compare past projects
to the current project and to capture information about the current project for future
reference. You might be required to upload measurement data on the project management
processes and those for the product of the project to your organization's performance mea-
surement database for reporting purposes. Change control procedures should be reviewed
and risk control procedures as well as you enter into the Executing processes.


Tools and Techniques of Direct and Manage
Project Work
The tools and techniques of the Direct and Manage Project Work process are expert judg-
ment, project management information system, and meetings. Your experts should have
experience or knowledge of cost and budget management, procurement processes, regula-
tions that impact your industry, and legal processes. We'll take a look at the project man-
agement information system next.

Project Management Information System
The project management information system (PMIS) is an automated system used to docu-
ment the project management plan and subsidiary plans, to facilitate the feedback process,
and to revise the documents. It incorporates the configuration management system and the
change control system, both of which I'll cover in Chapter 10. Later in the project, the PMIS
can be used to control changes to any of the plans. When you're thinking about the
PMIS as a tool and technique, think of it just that way--as a tool to facilitate the automa-
tion, collection, and distribution of data and to help monitor processes such as scheduling,
resource leveling, budgeting, and web interfaces.
   Remember that in the Executing processes, you'll be actively using all of these tools:
consulting and meeting with stakeholders, professionals, and others; employing the project
management methodology you developed in the Planning processes; and using the project
management information system to update and track progress.
   Some of the outputs of this process are going to look familiar and some are new. We'll
examine them next.
388         Chapter 8      Developing the Project Team




Outputs of Direct and Manage Project Work
The outputs of the Direct and Manage Project Work process are as follows:
      Deliverables
      Work performance data
      Issue log
      Change requests
      Project management plan updates (any component)
      Project documents updates (activity list, assumption log, lessons learned register,
      requirements documentation, risk register, stakeholder register)
      Organizational process assets updates
   The most important outputs of this process are deliverables (meaning actually accom-
plishing the activities leading to the completion of the product, result, or service you set out
to produce), work performance data, issue log, and change requests. Almost every process
you've performed up to this point has defined and outlined what the work of the project
entails and what the final results should look like. Now you're ready to begin performing
the work. Let's look at these three outputs that will help us document our progress.

Deliverables
During Direct and Manage Project Work, you'll gather and record information regard-
ing the outcomes of the work, including activity completion dates, milestone completions,
the status of the deliverables, the quality of the deliverables, costs, schedule progress and
updates, and so on. Deliverables aren't always tangible, but they are always unique and ver-
ifiable. For example, perhaps your team members require training on a piece of specialized
equipment. Completion of the training is recorded as a work result. Capabilities required
to perform a service that's described in the project management plan are also considered a
deliverable. All of this information gets used during the Control Communications process,
which I'll discuss during the Monitoring and Controlling processes.
    Executing and Monitoring and Controlling are two process groups that work hand in
hand. As you gather the information from work results, you'll measure the outputs and
take corrective actions where necessary. This means you'll loop back through the Executing
processes to put the corrections into place. The PMBOK(R) Guide breaks these processes up
for ease of explanation, but in practice, you'll work through several of the Executing and
Monitoring and Controlling processes together.

Work Performance Data
Work performance data concerns observing, gathering, documenting, and recording the
status of project activities. The types of information you might gather during this process
include some of the following:
      Key performance indicators
      Schedule status and progress
                                            Directing and Managing Project Work               389



    Status of deliverable completion
    Progress and status of schedule activities, including start and end dates
    Percent of overall work complete
    Adherence to quality standards
    Number of change requests
    Status of costs (those authorized and costs incurred to date)
    Schedule activity completion estimates for those activities started
    Schedule activities percent complete
    Actual durations of activities that are completed
    Lessons learned
    Resource consumption and utilization
    Technical performance measures
   Work performance data becomes an input to a few of the Monitoring and Controlling
processes where you'll perform further analysis on the data. It's important that you docu-
ment this information so that when you get to the Monitoring and Controlling processes,
you don't have to backtrack.

Issue Log
The issue log will come into play in the Executing processes in a big way. As your team per-
forms the work of the project, issues will arise. I promise this isn't an "if" they come up, it's
a "when" issues come up. You'll want to capture issues in an issue log so that you can track
and manage them, report on them during status meetings, assign owners, and understand
their status.
   An issue log can be easily constructed using your PMIS or a good old handy spread-
sheet. Table 8.1 shows a sample issue log with some of the information you might consider
capturing.

390        Chapter 8      Developing the Project Team



Change Requests
As a result of working through activities and producing your product, service, or result,
you will inevitably come upon things that need to be changed. Changes can also come
about from stakeholder requests, external sources, technological advances, and so on.
These change requests might encompass schedule, scope, requirement, or resource changes.
The list could go on. Your job as project manager, if you choose to accept it, is to collect
the change requests and make determinations about their impact on the project.


Exam Spotlight

According the PMBOK (R) Guide, a change request is a formal proposal to bring about a
change that will require revising a document, a project baseline, a deliverable, or some
combination of all three.



   Implementation of change requests may incorporate four types of actions: corrective
actions, preventive actions, defect repairs, or updates. Each of these topics is described
next.
Corrective Actions In my organization, a corrective action means an employee is in big
trouble. Fortunately, this isn't what's meant here. Corrective actions are taken to get the
anticipated future project outcomes to align with the project management plan. Maybe
you've discovered that one of your programmers is adding an unplanned feature to the
software project because he's friends with the user. You'll have to redirect him to the activi-
ties assigned to him originally to avoid schedule delays. Perhaps your vendor isn't able to
deliver the laboratory equipment needed for the next project phase. You'll want to exercise
your contract options (let's hope there's a clause in the contract that says the vendor must
provide rental equipment until they can deliver your order), put your contingency plan into
place, and get the lab the equipment that's needed to keep the project on schedule.
Preventive Actions A preventive action involves anything that will reduce the potential
negative impacts of risk events should they occur. Contingency plans and risk responses
are examples of preventive actions. I described these and other risk responses while talking
about the Plan Risk Response process in Chapter 6, "Risk Planning." You should be aware
of contingency plans and risk responses so that you're ready to implement them at the first
sign of trouble.
Defect Repairs A defect occurs when a project component does not meet the require-
ments or specifications. Defects might be discovered when conducting quality audits in
the Manage Quality process or when performing inspections during the Control Quality
process.
For the exam, you should understand the difference between a validated defect repair and
a defect repair. A validated defect repair is the result of a reinspection of the original defect
repair. In other words, you found a problem with the product during the Quality processes,
                                          Directing and Managing Project Work                391




you corrected the problem (defect repair), and now you're reinspecting that repair (vali-
dated defect repair) to make certain the fix is accurate and correct and fixed the problem.
Updates Changes may require updates to the project documents so that the new informa-
tion is captured and recorded. For example, some of the documents that might require an
update could include the scope statement, budget documents, the schedule, risk manage-
ment plan or risk response plans, and so on.
I'll discuss change requests more in the coming chapters as well. Change requests are an
output of several processes, including the Direct and Manage Project Work process and
the Control Communications process in the Monitoring and Controlling process group.
Remember that the Executing process group outputs and the Monitoring and Controlling
process group outputs feed each other as inputs. In this particular case, approved change
requests are an input, and change requests are an output of the same process.



Exam Spotlight

Direct and Manage Project Work is where the work of the project is performed and the
project management plan is put into action and carried out. In this process, the project
manager is like an orchestra conductor signaling the musicians when to begin their activi-
ties, monitoring what should be winding down, and keeping that smile going to remind
everyone that they should be enjoying themselves. I recommend that you know the out-
puts of the Direct and Manage Project Work process for the exam.



   I told you the Executing process group is about performing the work of the project, and
in order to do that, you need resources. You'll look at two processes, Acquire Resources
and Develop Team, in the next few sections.




We All Scream for Ice Cream

Heather is a pharmaceutical salesperson who is fed up with the rat race. She ran the num-
bers, decided to quit her day job, and bought an ice cream shop in a quaint tourist town.
Having been involved in a few research and development projects, she understands the
value of project management planning and using that plan as her guide to perform the
work of the project.

Heather documented the deliverables needed to prepare for opening day in her scope
statement. Some of those deliverables are as follows: remodel, develop staffing plan,
procure equipment, and procure materials. Confident in her planning, Heather hired a
392        Chapter 8      Developing the Project Team




contractor and began remodeling the shop. Then real life happened. The contractors dis-
covered a water problem in the storage room. They installed a sump pump, which took
care of the water, but discovered an even bigger problem when they moved the storage
shelves. Mold was growing up the drywall. The drywall had to be removed, as did the
insulation behind it, and the mold remaining on permanent fixtures had to be eliminated.
Then new insulation and drywall had to be installed. The drywall had to be primed and
painted. Because that portion of the storage room was getting a fresh coat of paint,
Heather decided the contractors might as well paint the entire room.

All of these actions required another pass through the Planning processes. The schedule
didn't require much modification because other work could be started while the water
problem was being addressed, but the budget needed to be modified as a result of the
additional work. To avoid more surprises, Heather requested that the contractor perform
a thorough inspection of the property and determine whether there were any other hid-
den issues. Armed with the inspection report, Heather could knowledgeably plan correc-
tive action for other items that needed to be addressed.




Acquiring the Project Team
and Project Resources
The Acquire Resources process involves attaining and assigning human resources to the
project and obtaining equipment, supplies, facilities, and other items you might need to per-
form the work of the project. This process is performed whenever you need to acquire new
or additional resources whether they come from inside or outside the organization.
   Project staff might be hired specifically for the project from inside the company or
brought in as contract help. In any case, it's your job as the project manager to ensure
that resources are available and skilled in the project activities to which they're assigned.
However, in practice, you might fi nd that you don't always have control over the selection
of team members. Someone else, the big boss for example, might handpick the folks they
want working on the project, and it's up to you to assess their skills and decide where
they best fit on the project.


                 One thing is certain: You need to be sure that resources (both human and
                 equipment or materials) are available and show up to the project according
                 to schedule. If you don't have resources at the right time, you could impact
                 the schedule, the budget, introduce risk, or put the project in jeopardy of
                 finishing. This could be a career-limiting move, so take this process seri-
                 ously. Work closely with your procurement department to ensure that
                 resources are available with the right qualifications and/or specifications
                 at the right time.
                              Acquiring the Project Team and Project Resources                 393




Acquire Resources Inputs
The Acquire Resources process inputs are as follows:
    Project management plan (resource management plan, procurement management plan,
    cost baseline)
    Project documents (project schedule, resource calendars, resource requirements,
    stakeholder register)
    Enterprise environmental factors
    Organizational process assets
    The resource management plan describes the roles and responsibilities and includes
project organization charts and other information on resource requirements for the
project. This plan will be your guide in both acquiring and managing your project
resources. Keep in mind that you may not have direct authority over the project resources
due to matrix managed organizations, collective bargaining agreements, the use of
contractors and subcontractors, and so on. You should document this in the resource
management plan.
    The project schedule is your roadmap in this process. Milestones, deliverables, and
activities will dictate when and where resources are needed. Keep that schedule handy
throughout the Executing processes.
    We discussed resource calendars in Chapter 7, "Planning Project Resources." You'll
recall that they describe the time frames in which the resources will be needed on the
project and when the recruitment process should begin.
    Enterprise environmental factors in this process account for project activities that might
require special skills or knowledge in order to be completed. These may also consider
personal interests, cost rates, prior experience, and availability of potential team members
before making assignments. For example, consider the previous experience of the staff
member you're thinking of assigning to a specific activity. Have they performed this
function before? Do they have the experience necessary for the level of complexity this
project activity requires? Are they competent and proficient at these skills?
    Personal interests and personal characteristics play a big role as well. If the person you're
thinking of just isn't interested in the project, that person isn't likely to perform at his best.
If you can, think about assigning someone else in a case like this. Unfortunately, some peo-
ple just don't play well with others. When you're assigning staff, if at all possible, don't put
the only two people in the whole company who can't get along together on the same proj-
ect. If a staff member you need has a skill no one else has, or she can perform a function
like no one else can, you might not have a choice. In this case, you'll have to employ other
techniques to keep the team cohesive and working well together despite the not-so-friendly
relationship between the two staff members.
    Here's one final consideration: Check on the availability of key team members. If the
team member you must have for the activity scheduled in February is on his honeymoon,
you probably aren't going to win the toss.

Exam Spotlight

Remember that the availability, experience levels, interests, cost, and abilities of your
resources are considered part of the enterprise environmental factors input. You should
understand these inputs and their importance to the Acquire Resources process for
the exam.



   The organizational process assets input refers to standard processes, policies, and pro-
cedures the organization has in place. Recruitment practices are one example to watch for
in this process. You'll want to make certain you're following the organization's recruitment
procedures and processes when hiring and assigning staff. You should also note that orga-
nizational policies that dictate recruitment practices are constraints.
   Let's move on to the tools and techniques of this process.


Tools and Techniques of Acquire Resources
The tools and techniques of the Acquire Resources process are as follows:
      Decision making (multicriteria decision analysis)
      Interpersonal and team skills (negotiation)
      Pre-assignment
      Virtual teams

Multicriteria Decision Analysis Selecting team members, just like selecting vendors,
requires some type of criteria and analysis to determine whether the potential candidate is a
fit. You could use any number of factors, including experience, education, skills, availabil-
ity, knowledge, attitude, geographic location, and more, to rank and score candidates and
choose among them.
Negotiation (Interpersonal and Team Skills) As the project manager, you will use the
negotiation technique a lot, so brush up on those skills every chance you get. You'll have to
negotiate with functional managers and other organizational department managers (and
sometimes with the vendor if you want to get some of their best people) for resources for
your project and for the timing of those resources.
Availability is one part of the negotiating equation. You'll have to work with the functional
manager or other project managers to ensure that the staff members you're requesting are
available when the schedule says they're needed.
The second part of the equation is the competency level of the staff members they're assign-
ing to your project. I remember hearing someone once say that availability is not a skill set.
Be wary of functional managers who are willing to offer up certain individuals "anytime"
whereas others are "never available." Be certain your negotiations include discussions about
the skills and personal characteristics of the team members you want on your project.
                              Acquiring the Project Team and Project Resources                 395




Pre-assignment Pre-assignment can happen when the project is put out for bid and spe-
cific team members are promised as part of the proposal or when internal project team
members are promised and assigned as a condition of the project. When staff members are
promised as part of the project proposal--particularly on internal projects--they should be
identified in the project charter.
Virtual Teams Virtual teams don't usually work in the same location, but their members
all share the goals of the project and have a role to fulfill. This type of team allows you to
include folks from different geographic locations, those who work different hours or shifts
than the other team members, those with mobility limitations, and so on. The idea is that
virtual teams can meet the objectives of the project and perform their roles without meeting
face to face. In today's wonderful world of technology, team members can use the Internet,
email, videoconferencing, teleconferencing, and more to meet and communicate on a regu-
lar basis. This of course brings to light the importance of communication. Make certain
all team members are aware of the protocols for communicating in a virtual team environ-
ment, understand the expectations, and are clear regarding decision-making processes.
It's vital in this type of team structure that you, as the project manager, give credit to the
appropriate team members for their performance and actions on the project. You might
be the only one who fully understands the contributions individual team members have
made. When teams are colocated, members have the opportunity to see for themselves the
extraordinary efforts others are making on the project. Virtual team members don't nec-
essarily know what their teammates have contributed to the project (or the level of effort
they've exerted), so it's up to you to let everyone know about outstanding performance.


Outputs of Acquire Resources
The resulting outputs of the Acquire Resources process are as follows:
    Physical resource assignments
    Project team assignments
    Resource calendars
    Change requests
    Project management plan updates (resource management plan, cost baseline)
    Project documents updates (lessons learned register, project schedule, resource break-
    down structure, resource requirements, risk register, stakeholder register)
    Enterprise environmental factors updates
    Organizational process assets updates

Physical Resource Assignments Physical resources may encompass a vast array of equipment,
materials, facilities, leases, office supplies, and so on. Some of these resources may be required
at specific times during the project, and others may be needed for the length of the project.
Let's say you're working on a project involving medical research. At times on the project, your
team needs access to medical research equipment that is shared by the entire organization.
396        Chapter 8      Developing the Project Team



You'll want to make certain the research equipment is assigned to the project at the right time
so that the team can complete their work and the project schedule remains on track.
Project Team Assignments Your ability to influence the selection of resources (using the
negotiating technique) will impact the project team assignments output. After determin-
ing elements such as the roles and responsibilities, reviewing recruitment practices, and
negotiating for staff, you assign project team members to project activities. Along with this
output, a project team directory is published listing the names of all project team members
and stakeholders. Don't forget to also include team member names in project organization
charts, RAM charts, and other planning documents if their assignments or names weren't
known when you created those documents.
Resource Calendars Resource calendars show the team members' availability and the
times they are scheduled to work on the project. A composite resource calendar includes
availability information for potential resources as well as their capabilities and skills.
(Resource calendars are an input to the Estimate Activity Resources process.) This comes in
handy when you're creating the final schedule and assigning resources to activities.
Project Management Plan Updates The time periods your project staff are available are
documented in the resource calendars output. The resource management plan might require
updates to document the project roles and responsibilities of the staff assigned to the proj-
ect. It might require updates throughout the project if staff members leave because of a
promotion or, heaven forbid, if they leave for employment in another company (unless you
want them to leave--that's another story). The cost baseline might need updating as well, if
resource costs are outside your original estimates.
Project Documents Updates Several documents may need some updates as a result of
acquiring resources. They include lessons learned register, project schedule, resource break-
down structure, resource requirements, risk register, and the stakeholder register.
EEFs and OPAs Enterprise environmental factors (EEFs), such as resource availability for
those resources you're using from inside the organization and the amount of resources that
have been consumed to date on the project, will need updating as an output of this process.
Updates to organizational process assets (OPAs) may include updating documents and pro-
cedures you used for acquiring, assigning, and allocating resources to the project.
Now that you have the team, what do you do with them? You'll look at topics such as moti-
vation, rewards, and recognition in the next process, Develop Project Team.




The Only Candidate

"Hey, did you hear?" your friend Story asks. "Roger has been assigned to the project team."

"Over my dead body," you reply, pushing away from your computer screen. You head
straight for the project manager's office and don't wait for a response from Story.
                                                      Developing the Project Team               397




Ann sets the phone into the cradle just as you walk through the door. Fortunately for you,
Ann's door is always open, and she welcomes drop-ins.

"Seems like something is on your mind," Ann says. "What can I help with?"

"Story just told me that Roger has been assigned to the project team. I can't work with
Roger. He's arrogant and doesn't respect anyone's work but his own. He belittles me in
front of others, and I don't deserve that. I write good code, and I don't need Roger looking
over my shoulder. I want to be on this team, but not if Roger is part of it."

Ann thinks for a minute and replies, "I want you to work on this project; it's a great
opportunity for you. But there isn't anyone else who can work on the analysis phase of
this project except Roger. He's the only one left who has a solid understanding of the
mainframe legacy code. Unfortunately, those old programs were never documented
well, and they've evolved over the years into programs on top of programs. Without
Roger's knowledge of the existing system, we'd blow the budget and time estimates
already established for this project. Since I need both of you on this project, here's what I
propose: I will clearly outline the roles and responsibilities for all the key team members
at the kickoff meeting. I'll also make it clear that negative team interactions won't be
allowed. If you have a problem with Roger that you can't resolve on your own, you should
get me involved right away."




Developing the Project Team
Projects exist to create a unique product, result, or service within a limited time frame. Projects
are performed by people, and most projects require more than one person to perform
all of the activities. If you've got more than one person working on your project, you've
got a team. If you've got a team, you've got a wide assortment of personalities, skills,
needs, and issues in the mix. Couple this with part-time team members, teams based in
functional organizations whose loyalty lies with the functional manager, teams based in
matrix organizations that report to you for project-related activities and another manager
for their functional duties, or teams with members who are scattered around the globe, and
you could have some real challenges on your hands. Good luck! Okay, I won't leave you
hanging like that.
    The Develop Team process is about creating an open, encouraging environment for your
team and developing it into an effective, functioning, coordinated group. Projects are per-
formed by individuals, and the better they work together, the smoother and more efficient
the execution of the project will be. I'm sure you have had the experience of working with
a team who pitched in and shared workloads when the work became unbalanced. I'm also
sure you have worked with teams who didn't do this--teams whose members took on a
"me first" attitude and couldn't care less about the plight of their fellow team members. I'd
much rather work with a team like the first example.
398         Chapter 8      Developing the Project Team




                   The proper development of the team is critical to a successful project, and
                   as the project manager, you should know that developing the team is one
                   of your most important duties. Because teams are made up of individu-
                   als, individual development becomes a critical factor to project success.
                   Individual team members need the proper development and training to
                   perform the activities of the project or to enhance their existing knowledge
                   and skills. The development needed will depend on the project. Perhaps
                   you have a team member who's ready to make the jump into a lead role
                   but she doesn't have any experience at lead work. Give her some exposure
                   by assigning her a limited amount of activities in a lead capacity, provide
                   her with some training if needed, and be available to coach and mentor
                   where needed. The best option is to work with the management team to
                   provide this person with the development she needs prior to the start of
                   the project (if you're lucky enough to know early on who your resources
                   might be and what their existing skills are).

   Developing a team requires a lot of time and dedication on the part of you, the project
manager, and guess which skill you'll need to employ effectively, efficiently, and clearly in
order to make this work? You guessed it--communication. According to the PMBOK(R)
Guide, there are several reasons for spending time developing the team. They include the
following:
      Team members skills and knowledge improve, which has an effect on the project of
      lowering costs, improving the schedule, and meeting or exceeding quality standards.
      Trust among team members is improved, which in turn improves morale, decreases
      conflicts among team members, and increases teamwork.
      The team becomes close-knit, practices cooperation, and improves productivity.
      Teams take ownership of the work, are more efficient and effective, and are empow-
      ered to make decisions.
   Develop Team inputs include the project management plan (resource management
plan), project documents (lessons learned register, project schedule, project team assign-
ments, resource calendars, team charter), enterprise environmental factors, and organi-
zational process assets. Funny thing is, two of these inputs are outputs that I discussed in
the Acquire Resources process (project team assignments and resource calendars), and the
resource management plan and team charter were covered previously, so we'll move on.


Tools and Techniques of Develop Team
The tools and techniques of Develop Team are as follows:
      Colocation
      Virtual teams
      Communication technology
                                                    Developing the Project Team             399



    Interpersonal and team skills (conflict management, influencing, motivation, negotia-
    tion, team building)
    Recognition and rewards
    Training
    Individual and team assessments
    Meetings
   I discussed virtual teams previously in this chapter, and we've covered meetings previ-
ously as well. I'll cover all the remaining tools and techniques next, and I'm going to discuss
recognition and rewards last because it is a complex topic with lots of information you need
to know for the exam.

Colocation
Colocation, also known as tight matrix, brings team members together in one physical
location for the entire project, or for important periods during the project life cycle. Many
times on large projects the project manager will make provisions in the project budget to
bring the team together at the same location. One way to achieve colocation might be
to set aside a common meeting room, sometimes called a war room, for team members
who are located in different buildings or across town to meet and exchange information.
   Multiple locations can also be a big time-waster for you as the project manager and for
your team members. If some team members are located in one part of town and another set
of team members are located across town, you'll find yourself in the car (or the bus) driving
back and forth to make face-to-face contact and get status updates. Conducting team meet-
ings also becomes a hassle as one set of team members or the other must drive to another
location (or both to a central location) to have a meeting.
   Our busy, conflicting schedules and differences in location don't always allow for face-
to-face communication, so email is the next best thing. Email can keep the information
flowing when you aren't able to meet in person, and it can even help take the heat out of
conflicts that might escalate if you were meeting one-on-one. However, email cannot reveal
tone of voice, facial expressions, or body language, and sometimes words alone are misin-
terpreted. Sometimes those nonverbal cues are more important than what's being said. If
you don't know your team members or stakeholders well, I recommend meeting with them
personally whenever you can. Once you've established good relationships with them, you
should be able to balance the use of email and personal interactions and know when it's
time to call a face-to-face meeting. In reality, it's often difficult to get your team together
physically. A good solution in lieu of having people relocate is videoconferencing or Internet
meetings. Team members scattered across the country have access to the Internet, and it's
relatively easy to find a time everyone can meet via the web. Videoconferencing or video
web conferencing are the best options if available because they allow intonation and non-
verbal behaviors to be part of the communication process.
400        Chapter 8      Developing the Project Team



Communication Technology
Communication technology refers to the methods you can use to perform communication.
These include email, chat, video chat, videoconferencing, portals that allow for collabora-
tion and sharing of documents and information, and teleconferencing.

Interpersonal Skills
Interpersonal skills are often referred to as soft skills or emotional intelligence. Soft skills
include such things as leadership, influence, negotiation, communications, motivation, empa-
thy, conflict management, negotiation, team building, and creativity. For example, it's impor-
tant for you as the project manager to understand your project team members' attitudes and
opinions about their work. Bad attitudes, as the saying goes, are contagious. It doesn't mean
the person who has the attitude is bad, but if you're paying attention to your team members
and taking the appropriate amount of time to listen to their legitimate concerns and issues,
and taking action on them, you can go a long way toward stemming bad attitudes.
   Soft skills can be learned, but in my experience they are more often inherent in proj-
ect managers' personalities. However, just because certain soft skills may not be in your
nature, it doesn't mean you can't observe this behavior in others and incorporate those
skills into your management techniques.
   One other issue to consider regarding this tool and technique is that you'll have
resources from other departments who have assignments on the project that you're respon-
sible for overseeing. For example, the finance department and the marketing department
might have assigned project activities, and as the project manager, you'll manage their
progress. This implies that you'll need general knowledge management skills to understand
what the assignments entail and strong leadership and negotiation skills to influence the
departments to stay on schedule.

Interpersonal Skills: Team-Building Activities
Many times, project teams consist of folks who don't know each other. They aren't neces-
sarily aware of the project objectives and might not even want to be a part of the team.
Or the project manager might not have previously worked with the people assigned to the
project team. Does this sound like a recipe for disaster? It's not. Thousands of projects are
started with team members and project managers who don't know each other, and those
projects come to a successful completion. How is that done? It's a result of the project
manager's team-building and communication skills.
   The project manager's job is to bring the team together, get its members all headed in
the right direction, and provide motivation, reward, and recognition to keep the team in
tip-top shape. This is done using a variety of team-building techniques and exercises. Team
building is simply getting a diverse group of people to work together in the most efficient
and effective manner possible. This might involve events organized by the management
team or individual actions designed to improve team performance. You can find entire
volumes on this subject, and it's beyond the scope of this book to go into all the team-
building possibilities. The exam tends to focus more on the theories behind team building
and the characteristics of effective teams, so that's what you'll spend your time exploring.
                                                   Developing the Project Team             401




   Dr. Bruce Tuckman and Mary Ann Jensen developed a model that describes how teams
develop and mature. According to Tuckman and Jensen, all newly formed teams go through
five stages of development:
1.   Forming
2.   Storming
3.   Norming
4.   Performing
5.   Adjourning
   Tuckman and Jensen originally devised this theory using the first four stages of develop-
ment. Based on later research by the Tuckman-Jensen team, a fifth stage of development
was added called adjourning. You've probably seen this model elsewhere, but because these
stages might show up on the exam, you'll want to memorize them. Let's take a brief look at
each of them:
Forming This one is easy. Forming is the beginning stage of team formation, when all the
members are brought together, introduced, and told the objectives of the project. This is
where team members learn why they're working together. During this stage, team members
tend to be formal and reserved and take on an "all-business" approach.
Your role as the project manager in this stage of development is communication. If the team
is small, I recommend meeting with each of the members one-on-one and as a group. In my
experience, team members who clearly understand why they are assigned to the project,
what's expected of them regarding individual and team deliverables, and how to inform the
project manager of their needs and issues will generally outperform their peers who do not
have or understand this information.
Storming Storming is where the action begins. Team members become confrontational
with each other as they're vying for position and control during this stage. They're working
through who is going to be the top dog and jockeying for status.
Your role as the project manager during this stage is to remind the team of the project goals
and keep everyone centered on those goals. Conflicts aren't bad in this case; they're neces-
sary to get the team into the next stage. During this stage, it is best if you can limit your
intervention and let team members resolve their own issues as often as possible. Team mem-
bers need to get a feel for where they stand, where the extent of their responsibility lies,
and how they'll accomplish their tasks working with the other personalities of the team,
and that usually involves some tussles. Questioning and conflict help clarify the goals of the
project for everyone on the team, not just the person in conflict, so encourage your team
members to ask questions and discuss conflicts openly. However, you won't progress to the
next stage until the team has resolved the conflicts.
Norming Now things begin to calm down. Team members know each other fairly well
by now. They're comfortable with their positions in the team, and they begin to deal with
project problems instead of people problems. In the norming stage, they confront the proj-
ect concerns and problems instead of each other. Decisions are made jointly at this stage,
and team members exhibit mutual respect and familiarity with one another.
402        Chapter 8      Developing the Project Team



As the project manager, you should continue to hold team meetings, especially during
this stage, because team members can fall back into the storming stage if left to their own
devices. During this stage, you should intervene more often when conflicts arise to keep the
team moving forward. Monitor each team member's participation, and encourage the team
to continue to remain focused on the project's goals and alert you of any problems as soon
as they arise.
Teams in the norming stage are efficient, functioning teams. If your team has progressed
to this stage, they'll likely be productive and work effectively toward meeting the project
goals. They still aren't performing at their absolute best, though--that happens in the
next stage.


Exam Spotlight

Different teams progress through the stages of development at different rates. When new
team members are brought onto the team, the development stages start all over again. It
doesn't matter where the team is in the first four phases of the development process--a
new member will start the cycle all over again.



Performing Ahh, perfection. Well, almost, anyway. This stage is where great teams end
up and where team members are productive and effective. The level of trust among team
members is high, and great things are achieved. This is the mature development stage.
Your role as project manager during this stage should be more focused on the project man-
agement processes than on the team itself. Teams in this stage are usually self-directed and
will hum along smoothly, provided you continue to update them on project progress and
keep the lines of communication open.
Adjourning As the name implies, this phase refers to the breakup of the team after the
work is completed.
   As the project manager, you need to realize that many team members may experi-
ence a sense of loss at the end of the project, particularly long-term projects. Guide the
team through a closure process. Team celebrations at the conclusion of the project are
one way to accomplish this. Acknowledge their contributions and let them know you
are grateful for their efforts and for any sacrifices they've made during the course of the
project.
   According to Tuckman and Jensen, leaders adapt their leadership styles as the teams
develop maturity and progress through the development stages. For example, early in the
forming stage, leaders take on a direct style of leadership. As the team progresses, their
leaders will employ a coaching, participating, and then delegating style of leadership to
match the level of development the team has achieved.
   You'll now take a closer look at focusing your team members throughout these stages of
development, along with some of the characteristics of effective teams.
                                                    Developing the Project Team             403




Team Focus
It's paramount that the team members know and understand the goals and objectives of the
project. They should all understand the direction in which they're headed and work toward
that end. After all, that's the reason they were brought together in the first place. Keep
in mind that people see and hear things from their own perspective. A room full of people
attending a speech will each come away with something a little different because what
was said speaks to their particular situation in life at the time. In other words, their own
perceptions filter what they hear. It's your job as project manager to make sure the team
members understand the project goals and their own assignments correctly. I suggest you
use solid communication skills to get your point across. Ask your team members to tell
you in their own words what they believe the project goals are. This is a great way to know
whether you've got everyone on board and a great opportunity for you to clarify any
misunderstandings regarding the project goals.

Effective Team Characteristics
Effective teams are typically very energetic teams. They often are characterized as high-
performance teams and are motivated by results and the successful completion of tasks.
Their enthusiasm is contagious, and it feeds on itself. They generate a lot of creativity and
become good problem solvers. Teams like this are every project manager's dream. Investing
yourself in team building as well as relationship building--especially when you don't think
you have the time to do so--will bring many benefits. Here's a sample of the benefits:
    Better conflict resolution
    Commitment to the project
    Commitment to the project team members and project manager
    High job satisfaction
    Enhanced communication
    A sense of belonging and purpose
    Enhanced feelings of trust
    Lower project costs
    Improved productivity
    Improved quality
    A successful project
   Dysfunctional teams will typically produce the opposite results of the benefits just listed.
Dysfunctional teams don't just happen by themselves any more than great teams do. Sure,
sometimes you're lucky enough to get the right combination of folks together right off the
bat. But usually, team building takes work and dedication on the part of the project man-
ager. Even in the situations where you do get that dynamite combination of people, they
will benefit from team-building exercises and feedback.
404         Chapter 8      Developing the Project Team



   Unfortunately, sour attitudes are just as contagious as enthusiasm. Watch for these
symptoms among your team members, and take action to correct the situation before the
entire team is affected:
      Lack of motivation or "don't care" attitudes
      Project work that isn't satisfactory
      Status meetings that turn into whining sessions
      Poor communication
      Lack of respect for and lack of trust in the project manager


                   No amount of team building will make up for poor project planning or inef-
                   fective project management techniques. Neglecting these things and fool-
                   ing yourself into thinking that your project team is good enough to make
                   up for the poor planning or poor techniques could spell doom for your
                   project. Besides that, it's not fair to your project team to put them in that
                   position.

Training
Training is a matter of assessing your team members' skills and abilities, assessing the proj-
ect needs, and providing the training necessary for the team members to carry out their
assigned activities. Training can be formal or informal. Formal training may include class-
room training, online training, or training performed on the job. Informal training might
occur by observing others or asking others how to perform a task. Training can sometimes
be a reward as well. In the software industry, programmers seek out positions that offer
training on the latest and greatest technologies, and they consider it a benefit or bonus to
attend training on the company dollar and time. If you know early in the Planning pro-
cesses that training is necessary, include the details of this in the staffi ng management plan.
During the course of the project, you might observe team members who need training, or
they might ask for training. Update the staffi ng management plan with this information.

Individual and Team Assessments
Assessment tools help highlight the strengths and weaknesses of the team by assessing
various aspects of the team, such as communication techniques, interpersonal skills and
preferences, organizational skills, decision-making skills, and more. There are many tools
available that can help in assessing work preference traits such as Emergenetics(R), Myers-
Briggs MBTI(R), DiSC(R), and many more. Surveys, interviews, focus groups, ability exams,
and other tools can be used to assess your team's abilities, strengths, and weaknesses.

Recognition and Rewards
I have quite a bit of ground to cover with recognition and rewards. As I said earlier, you
could see several exam questions regarding team building, so dig out all your favorite mem-
orization techniques and put them to use.
                                                     Developing the Project Team             405




    Team building starts with project planning and doesn't stop until the project is com-
pleted. It involves employing techniques to improve your team's performance and keeping
team members motivated. Motivation helps people work more efficiently and produce bet-
ter results. If clear expectations, clear procedures, and the right motivational tools are used,
project teams will excel.
    Motivation can be extrinsic or intrinsic. Intrinsic motivators are specific to the indi-
vidual. Some people are just naturally driven to achieve--it's part of their nature. (I suspect
this is a motivator for you since you're reading this book.) Cultural and religious influences
are forms of intrinsic motivators as well.
    Extrinsic motivators are material rewards and might include bonuses, the use of a com-
pany car, stock options, gift certificates, training opportunities, extra time off, and so on.
Reward and recognition--a tool and technique of the Develop Team process--is an exam-
ple of an extrinsic motivator. We'll look at motivators next.
    Recognition and rewards are important parts of team motivation. They are formal ways
of recognizing and promoting desirable behavior and are most effective when carried out
by the management team and the project manager. You should develop and document the
criteria for rewards, especially monetary awards. Although rewards and recognition help
build a team, they can also kill morale if you don't have an established method or criteria
for handing them out. Track who is receiving awards throughout the project. For example,
if you have consistent overachievers on the team, you could kill morale by consistently
rewarding the same one or two people repeatedly. It could also be perceived that you're
playing favorites. If team members believe the rewards are win-lose (also known as zero-
sum) and that only certain team members will be rewarded, you might end up hurting
morale more than helping. If you find yourself in this position, consider team awards. This
is a win-win because all team members are recognized for their contributions. Recognition
and rewards should be proportional to the achievement. In other words, appropriately
link the reward to the performance. For example, a project manager who has responsibil-
ity for the project budget and the procurement process and keeps the costs substantially
under budget without sacrificing the results of the project should be rewarded for this
achievement. However, if these responsibilities are assigned to a functional manager in the
organization, it wouldn't be appropriate to reward a project manager who was not the one
responsible for keeping the costs in line.




Baker's Gift Baskets

You're a contract project manager for Baker's Gift Baskets. This company assembles gift
baskets of all styles and shapes with every edible treat imaginable. The company has
recently experienced explosive growth, and you've been brought on board to manage
its new project. The owners of the company want to offer "pick-your-own" baskets
that allow customers to pick the individual items they want included in the baskets. In
406        Chapter 8      Developing the Project Team




addition, they're introducing a new line of containers to choose from, including items
such as miniature golf bags, flowerpots, serving bowls, and the like. This means changes
to the catalog and the website to accommodate the new offerings.

The deadline for this project is the driving constraint. The website changes won't cause
any problems with the deadline. However, the catalog must go to press quickly to meet
holiday mailing deadlines, which in turn are driving the project deadline.

Your team members put their heads together and came up with an ingenious plan to
meet the catalog deadline. It required lots of overtime and some weekend work on their
part to pull it off, but they met the date.

You decide this is a perfect opportunity to recognize and reward the team for their out-
standing efforts. You've arranged a slot on the agenda at the next all-company meeting to
bring your team up front and praise them for their cooperation and efforts to get the cata-
log to the printers on time. You'll also present each of them with two days of paid time off
and a gift certificate for a dinner with their family at an exclusive restaurant in the city.


   Team members should be rewarded for going above and beyond the call of duty.
Perhaps they put in a significant amount of overtime to meet a project goal or spent nights
round-the-clock babysitting ill-performing equipment. These types of behaviors should be
rewarded and formally recognized by the project manager and the management team. On
the other hand, if the ill-performing equipment was a direct result of mistakes made or if it
happened because of poor planning, rewards would not be appropriate, obviously.
   Consider individual preferences and cultural differences when using rewards and rec-
ognitions. Some people don't like to be recognized in front of a group; others thrive on it.
Some people appreciate an honest thank-you with minimal fanfare, and others just won't
accept individual rewards because their culture doesn't allow it. Keep this in mind when
devising your reward system.
   There are many theories on motivation. As a project manager, it's important to under-
stand them so that you can tailor your recognition and rewards programs to take into
account the reasons people do what they do. You might encounter questions on these theo-
ries on the exam, so we'll discuss their primary points in the following sections.

Motivational Theories
Motivational theories came about during the modern age. Prior to today's information- and
service-type jobs and yesterday's factory work, the majority of people worked the land
and barely kept enough food on the table to feed their family. No one was concerned about
motivation at work. You worked because you wouldn't have anything to eat if you didn't.
Fortunately, that isn't the only reason most people work today.
   Today we have a new set of problems in the workplace. Workers in the service- and
knowledge-based industries aren't concerned with starvation--that need has been replaced
with other needs, such as job satisfaction, a sense of belonging and commitment to the project,
                                                    Developing the Project Team             407




good working conditions, and so on. Motivational theories present ideas on why people act the
way they do and how you can influence them to act in certain ways to get the results you want.
Again, there are libraries full of books on this topic. I'll cover four of those theories here.
Maslow's hierarchy of neeDs
You have probably seen this classic example of motivational theory. Abraham Maslow the-
orized that humans have five basic needs arranged in hierarchical order. The fi rst needs are
physical needs, such as the need for food, clothing, and shelter. The idea is that these needs
must be met before the person can move to the next level of needs in the hierarchy, which
includes safety and security needs. Here, the concern is for the person's physical welfare
and the security of their belongings. Once that need is met, they progress to the next
level, and so on.
    Maslow's hierarchy of needs theory suggests that once a lower-level need has been met,
it no longer serves as a motivator and the next higher level becomes the driving motiva-
tor in a person's life. Maslow conjectures that humans are always in one state of need or
another. Here is a recap of each of the needs, starting with the highest level and ending
with the lowest:
Self-Actualization   Performing at your peak potential
Self-Esteem Needs    Accomplishment, respect for self, capability
Social Needs   A sense of belonging, love, acceptance, friendship
Safety and Security Needs    Your physical welfare and the security of your belongings
Basic Physical Needs Food, clothing, shelter
   The highest level of motivation in this theory is the state of self-actualization. Several
years ago, the United States Army had a slogan that I think encapsulates self-actualization
very well: "Be all that you can be." When all the physical, safety, social, and self-esteem
needs have been met, you reach a state of independence where you're able to express your-
self and perform at your peak. You'll do good work just for the sake of doing good work.
Recognition and self-esteem are the motivators at lower levels; now the need for being the
best you can be is reached.


                 In Maslow's later work, he discussed three additional aspects of motiva-
                 tion: cognitive, aesthetic, and transcendence. The five key needs are the
                 ones you'll most likely need to know for the exam, but it wouldn't hurt to
                 be familiar with the names of the three additional motivational levels. Also
                 note that people are not "stuck" at a certain level forever. You will traverse
                 the pyramid, up and down, throughout your life and career.

hygiene Theory
Frederick Herzberg came up with the Hygiene Theory, also known as the Motivation-Hygiene
Theory. He postulates that two factors contribute to motivation: hygiene factors and moti-
vators. Hygiene factors deal with work environment issues. The thing to remember about
408        Chapter 8       Developing the Project Team



hygiene factors is that they prevent dissatisfaction. Examples of hygiene factors are pay, ben-
efits, the conditions of the work environment, and relationships with peers and managers. Pay
is considered a hygiene factor because Herzberg believed that over the long term, pay is not a
motivator. Being paid for the work prevents dissatisfaction but doesn't necessarily bring satis-
faction in and of itself. He believed this to be true as long as the pay system is equitable. If two
workers performing the same functions have large disparities in pay, then pay can become a
motivator.
    Motivators deal with the substance of the work itself and the satisfaction one derives
from performing the functions of the job. Motivators lead to satisfaction. The ability to
advance, the opportunity to learn new skills, and the challenges involved in the work are
all motivators, according to Herzberg.



Exam Spotlight

For the exam, remember that Herzberg was the inventor of the Hygiene Theory and
that this theory claims that hygiene factors (pay, benefits, and working conditions) pre-
vent dissatisfaction whereas motivators (challenging work, opportunities to learn, and
advancement) lead to satisfaction.



Expectancy Theory
The Expectancy Theory, first proposed by Victor Vroom, says that the expectation of a
positive outcome drives motivation. People will behave in certain ways if they think there
will be good rewards for doing so. Also note that this theory says the strength of the expec-
tancy drives the behavior. This means the expectation or likelihood of the reward is linked
to the behavior. For example, if you tell your two-year-old to put the toys back in the toy
box and you'll give her a cookie to do so, chances are she'll put the toys away. This is a rea-
sonable reward for a reasonable action. However, if you promise your project team mem-
bers vacations in Hawaii if they get the project done early and they know there is no way
you can deliver that reward, there is little motivation to work toward it. Also make certain
you are using rewards that motivate your team members. If you make a trip to Hawaii the
reward, and you can make good on that promise in this example, but your team members
are deathly afraid of flying, the reward won't have a motivating effect.
   This theory also says that people become what you expect of them. If you openly praise
your project team members and treat them like valuable contributors, you'll likely have a
high-performing team on your hands. Conversely, when you publicly criticize people or let
them know that you have low expectations regarding their performance, they'll likely live
up (or down as the case might be) to that expectation as well.
Achievement Theory
The Achievement Theory, attributed to David McClelland, says that people are moti-
vated by the need for three things: achievement, power, and affiliation. The achievement
                                                     Developing the Project Team               409




motivation is obviously the need to achieve or succeed. The power motivation involves a
desire for influencing the behavior of others, and the need for affiliation is relationship ori-
ented. Workers want to have friendships with their co-workers and a sense of camaraderie
with their fellow team members. The strength of your team members' desire for each of
these will drive their performance on various activities.


Exam Spotlight

Make certain you understand the theories of motivation and their premises for the exam.
Here's a summary to help you memorize them:

Maslow's Hierarchy of Needs Abraham Maslow. Needs must be satisfied in a hierarchi-
cal order.

Hygiene Theory Frederick Herzberg. Work environment (pay, benefits, and working con-
ditions) prevents dissatisfaction.

Expectancy Theory Victor Vroom. Expectation of positive outcomes drives motivation.

Achievement Theory      David McClelland. People are motivated by achievement, power,
and affiliation.



   I'll cover two more theories in the leadership section, which is next. They deal specifi-
cally with how leaders interact with their project team members.

Leadership vs. Management
Chapter 1, "What Is a Project?," introduced the differences between leaders and managers.
I'll add a bit more information here regarding leadership theories and the types of power
leaders possess, but first I'll recap leadership and management.
    Recall that leadership is about imparting vision and rallying people around that vision.
Leaders motivate and inspire and are concerned with strategic vision. Leaders have a knack
for getting others to do what needs to be done.
    Two of the techniques they use to do this are power and politics. Power is the ability to
get people to do what they wouldn't do ordinarily. It's also the ability to influence behavior.
Politics imparts pressure to conform regardless of whether people agree with the decision.
Leaders understand the difference between power and politics and when to employ each
technique. I'll talk more about power shortly.
    Good leaders have committed team members who believe in the vision of the leader.
Leaders set direction and time frames and have the ability to attract good talent to work
for them. Leaders inspire a vision and get things done through others by earning loyalty,
respect, and cooperation from team members. They set the course and lead the way. Good
leaders are directive in their approach but allow for plenty of feedback and input. Good
leaders commonly have strong interpersonal skills and are well respected.
410        Chapter 8      Developing the Project Team



   Managers are generally task oriented and concerned with issues such as plans, controls,
budgets, policies, and procedures. They're generalists with a broad base of planning and
organizational skills, and their primary goal is satisfying stakeholder needs. They also pos-
sess motivational skills and the ability to recognize and reward behavior.


                  Project managers need to use the traits of both leaders and managers at
                  different times during a project. On large projects, a project manager will
                  act more like a leader, inspiring the subproject managers to get on board
                  with the objectives. On small projects, project managers will act more like
                  managers because they're responsible for all the planning and coordinat-
                  ing functions.

  I'll discuss six theories regarding leadership and management. They are Douglas
McGregor's Theory X and Theory Y, Dr. William Ouchi's Theory Z, the Contingency
Theory, the Tannenbaum and Schmidt Continuum Management Theory, and the Situational
Leadership Theory. Then I'll discuss the types of power leaders use and leadership styles.
Theory x, Theory y, anD Theory Z
Douglas McGregor defi ned two models of worker behavior, Theory X and Theory Y,
that attempt to explain how different managers deal with their team members. Theory X
managers believe most people do not like work and will try to steer clear of it; they believe
people have little to no ambition, need constant supervision, and won't actually perform
the duties of their job unless threatened. As a result, Theory X managers are like dictators
and impose very rigid controls over their people. They believe people are motivated only by
punishment, money, or position. Unfortunately for the team members, Theory X manag-
ers unknowingly also subscribe to the Expectancy Theory. If they expect people to be lazy
and unproductive and treat them as such, their team members probably will be lazy and
unproductive.
   Theory Y managers believe people are interested in performing their best given the right
motivation and proper expectations. These managers provide support to their teams, are
concerned about their team members, and are good listeners. Theory Y managers believe
people are creative and committed to the project goals, that they like responsibility and
seek it out, and that they are able to perform the functions of their positions with limited
supervision.
   Theory Z was developed by Dr. William Ouchi. This theory is concerned with increas-
ing employee loyalty to their organizations. It came about in Japan in the 1980s when jobs
were often offered for life. This theory results in increased productivity, it puts an emphasis
on the well-being of the employees both at work and outside of work, it encourages steady
employment, and it leads to high employee satisfaction and morale.
conTingency Theory
The Contingency Theory builds on a combination of Theory Y behaviors and the Hygiene
Theory. The Contingency Theory, in a nutshell, says that people are motivated to achieve
levels of competency and will continue to be motivated by this need even after competency
is reached.
                                                   Developing the Project Team            411



Tannenbaum and Schmidt Continuum Management Theory
Robert Tannenbaum and Warren Schmidt developed a leadership theory, called the
Tannenbaum and Schmidt Continuum Management Theory, that describes the level of
authority a manager exerts on the team versus the freedom a team has to make decisions
(under the guidance of the manager). They outline seven levels of delegated freedom rang-
ing from the manager making all decisions and announcing them to the team to the man-
ager allowing the team to identify the problem, determine alternatives, and make the final
recommendation regarding the action needed to solve the problem. The level of freedom
you use depends on the maturity and experience of the team and the manager. As the team
progresses, their decision making matures, and more and more freedom can be delegated.
Managers are always engaged at all levels of this model, but their authority level will
decrease as they delegate decision-making responsibility to the team.
Situational Leadership Theory
Paul Hersey and Ken Blanchard developed the Situational Leadership Theory during the
mid-1970 s. This theory's main premise is that the leadership style you use depends on the
situation. For example, perhaps you have a new employee fresh out of school and she is
learning a new task. Obviously, this employee will need a lot more guidance and direction
than an employee who has been with the organization for some time and knows how to
perform the task at hand. Both Hersey and Blanchard went on to develop their own situa-
tional leadership models. Blanchard's model, Situational Leadership II, describes four styles
of leadership that depend on the situation: directing, coaching, supporting, and delegating.

The Power of Leaders
As stated earlier, power is the ability to influence others to do what you want them to
do. Power can be used in a positive manner or a negative one. But that old saying of your
grandmother's about attracting more flies with honey than vinegar still holds true today.
   Leaders, managers, and project managers use power to convince others to do tasks in a
specific way. The kind of power they use to accomplish this depends on their personality,
their personal values, and the company culture.
   A project manager might use several forms of power. I've already talked about reward
power, which is the ability to grant bonuses or incentive awards for a job well done. Here
are a few more:
Punishment Power Punishment, also known as coercive or penalty power, is just the
opposite of reward power. The employee is threatened with consequences if expectations
are not met.
Expert Power Expert power occurs when the person being influenced believes the man-
ager, or the person doing the influencing, is knowledgeable about the subject or has special
abilities that make them an expert. The person goes along just because they think the influ-
encer knows what they're doing and it's the best thing for the situation.
Legitimate Power Legitimate, or formal, power comes about as a result of the influencer's
position. Because that person is the project manager, executive vice president, or CEO, they
have the power to call the shots and make decisions.
412       Chapter 8      Developing the Project Team



Referent Power Referent power is inferred to the influencer by their subordinates. Project
team members who have a great deal of respect and high regard for their project managers
willingly go along with decisions made by the project manager because of referent power.
   Punishment power should be used as a last resort and only after all other forms have
been exhausted. Sometimes you'll have to use this method, but I hope much less often than
the other three forms of power. Sometimes you'll have team members who won't live up
to expectations and their performance suffers as a result. This is a case where punishment
power is enacted to get the employees to correct their behavior.

Leadership Styles
Extensive research has been done in the area of leadership styles. I will highlight a few of
the well-known styles for exam purposes, but I encourage you to read more about leader-
ship on your own. You can train almost anyone to follow the principles and practices of
sound project management, but you won't have much of a team to lead if you haven't mas-
tered the art of great leadership.
Autocratic Autocratic leaders are essentially dictators. All decisions are made by the
leader with little to no input from the team.
Laissez-Faire This leadership style is the opposite of the autocratic style. The leader
allows the team to drive decisions and recommend actions and has little involvement in the
process.
Democratic Democratic, or participative, driven leaders gather all the facts and ask for
input from the team before making a decision. In this style, all team members participate in
the decision-making process.
Situational As we discussed earlier, the Blanchard theory of situational leadership has
four styles. Directing is used when a team member needs to know the step-by-step proce-
dures for the problem. Coaching is used with team members who have limited experience
with the task at hand. They can perform some minor functions of the task but need direc-
tion with the majority of the task. Supporting is used with team members who have com-
pleted the same types of tasks in the past and are able to complete the majority of the task
at hand on their own. They may need to ask a question or two to obtain guidance along the
way. Delegating is used when team members have performed the same tasks in the past and
are capable of making decisions regarding unexpected issues that may occur. Delegating
involves little to no input from the leader.
Transactional and Transformational Transactional and transformational leadership
styles were first developed by Bernard Bass, who was a professor emeritus in the School
of Management at Binghamton. He describes transactional leaders as autocratic, activ-
ity focused, and autonomous, and they use contingent reward systems and manage by
exception.
   Transformational leaders tend to focus on relationships rather than activities; they
are collaborative and influential and inspire and motivate their teams to perform. Bass
describes transformational leaders as empowering and concerned with social justice, equity,
and fairness.

Exam Spotlight

Know the difference between leaders and managers, the motivational and leadership
theories, and the types of power for the PMP (R) exam. Here's a summary to help you mem-
orize them:

Leaders Leaders motivate, inspire, and create buy-ins for the organization's strategic
vision. Leaders use power and politics to accomplish the vision.

Managers    Managers are task oriented and concerned with satisfying stakeholder needs.

Theory X - McGregor     Most people don't like work.

Theory Y - McGregor     People are motivated to perform their best given proper expecta-
tions and motivation.

Theory Z - Ouchi The implementation of this theory increases employee loyalty and
leads to high satisfaction and morale.

Contingency Theory People are motivated to achieve levels of competency and will con-
tinue to be motivated after competency is reached.

Tannenbaum and Schmidt Continuum Management Theory               You use seven levels of
delegated freedom when working with the team.

Situational Leadership Theory Hersey and Blanchard developed this theory, which states
that different situations call for different leadership styles. Blanchard describes the styles
in the Situational Leadership II Model as directing, coaching, supportive, and delegating.

Reward Power You reward desirable behavior with incentives or bonuses.

Punishment Power You threaten team members with consequences if expectations are
not met (also known as penalty or coercive power).

Expert Power The person doing the influencing has significant knowledge or skills
regarding the subject.

Legitimate Power This is the power of the position held by the influencer (the president
or vice president, for example), also known as formal power.

Referent Power This is power that's inferred to the influencer.



Outputs of Develop Team
You're now ready to close out the Develop Team process. This process has six outputs:
    Team performance assessments
    Change requests
    Project management plan updates (resource management plan)
414         Chapter 8      Developing the Project Team



      Project documents updates (lessons learned register, project schedule, project team
      assignments, resource calendars, team charter)
      Enterprise environmental factors updates
      Organizational process assets updates
   You may recall that the purpose of the resource management plan is to document how
resources are categorized, distributed or allocated, and managed. This plan may need
updating after performing this process. After you've acquired resources, their availability
may impact the schedule so the project schedule may need updating. The team charter
should be updated with any guidelines that may need to change, resource calendars may
also need updating with the availability of the new resources, and don't forget that lessons
learned may also need updating. EEF updates may include skills assessments and develop-
ment plan records for the employees you've acquired. OPA updates include training
requirements and assessment of personnel updates. Let's take a closer look at team
performance assessments and some of the ways you can perform this output.

Team Performance Assessments
Team performance assessments involve determining a team's effectiveness. As a result
of positive team-building experiences, you'll see individuals improving their skills, team
behaviors and relationships improving, conflict resolutions going smoothly, reduced turn-
over, and team members recommending ways to improve the work of the project. I talked
about effective team characteristics earlier in this chapter. Assessing these characteristics
will help you determine where (or whether) the project team needs improvements.
    Assessing the team may also include appraising the performance of individual team
members. In order to assess team member performance, you have to observe it. I hope
you've also learned how important communication is to the success of the project. This
includes communicating with your team members. I know project managers who are reti-
cent to engage their teams in conversation unless it's official project business. I've even
known project managers who've instructed their administrative assistants to give specific
directions to other team members. It's difficult to understand a team member's attitude or
viewpoint toward the project if you're communicating through someone else. Establish an
open door policy with your team members and live up to it. The benefits are so great that
it's worth a few minutes a day of chitchat to establish that feeling of trust and camaraderie.
If your team perceives you as open, honest, and willing to listen, you'll be the first person
they come to when issues arise.




What Not to Do

Tina is a newly minted project manager. She has worked on many projects as the assis-
tant project manager, but this is the first time she has led the charge. Tina is so shy she
finds it difficult to give team members any kind of direction or to assign tasks, so she
                                                      Developing the Project Team              415




has her administrative assistant do it for her. Tina tells her administrative assistant what
needs to be done and who needs to do it and leaves it to the assistant to inform the
appropriate team members.

As the project progresses, schedule milestone dates are missed, and Tina discovers tasks
that haven't started that were scheduled to begin two weeks ago. Coming in from lunch
one day she sees several project team members huddled around her administrative assis-
tant's desk. From what she overhears, they are discussing a risk event that occurred on
the project.

Fortunately for Tina, one of the project managers she has worked for in the past under-
stands what is happening. Because the administrative assistant is the one who has estab-
lished relationships with the team and is in effect giving the orders, the team is treating
her as the project manager instead of Tina. Tina's friend has a one-on-one coaching
session with Tina about her management style and the importance of conversation and
observation. Together they are able to get the project back on track.



    Team member performance assessments are typically annual or semiannual affairs
where managers let their employees know what they think of their performance over the
past year and rate them accordingly. They are also the perfect time to review the employee's
job description and clarify roles and responsibilities. Appraisals are usually manager-to-
employee exchanges but can incorporate a 360-degree review, which takes in feedback
from just about everyone the team member interacts with, including stakeholders, custom-
ers, project manager, peers, subordinates, and the delivery person if they have a significant
amount of project interaction. I'm not a fan of 360-degree reviews because they make most
nonmanager types uncomfortable. "I don't want to rate my peer," is a typical response. I
also find 360-degree reviews are biased. At best you'll get a response like this: "Oh, Ken
is great, just great. No problems--a good guy." Or you'll get exactly the opposite if the
person you're speaking with doesn't like the team member you're reviewing. Performance
appraisal should be a bit more constructive than this. Nonetheless, understand the
360-degree concept for the exam.
    No matter what type of appraisal is conducted, project managers should contribute to
the performance appraisals of all project team members. You should be aware of potential
loyalty issues when you're working in a matrix organizational structure. The team member
in this structure reports to both you (as the project manager) and a functional manager. If
the project manager does not have an equal say, or at least some say, about the employee's
performance, it will cause the team member to be loyal to the functional manager and show
little loyalty to the project or project manager. Managing these dual-reporting relationships
is often a critical success factor for the project, and it is the project manager's responsibility
to ensure that these relationships are managed effectively.
    Performance appraisal time is also a good time to explore training needs, clarify roles
and responsibilities, set goals for the future, and so on.
416         Chapter 8      Developing the Project Team



Change Requests
Change requests may come about when team members are added or removed from the proj-
ect. During the Develop Team process, you may fi nd that the skills or knowledge needed
for certain tasks are not present on the existing team. This may require hiring outside
resources to supplement the team and this will generate a change request. Or perhaps some
team members are not good team players, and you'll need to assign those folks to other
tasks with less direct team interaction, or remove them from the team. Team members may
leave on their own accord, and this could generate a change request.


                   Project managers wear a lot of hats. This is one of the things that make this
                   job so interesting. You need organization and planning skills to plan the
                   project. You need motivation and sometimes disciplinary skills to execute
                   the project plans. You need to exercise leadership and power where
                   appropriate--and all the while, you have a host of relationships to manage,
                   involving team members, stakeholders, managers, and customers. It's a
                   great job and brings terrific satisfaction.




Managing Project Teams
The Manage Team process is concerned with tracking and reporting on the performance
of individual team members. During this process, performance appraisals are prepared and
conducted, issues are identified and resolved, and feedback is given to the team members.
Some team behavior is also observed during this process, but the main focus here is on indi-
viduals and their performance.



exam spotlight

Take note that the PMBOK (R) Guide states that one of the outcomes or results of the Manage
Team process is an update to the resource management plan, which is part of the project
management plan updates output of this process. Other outcomes to note are that issues
are resolved and information is provided for performance appraisals and lessons learned.



   With the exception of work performance reports, you've seen all the inputs to this pro-
cess before:
      Project management plan (resource management plan)
      Project documents (issue log, lessons learned register, project team assignments, team
      charter)
      Work performance reports
                                                         Managing Project Teams               417



    Team performance assessments
    Enterprise environmental factors
    Organizational process assets
   Work performance reports document the status of the project compared to the forecasts,
including but not limited to cost control, scope validation, schedule control, and quality
control. Keep in mind that work performance reports are an output of the Monitor and
Control Project Work process and an input to this one (an Executing process).


Tools and Techniques for Managing Teams
The tools and techniques for this process may seem at first glance to be the same as others
you've seen. Don't skip studying them because you'll likely see exam questions on these top-
ics. The tools and techniques of the Manage Team process are as follows:
    Interpersonal and team skills (conflict management, decision making, emotional intel-
    ligence, influencing, leadership)
    Project management information system
   We'll take a closer look at each of these tools in the following sections.

Conflict Management (Interpersonal and Team Skills)
I said earlier in this chapter that if you have more than one person working on your project,
you have a team. Here's another fact: If you have more than one person working on your
project, you'll have conflict.
   Everyone has desires, needs, and goals. Conflict comes into the picture when the desires,
needs, or goals of one party are incompatible with the desires, needs, or goals of another
party (or parties). Conflict, simply put, is the incompatibility of goals, which often leads
to one party resisting or blocking the other party from attaining their goals. Wait--this
doesn't sound like a party!



Exam Spotlight

The PMBOK (R) Guide notes that conflict can be reduced by implementing team ground
rules and group norms and utilizing well-grounded project management processes.
Regular and effective communication, and clear definitions of roles and responsibilities of
team members, will also go a long way in keeping conflict to a minimum.



   There are five styles of resolving conflict that might show up on the exam:
Force/Direct Force or direct is just as it sounds. One person forces a solution on the
other parties. This is where the boss puts on the "Because I'm the boss and I said so" hat.
Although this is a permanent solution, it isn't necessarily the best solution. People will go
418        Chapter 8      Developing the Project Team



along with it because, well, they're forced to go along with it. It doesn't mean they agree
with the solution. This isn't the best technique to use when you're trying to build a team.
This is an example of a win-lose conflict resolution technique. The forcing party wins, and
the losers are those who are forced to go along with the decision.
Smooth/Accommodate The smooth or accommodate technique does not lead to a per-
manent solution. It's a temporary way to resolve conflict, where the areas of agreement
are emphasized over the areas of difference so the real issue stays buried. Smoothing can
also occur when someone attempts to make the conflict appear less important than it is.
Everyone looks at each other and scratches their head and wonders why they thought the
conflict was such a big deal anyway. As a result, a compromise is reached, and everyone
feels good about the solution until they get back to their desk and start thinking about the
issue again. When they realize that the conflict was smoothed over and is more important
than they were led to believe, or that they never dealt with the issue at hand, they'll be back
at it, and the conflict will resurface. This is an example of a lose-lose conflict resolution
technique because neither side wins. Smoothing is also known as accommodating.
Compromise/Reconcile Parties that compromise or reconcile each give up something to
reach a solution. Everyone involved decides what they will give on and what they won't give
on, and eventually through all the give and take, a solution is reached. Neither side wins
or loses in this situation. As a result, neither side is gung ho about the decision that was
reached. They will drag their feet and reluctantly trudge along. If, however, both parties
make firm commitments to the resolution, then the solution becomes a permanent one.
Collaborate/Problem Solve The collaborate technique is also called problem solve and is
the best way to resolve conflict. One of the key actions you'll perform with this technique
is a fact-finding mission. The thinking here is that one right solution to a problem exists and
the facts will bear out the solution. Once the facts are uncovered, they're presented to the
parties and the decision will be clear. Thus, the solution becomes a permanent one and the
conflict expires. This is a win-win solution. Multiple viewpoints are discussed and shared
using this technique, and team members have the opportunity to examine all the perspec-
tives of the issue. Collaborating will lead to true consensus where team members commit to
the decision. This is the conflict resolution approach project managers use most often and is
an example of a win-win conflict resolution technique.
Withdraw/Avoid When parties withdraw or avoid, they never reach resolution. The
withdraw or avoid technique occurs when one of the parties gets up and leaves and refuses
to discuss the conflict. It is probably the worst of all the techniques because nothing gets
resolved. This is an example of a lose-lose conflict resolution technique.



Exam Spotlight

Know each of the conflict resolution techniques for the exam. Also remember that these
techniques will not necessarily yield long-term results. The smoothing and withdrawal
techniques have temporary results and aren't always good techniques to use to resolve
                                                          Managing Project Teams             419




problems. Resolutions reached through forcing and compromise might not always be
satisfying for all parties, but they tend to produce longer-lasting results. Collaborating
techniques are often successful and produce commitment to the decision provided all
parties believe they had the opportunity to provide their opinions and ideas.



    During the Manage Team process, it's important to note that, as in any situation, you'll
want to deal with confl ict as soon as it arises. According to the PMBOK(R) Guide, when you
have successfully resolved confl ict, it will result in increased productivity and better, more
positive working relationships.
    Most confl icts come about in the Manage Team process as a result of schedule issues,
availability of resources (usually the lack of availability), or personal work styles. When
project team members are having a confl ict, address them fi rst in private with the per-
son who has the issue. Work in a direct and collaborative manner, but be prepared to
escalate the issue into a more formalized procedure (potentially even disciplinary action)
if needed.
    If confl icts exist between the team members, encourage resolution between them with-
out intervention on your part. The best confl ict resolution will come about when they can
work out the issues between them. When that isn't possible, you'll have to step in and help
resolve the matter.
    Remember that a solid team charter and established policies and procedures will help
mitigate confl ict before it arises.

Decision Making, Influencing, Leadership (Interpersonal
and Team Skills)
We talked about interpersonal skills in the Develop Team process, but you should know for
the exam that the PMBOK(R) Guide points out three types of interpersonal skills used most
often in this process: leadership, influencing, and effective decision making. We've already
covered leadership and influencing. Effective decision making involves making decisions
in a timely manner and making decisions that reflect and support the goals of the project.
Effective decisions should bring about a good result for the project, the stakeholders, and
the team members. They also help you take advantage of opportunities and minimize nega-
tive risks. As project managers and good leaders, we have a responsibility to put the good
of the project and the organization over our own needs, so use sound judgment when mak-
ing decisions.


                  In the course of my career, I have seen many project managers drag their
                  feet when it comes to making a decision or downright refuse to make a
                  decision. No decision is a decision--in effect, you're choosing to do noth-
                  ing. This can have disastrous consequences for your project. Sometimes,
                  it's better to make a misguided decision than no decision at all. Be sure to
                  examine all the information known at the time, consult your experts, and
                  finally, make the decision.
420         Chapter 8      Developing the Project Team




Emotional Intelligence (Interpersonal and Team Skills)
We discussed soft skills, also considered emotional intelligence, in the tools and techniques
section of the Develop Team process. Soft skills also include the ability to read the emotions
of others as well as your own, and adjust and acknowledge when others are experiencing
tension, not participating at their usual pace, or showing other signs of stress. Team mem-
bers can practice this for each other as well and help identify when others have concerns,
lend a listening ear, anticipate others' actions, and recognize and acknowledge others' con-
cerns and issues.


PMIS
The project management information system is useful in this process in performing
resource management and for scheduling resources to their activities.


Managing Project Team Outputs
The outputs of the Manage Team process are the result of the conversations, performance
appraisals, and conflict resolution I've talked about previously. This process has four outputs:
      Change requests
      Project management plan updates (resource management plan, schedule baseline,
      cost baseline)
      Project documents updates (issue log, lessons learned register, project team
      assignments)
      Enterprise environmental factors updates
   Remember that the elements of these outputs pertain to human resources. For example,
change requests might come about as a result of a change in staffing, corrective actions might
come about because of disciplinary actions or training needs, and preventive actions
might be needed to reduce the impact of potential human resource issues. Any of these
actions might cause changes to the resource management plan, which means you should
update the project management plan. The issue log, roles and responsibilities descriptions,
lessons learned register, team charter, and/or project team assignments are examples of
project document updates that might need to be changed.
   Lessons learned encompasses everything you've learned about the human resources
aspect during this project, including documentation that can be used as templates on future
projects (such as org charts, position descriptions, and so on), techniques used to resolve
conflict, the types of conflict that came up during the project, when and how virtual teams
were used on the project and the procedures associated with them, the resource manage-
ment plan, special skills needed during the project that weren't known about during the
Planning processes, and the issue log.
   The enterprise environmental factors updates have two components that may need
updating as a result of this process: input to organizational performance appraisals and
                                                      Implement Risk Responses                421




personnel skill updates. The input for team performance assessments comes from the
project manager and the team members with significant interactions with the project and
each other.
   We have one more process to go in this chapter. We'll look at how and when to imple-
ment the risks responses you created in the Planning processes next.



Implement Risk Responses
The Implement Risk Responses process concerns putting the agreed-upon risk response
plans into action when needed. Risk response plans help to address overall project risk
exposure, and will help protect the project from threats (or reduce their impact) and/or take
advantage of opportunities. Remember the risk owners we talked about in Chapter 6? It
is their responsibility to monitor for risks and then implement the risk response plan. The
response plan isn't of much value if no one is paying attention to the risk symptoms or trig-
gers and taking action to manage the risks before they occur.


                 As the PMBOK (R) Guide makes a point of stating, the project team spends
                 a good deal of time and effort in working all the risk processes in the
                 Planning process group and if no one actually takes action to manage the
                 risks, you won't be able to reduce the impact of threats or take advantage
                 of opportunities.

   The key to this process is implementing the agreed-upon risk response plans. There
aren't any new inputs, tools and techniques, or outputs to discuss in this process so we'll
cover these elements quickly.
   The inputs of the Implement Risk Responses process include the following:
    Project management plan (risk management plan)
    Project documents (lessons learned register, risk register, risk report)
    Organizational process assets
   Here are the tools and techniques of the Implement Risk Reponses process:
    Expert judgment
    Interpersonal and team skills (influencing)
    Project management information system (PMIS)
    The influencing skill comes into play in this process when risk owners are not part of
the project team. Given that the project is probably not their top priority, the project man-
ager may have to nudge them and remind them to monitor the risks they own and put their
action plans into place.
    The outputs of this process include change requests and project documents updates
(issue log, lessons learned register, project team assignments, risk register, risk report).
422        Chapter 8      Developing the Project Team



   In the next chapter, we'll wrap up the Executing process group and examine the pro-
cesses associated with conducting procurements: providing quality assurance, distributing
information, communicating, managing the expectations of stakeholders, and implement-
ing and creating project knowledge.




Project Case Study: New Kitchen Heaven Retail Store

You are in Dirk's office giving him some good news.

"The lease is signed and the work of the project has started. Ricardo has several of his
staff members assigned to perform tasks related to the information technology deliver-
ables, as do Jill and Jake for their areas.

"I held a kickoff meeting with all the key project team members. We started out with some
team-building exercises, and I explained the five stages of team development. It's normal
to have some conflict as we're starting out, and I let them all know my door is always open
and if they have issues they can't resolve, they can come to me directly. I explained the
goals of the project, laid some ground rules for team interaction, and talked with them
about the conflict resolution techniques we'll use as we get further into the project."

"I'm just glad to hear we're finally doing something," Dirk replies.

"Even though Gomez Construction doesn't start until next week, they sent their crew
leader to the kickoff meeting. I was impressed with that."

Dirk asks, "Why isn't Gomez starting work now?"

"They aren't scheduled to start until September 20 and we need to get our procurement
documents signed. We have a week to finish up the signatures before they get here, so
we're in fine shape. But Ricardo's group has already prepared their procurement docu-
ments to purchase the switches and other equipment they need to start work. Bryan,
Ricardo's team lead, finished his other project sooner than anticipated, and since they
have Ethernet cable on hand, he started running cable today."

The key stakeholder from the marketing department peeks her head in Dirk's door. "I saw
you both in here and thought I'd ask you when someone from the project team is going to
work with me on the website announcement. I haven't heard anything, and I don't want
to cut this so close that we put something subpar on the website. The 50th anniversary
deserves a little splash."

"Okay," you reply. "I'll set up a meeting with you to get more information, and then I'll
work with Ricardo to determine who the best fit is. I've noted we need to assign someone
to this activity in the issue log. The person he thought he was going to assign to this task
is out on family leave, and we don't know when he's expected back."
                                                       Implement Risk Responses                  423




"Thanks," the stakeholder replies. "I also heard you lost a valuable team member last
week. I was really sorry to see Madelyn go. What happened? And will her loss impact the
project?"

"I don't want to go into all the details, but she violated our Internet acceptable use policy.
She was placed on disciplinary action on this very issue once before. This may impact the
project schedule because her activities were on the critical path. I've already interviewed
two internal candidates who've expressed interest in working on the project. I believe
either one would work out nicely. They have the skills we need and are very interested.
However, some ramp-up time is needed. I've added this to the risk list because we could
have an impact to the schedule if we don't get Madelyn replaced by the end of this week.
I've got a change request ready also, in case there is a schedule impact. I won't know
more until next week."

Dirk glances at his desk clock.

You stand and on your way to the door tell him, "Next week I'll hold a formal status
meeting with all the stakeholders and will begin distributing written weekly status
reports."

Understanding How This Applies
to Your Next Project
The topics in this chapter are some of my favorites because this is where project manage-
ment shines--dynamic teams working under the direction of a capable, responsible leader
who can effectively balance the needs of the team with the needs of the project (and ulti-
mately the organization) and pull it all off successfully. There aren't many things better
in an organization than a high-performing team working together to accomplish a well-
understood goal. It doesn't matter whether the team members are all in the same company,
department, or country. When they're working toward a common goal and functioning
at the performing level, there's almost nothing they can't accomplish. The movies Ocean's
Eleven, Ocean's Twelve, and Ocean's Thirteen are good examples of strong leadership
and dynamic teamwork at play. Although I'm certainly not advocating you turn to a life of
crime, you can pick up a few pointers on how effective teams work from George Clooney
and the gang.
   So, how does this apply? As the project manager, it's your responsibility, and dare I say
duty, to acquire the best team members possible for your project. In my experience, this
doesn't always mean all my team members are highly qualified. To me, team fit and team
dynamics are as important as the team members' skills. I know some will disagree with
me on this next point, but I believe it's easier to train someone on a new skill (given they
have the aptitude) than it is to take on a team member with an abrasive personality who is
eminently qualified but can't get along with anyone else on the team. Sometimes you don't
have much choice when it comes to picking team members, as referenced in the sidebar
"The Only Candidate" earlier in this chapter. When you find yourself in this situation, I
recommend you lay down clear ground rules for communication, problem escalation, work
assignments, and so on.
   Make it a habit to read at least a couple of leadership books a quarter. You may already
be familiar with the topic and think there is nothing new to learn. However, staying current
on the topic will reinforce concepts that you already know and will remind you of other
points that you forgot about and haven't yet developed but know you should. Occasionally,
you will pick up a gold nugget of information that is new and immediately applicable to
your situation.
   Leadership skills are invaluable, but communication skills are just as important. In my
opinion, it's difficult to be an effective leader without also being an effective communica-
tor. My guess is that if you take a close look at the leaders you respect and admire, you'll
discover they are also good communicators--and communication is mostly listening, not
talking. I make it a habit to practice active listening. It's amazing what people will tell you
when you smile politely and ask an open-ended question or two.
   Let me stress again that you cannot successfully manage a project team without com-
municating with them on a regular basis. The last thing you want is for a stakeholder to
follow you into the elevator to inform you about a major problem with the project that
you weren't aware of. That will happen if you haven't established a relationship with your
                                                                         Summary             425




team. If they don't believe you're trustworthy or they don't know you well enough to know
whether you'll stand by them, you'll be one of the last people to find out what's happening.
I know managers and project managers who subscribe to the "don't get too close to your
team" theory. I subscribe to the "all things in moderation" theory. You do want to establish
relationships and prove your loyalty to the team, but you also have to know where to draw
the line. When it comes time to hold a team member accountable, it can be difficult to do if
you have become very close on a personal basis. However, I advocate erring on the side of
developing a relationship with the team. My teams have to trust me to the point that they
know they can come to me--at any time, with all types of news, good or bad--and I'll help
them resolve the problem.



Summary
This chapter described four processes from the Executing process group: Direct and
Manage Project Work, Acquire Resources, Develop Team, and Manage Team.
   In Direct and Manage Project Work, the project management plan comes to life; activi-
ties are authorized to begin; and the product, result, or service of the project is produced.
Status review meetings are held to inform stakeholders of project progress and updates.
   Acquire Resources involves negotiation with other functional managers, project manag-
ers, and organizational personnel to obtain human resources to complete the work of the
project. The project manager might not have control over who will be a part of the team.
Availability, ability, experience, interests, and costs are all enterprise environmental factors
that should be considered when you are able to choose team members.
   Develop Team involves creating an open, inviting atmosphere where project team mem-
bers will become efficient and cooperative, increasing productivity during the course of the
project. It's the project manager's job to bring the team together into a functioning, produc-
tive group.
   According to the Tuckman-Jensen model, team development has five stages: forming,
storming, norming, performing, and adjourning. All groups proceed through these stages,
and the introduction of a new team member will always start the process over again.
   Colocation, also known as tight matrix, is physically placing team members together
in the same location. This might also include a common meeting room or gathering area,
known as a war room, where team members can meet and collaborate on the project.
   Several motivational theories exist, including reward and recognition, Maslow's hierar-
chy of needs, the Hygiene Theory, the Expectancy Theory, and the Achievement Theory.
These theories conjecture that motivation is driven by several desires: physical, social, and
psychological needs; anticipation of expected outcomes; and needs for achievement, power,
or affiliation. The Hygiene Theory proposes that hygiene factors prevent dissatisfaction.
   Leaders inspire vision and rally people around common goals. Theory X leaders
think most people are motivated only through punishment, money, or position. Theory
Y leaders think most people want to perform the best job they can. The Contingency
Theory says that people naturally want to achieve levels of competency and will continue
426        Chapter 8      Developing the Project Team



to be motivated by the desire for competency even after competency is reached. The
Tannenbaum-Schmidt Continuum Management Theory involves seven levels of delegated
freedom regarding decision making and problem solving. The Blanchard version of the
Situational Leadership Theory describes four leadership styles to use depending on the
situation.
   Leaders exhibit five types of power: reward, punishment, expert, legitimate, and referent
power.
   Manage Team involves tracking and reporting on project team member performance.
Performance appraisals are performed during this process, and feedback is provided to the
team members.
   Implement Risk Responses concerns implementing the agreed-upon risk response plans
and making certain risk owners are monitoring for risks so they can take action when
appropriate.



Exam Essentials
Be able to identify the distinguishing characteristics of Direct and Manage Project Work.
Direct and Manage Project Work is where the work of the project is performed, and the
majority of the project budget is spent during this process.
Be able to name the five stages of group formation. The five stages of group formation are
forming, storming, norming, performing, and adjourning.
Be able to define Maslow's highest level of motivation. Self-actualization occurs when a
person performs at his or her peak and all lower-level needs have been met.
Know the five types of power. The five types of power are reward, punishment, expert,
legitimate, and referent.
Be able to identify the five styles of conflict resolution. The five styles of conflict resolu-
tion are force/direct, smooth/accommodate, compromise/reconcile, collaborate/problem
solve, and withdraw/avoid.
Be familiar with the tools and techniques of the Manage Team process. The tools and
techniques of Manage Team are interpersonal and team skills (conflict management, deci-
sion making, emotional intelligence, influencing, leadership), and PMIS.
Be able to name the purpose of the Implement Risk Responses process. Implement Risk
Responses concerns implementing the agreed-upon risk response plans and making certain
risk owners are monitoring for risks so they can take action when appropriate.
                                                                  Review Questions               427




Review Questions
You can find the answers to the review questions in Appendix A.

1.   You are a project manager for a growing dairy farm business. It offers organic dairy prod-
     ucts regionally and is expanding its operations to the West Coast. It is in the process of
     purchasing and leasing dairy farm businesses to get operations underway. You are in charge
     of the network operations part of this project. An important deadline that depends on the
     successful completion of the testing phase is approaching. You've detected some problems
     with your hardware in the testing phase and discover that the hardware is not compatible
     with other network equipment. You take corrective action and exchange the hardware for
     more compatible equipment. Which of the following statements is true?
     A. This is not a corrective action because corrective action involves human resources, not
        project resources.
     B.   Corrective action is taken here to make sure the future project outcomes are aligned
          with the project management plan.
     C.   Corrective action is not necessary in this case because the future project outcomes
          aren't affected.
     D.   Corrective action serves as the change request to authorize exchanging the equipment.

                               This chapter wraps up the Executing process group. We'll
                               look at five processes in this chapter: Conduct Procurements,
                               Manage Quality, Manage Communications, Manage Project
Knowledge, and Manage Stakeholder Engagement.
   Most of these processes aren't related to each other, but all are necessary to conduct the
work of the project. They work in coordination with all the other Executing processes and
are extensions of the Planning processes that preceded them (such as Plan Procurement
Management, Plan Quality Management, and so on). Conduct Procurements and Manage
Quality, in particular, work hand in hand with their Monitoring and Controlling processes
(Control Procurements and Control Quality) to implement, measure, and report services
and results.
   The Conduct Procurements process is where sellers respond to the bids prepared in the
Plan Procurement Management process. Contract awards are made here also. In Manage
Quality, we'll look at several techniques to audit the project's quality requirements against
the quality results. Manage Communications will cover more communication topics,
including status reports. Manage Project Knowledge involves sharing organizational as well
as project knowledge along with creating new knowledge that can be shared in the future.
Last but not least we'll talk about Manage Stakeholder Engagement, which is critical dur-
ing the Executing processes. Grab your favorite beverage and let's get started.


                 The process names, inputs, tools and techniques, outputs, and
                 descriptions of the project management process groups and related
                 materials and figures in this chapter are based on content from A
                 Guide to the Project Management Body of Knowledge (PMBOK (R) Guide),
                 Sixth Edition (PMI(R), 2017).




Conducting Procurements
Many times project managers must purchase goods or services to complete some or all
of the work of the project. Sometimes the entire project is completed on contract. The
Conduct Procurements process is concerned with obtaining responses to bids and propos-
als from potential vendors, selecting a vendor, and awarding the contract.
   This process has several inputs:
    Project management plan (scope management plan, requirements management plan,
    communication management plan, risk management plan, procurement management
    plan, configuration management plan, cost baseline)
436         Chapter 9       Conducting Procurements and Sharing Information



      Project documents (lessons learned register, project schedule, requirements documenta-
      tion, risk register, stakeholder register)
      Procurement documentation
      Seller proposals
      Enterprise environmental factors
      Organizational process assets
   We've talked about most of these inputs in previous chapters. The procurement man-
agement plan is based on the project scope, budget, and schedule and ensures that the
resources you'll need throughout the project are available at the right time so that you will
meet the project requirements. Procurement documents include requests for proposals
(RFPs), requests for information (RFIs), requests for quotations (RFQs), and so on. The
responses to those requests become inputs to this process. Source selection criteria were
defi ned in the Plan Procurement Management process that we talked about in Chapter 7,
"Planning Project Resources." In the tools and techniques section for the Conduct
Procurement process, we'll talk more about how seller proposals are evaluated. Seller pro-
posals are responses to your procurement requests. Most organizations have a preferred
format for seller responses so that the selection committee has a little easier time comparing
proposals.
   One element of the organizational process assets input you might consider during this
process is a qualifi ed sellers list. Qualified sellers lists are lists of prospective sellers who
have been preapproved or prequalified to provide contract services (or provide supplies and
materials) for the organization. For example, your organization might require vendors to
register and maintain information regarding their experience, offerings, and current prices
on a qualified seller list. Usually, vendors must go through the procurement department to
be placed on the list. Project managers are then required to choose their vendors from the
qualified seller list published by the procurement department. However, not all organiza-
tions have qualified seller lists. If a list isn't available, you'll have to work with the project
team to come up with your own requirements for selecting vendors.


                   The Conduct Procurements process is used only if you're obtaining
                   goods or services from outside your own organization. If you have all the
                   resources you need to perform the work of the project within the organiza-
                   tion, you won't use this process.

   In the following sections, you'll examine some new tools and techniques that will help
vendors give you a better idea of their responses, and then you'll move on to the outputs of
this process, two of which are the selected sellers and agreements.


Conduct Procurements Tools and Techniques
Remember that the purpose of the Conduct Procurements process is to obtain responses to
your RFP (or similar procurement document), select the right vendor for the job, and award
                                                      Conducting Procurements              437




the contract. The tools and techniques of this process are designed to assist the vendors in
getting their proposals to you and include techniques for evaluating those proposals. The
tools and techniques are as follows:
    Expert judgment
    Advertising
    Bidder conferences
    Data analysis (proposal evaluation)
    Interpersonal and team skills (negotiation)
  We'll look at each of these tools and techniques next with the exception of expert judg-
ment, which we've covered in previous chapters.

Advertising
Advertising is letting potential vendors know that an RFP is available. Advertising can be
used as a way of expanding the pool of potential vendors, or it may be a requirement, such
as in the case of government projects. The company's Internet site, professional journals,
and newspapers are examples of where advertising might appear. In reality, most organiza-
tions, including government organizations, have replaced advertising in the newspaper with
advertising on their own websites.

Bidder Conferences
Bidder conferences (also known as vendor conferences, prebid conferences, and contractor
conferences, according to the PMBOK (R) Guide) are meetings with prospective vendors or
sellers that occur prior to the completion of their response proposal. You or someone from
your procurement department arranges the bidder conference. The purpose is to allow all
prospective vendors to meet with the buyers to ask questions and clarify issues they have
regarding the project and the RFP. The facilitator of the meeting should ensure that the
meeting is orderly and that all questions and answers are restated in front of the entire
group; that way, all potential vendors have an equal chance at the bid. The meeting is held
once, and all vendors attend at the same time. The bidder conference is held before the
vendors prepare their responses so that they are sure their RFP responses will address the
project requirements.

Data Analysis--Proposal Evaluation
There are several techniques you might use to evaluate proposals. Simple procurements may
not need much more than a quick check against the statement of work or a price compari-
son. Complex procurements may need several rounds of evaluation to begin narrowing the
list of sellers. This is where you might use one or more of the following evaluation tech-
niques to get to the final winner.
    You can use source selection criteria as one method of rating and scoring proposals. We
first discussed source selection criteria in Chapter 7. In this process, source selection cri-
teria are part of the procurement documentation input. You may recall that these criteria
438        Chapter 9      Conducting Procurements and Sharing Information



include several elements such as an understanding of the work, costs, technical capability,
risk, warranty, and so on. We'll get into more detail on some of these criteria here. Keep in
mind this is an input to the Conduct Procurements process, not a tool and technique, even
though you'll be using it as you would a tool and technique.
    The types of goods and services you're trying to procure will dictate how detailed your
evaluation criteria are. (Of course, if your organization has policies in place for evaluating
proposals, then you'll use the format or criteria already established.) The selection of some
goods and services might be price driven only. In other words, the bidder with the lowest
price will win the bid. This is typical when the items you're buying are widely available.
    When you're purchasing goods, you might request a sample from each vendor in order to
compare quality (or some other criteria) against your need. For example, perhaps you need
a special kind of paper stock for a project you're working on at a bank. This stock must
have a watermark; it must have security threads embedded through the paper; and when
the paper is used for printing, the ink must not be erasable. You can request samples of
stock with these qualities from the vendors and then test them to see whether they'll work
for your project.
    It's always appropriate to ask the vendor for references, especially when you're hiring
contract services. It's difficult to assess the quality of services because it's not a tangible
product. References can tell you whether the vendor delivered on time, whether the vendor
had the technical capability to perform the work, and whether the vendor's management
approach was appropriate when problems surfaced. Create a list of questions to ask the ref-
erences before you call.
    You can request financial records to assure you--the buyer--that the vendor has the
fiscal ability to perform the services they're proposing and that the vendor can purchase
whatever equipment is needed to perform the services. If you examine the records of the
company and find that it's two steps away from bankruptcy, that company might not be
a likely candidate for your project. (Remember those general management skills? Here's
another example where they come into play.)
    One of the most important criteria is the evaluation of the response itself to determine
whether the vendor has a clear understanding of what you're asking them to do or provide.
If they missed the mark (remember, they had an opportunity at the bidder conferences to
ask clarifying questions) and didn't understand what you were asking them to provide,
you'll probably want to rank them very low.
    Now you can compare each proposal against the criteria and rate or score each proposal
for its ability to meet or fulfill these criteria. This can serve as your first step in eliminating
vendors that don't match your criteria. Let's say you received 18 responses to an RFP. After
evaluating each one, you discover that 6 of them don't match all the evaluation criteria. You
eliminate those 6 vendors in this round. The next step is to apply the tools and techniques
of this process to further evaluate the remaining 12 potential vendors.

Weighting Systems
Weighting systems assign numerical weights to evaluation criteria and then multi-
ply them by the weights of each criterion factor to come up with total scores for each
                                                     Conducting Procurements             439




vendor. This technique provides a way to quantify the data and assist in keeping per-
sonal biases to a minimum. Weighting systems are useful when you have multiple
vendors to choose from because they allow you to rank the proposals to determine the
sequence of negotiations.
   You'll find an example of a weighted scoring system in Chapter 2, "Creating the Project
Charter." These systems are commonly used to evaluate vendor proposals.

Screening Systems
Screening systems use predefined performance criteria or a set of defined minimum
requirements to screen out unsuitable vendors. Perhaps your project requires board-
certified engineers. One of the screening criteria would be that vendors propose project
team members who have this qualification. If they don't, they're eliminated from the
selection process.
   Screening systems can be used together with some of the other tools and techniques of
this process to rank vendor proposals.

Seller Rating Systems
Seller rating systems use information about the sellers--such as past performance, delivery,
contract compliance, and quality ratings--to determine seller performance. Your organiza-
tion might have seller rating systems in place, and you should check with your procurement
department to see whether they exist for the bidders on your project. Part of the Control
Procurements process (I'll talk about this in Chapter 10, "Measuring and Controlling
Project Performance") concerns gathering and recording this type of information. Don't use
seller rating systems as your sole criterion for evaluating vendors.

Analytical Techniques
Analytical techniques are used to help research potential vendors' capabilities, get an
idea of cost, analyze past performance, forecast future performance, and learn from oth-
ers who have undergone similar projects. Internet searches are an analytical technique
that has several useful features. You can use Internet searches to find vendors, perform
research on their past performance, and compare prices. You can also use the Internet
to purchase items that are readily available and are generally offered for a fixed price.
Internet searches are probably not useful when you're conducting high-risk or complex
procurements, but you could do some research on company performance and reputation
to help in choosing a vendor.
   You can also use independent cost estimates (they are an output of the Plan Procurement
Management process) to analyze whether the proposed cost is in alignment with the project
team's expectations on cost. Remember that if there are large differences between the inde-
pendent estimate and the proposed vendor cost, one of two things is happening: Either the
statement of work (SOW) or the terms of the contract or both are not detailed enough to
allow the vendor to come up with an accurate cost, or the vendor simply failed to respond
to all the requirements laid out in the contract or SOW.
440        Chapter 9      Conducting Procurements and Sharing Information




                  Proposal evaluation techniques are a combination of all the techniques
                  I've discussed in the Data Analysis--Proposal Evaluation section. All tech-
                  niques use some form of expert judgment and evaluation criteria--whether
                  it's objective or subjective criteria. The evaluation criteria are usually
                  weighted, much like a weighted scoring system, and those participating as
                  reviewers provide their ratings (usually to the project manager) to compile
                  into a weighted proposal to determine an overall score. Scoring differ-
                  ences are also resolved using this technique. Some or all of the evaluation
                  techniques described here can be used in combination with the remaining
                  tools and techniques of the Conduct Procurements process to evaluate
                  seller responses.



Interpersonal and Team Skills--Negotiation
Negotiation in the Conduct Procurements process refers to procurement negotiation. In
procurement negotiation, both parties come to an agreement regarding the contract terms.
Negotiation skills are put into practice here as the details of the contract are ironed out
between the parties. At a minimum, contract language should include price, responsibili-
ties, regulations or laws that apply, and the overall approach to the project.
    The complexity of the contract will determine how extensive the contract negotia-
tions will be. Simple contracts may have predetermined nonnegotiable elements that
require only seller acceptance. Complex contracts may encompass any number of ele-
ments, including fi nancing options, overall schedule, proprietary rights, service-level
agreements, technical aspects, and more. In either case, once agreement is reached and
the negotiations are fi nished, the contract is signed by both buyer and seller and then it
is executed.
    You might see the term fait accompli show up on the exam. Fait accompli tactics are
used during contract negotiation when one party tries to convince the other party discuss-
ing a particular contract item that it is no longer an issue. It can be a distraction technique,
when the party practicing fait accompli tactics is purposely trying to keep from negotiating
an issue and claims the issue cannot be changed. For example, during negotiations the ven-
dor tells you that the key resource it's assigning to your project must start immediately or
you'll lose that resource and the vendor will assign that resource work elsewhere. However,
you don't know--because the vendor didn't tell you--that the vendor can reserve this
resource for your project and hold it until the start date. In this instance, the vendor used
fait accompli tactics to push you into starting the project, or hiring this resource, sooner
than you would have otherwise.

Procurement negotiations can be performed as a process itself with inputs and outputs.

Vendor Selection for Fitness Counts HR System

Amanda Jacobson is the project manager for Fitness Counts, a nationwide chain of gyms
containing all the latest and greatest fitness equipment, aerobics classes, swimming
pools, and such. Fitness Counts is converting its human resources data management
system. The RFP addressed several requirements, including the following:

    The new system must run on a platform that's compatible with the company's
    current operating system.
    Hardware must be compatible with company standards.
    Data conversion of existing HR data must be included in the price of the bid.
    Fitness Counts wants to have the ability to add custom modules using internal
    programmers.
    Training for the Fitness Counts programmers must be included in the bid.

The project team is in the Conduct Procurements process and has received bids based on
the RFP published earlier this month. Fitness Counts is using a combination of selection
criteria and a weighted scoring model to choose a vendor.

One of the evaluation criteria states that the vendor must have prior experience with a
project like this. Four vendors met that criterion and proceeded to the weighted scoring
selection process.

Amanda is one of the members of the selection committee. She and four other members
on the committee rated the four vendors who met the initial selection criteria. They read
all of the proposals and rated the criteria using factors they had predetermined for each;
for example, vendors who proposed a SQL database as part of the "Platform" criteria
(along with the other predetermined factors) should receive a total weighted score of 5.
The following table shows their results.

Vendor C is the clear winner of this bid. Based on the weighted scoring model, its
responses to the RFP came out ahead of the other bidders. Amanda calls Vendor C with
the good news and also calls the other vendors to thank them for participating in the bid.
Vendor C is awarded the contract, and Amanda moves on to the Contract Administration
process.



Conduct Procurements Outputs
The Conduct Procurements process has six outputs:
      Selected sellers
      Agreements
      Change requests
      Project management plan updates (requirements management plan, quality manage-
      ment plan, communications management plan, risk management plan, procurement
      management plan, scope baseline, schedule baseline, cost baseline)
      Project documents updates (lessons learned register, requirements documentation,
      requirements traceability matrix, resource calendars, risk register, stakeholder register)
      Organizational process assets updates
                                                       Conducting Procurements                 443




   The selected sellers output is obvious: You choose the seller (or sellers) to whom you'll
award the project and execute the contract.
   Change requests require agreement between the parties regarding the context of the
changes. Changes that cannot be agreed on are called contested changes. These take the
form of disputes, claims, or appeals. They might be settled among the parties directly,
through a court of law, or through arbitration.
   I'll talk more about the agreements output next.


                  According to the PMBOK (R) Guide , senior management signatures may be
                  required on complex, high-risk, or high-dollar contracts. Be sure to check
                  your organization's procurement policies regarding the authority level and
                  amounts for which you are authorized to sign. In my organization, not only
                  do our contracts require senior management signatures, they also require
                  signatures from two other external departments. We have to account
                  for the multiple reviews, signatures, and question-and-answer sessions
                  required to obtain the contract signatures. This has a definite impact on
                  the project schedule and must be accounted for in time estimates for
                  these tasks.

Elements of a Procurement Agreement
Procurement agreements take different forms depending on what you are procuring, who
you are procuring it from, and the nature of the goods or services themselves. You might
use a purchase order, a contract, a work order against an existing contract, or other forms.
You might recall that a contract is a legally binding agreement between two or more par-
ties, typically used to acquire goods or services. Contracts have several names, including
agreements, memorandums of understanding (MOUs), subcontracts, and purchase orders.
   The type of contract you'll award will depend on the product or services you're procur-
ing and your organizational policies. I talked about the types of contracts--fi xed price, cost
reimbursable, and so on--in Chapter 7. If you need a refresher, you can refer back to that
chapter. If your project has multiple sellers, you'll award contracts for each of them.
   The contract or procurement agreement should clearly address the elements of the SOW,
time period of performance, pricing and payment plan, acceptance criteria, warranty peri-
ods, dispute resolution procedures, status or performance reporting procedures, limitations
of liabilities, change request process, penalties and incentives, and so on.
   Because contracts are legally binding and obligate your organization to fulfi ll the terms,
they'll likely be subject to some intensive review, often by several different people. Be cer-
tain you understand your organization's policies on contract review and approval before
proceeding.
   Contracts, like projects, have a life cycle of their own. You might encounter questions on
the exam regarding the stages of the contract life cycles, so we'll look at this topic next.

Contract Life Cycles
The contract life cycle consists of four stages:
    Requirement
    Requisition
444           Chapter 9      Conducting Procurements and Sharing Information



       Solicitation
       Award
  These stages are closely related to the following Project Procurement Management
Knowledge Area processes from the PMBOK (R) Guide:
       Plan Procurement Management
       Conduct Procurements
      A description of each of the contract life cycles follows:
Requirement The requirement stage is the equivalent of the Plan Procurement
Management process I discussed in Chapter 7. You establish the project and contract needs
in this cycle, and you define the requirements of the project. The SOW defines the work
of the project, the objectives, and a high-level overview of the deliverables. You develop a
work breakdown structure (WBS), a make-or-buy analysis takes place, and you determine
cost estimates.
The buyer provides the SOW to describe the requirements of the project when it's per-
formed under contract. The product description can serve as the SOW.
Requisition In the requisition stage, the project objectives are refined and confirmed.
Solicitation materials such as the request for proposals (RFP), request for information
(RFI), and request for quotations (RFQ) are prepared during this phase. Generally, the
project manager is responsible for preparing the RFP, RFI, and RFQ. A review of the
potential qualified vendors takes place, including checking references and reviewing other
projects the vendors have worked on that are similar to your proposed project. Requisition
occurs during the Plan Procurement Management process.
Solicitation The solicitation stage is where vendors are asked to compete for the contract
and respond to the RFP. You can use the tools and techniques of the Conduct Procurements
process during this contract stage. The resulting output is the proposals. Solicitation occurs
during the Conduct Procurements process.
Award Vendors are chosen and contracts are awarded and signed during the award stage.
The Conduct Procurements process is the equivalent of the award phase.
   The project manager--or the selection committee, depending on the organizational
policy--receives the bids and proposals during the award phase and applies evaluation cri-
teria to each in order to score or rank the responses. After ranking each of the proposals,
an award is made to the winning vendor, and the contract is written.
   Once you have a contract, someone has to administer it. In large organizations, this
responsibility will fall to the procurement department. The project manager should still
have a solid understanding of administering contracts because that person will work with
the procurement department to determine the satisfactory fulfillment of the contract.

Project Management Plan Updates
Several components of the project management plan may require updates after awarding
a contract. For example, vendors may propose changes to the quality processes, they may
                                     Laying Out Quality Assurance Procedures             445




introduce changes to the requirements or timeline, they may introduce new risks, and so
on, all of which require updates to the associated plans. Once the vendor is on board, they
also need to be added to the communications management plan so they are receiving proj-
ect information and are informed about when status reports and other project documenta-
tion is required of them.
   Now we're going to switch course and discuss the quality assurance aspects of the proj-
ect. We discussed the Plan Quality Management process in Chapter 7, which prepared you
for the Manage Quality process that's conducted during the Executing process group. We'll
look at it next.



Laying Out Quality Assurance
Procedures
The Plan Quality Management process laid out the quality standards for the project and
determined how those standards are to be satisfied. The Manage Quality process involves
performing systematic quality activities and uses quality audits and failure analysis to
determine which processes should be used to achieve the project requirements, to meet the
quality objectives of the project, and to ensure that activities and processes are performed
efficiently and effectively. Manage Quality is also known as quality assurance and involves
all the activities that go with quality assurance.
    The project team members, the project manager, and the stakeholders are all responsible
for the quality of the project. Continuous process improvement can be achieved through
this process, bringing about improved process performance and eliminating unnecessary
actions.
    A quality assurance department or organization may be assigned to the project to over-
see these processes. In that case, quality assurance might be provided to (rather than by)
the project team. The project manager will have the greatest impact on the quality of the
project during this process.
    You'll review the inputs to this process next and then spend some time exploring a few
new tools and techniques for ensuring a quality product and project.


Inputs to Manage Quality
The inputs to Manage Quality are what you use to measure the organizational project
quality management processes against. The quality management processes were defined
during the Plan Quality Management process. The inputs to the Manage Quality process
are as follows:
    Project management plan (quality management plan)
    Project documents (lessons learned register, quality control measurements, quality met-
    rics, risk report)
    Organizational process assets
446             Chapter 9      Conducting Procurements and Sharing Information



   You've heard about the inputs to Manage Quality before, so we'll move right into the
tools and techniques of this process. But wait! One reminder for you before we move on:
The quality management plan is used to ensure that the project work is performed accord-
ing to the quality standards laid out in the plan.



Exam Spotlight

The most important point to remember about Manage Quality is that quality management
processes are what you use to verify that the project satisfies the quality standards laid
out in the project management plan.



Manage Quality Tools and Techniques
The Manage Quality process has eight tools and techniques:
       Data gathering (checklists)
       Data analysis (alternatives analysis, document analysis, process analysis, process
       analysis, root cause analysis)
       Decision making (multicriteria decision analysis)
       Data representation (affinity diagrams, cause-and-effect diagrams, flowcharts,
       histograms, matrix diagrams, scatter diagrams)
       Audits
       Design for X
       Problem solving
       Quality improvement methods
      Let's take a look at the new tools and techniques listed in this process next.

Data Analysis
Process analysis is a new data analysis technique we haven't covered previously. Process
analysis involves examining elements such as constraints, problems, and activities that
don't add value to the project in order to identify process improvements. While you're
examining problems and constraints, you should also look for what's causing the underly-
ing issue. Essentially, you're performing root cause analysis at the same time as identifying
potential improvements. The result of this exercise will allow you to understand the root
cause of the problem, recommend improvements, and develop preventive actions for prob-
lems that are similar to the one you're examining.

Data Representation
There are several new tools and techniques within data representation. We'll cover them
one by one.
Affinity Diagrams Affinity diagrams, also known as KJ methods, are used to group and
organize thoughts and facts and can be used in conjunction with brainstorming. After
                                         Laying Out Quality Assurance Procedures            447




you've gathered all ideas possible with brainstorming, you group similar ideas together
on an affinity diagram. You may be familiar with mind-mapping techniques, where the
primary concept is captured in the middle of the diagram and related ideas are branched
off the middle into their own segments. This is an example of an affinity diagram. This
technique is useful when decomposing the scope of the project. Put a brief scope statement
in the middle circle or bubble, and then identify all the deliverables that make up the scope
on independent branches (and bubbles). You could use this technique to decompose each
deliverable as well.
Cause-and-Effect Diagrams Cause-and-effect diagrams (also known as fishbone dia-
grams) show the relationship between the effects of problems and their causes and help
identify the root cause of the problem. This diagram depicts every potential cause and
subcause of a problem and the effect they have on the problem. The causes of the problem
make up the fish bones on this diagram, and the effect is shown as the head of the fish.
These diagrams can be depicted horizontally (with the "head or effect" to the right) or
vertically (with the "head or effect" on top). Each of the branches that extend from the
spine lists a cause. All of the issues that contribute to that cause are shown as offshoots on
the branch. Engage your subject matter experts in a brainstorming session to outline the
causes. This visual representation of cause-and-effect is helpful when you don't have quan-
titative data available to help analyze the problem. This diagram is also called a why-why
diagram, or an Ishikawa diagram after its developer, Kaoru Ishikawa. Figure 9.1 shows an
example cause-and-effect diagram.

                                                                   Defect Statement

        Project Staff                         Hardware



Flowcharts The system or process flowchart shows the logical steps needed to accomplish
an objective, how the elements of a system relate to each other, and what actions cause what
responses. This flowchart is probably the one with which you're most familiar. It's usually
constructed with rectangles and parallelograms that step through a logical sequence and
allow for "Yes" and "No" branches (or some similar type of decision). Figure 9.2 shows a
flowchart to help determine whether risk response plans should be developed for the risk.

Histograms We looked at a resource histogram in Chapter 7. They are typically bar type
charts that show distributions of numerical data. Typically, histograms display continuous
data such as weight, time, amounts, and so on. In the quality processes, they can repre-
sent defects, the number of times processes are not in compliance, and other distributions
regarding product or process defects.
Matrix Diagrams In Chapter 7 we also talked about RAMs and RACI charts, which
are examples of matrix diagrams. Matrix diagrams represent the correlation of two or
more groups. For example, in a RACI diagram you are typically relating the responsibil-
ity, accountability, consult, or inform relationships among several members of the project
team. There are two types of matrix diagrams you should be aware of for the exam: two-
dimensional diagrams that consist of L-Type, T-Type, and X-Type, and three-dimensional
diagrams such as C-Type. A RACI is an example of an L-Type matrix.
Scatter Diagrams Scatter diagrams use two variables--an independent variable and a
dependent variable--to display the relationship between these two elements as points on
a graph. They are also known as correlation charts. When the two variables correlate,
the points on the graph will fall close together along a curve or line. The scatter diagram
helps you see at a glance how changes to the independent variable will change the depen-
dent variable. We'll look at an example scatter diagram in Chapter 11, "Controlling Work
Results."
   There are a few additional data representation techniques that you may need to know
for the exam but that aren't named in the PMBOK (R) Guide. I recommend being familiar
with them.
Process Decision Program Charts (PDPCs) PDPCs are constructed like organizational
charts. The project or primary idea is in the top box, and related ideas are branched off
from the main box, with more boxes branching off from them. This technique may be
used for contingency planning to help identify all the possible results that could impact the
project.
Interrelationship Digraphs Interrelationship digraphs are problem-solving tools used for
complex situations. They involve relating up to 50 factors, processes, or areas of focus.
Each factor is interconnected to many other factors, making it easier to identify those ele-
ments that have the biggest impact on the project. The idea behind this tool is to start by
writing down the main issue and drawing a circle or square around it. From there, identify
all of the elements involved and connect them to the main issue and to each other where a
relationship exists. It can look a bit like a misshaped spider web when you are finished. The
factors with the most connecting lines are the ones you'll want to pay particular attention
to because they likely have the biggest impact on the project.
Tree Diagrams Examples of tree diagrams include work breakdown structures, risk
breakdown structures, and objectives breakdown structures. The common theme with
these diagrams is that they depict hierarchies and parent-child relationships. If you flip
back to Chapter 3, "Developing the Project Scope Statement," and look at the WBS for
Billy Bob's Bassoon, you'll see there are nested branches that all lead to a single point
450         Chapter 9      Conducting Procurements and Sharing Information



(ultimately the project itself). For example, "Requirements definition" requires both "Game
Requirements" and "Software Requirements" to be completed before this deliverable is
complete. And both of these deliverables have work packages that must be completed.
Uncomplicated structures such as this allow you to easily determine expected values for any
level on the structure. (We talked about expected values in Chapter 4, "Creating the Project
Schedule.") Tree diagrams are also known as systematic diagrams.
Prioritization Matrices We've talked quite a bit about prioritization matrices, including
probability and impact matrix and weighted scoring systems. Prioritization matrices are
also applicable to the Manage Quality process.
Activity Network Diagrams We talked about network diagrams in Chapter 4. They
include both activity on nodes and activity on arrow diagrams and are used to help con-
struct the project schedule.

Quality Audits
Audits, or more specifically, quality audits, are independent reviews performed by trained
auditors or third-party reviewers. The purpose of a quality audit is the same as the purpose
of the Manage Quality process--to identify ineffective and inefficient activities or processes
used on the project. These audits might examine and uncover inefficient processes and pro-
cedures as well as processes that are not in compliance with organizational practices.
   You can perform quality audits on a regular schedule or at random, depending on the
organizational policies. Quality audits performed correctly will provide the following
benefits:
      The product of the project is fit for use and meets safety standards.
      Applicable laws and standards are followed.
      Corrective action is recommended and implemented where necessary.
      The quality plan for the project is followed.
      Quality improvements are identified.
      The implementation of approved change requests, corrective actions, preventive
      actions, and defect repairs are confirmed.
      Gaps or shortcomings in the process are identified.
      Good and best practices are implemented and shared within the organization or
      industry.
   Quality improvements come about as a result of the quality audits. During the course of
the audit, you might discover ways of improving the efficiency or effectiveness of the proj-
ect, thereby increasing the value of the project and more than likely exceeding stakeholder
expectations.
   Quality improvements are implemented by submitting change requests and/or taking
corrective action. Quality improvements interface with the Monitoring and Controlling
processes because of the need to submit change requests. You'll look at change requests and
change request procedures in Chapter 10.

Exam Spotlight

Remember in Chapter 6, "Risk Planning," that we talked about the risk management plan.
Although there isn't a risk process within the Executing process group, you should review
the risk management plan when implementing approved corrective actions in order to
take advantage of opportunities and/or minimize risk impacts.


   Experienced specialists generally perform quality audits. The specialist's job is to pro-
duce an independent evaluation of the quality process. Some organizations are large enough
to have their own quality assurance departments or quality assurance teams; others might
have to hire contract personnel to perform this function. Internal quality assurance teams
report results to the project team and management team of the organization. External
quality assurance teams report results to the customer.

Design for X
Design for X (DfX) is also known as design for excellence. It is used to examine elements
of the product design and product development to determine if quality standards are being
met. The "X" refers to characteristics in the design of the product in order to ensure that
particular element of the design is optimized. Element "X" may also improve the final
product overall. "X" may represent almost any element of product development, including
but not limited to usability, cost, service, safety, reliability, and most importantly to this
process, quality.

Problem Solving
Problem solving looks at solving issues and finding answers to problems and challenges.
According to the PMBOK (R) Guide, problem solving identifies and defines the problem,
investigates and analyzes the data, determines possible solutions, implements the best solu-
tion, and checks the solution to ensure the problem is fixed. You'll also circle back around
to verify that the solution was effective.


Manage Quality Outputs
The Manage Quality process has five outputs:
    Quality reports
    Test and evaluation documents
    Change requests
    Project management plan updates (quality management plan, scope baseline, schedule
    baseline, cost baseline)
    Project documents updates (issue log, lessons learned register, risk register)
452        Chapter 9      Conducting Procurements and Sharing Information



   Quality reports provide the stakeholders with information about whether the qual-
ity standards for the project are on track. The quality reports include findings from the
Control Quality process, recommendations regarding corrective actions, and/or process or
product improvements that may improve the quality results.
   Test and evaluation documents are used to determine if the quality objectives have been
met. These documents may already exist within the organization in the form of templates
or checklists. During this process, any recommended corrective actions, whether they are a
result of a quality audit or process analysis, should be acted on immediately and processed
through the change control process, which is governed by the change management plan.
Let's say you're manufacturing parts for one of the deliverables of your project. Obviously,
the moment you discover that the parts are not correct, you'd correct the process by cali-
brating the machine perhaps, or by using different raw materials, to make certain the parts
are produced accurately.



Quality Improvements

Although it isn't stated as an output, one of the overarching goals of the Manage Quality
process is to provide a foundation for continuous process improvements. As the name
implies, continuous improvements are iterative. This process of continuous improve-
ments sets the stage, so to speak, for improving the quality of all the project processes.
This can mean project management processes, but it also means the processes and activ-
ities involved in accomplishing the work of the project.

The advantage of continuous process improvement is that it reduces the time the project
team spends on ineffective or inefficient processes. If the activities don't help you meet
the goals of the project or, worse yet, they hinder your progress, it's time to look at ways
to improve them.


   Once again we're going to shift gears and talk about a new process. We'll examine the
Manage Project Knowledge process and then look at best practices regarding sharing and
distributing information.



Manage Project Knowledge
Have you heard this saying, generally attributed to Francis Bacon: "Knowledge is power?"
That sums up this process in a nutshell, so let's move on.
   Wait, not so fast. There are some specific things you should know for the exam about
this process, so let's spend a little time uncovering them.
   Manage Project Knowledge involves sharing organizational as well as project knowl-
edge and creating new knowledge that can be shared in the future. The purpose for sharing
the knowledge is to increase the chance of success for your project and to improve project
                                                     Manage Project Knowledge                453




results (now that's power). This is much more than simply collecting project artifacts and
documenting lessons learned. It involves actively sharing that knowledge from the people
who have experienced it with those who are about to embark on a similar project.
   The PMBOK (R) Guide says there are two types of knowledge, explicit and tacit. Explicit
information is easily conveyed with words, pictures, or numbers. If I told you the moon is
238,900 miles from the earth, I have shared explicit information with you. Tacit informa-
tion is based on experiences, beliefs, or insights. If I told you that I believe the moon is
made of green cheese, I've shared tacit information with you--albeit it's incorrect informa-
tion, but that's a story for another book.
   The idea is to use both explicit and tacit information together to improve project results
and to create new information that can be shared in the future that's based on the experi-
ences you'll go through on the next project. Information is shared person-to-person and
information management tools are how you'll capture and share that information.
   The inputs to the Manage Project Knowledge process include the following:
    Project management plan (any component)
    Project documents (lessons learned register, project team assignments, resource break-
    down structure, source selection criteria, stakeholder register)
    Deliverables
    Enterprise environmental factors
    Organizational process assets
   Although there are specific project documents listed in the inputs to this process, in
reality any project document could contribute to the sharing and creation of knowledge.
Deliverables, collectively, make up the final product, service, or result of the project.
Knowledge of deliverables, how to produce them, how similar work products were accom-
plished in the past, and so on all contribute to the knowledge base.


Tools and Techniques to Manage Project Knowledge
The tools and techniques of Manage Project Knowledge are as follows:
    Expert judgment
    Knowledge management
    Information management
    Interpersonal and team skills (active listening, facilitation, leadership, networking,
    political awareness)
  We've covered expert judgment and interpersonal skills several times. Let's look at
knowledge management followed by information management next.

Knowledge Management
Knowledge management deals with sharing tacit information among the project team (and
others) so that new knowledge can be created and also to collaborate and take advantage
of the knowledge and experiences of everyone involved. This can involve many forms of
454        Chapter 9      Conducting Procurements and Sharing Information



communication, including face-to-face or virtual sessions, interviews, networking, focus
groups, workshops, storytelling, training sessions, and more. Job shadowing is a way to
share information firsthand. This involves working with people side-by-side, watching them
perform their tasks and then trying it out for yourself.

Information Management
Information management tools are used to collect, distribute, and share explicit informa-
tion with people. The PMIS is one type of information management tool. Others include
document libraries, web searches, published articles, lessons learned register, and document
management systems. Document management systems can be used by team members to col-
laborate and share documents and often have built-in retention rules so that documents past
a certain age are purged or archived. They may also have rules such as how documents and
records must be named, they may provide version control on the documents, and they may
be able to restrict access to documents or libraries to certain groups of people or departments.


Manage Project Knowledge Outputs
The three outputs of Manage Project Knowledge are lessons learned register, project man-
agement plan updates (any component), and organizational process assets updates. Any
organizational process or policy may need to be updated as a result of the new knowledge
created on the project.



Managing Project Information
The Manage Communications process is concerned with gathering, creating, storing, dis-
tributing, retrieving, and the disposition of project communications. One of the primary
functions of this process is distributing information about the project to the stakeholders
in a timely manner. This can come about in several ways: status reports, project meetings,
review meetings, and so on. Status reports inform stakeholders about where the project is
today in regard to project schedule and budget, for example. They also describe what the
project team has accomplished to date. This might include milestones completed to date,
the percentage of schedule completion, and what remains to be completed. The Manage
Communications process describes how this report and other information are distributed
and to whom.
   In the Manage Communications process, the communications management plan that
was defined during the Plan Communications Management process is put into action.
This plan will define how you manage the flow of information to the stakeholders and will
also help keep them informed and engaged. Remember that this plan is a subsidiary of
the project management plan, which is an input to this process. The inputs to the Manage
Communication process include the following:
      Project management plan (resource management plan, communications management
      plan, stakeholder engagement plan)
                                                  Managing Project Information             455



    Project documents (change log, issue log, lessons learned register, quality report, risk
    report, stakeholder register)
    Work performance reports
    Enterprise environmental factors
    Organizational process assets


                 There is a subtle difference between the communications management
                 plan and the stakeholder engagement plan in the Executing process
                 group. The communications management plan is used to manage the flow
                 of information to the stakeholders in order to keep them engaged and
                 informed. The stakeholder engagement plan helps maintain relationships
                 with the stakeholders, helps to ensure their support, and manages
                 stakeholder expectations.

   Manage Communications has some new tools and techniques, which we'll look at next.


Tools and Techniques of Manage Communications
The tools and techniques of this process are as follows:
    Communication technology
    Communication methods
    Communication skills (communication competence, feedback, nonverbal,
    presentations)
    Project management information system
    Project reporting
    Interpersonal and team skills (active listening, conflict management, cultural
    awareness, meeting management, networking, political awareness)
    Meetings
    We talked about communication technology and methods in Chapter 5, "Developing
the Project Budget and Communicating the Plan." Pop quiz: Do you remember what the
difference is between interactive, push, and pull communication methods? If not, jump
back to Chapter 5 for a quick refresher. Communication models are not a tool and tech-
nique of this process, but we'll explore this topic in a little more depth in this chapter
because it ties in closely with the communication skills and interpersonal and team skills
listed in this process. Communication skills are probably the single most important skill in
your project management toolbox. You can't employ communication methods or use com-
munication tools effectively without some sound communication skills, so let's take a look
at this topic next.
456        Chapter 9      Conducting Procurements and Sharing Information



Developing Great Communication Skills
Every aspect of your job as a project manager will involve communications. It has been
estimated that project managers spend as much as 90 percent of their time communicat-
ing in one form or another. Therefore, communication skills are arguably among the most
important skills a project manager can have. They are even more important than technical
skills. Good communication skills foster an open, trusting environment, and excellent com-
munication skills are a project manager's best asset.
   Throughout this book I've emphasized how important good communication skills are.
Now I'll discuss communication, listening behaviors, and confl ict resolution. You'll employ
each of these techniques with your project team, stakeholders, customers, and management
team.

Information Exchange
Communication is the process of exchanging information. All communication includes
three elements:
Sender The sender is the person responsible for putting the information together in a
clear and concise manner. The information should be complete and presented in a way that
the receiver will be able to correctly understand it. Make your messages relevant to the
receiver. Junk mail is annoying, and information that doesn't pertain in any way whatso-
ever to the receiver is nothing more than that.
Message The message is the information being sent and received. It might be written,
verbal, nonverbal, formal, informal, internal, external, horizontal, or vertical. Horizontal
communications are messages sent to and received by peers. Vertical communications are
messages sent and received down to subordinates and up to executive management.


                 Make your messages as simple as you can to get your point across.
                 Don't complicate messages with unnecessary detail and technical jargon
                 that others might not understand. A simple trick that helps clarify your
                 messages, especially verbal messages, is to repeat the key information
                 periodically. Public speakers are taught that the best way to organize a
                 speech is to first tell the audience what you're going to tell them; second,
                 tell them; and third, tell them what you just told them.

Receiver The receiver is the person for whom the message is intended. Receivers are
responsible for understanding the information correctly and making sure they've received
all the information.
   Keep in mind that receivers fi lter the information they receive through their knowledge
of the subject, cultural influences, language, emotions, attitudes, and geographic locations.
The sender should take these fi lters into consideration when sending messages so that the
receiver will clearly understand the message that was sent.
                                                  Managing Project Information              457




                 This book is an example of the sender-receiver communication model. I'm
                 the sender of the information. The message concerns topics you need to
                 know to pass the PMP (R) exam (and, if I've done my job correctly, is written
                 in a clear and easily understood format). You, the reader, are the receiver.

eleMenTS of a CoMMunICaTIon Model
Senders, receivers, and messages are the elements of communication. The way the sender
packages or encodes the information and transmits it and the way the receiver unpacks or
decodes the message are the models of communication exchange. This is a basic sender/
receiver model.
    Senders encode messages. Encoding is a method of putting the information into a format
the receiver will understand. Language, pictures, and symbols are used to encode messages.
Encoding formats the message for transmitting.
    Transmitting is the way the information gets from the sender to the receiver. Spoken
words, written documentation, memos, email, and voicemail are all transmitting methods.
    Decoding is what receivers do with the information when they get it. They convert it into
an understandable format. Usually, this means they read the memo, listen to the speaker,
read the book, and so on.
    The interactive communication model goes a couple of steps further in that the message
is acknowledged and feedback is provided. Acknowledging involves receivers informing the
sender they have received the message. This is not, however, an indication of agreement or
that the receiver understands the message. It serves only to let the sender know the message
has been received.
    Feedback/response implies that the message was not only received and decoded but that
the message from the sender was understood. In response, the receiver crafts a message and
sends it back to the sender, starting the cycle all over again.
forMS and MeThodS of CoMMunICaTIon
Communication occurs primarily in written or verbal form. Granted, you can point to
something or indicate what you need with motions, but usually you use the spoken or writ-
ten word to get your message across.
    Verbal communication is easier and less complicated than written communication, and
it's usually a fast method of communication. Written communication, on the other hand, is
an excellent way to get across complex, detailed messages. Detailed instructions are better
provided in written form because it gives readers the ability to go back over information
about which they're not quite sure.
    Both verbal and written communication might take a formal or an informal approach.
Speeches, presentations, and lectures are examples of formal verbal communication. Most
project status meetings take more of a formal approach, as do most written project status
reports. Generally speaking, the project manager should take an informal approach when
communicating with stakeholders and project team members outside of the status meet-
ings. This makes you appear more open and friendly and easier to approach with ques-
tions and issues.
458        Chapter 9      Conducting Procurements and Sharing Information



   Formal and informal approaches may also include techniques such as fact finding, ask-
ing questions, motivating team members, providing performance feedback to team mem-
bers, and setting and managing stakeholder (and team) expectations.
   There are many methods and skills you can use to communicate, including in person in
a one-on-one setting; in small groups; by using a speaker to speak to an audience of people;
by using mass communication methods such as newsletters and other publications; or by
using network methods such as instant messaging, email, videos, press releases, social net-
works, and more.

Communication Competence
Communication competence involves having the skills necessary to craft your message
for the intended audience, appropriately sharing information, and presenting yourself in a
way that denotes you are a leader. It is the ability to communicate clearly and effectively
in a way that you are understood. For example, if you are working on a complex project
involving advanced engineering techniques, you'll communicate differently with the engi-
neers than you will with the business members of the project team. The engineers will
understand a certain level of vocabulary and terms that the business users will not likely be
familiar with--and vice versa. Sometimes a project manager serves as a translator between
groups or teams of professionals, and you'll need to be adept at understanding effective
communication, based on the audience's level of understanding, as well as knowing what is
considered appropriate communication for each group.

Feedback
Feedback involves two-way communication. Project managers must be open to feed-
back from team members, stakeholders, sponsors, and others. No one person has all the
answers, and one of the best actions project managers can take to gain the trust of their
team is to solicit feedback, actively listen to the feedback, and implement solutions or pro-
cess improvements offered through the feedback process when it is appropriate and makes
sense for the project. Warning! If your first reaction is to dismiss the suggestions of others
and not actively engage their ideas, you will not gain a lot of trust and will shut yourself off
from the communication flow, miss out on opportunities to improve, and worst case, find
yourself looking for a new position elsewhere.

Nonverbal Communication Skills
I was in a meeting recently that was, to be honest, a bit tense. A senior staff member
was asked a question by a VP. The question was posed in a way that indicated the VP's
displeasure about the slowness of the progress made to date. The staff member wanted
to assure the VP that all was well, and there was no cause for concern. However, when
answering the question, the staffer slumped in their chair and talked down to the table
(instead of to the VP). Their body language didn't match the message and the VP picked
up on this instantly. Nonverbals are just as important as the words you use. Make cer-
tain your posture, tone of voice, expressions, and gestures match the message you're
delivering.

Presentations
Presentations come in many forms. They may include giving status reports; performing and
presenting research for decision-making purposes; and presenting updates on deliverable
status, risks, contract performance, and much more.

Project Management Information System
We've covered the PMIS in earlier chapters. In this process, it refers to ways of getting the
project information to the project team or stakeholders. As the name implies, these are
ways to distribute the information, including email, hard copy, voicemail, videoconferenc-
ing, websites and social media outlets, project management software, collaborative work
management tools, and so on. You can also use electronic project management tools such
as schedules and meeting software to maintain project records.

Project Reporting
This tool and technique involves collecting and distributing the project information, which
can include status reports, measurements regarding the progress of the project, and fore-
casts concerning future performance. I'm certain you're all familiar with status reports.
These can take many forms, but most project status reports include the progress of the
project to date, the expected activities for the next period, schedule and budget updates,
risk and issues updates, and change requests. Most project management software systems
can produce dashboards with information about the project schedule, budget, quality,
and other criteria the management team might like to see. The dashboards typically grade
the health of these areas of the project with numeric scores or colors such as red, yellow,
and green to indicate whether an area is in trouble, is headed into trouble and should be
watched, or is in good shape.

Interpersonal and Team Skills
We'll touch on two of the skills listed in this tool and technique, including active listening
skills and conflict management.

Active Listening Skills
What did you say? Often we think we're listening when we really aren't. In all fairness,
we can take in only so much information at one time. However, it is important to perform
active listening when someone else is speaking. As a project manager, you will spend the
majority of your time communicating with team members, stakeholders, customers, ven-
dors, and others. This means you should be as good a listener as you are a communicator.
   You can use several techniques to improve your listening skills. Many books are devoted
to this topic, so I'll try to highlight some of the most common techniques here:
    Appear interested in what the speaker is saying. This will make the speaker feel at ease
    and will benefit you as well. By acting interested, you become interested and thereby
    retain more of the information being presented.
460         Chapter 9      Conducting Procurements and Sharing Information



      Making eye contact with the speaker is another effective listening tool. This lets the
      speaker know you are paying attention to what they're saying and are interested.
      Put your speaker at ease by letting them know beforehand that you're interested in
      what they're going to talk about and that you're looking forward to hearing what they
      have to say. While they're speaking, nod your head, smile, or make comments when
      and if appropriate to let the speaker know you understand the message. If you don't
      understand something and are in the proper setting, ask clarifying questions.
      Another great trick that works well in lots of situations is to recap what the speaker
      said in your own words and tell it back to them. Start with something like this, "Let
      me make sure I understand you correctly; you're saying...," and ask the speaker to con-
      firm that you did understand them correctly.
      Just as your mother always said, it's impolite to interrupt. Interrupting is a way of tell-
      ing the speaker that you aren't really listening, and you're more interested in telling
      them what you have to say than listening to them. Interrupting gets the other person
      off track, they might forget their point, and it might even make them angry.
    Not to disagree with Mom, but there probably are some occasions where interrupting
is appropriate. For example, if you're in a project status meeting and someone wants to
take the meeting off course, sometimes the only way to get the meeting back on track is
to interrupt them. You can do this politely. Start first by saying the person's name to get
their attention. Then let them know that you'd be happy to talk with them about their topic
outside of the meeting or add it to the agenda for the next status meeting if it's something
everyone needs to hear. Sorry, Mom.

Resolving Conflicts
We discussed conflict resolution techniques in Chapter 8, "Developing the Project Team."
They are also a form of communication skills. You may recall the conflict resolution
techniques:
      Force/direct
      Smooth/accommodate
      Compromise/reconcile
      Collaborate/problem solve
      Withdraw/avoid
    Keep in mind that group size makes a difference when you're trying to resolve con-
flicts or make decisions. Remember the channels of communication you learned about in
Chapter 5? The larger the group, the more lines of communication and the more difficult it
will be to reach a decision. Groups of 5 to 11 people have a manageable number of partici-
pants and have been shown to make the most accurate decisions.
    Use communication, listening, and conflict resolution skills wisely. As a project man-
ager, you'll find that your day-to-day activities encompass these three areas the majority
of the time. Project managers with excellent communication skills can work wonders.
Communication won't take the place of proper planning and management techniques, but a
                                                  Managing Project Information            461




project manager who communicates well with their team and the stakeholders can make up
for a lack of technical skills any day, hands down. If your team and your stakeholders trust
you and you can communicate the vision and the project goals and report on project status
accurately and honestly, the world is your oyster.


Outputs of Manage Communications
The Manage Communications process has four outputs, including project communications,
project management plan updates (communications management plan, stakeholder engage-
ment plan), project documents updates (issue log, lessons learned register, project schedule,
risk register, stakeholder register), and organizational process assets updates.
   The project communications outputs involve all of the work required for gathering,
creating, storing, distributing, retrieving, and disposing of project communications. A few
key elements you should consider regarding this output are the urgency of the message, the
impact the message may have on the receiver (and perhaps the project as well), the delivery
method you'll use for the message, and whether the message is sensitive or confidential
and how to ensure that the message goes only to the intended receivers. According to the
PMBOK (R) Guide, project communications typically consists of performance reports, deliv-
erables status, schedule progress, cost incurred, and presentations.
   The project management plan updates may include updating the communications man-
agement plan and the stakeholder engagement plan. It's important to keep the stakeholder
engagement plan up-to-date because this will help keep the stakeholders engaged and sup-
porting the team, and it helps you as the project manager manage their expectations. The
Manage Communications process could require updates to the project scope, schedule,
and/or cost baselines. Remember that together, the approved scope, schedule, and cost
baselines are known as the performance measurement baseline. It's essential that you as the
project manager update the project sponsor and key stakeholders with any changes to the
performance management baseline.
   There are six elements of the organizational process assets updates you should know:
Stakeholder Notifications Remember that the focus of this process is distributing infor-
mation. Stakeholder notifications involve notifying stakeholders when you have imple-
mented solutions and approved changes, have updated project status, have resolved issues,
and so on.
Project Reports Project reports include the project status reports and minutes from proj-
ect meetings, lessons learned, closure reports, and other documents from all the process
outputs throughout the project. If you're keeping an issue log, the issues should be included
with the project reports as well.
Project Presentations Project presentations involve presenting project information to the
stakeholders and other appropriate parties when necessary. The presentations might be for-
mal or informal and depend on the audience and the information being communicated.
Project Records As you might guess, project records include memos, correspondence, and
other documents concerning the project. The best place to keep information like this is in
462        Chapter 9      Conducting Procurements and Sharing Information



a project notebook or in a set of project notebooks, depending on the size of the project.
The project notebooks are ordinary three-ring binders where project information gets filed.
They are maintained by the project manager or project office and contain all informa-
tion regarding the project. You could also keep the information on a project website, the
company intranet, or CDs. If you're keeping the information electronically, make certain
it's backed up regularly. Individual team members might keep their own project records in
notebooks or electronically as well. These records serve as historical information once the
project is closed.
Feedback from Stakeholders Feedback you receive from the stakeholders that can improve
future performance on this project or performance on future projects should be captured
and documented. If the information has an impact on the current project, distribute it
to the appropriate team members so that future project performance can be modified to
improve results.
Lessons Learned Documentation Lessons learned include information that you gather
and document throughout the course of the project that can be used to benefit the current
project, future projects, or other projects currently being performed by the organization.
Lessons learned might include positive as well as negative lessons.
   During the Manage Communications process, you'll continue conducting lessons
learned meetings focusing on many different areas, depending on the nature of your proj-
ect. These areas might include project management processes, product development, techni-
cal processes, project team performance, stakeholder involvement, and so on. The lessons
learned register should be updated with this information.
   Lessons learned meetings should always be conducted at the end of project phases and
at the end of the project at minimum. Team members, stakeholders, vendors, and others
involved with the project should participate in these meetings. It's important to understand,
and to make your team members understand, that this is not a finger-pointing meeting. The
purpose of lessons learned is to understand what went well and why--so you can repeat it
on future projects--and what didn't go so well and why--so you can perform differently
on future projects. These meetings can make good team-building sessions because you're
creating an atmosphere of trust and sharing and you're building on each other's strengths
to improve performance.
   You should document the reasons or causes for the issues, the corrective action taken
and why, and any other information from which future projects might benefit.



Exam Spotlight

According to the PMBOK (R) Guide, it's a project manager's professional obligation to hold
lessons learned meetings. Understanding lessons learned enables continuous improve-
ment on the current and future projects.


   We're making one last switch of focus in this chapter and will examine the Manage
Stakeholder Engagement process next.
                                            Managing Stakeholder Engagement                   463




Managing Stakeholder Engagement
The Manage Stakeholder Engagement process is about satisfying the needs of the stake-
holders by managing communications with them, resolving issues, engaging them on the
project, managing their expectations, improving project performance by implementing
requested changes, and managing concerns in anticipation of potential problems.


                 If you need a refresher on the definition and role of stakeholders, please
                 see Chapter 1, "What Is a Project?"

    In my experience, managing stakeholder expectations is much more difficult than man-
aging project team members. Stakeholders are often managers or directors in the organiza-
tion who might be higher in the food chain than the project manager and aren't afraid to
let you know it. Having said that, you can manage stakeholder expectations, and you do so
using communication.
    Stakeholders need lots of communication in every form you can provide. If you are
actively engaged with your stakeholders and interacting with them, providing project sta-
tus, and resolving issues, your chances of a successful project are much greater than if you
don't do these things.



exam Spotlight

According to the PMBOK (R) Guide, it's the project manager's responsibility to manage
stakeholder expectations. Doing so will decrease the potential for project failure. Manag-
ing the expectations of your stakeholders will also increase the chance of meeting the
project goals because issues are resolved in a timely manner and disruptions during the
project are limited.



Manage Stakeholder Engagement Inputs
The inputs of Manage Stakeholder Engagement include the following:
    Project management plan (communications management plan, risk management plan,
    stakeholder engagement plan, change management plan)
    Project documents (change log, issue log, lessons learned register, stakeholder register)
    Enterprise environmental factors
    Organizational process assets
   We have discussed each of these inputs previously with the exception of the change log.
We'll look more closely at change logs in the next chapter, but for the purposes of this pro-
cess, understand that this is a log that documents all the changes made during the course of
464        Chapter 9      Conducting Procurements and Sharing Information



the project. In terms of stakeholder expectations, you'll want to keep stakeholders updated
on changes and their impacts on the project.


Tools and Techniques for Manage
Stakeholder Engagement
The tools and techniques of this process include expert judgment, inspection, commu-
nication skills (feedback), interpersonal and team skills (conflict management, cultural
awareness, negotiation, observation/conversation, political awareness) ground rules, and
meetings. Let's look at observation and conversation followed by ground rules.

Observation and Conversation
Observation and conversation is another one of those tools and techniques that is self-
evident. To understand performance or quality issues for example, you have to observe them.
Observation can also come into play with stakeholders and team members when you observe
their body language, performance, and/or actions to determine their attitudes about the
project. Conversation is carried out through communications, I hope you've learned how
important communication is to the success of the project. This includes communicating
with your team members. I know project managers who are reticent to engage their teams in
conversation unless it's official project business. I've even known project managers who've
instructed their administrative assistants to give specific directions to other team members to
avoid having to converse with a team member. It's difficult to understand a team member's
attitude or viewpoint toward the project if you're communicating through someone else. I
recommend establishing an open door policy with your team members and live up to it. The
benefits are so great that it's worth a few minutes a day of chitchat to establish that feeling
of trust and camaraderie. If your team perceives you as open, honest, and willing to listen,
you'll be the first person they come to when issues arise.

Ground Rules
Ground rules are defined in the team charter and are expectations set by the project man-
ager and project team that describe acceptable team behavior. For example, one of my pet
peeves is team members who interrupt each other. In this case, one of the ground rules is one
person speaks at a time during a meeting. Another ground rule might be reporting potential
issues as soon as the team member becomes aware of them. Outlining ground rules like this
helps the team understand expectations regarding acceptable behavior and increases produc-
tivity. Ground rules should also include expectations for stakeholder engagement.


Manage Stakeholder Engagement Outputs
The outputs of the Manage Stakeholder Engagement process are change requests, project
management plan updates (communications management plan, stakeholder engagement
plan), and project documents updates (change log, issue log, lessons learned register,
stakeholder register).

   One thing to note about the issue log in this process is that it acts more like an action
item log where you record the actions needed to resolve stakeholder concerns and project
issues they raise. Issues should be ranked according to their urgency and potential impact
on the project. As with the issue log in the Manage Team process, you'll assign a respon-
sible party and a due date for resolution.



Exam Spotlight

The issue log (or action item log) can be used to promote communication with stakeholders
and to ensure that stakeholders and the project team have the same understanding of the
issues.


   You've successfully completed the Executing process group. Congratulations. Remember
that the Executing processes and Monitoring and Controlling processes serve as inputs to
each other and that Executing and Monitoring and Controlling are both iterative process
groups. As your project progresses and it becomes evident that you need to exercise controls
to get the project back on track, you'll come back through the Executing process group and
then proceed through the Monitoring and Controlling processes again. You'll move on to
the Monitoring and Controlling process group now and find out what it's all about.

Section 2: Scheduled and Actual Completion Dates
      Sign lease: Scheduled: 8/21. Completed: 8/21
      Gomez contract signed: Scheduled: 9/12. Completed: 9/12
      Ethernet cable run: Scheduled: 9/18. Completed: 9/19
      Build-out started: Scheduled: 9/20. Completed: In progress

Section 3: Activity That Occurred in the Project This Week
The Ethernet cable run was completed without a problem.

Section 4: Progress Expected This Reporting Period Not Completed
None. Project is on track to date.

Section 5: Progress Expected Next Reporting Period
Build-out will continue. Jake reports that Gomez expects to have electrical lines run and
drywall started prior to the end of the next reporting period.

Ricardo should have a T1 update. There's a slim possibility that the T1 connection will
have occurred by the next reporting period.

Section 6: Issues
We had to start the build-out on the last day of the cable run (this is called fast tracking)
to keep the project on schedule. Jake and Ricardo reported only minor problems with
this arrangement in that the contractors got in each other's way a time or two. This did
not impact the completion of the cable run because most of day two this team was in the
back room and Gomez's crew was in the storefront area.

A key member of the Gomez construction crew was out last week because of a fam-
ily emergency. Gomez assures us that it will not impact the build-out schedule. They
replaced the team member with someone from another project, so it appears so far that
the build-out is on schedule.

Ricardo is somewhat concerned about the T1 connection because the phone company
won't return his calls inquiring about status. We're still ahead of the curve on this one
because hardware isn't scheduled to begin testing until January 21. Hardware testing
depends on the T1 connection. This is a heads-up at this point, and we'll carry this as an
issue in the status report going forward until it's resolved.

One of the gourmet food item suppliers Jill uses regularly went out of business. She is
in the process of tracking down a new supplier to pick up the slack for the existing stores
and supply the gourmet food products for the new store.

Status Meeting in Early December
"Thank you all for coming," you begin. You note those stakeholders who are present
and pass out the agendas. "First, we have a contract update. Jake, would you give us the
update, please?"

"Gomez Construction has submitted a seller payment request for the work completed
through November 30. Shelly in our contract management office manages the payment
system and handles all payment requests. She'll get a check cut and out to Gomez by the
end of this month. They are doing an outstanding job as always. As you know, I've also
hired an independent inspector, aside from the city and county types, so that we make
sure we're up to code before the city types get there. I don't want to get caught in that
trap and end up delaying the project because we can't get the city inspector back out to
reinspect quickly enough."

"Thank you, Jake. Any problems with those inspections so far?"

Jake clears his throat. "It turned out to be a good move because the contractor did find
some things that we were able to correct before bringing out the official inspectors."

"Ricardo, do you have a contract update for us today?"

"Yes. The contract management office used a fixed-price contract on the hardware and IT
supplies order. That contract is just now making its way through the sign-off processes.
My group will manage the quality control and testing once all this equipment arrives."

"Jill, can you give us the update on the store?" you ask.

"I've ordered all the retail products, have ordered the cookware line, and have lined up
the chef demos. The costs for the new gourmet supplier we're using are higher than our
original vendor. This impacts ongoing operations, but the hit to the project budget is
minimal. I should also mention that a change request was submitted."

You point everyone's attention to the issues list. "In the last meeting I reported that
Gomez had an important crew member out on a family emergency. Gomez was able
to replace the team member with no impact to the schedule. The next issue was the T1
connection--I reported that Ricardo was not receiving return phone calls. Good news--
that issue has been cleared, the date has been set, and we can close this issue. Are there
any new issues to be added this week?"

No additional issues were reported.

"What's the forecast?" Dirk asks. "Are we on track for meeting the grand opening date
given all these issues?"

"I'll have performance figures for you at the next status meeting, and I have some ideas
on how we can make up this time in other ways so that we still meet the date."

You thank everyone for coming and remind them of the next meeting time.

Understanding How This Applies
to Your Next Project
This chapter is jammed with information you need to know for the exam as well as on
the job. Depending on the size of your organization, many of the processes I discussed in
the Executing process group might actually be handled by another department in your
organization. I've worked in small companies (fewer than 100 people) as well as very large
companies and have always had either a person or a department that was responsible for
the vendor selection, contract negotiation, and contract administration. In all these situa-
tions and in my current role overseeing major projects, I have significant input to these pro-
cesses, but the person or department responsible for procurement has the ultimate control.
For example, we use RFPs (and occasionally RFIs) to solicit vendors. We typically use a
weighted scoring model in combination with a screening and rating system to choose a ven-
dor. For small projects, we have a list of prequalified vendors from which to choose.
                                                                        Summary            469




   Someone who is skilled at writing contracts can best handle the contracts, which ide-
ally should be reviewed by the legal team. The legal team should also review changes pro-
posed by the vendor before someone signs on the dotted line. Clear, concise, and specific
contracts, in my experience, are critical success factors for any project. I've too often seen
contract issues bring a project to a sudden halt. Another classic contract faux pas allows
the vendor to think the work is complete while the buyer believes the vendor is weeks or
months away from meeting the requirements. These types of disputes can almost always be
traced back to an unclear, imprecise contract. It's important to be specific in your statement
of work. Make sure that the project requirements are clear and broken down far enough to
be measurable and that deliverables are defined with criteria that allow you to inspect for
contract compliance prior to final acceptance.
   I'll emphasize one last time the importance of communication, good communication skills,
and getting that information into the appropriate hands at the right time. Enough said.
   Engaging your stakeholders on the project and managing their expectations is as impor-
tant as managing the project team. Stakeholders need plenty of communication, and issues
need to be discussed and resolutions agreed on. Remember the old adage that most people
need to hear the same information six times before it registers with them. Stakeholders,
understandably, are notorious for hearing what they want to hear. Here's an example: If
I asked you to picture an elephant, you would likely picture an elephant in your mind. It
might be live or the stuffed variety and it could be gray, brown, or pink, but you'd clearly
understand the concept. Elephant is a word that's pretty hard to misinterpret. But what if I
asked you to picture a three-bedroom house? There's lots of room for interpretation there.
When I said three-bedroom house, I meant ranch style with the master on one end of the
house and the other two bedrooms at the other end of the house. What did you picture?
Make certain you're using language your stakeholders understand, and repeat it often until
you're certain they get it.



Summary
This chapter finished up the Executing process group. We looked at Conduct Procurements,
Manage Quality, Manage Communications, Manage Project Knowledge, and Manage
Stakeholder Engagement.
   Conduct Procurements involves obtaining responses to bids and proposals from poten-
tial vendors, selecting a vendor, and awarding the contract. In this process, the selection
committee will use proposal evaluation techniques to prioritize the bids and proposals, and
the outcome is that a seller (or sellers) is selected and contracts awarded.
   Contracts have cycles of their own, much like projects. Phases of the contracting life
cycle include requirement, requisition, solicitation, and award. Changes to the contract are
managed with change requests.
   Changes that cannot be agreed on are contested changes. These take the form of dis-
putes, claims, or appeals. They might be settled among the parties directly, through a court
of law, or through arbitration.
470        Chapter 9      Conducting Procurements and Sharing Information



   During the Manage Quality process, quality audits are performed to ensure that the
project will meet and satisfy the project's quality standards set out in the quality manage-
ment plan.
   The Manage Project Knowledge process involves sharing organizational as well as
project knowledge and creating new knowledge that can be shared in the future. The pur-
pose for sharing the knowledge is to increase the chance of success for your project and to
improve project results.
   The Manage Communications process is concerned with making sure project informa-
tion is available to stakeholders at the right time and in the appropriate format. This pro-
cess is performed throughout the life of the project.
   The Manage Stakeholder Engagement process involves making certain that communica-
tion needs and expectations of the stakeholders are met, managing any issues stakeholders
might raise that could become future issues, and resolving previously identified issues.



Exam Essentials
Be able to describe the purpose of the Conduct Procurements process. Conduct Pro
curements involves obtaining bids and proposals from vendors, selecting a vendor, and
awarding a contract.
Be able to name the tools and techniques of the Conduct Procurements process. The tools
and techniques of the Conduct Procurements process are bidder conferences, expert judg-
ment, advertising, data analysis, and interpersonal and team skills.
Be able to name the contracting life-cycle stages. Contracting life cycles include require-
ment, requisition, solicitation, and award stages.
Be able to describe the purpose of the Manage Quality process. The Manage Quality
process is concerned with making certain the project will meet and satisfy the quality
standards of the project.
Be able to differentiate between senders and receivers of information. Senders are
responsible for clear, concise, complete messages, whereas receivers are responsible for
understanding the message correctly.
Be able to describe the sender-receiver model and the interactive communication model.
The sender-receiver model involves a sender who encodes and transmits a message and a
receiver who decodes and interprets the message. The interactive communication model
includes the sender-receiver model as well as an acknowledgment the message was received
and feedback regarding the contents of the message.
Be able to describe the purpose of the Manage Communication process. Manage Commu
nication involves making sure project information is available to stakeholders at the right
time and in the appropriate format.

    one of your team members drop everything to assist her with a problem that could have
    been avoided if she had performed the test. This employee reports to a stakeholder, not
    to the project team. All project team members and stakeholders are colocated. Because
    your team also needs her to participate in an upcoming test, you decide to do which of the
    following?
    A. You decide to record the issue in the issue log and bring it up at the next status
       meeting. Everyone can benefit from understanding the importance of stakeholders
       fulfilling their roles and responsibilities on the project.
    B.   You decide to record the issue in the issue log and then phone the stakeholder to
         explain what happened. You know speaking with the stakeholder directly is the most
         effective means for resolving issues.
    C.   You decide to have a face-to-face meeting with the stakeholder because this is the most
         effective means for resolving issues with them.
    D.   You decide to email the stakeholder and explain what happened in a professional
         manner so you can incorporate their response in the next status report.

16. Your project is progressing as planned. The project team has come up with a demo that the

476          Chapter 9      Conducting Procurements and Sharing Information



18. According to the PMBOK (R) Guide, this party is responsible for managing stakeholder
    expectations.
      A. Project manager, because actively managing stakeholder expectations will reduce
         project risk and help unresolved issues get resolved quickly
      B.   Project sponsor, because the overall success or failure of the project rests on this
           individual
      C.   All stakeholders have the responsibility to make sure their expectations are managed
           and they receive the proper information at the right time.
      D.   The project manager and the project team members together have the responsibility
           because the project manager alone cannot manage all the stakeholders on a large,
           complex project.

19. This activity can become its own process with inputs and outputs on large or complex
    projects.
      A. Independent estimates
      B.   Procurement negotiations
      C.   Procurement agreements
      D.   Proposal evaluations

20. Which of the following statements is false regarding contract life cycles?
      A. The requirement phase is the first contract life-cycle phase and is performed during
         the Plan Procurement Management process. The buyer prepares the SOW during this
         phase.
      B.   The award phase is the fourth contract life-cycle phase and is performed during the
           Conduct Procurements process. The buyer awards the contract in this phase.
      C.   The solicitation phase is the third contract life-cycle phase and is performed during the
           Conduct Procurements process. This phase receives the bids and proposals and applies
           evaluation criteria to each in order to score or rank the responses.
      D.   The requisition phase is the second contract life-cycle phase and is performed during
           the Plan Procurement Management process. The buyer prepares the RFP during this
           phase.

                               This chapter introduces the Monitoring and Controlling pro-
                               cess group. The Monitoring and Controlling process group
                               involves taking measurements and performing inspections to
fi nd out whether there are variances in the plan. If you discover variances, you need to take
corrective action to get the project back on track and repeat the affected project Planning
processes to make adjustments to the plan as a result of resolving the variances.
    We'll start with the Monitor and Control Project Work process. This process involves
tracking, reviewing, adjusting, and controlling progress to meet the project performance
objectives. We'll also look at Control Procurements, Monitor Communications, Perform
Integrated Change Control, and Monitor Stakeholder Engagement.
    Control Procurements is where contract performance is monitored, procurement rela-
tionships are managed, and corrections or changes are implemented where needed.
    Work performance information is an output of the Monitor Communications process,
and this output is used and maintained during the Monitoring and Controlling
processes, along with tools and techniques, to monitor and control project communica-
tion throughout the life of the project. This information allows the project manager to take
corrective action during the Monitoring and Controlling processes and to remedy wayward
project results and realign future project results with the project management plan.
    Perform Integrated Change Control lays the foundation for all the control processes--
such as Monitor Risks, Control Costs, and Control Schedule--that we'll talk about in
Chapter 11, "Controlling Work Results." During this discussion, I'll take time to explain
how change control and configuration management works. When you read these sections,
remember that the information from the Perform Integrated Change Control process
applies to all the control processes we'll talk about in Chapter 11.
    Monitor Stakeholder Engagement is about continuing your relationship with the stake-
holders and maintaining their engagement on the project. Stakeholders sometimes lose
interest once you get into the later stages of the project, and you don't want that to happen.
You've learned a lot about project management by this point and have just a few more
topics to add to your study list. Keep up the good work. You're getting closer to exam day.


                 The process names, inputs, tools and techniques, outputs, and
                 descriptions of the project management process groups and related
                 materials and figures in this chapter are based on content from A Guide
                 to the Project Management Body of Knowledge (PMBOK (R) Guide), Sixth
                 Edition (PMI (R), 2017).

Monitoring and Controlling Project Work
The processes in the Monitoring and Controlling process group concentrate on monitoring
and measuring project performance at regular intervals to identify and quantify variances
from the project management plan and get it back on track using corrective actions.
   The Monitor and Control Project Work process is concerned with monitoring all the
processes in the Initiating, Planning, Executing, and Closing process groups. Collecting
data, measuring results, comparing results to what was planned, and reporting on perfor-
mance information are some of the activities you'll perform during this process. Many key
outputs from other Monitoring and Controlling processes are inputs to this process.
   According to the PMBOK(R) Guide, the Monitor and Control Project Work process
involves the following:
    Reporting and comparing actual project results against the project management plan
    Analyzing performance data and determining whether corrective or preventive action
    should be recommended
    Monitoring the project for risks to make certain they're identified and reported, their
    status is documented, and the appropriate risk response plans have been put into action
    Documenting all appropriate product information throughout the life of the project
    Gathering, recording, and documenting project information that provides project
    status, measurements of progress, and forecasting to update cost and schedule informa-
    tion that is reported to stakeholders, project team members, management, and others
    Monitoring approved change requests
    Providing reports on the project processes and program management status when the
    project is part of an overall program


                 Keep in mind that the PMBOK (R) Guide presents information according to
                 Knowledge Areas. In this chapter, for example, the Monitor and Control
                 Project Work process is presented first because it is the first process in
                 the Project Integration Management Knowledge Area that is a Monitoring
                 and Controlling process. Monitor and Control Project Work is a process
                 that encompasses all aspects of monitoring and controlling the work of
                 the project. Unfortunately, we can't cover every process that this process
                 refers to in the same chapter. (For example, outputs from other Monitor-
                 ing and Controlling processes are inputs to this process.) I have attempted
                 to arrange these processes in the most logical format possible so an all-
                 encompassing process will be presented first, followed by other processes
                 within this group. Rest assured we will cover everything this process
                 touches in either this chapter or Chapter 11.

Monitor and Control Project Work Inputs
The inputs of this process include the project management plan (any component), project
documents (assumption log, basis of estimates, cost forecasts, issue log, lessons learned
register, milestone list, quality reports, risk register, risk report, schedule forecasts),
work performance information, agreements, enterprise environmental factors, and organi-
zational process assets. We will look at the new aspects of each of these next.

Project Management Plan
The Monitor and Control Project Work process is broad-reaching and is concerned with
all of the work of the project rather than a specific area like schedule or cost or human
resources. To monitor and control the work, you'll need the project management plan,
which includes all of the subsidiary plans we've talked about so far, so that you know what
was planned and can take action where needed to get the project back in line with the plan.
As a reminder, some of those subsidiary plans include the scope management plan, the cost
management plan, the resource management plan, the communications management plan,
and more. And don't forget the important baselines: scope, schedule, and cost.

Basis of Estimates
Basis of estimates are used in this process to determine if there are variances to the cost,
schedule, or other estimates that require adjustments to the project. Work performance
information can also be considered when using this input.

Project Documents--Schedule Forecasts
Schedule forecasts are an output of the Control Schedule process. Schedule forecasts help
determine the progress of the project schedule as it compares to the schedule baseline.
This can involve a series of formulas to determine elements such as when a milestone was
scheduled to be completed versus when it was actually completed. We will look at all of the
formulas in the next chapter when we talk about controlling the project schedule.

Project Documents--Cost Forecasts
Cost forecasts are an output of the Control Costs process. Much like the schedule
forecasts, cost forecasts help us determine project progress as far as costs are concerned.
This includes formulas to determine factors such as what we anticipated spending at this
point in time versus what was actually spent. These formulas are known as earned value
management formulas, and we will look at them as well as the cost forecasts formulas in
the next chapter when we talk about controlling project costs.

Forecasting Methods
There are several forecasting methods you can use for both schedule and cost forecasting
that you may need to know for the exam. Let's take a quick look at each of them.
                                        Monitoring and Controlling Project Work              481




                  Forecasting involves examining the project performance data to date and
                  making predictions about future project performance based on this data.
                  According to the PMBOK (R) Guide, cost forecasts are determined using
                  earned value management formulas such as estimate to complete
                  and estimate at completion. Forecasting can also include methods such as
                  time series, scenario building, and simulation. These forecasting methods
                  fall into four different categories, and each category has several types of
                  forecasting methods. We'll look at a brief description of each of the catego-
                  ries next, but it is beyond the scope of this book to go into detail on each
                  one. Keep in mind these are not discussed in the PMBOK (R) Guide but they
                  are methods you should know since you may see them in practice.


Time Series Methods These forecasting methods use historical data to predict future per-
formance. Earned value, moving average, extrapolation, trend estimation, linear prediction,
and growth curve are some of the methods that fall into this category. We'll cover earned
value in Chapter 11.
Causal/Econometric Methods Causal methods are based on the ability to identify vari-
ables that may cause or influence the forecast. A drop in interest rates, for example, may
spur an increase in home sales. The methods included in this category are regression analy-
sis, autoregressive moving average (ARMA), and econometrics.
Judgmental Methods If your mom is anything like mine, you were taught not to be
judgmental. This category of forecasting does just that, only it doesn't judge people. It
uses opinions, intuitive judgments, and probability estimates to determine possible future
results. Methods within this category include composite forecasts, the Delphi method, sur-
veys, technology forecasting, scenario building, and forecast by analogy.
Other Methods Other types of forecasting methods include simulation (like Monte Carlo
analysis), probabilistic forecasting, and ensemble forecasting.

Work Performance Information
Work performance information concerns gathering the performance data, or work results,
from the Executing processes and then reporting and analyzing the information in the
Monitoring and Controlling processes. This might include performance information such
as the status of deliverables, schedule forecast data, cost forecast data, the status of change
requests, costs incurred to date, and more. This information is analyzed against the proj-
ect management plan, project documents, and other project information. For example,
you'll recall that quality metrics were defi ned in the Plan Quality Management process. In
order to know if the quality metrics you've gathered are on target with the plan, you have
to compare the results to the quality management plan. Work performance information is
reported to the stakeholders according to the requirements laid out in the communications
management plan and the stakeholder management plan.
482         Chapter 10      Measuring and Controlling Project Performance



Enterprise Environmental Factors
Some of the enterprise environmental factors to consider in this process include the project
management information system, government or industry standards, the risk tolerance
levels of your stakeholders, and infrastructure.

Organizational Process Assets
The organizational process assets for which the PMBOK(R) Guide notes should be
considered during this process include financial controls, the organization's policies and
procedures, methods you'll use to monitor and report during this process, managing
and resolving of issues and action items, managing and resolving of defects, process
measurements, and lessons learned.
   We talked about lessons learned in Chapter 9, "Conducting Procurements and Sharing
Information." Remember that lessons learned should be performed throughout the life of
the project. Capturing and analyzing lessons learned will help you continually improve
project management processes and will ultimately improve your project success rates.
   There are four tools and techniques of this process including expert judgment, data anal-
ysis (alternatives analysis, cost-benefit analysis, earned value analysis, root cause analysis,
trend analysis, variance analysis), decision making, and meetings, all of which we've cov-
ered previously, so we'll move right to the outputs next.


Monitor and Control Project Work Outputs
The outputs of the Monitor and Control Project Work process will also look familiar. They
are as follows:
      Work performance reports
      Change requests
      Project management plan updates (any component)
      Project documents updates (cost forecast, issue log, lessons learned register, risk
      register, schedule forecasts)

Work Performance Reports
Work performance reports are the primary output of this process. It's here that the work
performance data and work performance information gathered and analyzed throughout
the Monitoring and Controlling processes are documented and reported to the stakehold-
ers as outlined in the communications management plan. Work performance reports might
take many forms, including status reports, issues or action item logs, project documents,
and so on. They may be represented in hardcopy form or electronic form or both.
   Work performance reports may range from simply stated status reports to highly
detailed reports. Dashboards are an example of a simple report that may use stoplight-type
indicators like red-yellow-green to show the status of each area of the project at a glance.
Red means the item being reported is in trouble or behind schedule, yellow means it's in
                                       Monitoring and Controlling Project Work              483




danger of falling behind schedule and corrective action should be taken, and green means
all is well.
    Almost any type of report or chart or graph can be included as part of the work perfor-
mance report output. Other examples might include defect histograms, burn-down charts,
trend lines, and more. The information in these reports pertains to project work results (or
performance metrics) but can also be used to report on contract performance.



Exam Spotlight

According to the PMBOK (R) Guide, the work performance reports produced as a result
of this process are used by the project management team and stakeholders to create
awareness of issues, make decisions about those issues, and determine actions to take to
resolve the issues. They are a subset of project documents.



   More detailed reports may include the following elements:
    Analysis of project performance for previous periods
    Risk and issue status
    Work completed in the current reporting period
    Work expected to be completed during the next reporting period
    Changes approved in the current reporting period (or a summary if there are numerous
    changes)
    Results of variance analysis
    Time completion forecasts and cost forecasts
    Other information stakeholders want or need to know
   The information contained in these reports is used at status meetings or in meet-
ings with the project sponsor to generate action, to make decisions, or to inform. This
information should be in written format (such as a status report or memo) and stored
electronically with other project documents. Work performance reports are considered a
subset of project documents and should be shared and distributed according to your com-
munications plan.

Change Requests
Remember from Chapter 9 that change requests may take the form of corrective actions,
preventive actions, or defect repairs. Corrective actions bring the work of the project into
alignment with expected future performance. Preventive actions are implemented to help
reduce the probability of negative project risks. Defect repairs either correct or replace com-
ponents that are substandard or malfunctioning.
484        Chapter 10      Measuring and Controlling Project Performance



Project Management Plan and Document Updates
Project management plan updates may include updates to one or more of the manage-
ment plans--including schedule, cost, or quality. Updates to the baselines, such as scope,
schedule, and cost, may be required.



Controlling Procurements
We'll now take another look at the procurement arena. You learned about Conduct
Procurements in Chapter 9. Now that the contract has been awarded, you need to
administer it.
   The Control Procurements process involves monitoring the vendor's performance and
ensuring that all the requirements of the procurement agreement (this is usually a contract)
are met and then closing out the procurement when the work is complete. When multiple
vendors are providing goods and services to the project, Control Procurements entails coor-
dinating the interfaces among all the vendors as well as administering each of the contracts
or procurement agreements. If vendor A has a due date that will impact whether vendor B
can perform their service, the management and coordination of the two vendors become
important. Vendor A's contract and due dates must be monitored closely because failure
to perform could affect another vendor's ability to perform, not to mention the project
schedule. You can see how this situation could multiply quickly when you have six or
seven or more vendors involved.


                 It's imperative that the project manager and project team are aware of any
                 contract agreements that might impact the project so that the team does
                 not inadvertently take action that violates the terms of the contract.

   Depending on the size of the organization, administering the contract or other procure-
ment agreement might fall to someone in the procurement department. This doesn't mean
you're off the hook as the project manager. It's still your responsibility to oversee the pro-
cess and make sure the project objectives are being met, regardless of whether a vendor is
performing the activities or your project team members are performing the activities. You'll
be the one monitoring the performance of the vendor and informing them when and if per-
formance is lacking. You'll also monitor the procurement agreement's fi nancial conditions.
For example, the seller should be paid in a timely manner when they've satisfactorily met
the conditions of the agreement, and it will be up to you to let the procurement department
know it's okay to pay the vendor. If administering the contract or procurement agreement is
your responsibility, you might have to terminate the contract when the vendor violates the
terms or doesn't meet the agreed-on deliverables. If the procurement department has this
responsibility, you'll have to document the situation and provide this to the procurement
department so that they can enforce or terminate the contract.
                                                       Controlling Procurements               485




   Control Procurements involves monitoring procurement activities to verify that you are
meeting the project objectives, and it is closely linked with other project management pro-
cesses. You'll manage vendor relationships, monitor the progress of the contract, execute
plans, track costs, measure outputs, approve changes, take corrective action, and report on
status, just as you do for the project itself.



Exam Spotlight

Buyers and sellers are equally responsible for monitoring the contract. Each has a vested
interest in ensuring that the other party is living up to their contractual obligations and
that their own legal rights are protected.




Controlling Procurements Inputs
Control Procurements has eight inputs:
    Project management plan (requirements management plan, risk management plan, pro-
    curement management plan, change management plan, schedule baseline)
    Project documents (assumption log, lessons learned register, milestone list, quality
    reports, requirements documentation, requirements traceability matrix, risk register,
    stakeholder register)
    Agreements
    Procurement documentation
    Approved change requests
    Work performance data
    Enterprise environmental factors
    Organizational process assets
   The project management plan, procurement documentation, agreements, approved
change requests, and work performance data are outputs from other processes. We'll look
at approved procurement documentation, change requests, and some additional content for
work performance data as it pertains to this process next.

Procurement Documentation
It has been a while since I've talked about documentation, but discussing procurement
documentation reminds me of the importance of having an organized system for your
procurement documents. These may include the contract itself, the statement of work,
payment information, drawings and plans, policies and procedures, and so on. A records
486        Chapter 10      Measuring and Controlling Project Performance



management system provides a way to organize, retrieve, and archive these documents
when needed. Records management might be part of your project management information
system or a stand-alone system. In my organization, the PMIS is separate from the records
management system. Records are clearly defined, have specific naming conventions, are
indexed for easy filing and retrieval, and have retention policies associated with them. Both
systems may provide control functions, workflows, automated tools, and a way to link to
documents in the PMIS (or vice versa).

Approved Change Requests
Sometimes as you get into the work of the project, you discover that changes need to be
made. This could entail changes to the contract as well. Approved change requests are used
to process the project or contract changes and might include things such as modifications to
deliverables, changes to the product or service of the project, changes in contract terms, or
termination for poor performance.
   Generally speaking, contracts end for three reasons: cause, convenience, or default.
When a contract ends for cause, it's because one of the parties has violated the terms of the
contract. A contract ends for convenience when one of the parties determines they no lon-
ger wish to participate in the contract. And contracts that end by default are those where
one of the parties has failed to perform according to the terms of the contract.
   Contracts can be amended at any time prior to contract completion, provided the
changes are agreed to by all parties and conform to the change control processes outlined
in the contract.

Contract Change Control System
The purpose of the contract change control system is to establish a formal process
for submitting change requests. It documents how to submit changes, establishes the
approval process, and outlines authorization levels. The contract change control system is
part of the enterprise environmental factors input to the Plan Procurement Management
process. Why am I mentioning it here? Because changes to the contract generally occur
during the Executing or Monitoring and Controlling processes after the work of the
project has started and when results are being monitored. Approved change requests for
contracts will be processed through the contract change control system (an input to this
process).
    Much like the management plans found in the Planning processes, the contract change
control system describes the processes needed to make contract changes. Because the
contract is a legal document, changes to it require the agreement of all parties. A formal
process must be established to process and authorize (or deny) changes. (Authorization lev-
els are defined in the organizational policies.) It includes a tracking system to number the
change requests and record their status. The procedures for dispute resolution are spelled
out in the contract change control system as well.
    The change control system, along with all the management plan outputs, becomes
part of the Perform Integrated Change Control process that I'll discuss later in this
chapter.

Exam Spotlight

Work performance data is an output of the Direct and Manage Project Work process. The
results you gather in the Control Procurements process are actually collected as part of
the Direct and Manage Project Work process output.



Work Performance Data
Work performance data include technical documentation that is developed by the seller
according to the terms of the contract as well as work performance information as it relates
to the seller (or vendor).
   Work performance information in the Control Procurements process concerns monitor-
ing vendor work results and examining the vendor's deliverables. This includes monitoring
their work results against the contract statement of work and making sure activities are
performed correctly and in sequence. You'll need to determine which deliverables are com-
plete and which ones have not been completed to date. You'll also need to consider the
quality of the deliverables and the costs that have been incurred to date.
   Vendors request payment for the goods or services delivered in the form of seller
invoices. Seller invoices should describe the work that was completed or the materials that
were delivered and should include any supporting documentation necessary to describe
what was delivered. The contract should state what type of supporting documentation is
needed with the invoice. The payment system is used to issue payments for the invoices.
The organization might have a dedicated department, such as accounts payable, that han-
dles vendor payments, or it might fall to the project manager. In either case, follow the poli-
cies and procedures the organization has established regarding vendor payments and make
sure the payments themselves adhere to the contract terms.


Control Procurements Tools and Techniques
The Control Procurements process has several tools and techniques:
    Expert judgment
    Claims administration
    Data analysis (performance reviews, earned value analysis, trend analysis)
    Inspection
    Audits
   You will look at each of these in the following sections.

Expert Judgment
You are probably well aware of this tool and technique by now. Experts for this process
may include personnel from the functional areas (such as accounting, information tech-
nology, procurement, and so on), legal experts, compliance experts, and those who have
claims administration experience.
488         Chapter 10      Measuring and Controlling Project Performance



Claims Administration
Claims administration involves documenting, monitoring, and managing contested changes
to the contract. Changes that cannot be agreed on are called contested changes. Contested
changes usually involve a disagreement about the compensation to the vendor for imple-
menting the change. You might believe the change is not significant enough to justify addi-
tional compensation, whereas the vendor believes they'll lose money by implementing the
change free of charge. Contested changes are also known as disputes, claims, or appeals.
These can be settled directly between the parties themselves, through the court system, or
by a process called arbitration. Arbitration involves bringing all parties to the table with a
third, disinterested party who is not a participant in the contract to try to reach an agree-
ment. The purpose of arbitration is to reach an agreement without having to go to court.
Arbitration is a form of alternative dispute resolution (ADR) and could be a named tool
in the contract for resolving disputes. Reaching a negotiated settlement through the aid of
ADR techniques is the most favorable way to resolve the dispute.

Data Analysis--Procurement Performance Reviews
Procurement performance reviews examine the seller's performance on the contract to date.
These reviews can be conducted at the end of the contract or at intervals during the con-
tract period. Procurement reviews examine the contract terms and seller performance for
elements such as these:
      Meeting project scope
      Meeting project quality
      Staying within project budgets
      Meeting the project schedule
    The performance reviews themselves might take the form of quality audits or inspec-
tions of documents as well as the work of the product itself, or they may be part of a status
review. The point of the review is to determine where the seller is succeeding at meeting
scope, quality, cost, and schedule issues, for example, or where they're not measuring up. If
the seller is not in compliance, action must be taken to either get them back into compliance
or terminate the contract. The yardstick you're using to measure their performance against
is the contract SOW and the terms of the contract. When the RFP is included as part of the
contract, you might also use it to determine contract compliance.

Inspections
Inspections involve physically examining or inspecting the work. This may be performed by
the buyer or a designated third party. Inspections may occur during the work of the project
as well as at the completion of the work.

Audits
Audits in this process consist of reviews of procurement activities to determine whether
they are meeting the right needs and are being performed correctly and according to stan-
dards. Procurement audits also examine the procurement processes to determine areas of
                                                       Controlling Procurements            489




improvement and to identify flawed processes or procedures. This allows you to reuse the
successful processes on other procurement items for this project, on future projects, or
elsewhere in the organization. It also alerts you to problems in the process so that you don't
repeat them.
   Procurement audits might be used by either the buyer or the vendor, or by both, as an
opportunity for improvement. It's a good idea to document what you learned during the
audits as lessons learned--including the successes and failures that occurred. This allows
you to improve other procurement processes currently underway on this project or other
projects. It also gives you the opportunity to improve the process for future projects.


Control Procurements Outputs
The outputs of the Control Procurements process are as follows:
    Closed procurements
    Work performance information
    Procurement documentation updates
    Change requests
    Project management plan updates (risk management plan, procurement management
    plan, schedule baseline, cost baseline)
    Project documents updates (lessons learned register, resource requirements, require-
    ments traceability matrix, risk register, stakeholder register)
    Organizational process assets updates
   These outputs relate to the tools and techniques just talked about and, in practice, work
hand in hand with them. Closed procurements is a new output, and I'll highlight some of
the new elements for a few other outputs next.

Closed Procurements
When the work of the contract is complete, you'll provide formal notice to the seller--
usually in written form--that the procurement is complete. This is a formal acceptance and
closure of the procurement. It's your responsibility as project manager to document the for-
mal acceptance of the procurement. Many times the provisions for formalizing acceptance
and closing the procurement are spelled out in the procurement documents and should be
included in the procurement management plan.
   If you have a procurement department that handles contract administration, they will
expect you to inform them when the procurement is completed and will in turn follow the
formal procedures to let the seller know it's complete. However, you'll still note the pro-
curement completion in your copy of the project records.


                 Depending on the terms of the procurement, early termination (whether
                 by agreement, via default, or for cause) might result in additional charges
                 to the buyer. Be certain to note the reasons for early termination in your
                 procurement documentation.
490         Chapter 10      Measuring and Controlling Project Performance



   Closing procurements should occur after receiving all the deliverables, ensuring that
they meet the technical and quality standards set out in the contract, that there is no
remaining work, and that all payments have been made to the vendor. If the product or
service does not meet expectations, the vendor will need to correct the problems before you
issue a formal acceptance notice. Ideally, quality inspections have been performed during
the course of the project, and the vendor was given the opportunity to make corrections
earlier in the process than the closing stage. It's not a good idea to wait until the very end
of the project and then spring all the problems and issues on the vendor at once. It's much
more efficient to discuss problems with your vendor as the project progresses because it
provides the opportunity for correction when the problems occur.
   Some of the administrative functions of closing out the procurement documents such as
confirming formal acceptance, closing out open claims, updating and archiving records will
happen in the Closing process group. We'll talk more about these procedures in
Chapter 12, "Closing the Project and Applying Professional Responsibility."

Procurement Documentation Updates
Here's your favorite topic again. This output includes (but isn't limited to) updating all of
the following:
      Contract or other procurement documents
      Deliverables
      Performance reports
      Technical documentation
      Warranties
      Financial information (such as invoices and payment records)
      Inspection and audit results
      Supporting schedules
      Approved and unapproved changes
   The records management system I talked about earlier is the perfect place to keep all
these documents.

Change Requests
Requested contract changes are coordinated with the Direct and Manage Project Work
and Perform Integrated Change Control processes so that any changes impacting the
project are communicated to the project team, and appropriate actions are put into place
to realign the objectives. This might also mean you'll have to change the project manage-
ment plan, including the cost baseline and/or the schedule baseline. That requires you to
jump back to the Planning process group to bring the project management plan, or other
documents, up-to-date. Once the plan is updated, the Direct and Manage Project Work
process might require changes as well to get the work of the project in line with the new
plan. Remember that project management is an iterative process, and it's not unusual to
                                                       Controlling Procurements            491




revisit the Planning or Executing processes, particularly as changes are made or corrective
actions are put into place.
   Contract changes will not always impact the project management plan, however. For
example, late delivery of key equipment probably would impact the project management
plan, but changes in the vendor payment schedule probably would not. It's important that
you are kept abreast of any changes to the contract so that you can evaluate whether the
project management plan needs adjusting.

Organizational Process Assets Updates
Organizational process assets updates consist of organizational policies, procedures, and so
on. Three elements of this output relate to contracts:
Procurement File The procurement file includes contract documents, the closed con-
tract documents, and correspondence related to the contract and contract performance.
Correspondence is information that needs to be communicated in writing to either the
seller or the buyer. Examples include changes to the contract, clarification of contract
terms, results of buyer audits and inspections, and notification of performance issues. You'll
use correspondence to inform the vendor if their performance is unsatisfactory. If they
don't correct it, you'll use correspondence again to notify a vendor that you're terminating
the contract because performance is below expectations and is not satisfying the require-
ments of the contract.
Payment Schedules and Requests Many times, contracts are written such that payment
is made based on a predefined performance schedule. For example, perhaps the first pay-
ment is made after 25 percent of the product or service is completed, or maybe the payment
schedule is based on milestone completion. In any case, as the project manager, you will
verify that the vendor's work (or delivery) meets expectations before the payment is autho-
rized. It's almost always your responsibility as the project manager to verify that the terms
of the contract to date have or have not been satisfied. Depending on your organizational
policies, someone from the accounting or procurement department might request writ-
ten notification from you that the vendor has completed a milestone or made a delivery.
Monitoring the work of the vendor is as important as monitoring the work of your team
members.
If the procurement department is responsible for paying the contractor, then that depart-
ment manages the payment schedule (which is one of the terms of the contract). The seller
submits a payment request, an inspection or review of their performance is conducted to
make certain the terms of the contract were fulfilled, and the payment is made.
Seller Performance Evaluation Seller performance evaluation is a written record of the
seller's performance on the contract and is prepared by the buyer. It should include infor-
mation about whether the seller successfully met contract dates, whether the seller fulfilled
the requirements of the contract and/or contract statement of work, whether the work was
satisfactory, and so on. Seller performance evaluations can be used as a basis for termi-
nating the existing contract if performance is not satisfactory. They can also be used to
492         Chapter 10      Measuring and Controlling Project Performance



determine penalty fees in the case of unsatisfactory performance or incentives that are due
according to the terms of the contract. They should also indicate whether the vendor should
be allowed to bid on future work. Seller performance evaluations can also be included as
part of the qualified sellers lists.
Prequalified Seller List Updates Prequalified sellers are sellers who are preapproved to
bid on contract work. If you have an underperforming vendor, you'll want to remove them
from this list.
Lessons Learned Repository Everything you learned about the procurement process,
successes and failures, should be documented in the lessons learned repository for future
reference. This should also include an assessment of the procurement management plan and
how it compared to the actual procurement process.



Exam Spotlight

I recommend that you understand the purposes of the procurement processes and don't
simply memorize their components. Here's a brief recap:

      Plan Procurement Management: Preparing the SOW and procurement documents
      and determining source selection criteria
      Conduct Procurements: Obtaining bids and proposals from potential vendors, evalu-
      ating proposals against predetermined evaluation criteria, selecting vendors, and
      awarding the contract
      Control Procurements: Monitoring vendor performance to ensure that contract
      requirements are met




Monitoring Communications
As mentioned, the Monitoring and Controlling process group concentrates on monitoring
and measuring project performance to identify variances from the project management
plan. Monitor Communications is the process that monitors and controls communica-
tions throughout the life of the project, and it is part of the Project Communications
Management Knowledge Area. You will recall that this Knowledge Area is concerned
with collecting, distributing, storing, archiving, and organizing project communications.
Therefore, it plays a key role in collecting information regarding project progress and
project accomplishments and reporting it to the stakeholders. This information might also
be reported to project team members, the management team, and other interested parties
through the Monitor and Control Project Work process. Reporting might include infor-
mation concerning project quality, costs, scope, project schedules, procurement, and risk,
and it can be presented in the form of status reports, progress measurements, or forecasts.

As with other processes in the Monitoring and Controlling process group, Monitor
Communications may produce changes that will require a trip back through the
Plan Communications Management process and/or the Manage Communications process.



Exam Spotlight

According to the PMBOK (R) Guide, the Monitor Communications process is concerned
with evaluating and controlling the impact messages may carry and delivering the right
message to the right people at the right time. This process is also about making certain
that the project information needs and, most importantly, the information needs of the
stakeholders are met.




Monitor Communications Inputs
You've examined most of the inputs to the Monitor Communications process previously,
but we'll reexamine all of them briefly with the exception of work performance data and
enterprise environmental factors, which we've covered previously. The inputs are as follows:
    Project management plan (resource management plan, communications management
    plan, stakeholder engagement plan)
    Project documents (issue log, lessons learned register, project communications)
    Work performance data
    Enterprise environmental factors
    Organizational process assets

Project Management Plan The project management plan contains the project management
baseline data (typically cost, schedule, and scope factors), which you'll use to monitor and
compare results. Deviations from this data are reported to management. The resource man-
agement plan, communications management plan, and stakeholder management plan are
useful in keeping up with the communication needs of the stakeholders.
Issue Log (Project Documents) The issue log documents issues, assigns owners, tracks
due dates, and more. The issue log is useful in status meetings and in the Monitor
Communications process as a way to determine what issues remain that are potentially
blocking progress and what's been resolved. I have found that reviewing issue logs at every
status meeting helps to maintain stakeholder expectations and also holds them accountable
for actions they are required to take to resolve the issue.
Lessons Learned Register (Project Documents) Lessons learned are helpful in improv-
ing the effectiveness of your communications. Review lessons learned from earlier in the
project to see if there are areas where you can improve communications (or that have been
improved). Lessons learned from similar projects completed in the past are helpful as well.
494           Chapter 10      Measuring and Controlling Project Performance



Project Communications (Project Documents) Project communications include informa-
tion such as status, progress on performance, cost and budget information, schedule prog-
ress, and more. This information is used to make project decisions and take action where
needed.
Organizational Process Assets Several organizational process assets come into play in
this process, including reporting templates; communication policies or standards, including
those for social media; communication technologies for storing and retrieving data; and
security issues surrounding data, historical data, and communications data from previous
projects.


Monitor Communications Tools and Techniques
The following are tools and techniques of this process:
       Expert judgment
       Project management information system
       Data representation (stakeholder engagement assessment matrix)
       Interpersonal and team skills (observation/conversation)
       Meetings
      Let's look at each of these next.

Expert Judgment
In this process, experts from all areas--including the project team, consultants, stakehold-
ers, industry groups, the PMO, and others as appropriate--are consulted to help interpret
the information gathered during the Monitoring and Controlling processes and make deci-
sions and take action where needed to align the work of the project with the project man-
agement plan. One of the obvious reasons you want to keep the work results on track with
the plan is so that stakeholder expectations are realized.
   You'll want people available with expertise in media communications, public outreach,
and international communications experience to craft and deliver messages to people out-
side the organization. Remember also that communication among and between virtual
teams is important in the communications processes.

Project Management Information Systems
The PMIS is used to record, store, and distribute information about the project, including
cost, schedule progress, and performance information. According to the PMBOK(R) Guide,
spreadsheet analysis, presentations, table reporting, and graphic capabilities are types of
distribution formats.

Data Representation--Stakeholder Engagement Matrix
The stakeholder engagement matrix documents the communication needs of the stake-
holders. This will need periodic updates and should be assessed to determine if the
                                                   Monitoring Communications              495




communications needs are being met and the methods and content of the communications
are effective in informing stakeholders.

Interpersonal and Team Skills--Observation/Conversation
Observation and conversation is used to gather information from team members and stake-
holders on project performance, to communicate project updates, to determine if confl ict
exists among or between teams, and to address team member performance issues.

Meetings
Meetings in this process include meetings involving the project team, vendors, functional
managers, stakeholders, and others you will be working with on the project. Meetings may
be formal, informal, in person, or online. The important point here is that you are meet-
ing with all those involved in your project and exchanging information. Meetings with the
project team are concerned with updating project performance information and communi-
cating those updates to the appropriate parties and working with stakeholders to provide
them with requested project information.
   One of the important meetings you will conduct throughout the life of the project is
the status review meeting. Status meetings are a type of interactive communication and
are important functions during the course of the project. The purpose of the status meet-
ing is to provide updated information regarding the progress of the project. These are not
show-and-tell meetings. If you have a prototype to demo, set up a different time to do that.
Status meetings are meant to exchange information and provide project updates. They are a
way to formally exchange project information. It's not unusual for projects to have three or
four status meetings conducted for different audiences. They can occur between the project
team and project manager, between the project manager and stakeholders, between the
project manager and users or customers, between the project manager and the management
team, and so on.
   Notice that the project manager is always included in status review meetings. Take care
that you don't overburden yourself with meetings that aren't necessary or meetings that
could be combined with other meetings. Having any more than three or four status meet-
ings per month is unwieldy.


                 Regular, timely status meetings prevent surprises down the road because
                 you are keeping stakeholders and customers informed of what's hap-
                 pening. Team status meetings alert the project manager to potential risk
                 events and provide the opportunity to discover and manage problems
                 before they get to the uncontrollable stage.

   The project manager is usually the expediter of the status meeting. As such, it's your job
to use status meetings wisely. Don't waste your team's time or the stakeholders' time either.
Notify attendees in writing of the meeting time and place. Publish an agenda prior to the
meeting, and stick to the agenda during the meeting. Every so often, summarize what has
496         Chapter 10      Measuring and Controlling Project Performance



been discussed during the meeting. Don't let side discussions lead you down rabbit trails,
and keep irrelevant conversations to a minimum. It's also good to publish status meeting
notes at the conclusion of the meeting, especially if any action items resulted from the meet-
ing. This will give you a document trail and serve as a reminder to the meeting participants
of what actions need to be resolved and who is responsible for each action item.
   It's important that project team members are honest with the project manager and that
the project manager is in turn honest about what they report. A few years ago, a depart-
ment in my agency took on a project of gargantuan proportions and unfortunately didn't
employ good project management techniques. One of the biggest problems with this project
was that the project manager did not listen to the highly skilled project team members. The
team members warned of problems and setbacks, but the project manager didn't want to
hear about it. The project manager took their reports to be of the "Chicken Little" ilk and
refused to believe the sky was falling. Unfortunately, the sky was falling! Because the proj-
ect manager didn't believe the reports, she refused to report the true status of the project to the
stakeholders and oversight committees. Millions of dollars were wasted on a project that
was doomed for failure while the project manager continued to report that the project was
on time and activities were completed when in fact they were not.
   There are hundreds of project stories like this, and I'll bet you've got one or two from
your experiences as well. Don't let your project become the next bad example. Above all,
be honest in your reporting. No one likes bad news, but bad news delivered too late along
with millions of dollars wasted is a guaranteed career-limiting move.


Monitor Communications Outputs
The Monitor Communications process has several outputs:
      Work performance information
      Change requests
      Project management plan updates (communications management plan, stakeholder
      engagement plan)
      Project documents updates (issue log, lessons learned register, stakeholder register)
   We'll look briefly at work performance information and change requests.
   Work performance information includes information you've gathered and analyzed
about the progress of the project to date. This information is typically documented in the
work performance reports (an output of the Monitor and Control Project Work process
we discussed earlier in this chapter) and is distributed to the stakeholders. Change requests
come about as a result of actions taken to correct issues; actions taken to modify scope,
schedule, or budget; or actions taken to address other items. These actions and decisions
are made as a result of reviewing work performance information. Change requests are
generated from this process (and others) but are processed through the Integrated Change
Control process that we'll discuss in the next section of this chapter. As you'll see shortly,
change requests may require updates to the project management plan, project documents,
project baselines, and more.

Exam Spotlight

For the exam, remember that one of the purposes of the Monitoring and Controlling
process group is to gather performance metrics, including work efforts, costs (both
expended and remaining forecasted costs), milestone measures, and other work perfor-
mance measures to determine project progress. The Monitor Communications process
brings much of this information together into one format.




Exam Spotlight

Work performance data, work performance information, and work performance reports
are all either inputs or outputs of various processes in the Executing and Monitoring and
Controlling process groups. They are similar but do have differences. I recommend you
understand the differences for the exam. Here is a recap of each for your study time.
According to the PMBOK (R) Guide, the definitions are as follows:

Work Performance Data This data is the result of measuring and observing project
activities. It may include data such as reports on the percentage of work complete, status
of deliverables, technical performance measurements, the actual start and finish dates of
schedule activities (schedule progress to date), the number of change requests or defects,
costs incurred to date, and so on. Work performance data is an input of the following
processes:
       Validate Scope
       Control Scope
       Control Schedule
       Control Costs
       Control Quality
       Monitor Communications
       Monitor Risks
       Control Procurements
       Control Resources
       Monitor Stakeholder Engagement

Work performance data is an output of the following process:

       Direct and Manage Project Work
498         Chapter 10        Measuring and Controlling Project Performance




Work Performance Information Work performance information is used in the
Monitoring and Controlling processes to analyze information such as the status of
deliverables, the status of change requests, and forecasts such as estimate to complete
(i.e., the work performance data).

Work performance information is an input of the following process:

         Monitor and Control Project Work

Work performance information is an output of the following processes:

         Validate Scope
         Control Scope
         Control Schedule
         Control Costs
         Control Quality
         Control Resources
         Monitor Communications
         Monitor Risks
         Control Procurements
         Monitor Stakeholder Engagement

Work Performance Reports Work performance reports are the physical manifesta-
tion of the work performance information you've gathered and analyzed using variance
analysis, earned value calculations, or forecasts. Work performance reports may include
status reports, memos, updates, and more. Work performance reports are intended to aid
decision making and action plans.

Work performance reports are an input of the following processes:

         Manage Team
         Manage Communications
         Perform Integrated Change Control
         Monitor Risks

Work performance data is an output of the following process:

         Direct and Manage Project Work
                                 Managing Perform Integrated Change Control                     499




Managing Perform Integrated
Change Control
The Perform Integrated Change Control process is where you implement the project's
change control process in accordance with the change management plan. This process
is performed throughout the life of the project from the point the project baselines are
established to the end of the project. Changes, which encompass corrective actions, pre-
ventive actions, and defect repair, are common across all the Monitoring and Controlling
processes. (Don't forget that change requests are also an output of the Direct and Manage
Project Work process, which is an Executing process.) These processes can generate the
change requests that are managed through the Perform Integrated Change Control process.
    You're likely to see exam questions on several topics that involve change and the Perform
Integrated Change Control process. Configuration management, for example, isn't listed
as a tool and technique of this process, but you really can't perform the Perform Integrated
Change Control process without it. There are several elements of configuration manage-
ment listed as part of the change control tool and technique of this process, but configu-
ration management itself needs some explanation. I'll discuss this shortly. First, though,
you'll look at change, what it is, and how it comes about.



Exam Spotlight

The project manager is responsible for performing and overseeing the Perform Inte-
grated Control process.



   Changes come about on projects for many reasons. It's the project manager's responsibil-
ity to manage these changes and see to it that organizational policies regarding changes are
implemented. Changes don't necessarily mean negative consequences. Changes can produce
positive results as well. It's important that you manage this process carefully, because too
many changes--even one significant change--will impact cost, schedule, scope, and/or
quality. Once a change request has been submitted, you have some decisions to make. Ask
yourself questions such as these:
    Should the change be implemented?
    If so, what's the cost to the project in terms of project constraints: cost, time, scope,
    and quality?
    Will the benefits gained by making the change increase or decrease the chances of
    project completion?
500         Chapter 10      Measuring and Controlling Project Performance



   Just because a change is requested doesn't mean you have to implement it. You'll always
want to discover the reasons for the change to determine whether they're justifiable and
aligned with business needs, and you'll want to know the cost of the change. Remember
that cost can take the form of increased time. Let's say the change you're considering will
result in a later schedule completion date. That means you'll need human resources longer
than expected. If you've leased equipment or project resources for the team members to use
during the course of the project, a later completion date means your team needs the leased
equipment for a longer period of time. All this translates to increased costs. Time equals
money, as the saying goes, so manage time changes wisely, and dig deep to find the impacts
that time changes might make on the budget.


How Change Occurs
As the project progresses, the stakeholders or customers might request a change directly.
Team members might also recommend changes as the project progresses. For example,
once the project is under way, they might discover more efficient ways of performing tasks
or producing the product of the project and recommend changes to accommodate the new
efficiencies. Changes might also come about as a result of mistakes that were made earlier
in the project in the Planning or Executing processes. (However, I hope you've applied
all the great practices and techniques I've talked about to date, and you didn't experience
many of these.)
    Changes to the project might occur indirectly as a result of contingency plans, other
changes, or team members performing favors for the stakeholders by making that one
little change without telling anyone about it. Many times, the project manager is the last
to know about changes such as these. There's a fine line here because you don't want to
discourage good working relationships between team members and stakeholders, yet at the
same time, you want to ensure that all changes come through the change control process. If
a dozen little changes slip through like this, your project scope suddenly exits stage left.


Change Control Concerns
Perform Integrated Change Control, according to the PMBOK(R) Guide, is primarily
concerned with the following:
      Influencing the factors that cause change control processes to be circumvented
      Promptly reviewing and analyzing change requests
      Managing approved changes
      Maintaining the integrity of the project baselines (including scope, quality, schedule,
      cost, and performance measurement baselines) and incorporating approved changes
      into the project management plan and other project documents
      Promptly reviewing and analyzing corrective and preventive actions
      Coordinating and managing changes across the project
      Documenting requested changes and their impacts
                                 Managing Perform Integrated Change Control                  501




   Factors that might cause change include project constraints, stakeholder requests, team
member recommendations, vendor issues, and many others. You'll want to understand the
factors that are influencing or bringing about change and how a proposed change might
impact the project if implemented. Performance measures and corrective actions might
dictate that a project change is needed as well.


                  Modifications to the project are submitted in the form of change requests
                  and managed through the change control process. Obviously, you'll want
                  to implement those changes that are most beneficial to the project. I'll talk
                  more about change requests later in this chapter.

   Managing changes might involve making changes to the project scope, schedule, or
cost baseline, also known as the performance measurement baseline. This baseline might
also involve quality or technical elements. The performance measurement baseline is the
approved project management plan that describes the work of the project. This is used
through Executing and Monitoring and Controlling to measure project performance and
determine deviations from the plan. It's your responsibility to maintain the reliability of the
performance measurement baselines. Changes that impact an existing or completed project
management process will require updates to those processes, which might mean additional
passes through the appropriate Planning and Executing processes.
   The management plans created during the Planning process group should reflect the
changes as well, which might require updates to the project management plan or the proj-
ect scope statement. This requires a close eye on coordination among all the processes that
are impacted. For example, changes might require updates to risk response alternatives,
schedule, cost, resource requirements, or other elements. Changes that affect product scope
always require an update to the project scope.



exam spotlight

Managing changes involves maintaining accurate and reliable performance measure-
ment baselines; coordinating all processes impacted as a result of the change, including
revisiting Planning and Executing processes where needed; and updating project scope
to reflect any changes in product scope.



   I caution you to not change baselines at the drop of a hat. Examine the changes, their
justification, and their impacts thoroughly before making changes to the baselines. Make
certain your project sponsor approves baseline changes and that the project sponsor under-
stands why the change occurred and how it will impact the project. Be sure to keep a copy
of the original baseline for comparison purposes and for lessons learned.
502        Chapter 10      Measuring and Controlling Project Performance




Configuration Control
Configuration control is concerned with changes to the specifications of the deliverables
or project management processes. Configuration control is managed through the con-
figuration management system. The configuration management system is a subsystem of
the project management information system. It documents the procedures and authorized
approval levels for managing and controlling changes to the physical characteristics of the
deliverables.



Exam Spotlight

According to the PMBOK (R) Guide, change control involves changes to the deliverables,
project baselines, and/or project documents. Configuration control, which is managed
through the configuration management system, is concerned with changes to the specifi-
cations of the deliverables and/or the project management processes.



  The following items are part of the Change Control tool and technique of this process
and are activities associated with configuration control, so we'll look at them here:
Configuration Identification Configuration identification describes the characteristics of
the product, service, or result of the project. This description is the basis that's used to ver-
ify when changes are made and how they're managed. Configuration identification is also
used to label products or documents, manage changes, and verify changes.
Configuration Status Accounting This activity doesn't have to do with financials as you
might assume from its title. It's about accounting for the status of the changes by docu-
menting and storing the configuration information needed to effectively manage the prod-
uct information. This includes the approved configuration identification, the status of
proposed changes, and the status of changes currently being implemented.
Configuration Verification and Auditing Verification and audits are performed to
determine whether the configuration item is accurate and correct and to make sure the
performance requirements have been met. It ensures that changes are registered in the con-
figuration management system and that they are assessed, approved, tracked, and imple-
mented correctly.


Change Control System
If you were to allow changes to occur to the project whenever requested, you would prob-
ably never complete the project. Stakeholders, the customer, and end users would continu-
ally change the project requirements if given the opportunity to do so. That's why careful
planning and scope definition are important in the beginning of the project. It's your job
as project manager to drive out all the compelling needs and requirements of the project
                                  Managing Perform Integrated Change Control                    503




during the Planning process so that important requirements aren't suddenly "remembered"
halfway through the project. However, we're all human, and sometimes things are not
known, weren't thought about, or simply weren't discovered until a certain point during
the project. Stakeholders will probably start thinking in a direction they weren't consider-
ing during the Planning process, and new requirements will come to light. This is where the
change control system comes into play.



exam spotlight

Understand for the exam that configuration management involves identifying the
physical characteristics of the product, service, or result of the project (or its individual
components); controlling changes to those characteristics; and documenting changes
to verify that requirements are met. It also includes the change management system
and documents the process for requesting, tracking, and determining whether change
requests should be approved or denied.




The Purpose of the Change Control System
Change control systems are documented procedures that describe how the deliverables of
the project and associated project documentation are controlled, changed, and approved.
They also often describe how to submit change requests and how to manage change
requests. They may include preprinted change request forms that provide a place to record
general project information, such as the name and project number, the date, and the details
regarding the change request. Change control systems are usually subsystems of the con-
figuration management system.
   The change control system also tracks the status of change requests, including their
approval status. Not all change requests will receive approval. Those changes that are not
approved are also tracked, communicated to the appropriate stakeholders, and fi led in the
change control log for future reference.
   The change control system might defi ne the level of authority needed to approve
changes, if it wasn't previously defi ned in the configuration management system. Some
change requests could receive approval based on the project manager's decision; others
might need to be reviewed and formally approved by the project sponsor, executive man-
agement, and so on.


                  The change control system is a subset of the project management system.
                  It includes the processes for identifying the characteristics of the product,
                  service, or result and includes the process for documenting, tracking, and
                  approving changes.
504         Chapter 10      Measuring and Controlling Project Performance



   Procedures that detail how emergency changes are approved should be defined as well.
For example, you and your team might be putting in some weekend hours and be close
to the completion of a deliverable when you discover that thing 1 will not talk to thing 2
no matter what you do. The team brainstorms and comes up with a brilliant solution that
requires a change request. Do you stop work right then and wait until the change control
board or committee can meet sometime next week and make a decision, or do you--the
project manager--make the decision to go forward with this solution and explain the
change to the appropriate parties later? That answer depends on the change procedures you
have in place to handle situations like this and on the authority you have to make emer-
gency changes as outlined in the change control system.
   Many organizations have formal change control or change request systems in place. If
that's the case, you can easily adopt those procedures and use the existing system to man-
age project change. But if no procedures exist, you'll have to define them.
   There are three objectives you should know about for implementing and using configura-
tion management systems and change control processes:
      Establish a method to consistently identify changes, request changes to project base-
      lines, and analyze and determine the value and effectiveness of the changes.
      Continuously authenticate and improve project performance by evaluating the impact
      of each change.
      Communicate all change requests--whether approved, rejected, or delayed--to all the
      stakeholders.




But I Thought You Said...

Marcus was working on a web redesign project for a division of the marketing department
in his organization. The project started out as a simple redesign of the look and feel of the
site. Marcus made the mistake of not defining change control procedures for the project
from the beginning because he reasoned that the project was small, the design changes
were well understood by all, and the project could be finished in a matter of weeks.

After the work of the project started, Marcus's team showed the initial design results to
the business lead, Kendra. Kendra asked for a few modifications that seemed minor, and
Marcus was happy to accommodate. When his team finished the work and turned the site
over for initial testing, Kendra created a list of changes that extended beyond the initial
scope of the project. Marcus thought everyone had agreed that the project involved only
an update to the look and feel of the site, but Kendra was requesting changes to the appli-
cations people used to order products from the website. Marcus knew that application
changes need their own set of requirements and testing. Changing the look of the site was
a lot different from changing the way an application worked and the results it produced.
Kendra and Marcus were in disagreement over what the changes entailed. Kendra thought
                                 Managing Perform Integrated Change Control                 505




she had carte blanche to make changes until she was satisfied with the project. Marcus
knew that the projects waiting in the queue were going to suffer because of the never-
ending stream of changes to Kendra's project. The additional time her project was taking
already had pushed the deliverable of the next project on their list by two weeks.

To resolve the dilemma, Marcus had to negotiate with Kendra on the list of changes she
had requested. He agreed to all changes that required less than four hours to complete,
and the remaining changes were moved to a new project request. Marcus also vowed to
implement change control procedures for all projects from this point forward, no matter
what the size or complexity of the project.




Requirements for Change
You should require two things regarding change for all projects. First, require that all
change requests be submitted in writing. This is to clarify the change and make sure there's
no confusion about what's requested. It also allows the project team to accurately estimate
the time it will take to incorporate the change.
    Second, require that all change requests go through the formal change control system.
Make sure no one is allowed to go directly to team members and request changes without
the project manager knowing about them. Also make certain your stakeholders understand
that going around the project manager can cause schedule delays, cost overruns, and sacri-
fices to quality and that it isn't good change management practice. From the beginning of
the project, encourage the stakeholders to use the formal procedures laid out in the change
control system to request changes.


                 It's good practice to require all change requests in writing. This should be
                 a documented procedure outlined in your change control system. Beware!
                 Stakeholders are notorious for asking for changes verbally even when
                 there is a detailed process in place. If they don't want to follow the process,
                 someone on the project team should have responsibility for documenting
                 and logging the change requests for future reference.



Change Control Board
In some organizations, a change control board (CCB) is established to review all change
requests. The board is officially chartered and given the authority to approve or deny
change requests as defi ned by the organization. It's important that its authority be clearly
defi ned and that separate procedures exist for emergency changes. The CCB might meet
only once a week, once every other week, or even once a month, depending on the project.
When emergencies arise, the established procedures allow the project manager to imple-
ment the change on the spot. This always requires follow-up with the CCB and completion
of a formal change request, even though it's after the fact.
506         Chapter 10      Measuring and Controlling Project Performance



   CCB members might include stakeholders, managers, project team members, and others
who might not have any connection to the project at hand. Some organizations have per-
manent CCBs that are staffed by full-time employees dedicated to managing change for the
entire organization, not just project change. You might want to consider establishing a CCB
for your project if the organization does not have one.



Exam Spotlight

For purposes of the exam, note that the PMBOK (R) Guide states that the CCB is made up of
a group of stakeholders who review and then approve, delay, or reject change requests.



   Some organizations use other types of review boards that have the same responsibilities
as the CCB. Some other names you might see are technical assessment board (TAB),
technical review board (TRB), engineering review board (ERB), and configuration control
board (CCB).


Perform Integrated Change Control Inputs, Tools and
Techniques, and Outputs
The inputs for the Perform Integrated Change Control process are as follows:
      Project management plan (change management plan, configuration management plan,
      scope baseline, schedule baseline, cost baseline)
      Project documents (basis of estimates, requirements traceability matrix, risk report)
      Work performance reports
      Change requests
      Enterprise environmental factors
      Organizational process assets
   Remember that the project management plan includes all the documents that make up
that plan. According to the PMBOK(R) Guide, the documents in the project management
plan include at least the following:
      Scope management plan
      Requirements management plan
      Schedule management plan
      Cost management plan
      Quality management plan
      Resource management plan
      Communications management plan
                                 Managing Perform Integrated Change Control                507



    Risk management plan
    Procurement management plan
    Stakeholder engagement plan
   As a reminder, the project baselines include at least the following:
    Schedule baseline
    Cost baseline
    Scope baseline



Pop Quiz

Do you remember what documents comprise the scope baseline? Turn back to Chapter 3,
"Developing the Project Scope Statement," if you need a refresher.



   The tools and techniques for Perform Integrated Change Control include the following:
    Expert judgment
    Change control tools
    Data analysis (alternatives analysis, cost-benefit analysis)
    Decision making (voting, multicriteria decision analysis)
    Meetings
   Change control tools may include manual processes or software systems that assist in
managing this process. They will track and record the change requests, record the decisions
by the change control board, and help manage the distribution of the change request deci-
sions and more. The configuration tools I mentioned earlier, configuration item descrip-
tion, configuration status accounting, and configuration item verification, are all considered
change control tools. They help support identifying and documenting changes, tracking
changes, and making decisions regarding the disposition of the change.
   The outputs of the Perform Integrated Change Control process are as follows:
    Approved change requests
    Project management plan updates (any component)
    Project documents updates (change log)
    Approved change requests are implemented during the Direct and Manage Project Work
process. They are documented in the change log along with other items such as costs, risks
associated with the changes, the timing of the change requests, and more. Project manage-
ment plan updates are typically required as a result of an approved change or corrective
action, especially those changes that impact a project baseline. It may sound obvious, but
I'll tell you anyway: Changes made to baselines should reflect changes from the current
508        Chapter 10      Measuring and Controlling Project Performance



point in time forward. You cannot change past performance. These changes are noted in
the change control system or the configuration management system, and stakeholders are
informed at the status meetings of the changes that have occurred, their impacts, and where
the description of the changes can be found.
   You should document all the actions taken in the Perform Integrated Change Control
process (whether implemented or not) as part of the project documents updates output.
You should also record the reason for the change request. In other words, how did this
particular change request come about? How did it change the original project management
plan? Is this something you could or should have known about in the Planning processes?
You should also note the corrective action taken and the justification for choosing that par-
ticular corrective action as part of lessons learned. You can use the information you cap-
ture here in your configuration management system as lessons learned for future projects.
When you take on a new project, it's a good idea to review the lessons learned from similar
projects so that you can plan appropriately and avoid, where possible, the variances that
occurred in those projects.



Exam Spotlight

Remember that approved change requests are an output of the Perform Integrated
Change Control process but that they are implemented in the Direct and Manage Project
Work process (an Executing process).



  In the next chapter, you'll explore the individual change control processes (like Control
Costs and Control Schedule) and the measurement tools you'll use to provide the vari-
ance measurements that are gathered and reported to the stakeholder via the Monitor
Communications process that we discussed earlier in this chapter.



Monitoring Stakeholder Engagement
The purpose of the Monitor Stakeholder Engagement process is to monitor your stake-
holder relationships and ensure the stakeholders' continued engagement in the project. It's
easy for stakeholders to become distracted on long projects. As more time goes by, the cur-
rent project fades in importance and other issues can take their place. Keeping stakeholders
engaged will help overall project success, it will help you efficiently manage the processes as
the project progresses, and it will help your stakeholders stay up-to-date on issues and sta-
tus as the project evolves so they can make informed decisions.
   You have seen all of the inputs, tools and techniques, and outputs of this process before.
For your reference they are listed next.
                                           Monitoring Stakeholder Engagement               509




   The inputs to the Monitor Stakeholder Engagement process are as follows:
    Project management plan (resource management plan, communications management
    plan, stakeholder engagement plan)
    Project documents (issue log, lessons learned register, project communications, risk
    register, stakeholder register)
    Work performance data
    Enterprise environmental factors
    Organizational process assets
   This process has the following tools and techniques:
    Data analysis (alternatives analysis, root cause analysis, stakeholder analysis)
    Decision making (multicriteria decision analysis, voting)
    Data representation (stakeholder engagement assessment matrix)
    Communication skills (feedback, presentations)
    Interpersonal and team skills (active listening, cultural awareness, leadership, network-
    ing, political awareness)
    Meetings
   The outputs of this process are as follows:
    Work performance information
    Change requests
    Project management plan updates (resource management plan, communications man-
    agement plan, stakeholder engagement plan)
    Project documents updates (issue log, lessons learned register, risk register, stakeholder
    register)




Project Case Study: New Kitchen Heaven Retail Store

Your regularly scheduled status meeting is in progress. Let's see how it's progressing.

Your next agenda item is an update on change requests. Ricardo submitted a change
request regarding the hardware installation at the new store site. A new, much antici-
pated operating system was just released, and Ricardo has plans to upgrade the
entire company to the new operating system. Since he must purchase new equipment
for this store anyway, he contends that it makes sense to go ahead and purchase the
hardware with the newest operating system already loaded. His staff won't have to
upgrade this store as part of the upgrade project because the store will already have
the new operating system.
510         Chapter 10      Measuring and Controlling Project Performance




Ricardo's change request was submitted in writing through the change control system. A
CCB was set up during the Planning stages of this project to handle change requests. At
the CCB meeting, the following questions come up regarding Ricardo's request: Has the
new operating system been tested with the existing system? Are there compatibility prob-
lems? If so, what risks are associated with getting the problems resolved and the equip-
ment installed by opening day? Is the vendor ready to ship the new operating system?

The CCB defers their decision for this request until Ricardo answers these questions.

During the next CCB meeting, the board reviews a change request from Jill. The gourmet
food supplier she used went out of business, and Jill contracted with a new vendor. She
received a sample shipment from the new vendor and was very unhappy with the results.
Upon inspecting the products, she found broken containers and damaged packaging.
Meanwhile, Jill found another vendor, who has sent her a sample shipment. She is very
pleased with the new vendor's products and service. However, this vendor's prices are
even higher than the first replacement vendor with whom she contracted. Jill submitted a
cost change request to the CCB because of the increased cost of the gourmet food prod-
uct shipment. The change in cost does not have a significant impact on the budget.

Jake reported that payments have been made to the vendor supplying the store's display
cases and shelving and also gave an update on the vendor supplying the lighting for the store.
Both vendors met or exceeded performance requirements and he's happy with their service.

You hold a seat on the CCB and are aware of the change requests and their impacts on
the project. Ricardo satisfactorily answered all the questions the CCB had, so his request
and Jill's request were both approved during the meeting.

You inform the group that you will be setting up some one-on-one meetings with each of
the key stakeholders to check in with them on how the project is progressing from their
viewpoint and to listen to their input and/or any issues they may have.

"Now I'd like to give a brief update on the project forecast," you tell the group. "Based
on the preliminary data I've gathered, we are somewhat behind schedule but budget
appears to be on track. I will have some forecast numbers for you at the next meeting."

Understanding How This Applies to
Your Next Project
I've learned from experience the value of having a change control process in place for all
projects. I've never managed a project that didn't encounter change--and there are hun-
dreds of reasons that bring about change. One of the ways to help reduce the amount of
change you might experience is to make certain you've documented the requirements of the
project accurately and have obtained sign-off from the stakeholders. Beware! Just because
the stakeholders have agreed to the requirements doesn't mean they won't want change. As
you elaborate the deliverables and requirements, the product or end result becomes clearer,
and that means some elements not previously known or at least not known in their entirety
early in the planning process will require change.
   If you don't already have a change control process in place, I recommend setting one up
before you begin your next project. Document the procedures for requesting, tracking, and
approving or denying changes. Make change control procedures one of the agenda items
for discussion at your project kickoff meeting. It's easier to enforce change procedures (and
deny changes that are out of scope) if the process is discussed with the stakeholders early
in the project. You will likely want to include important stakeholders on the change con-
trol board, and that will give you another great opportunity to discuss and reinforce the
process.
   Administering contracts and procurements, as I mentioned earlier, may be managed
by someone in your procurement department. In my experience, there is always someone
512        Chapter 10      Measuring and Controlling Project Performance



from this department involved from the request process through contract administration.
However, it will likely be up to you to monitor vendor performance, make sure deliverable
dates are met, and verify time cards against the submitted invoice.
   Keeping your stakeholders engaged throughout the entire project is key to its success.
Don't let stakeholder interests drift. Make an effort to reach out to them and meet with
them on a regular basis. Your enthusiasm for the project is contagious and will keep the
stakeholders engaged.



Summary
This chapter examined several change control processes, starting with the Monitor and
Control Project Work process. This process is responsible for reviewing, tracking, and con-
trolling project progress. It ensures that the performance objectives outlined in the project
management plan are met.
    The Control Procurements process is concerned with managing vendor relationships,
monitoring performance, and implementing changes or corrections when necessary. Both
buyer and seller are responsible for administering the contract (or other procurement vehi-
cle) to ensure that contractual obligations are being met.
    The Monitor Communications process involves monitoring and measuring project per-
formance to identify variances from the project management plan. This process monitors
and controls communications throughout the life of the project.
    Perform Integrated Change Control is an important part of the project process. It's
your responsibility as project manager to manage change and implement corrective action
where needed to keep the project on track with the plan. Perform Integrated Change
Control concerns influencing the things that cause change and managing the change once
it has occurred. One or more of the project baselines may be affected when change occurs.
Managing change might involve changes to the project plan, the project schedule, the proj-
ect budget, project scope, and so on. Changes that impact processes you've already com-
pleted require updates to those processes. Corrective action is often a result of a change and
ensures that the future performance of the project lines up with the project management
plan.
    Configuration management systems typically include change control systems that docu-
ment the procedures to manage change and how change requests are implemented. Change
requests might come in written or verbal forms, but ideally you should ask for all your
change requests in writing. Change requests are processed through a formal change control
system, and configuration control boards have the authority to approve or deny change
requests.
    Monitor Stakeholder Engagement concerns monitoring your relationships with the
stakeholders and keeping them engaged throughout the project.

                             You've almost made it to the homestretch. This chapter
                             covers the last group of project management processes in
                             the Monitoring and Controlling process group. A significant
amount of information is packed into this chapter, and I recommend you memorize all the
formulas presented here for the exam.
   I'll cover the Monitor Risks, Control Costs, Control Schedule, Control Quality, Validate
Scope, Control Scope, and Control Resources processes in this chapter.
   The Monitor Risks process monitors the project for risks and monitors the risk response
plans that have been or might need to be put into action. The Control Costs and Control
Schedule processes are similar to Perform Integrated Change Control, which we discussed
in the previous chapter. When you're reading these sections, remember that the information
from the Perform Integrated Change Control process applies to these areas as well.
   The Control Quality process involves several new tools and techniques that might
show up on the exam. Take some time to understand these tools and techniques and know
how to differentiate them from the tools and techniques associated with the Plan Quality
Management and Manage Quality processes.
   The Validate Scope process involves validating and accepting work results. Control
Scope is like the change control processes I discussed in Chapter 10, "Measuring and
Controlling Project Performance," and is concerned with controlling changes to project
scope.
   Making certain the right physical resources are available at the time they are needed is
the focus of the Control Resources process.


                 The process names, inputs, tools and techniques, outputs, and
                 descriptions of the project management process groups and related
                 materials and figures in this chapter are based on content from A Guide
                 to the Project Management Body of Knowledge (PMBOK (R) Guide),
                 Sixth Edition (PMI(R), 2017).




Monitoring and Controlling Risk
The Monitor Risks process involves tracking and monitoring identified risks, monitoring
implemented risk response plans to make certain they are effective, ensuring the overall
risk management approach is still valid, and identifying and responding to new risks as
they occur. You will examine performance information and use the tools and techniques
522         Chapter 11      Controlling Work Results



of this process to analyze and implement other functions of this process, including the
following:
      Ensuring that risk response plans and contingency plans that are put into action are
      appropriate and effective
      Determining if overall project risk has changed
      Reexamining existing risks to determine if they have changed or should be closed out
      Monitoring for new individual risks
      Evaluating the overall appropriateness of the risk management approach
      Reassessing project assumptions and determining validity
      Ensuring that risk management policies and procedures are followed
      Ensuring that contingency reserves (for schedule and cost) are updated according to the
      updated risk assessment
      Ensuring the overall project strategy is valid
   Monitor Risks is a busy process. During the course of the project, risk responses, which
were developed during the Planning process group and implemented in the Executing pro-
cess group, are still effective and have reduced or averted the impact of risk events (or you
hope they did).


                   Implement Risk Responses and Monitor Risks go hand in hand, but
                   they each have their distinct function. Implement Risk Responses is per-
                   formed by the risk owners (who are responsible for monitoring risks to
                   determine if response plans are needed). Risk owners put the response
                   plan into action in this process. Monitor Risks monitors the response
                   plans for effectiveness along with the all of the other functions listed
                   earlier in this section.


Monitor Risks Inputs
This process has four inputs:
      Project management plan (risk management plan)
      Project documents (issue log, lessons learned register, risk register, risk report)
      Work performance data
      Work performance reports
   You'll recall that the risk register tracks and ranks individual risks, identifies the risk
owner, describes risk triggers and residual risks, and lists the response plans and strategies
you should implement if an actual risk event occurs. Keep in mind that some risk events
identified in risk planning will happen and some will not. You will have to stay alert for
risk event occurrences and be prepared to respond to them when they do occur. This means
                                                Monitoring and Controlling Risk             523




you should monitor the risk register regularly. Work performance data includes information
that may help you determine that a new risk event is about to occur, or it may assist you in
monitoring previously identified risks. Remember that this entails elements such as the sta-
tus of deliverables, costs to date, cost changes, schedule progress to date, schedule changes,
and scope changes. Work performance reports (often in the form of a status report) is where
you take this information and use variance analysis, forecasting, and earned value analysis
to produce results (that are reported in the status report) that help aid in decision making,
implementing risk responses, and taking corrective actions. This information should also be
examined from the perspective of risks that might need close monitoring or response plans
that could require changes to coincide with the data in the work performance reports.
   Additional risk response planning might be needed to deal with the new risks or with
expected risks whose impact might be greater than expected. This might require repeating
the Plan Risk Responses process to create new contingency plans or alternative plans to
deal with the risk, or it might require modification to existing plans.


Monitor Risks Tools and Techniques
The tools and techniques of Monitor Risks are used to monitor risks throughout the life of
the project. You should perform periodic reviews, audits, and new earned value analyses to
check the pulse of risk activity and to make certain risk management is enacted effectively.
   The tools and techniques of this process are as follows:
    Data analysis (technical performance analysis, reserve analysis)
    Audits
    Meetings
   We'll look at each of these next.

Data Analysis--Technical Performance Analysis
The technical performance analysis tool and technique compares the technical accom-
plishments of the project objectives completed during the Executing and Monitoring
and Controlling processes to the technical objectives defined in the project management
Planning processes. Variances might indicate that a project risk is looming, and you'll want
to analyze and prepare a response to it if appropriate. For example, a technical objective
for a new computer software project might require that the forms printed from a particular
module include a barcode at the bottom of the page. If the barcode functionality does not
work once the module is coded, a technical deviation exists, which means you should reex-
amine project risks. In this particular example, project scope is likely at risk. Any techni-
cal performance measurement or objective that was defined in the Planning process group
should be examined here.

Data Analysis--Reserve Analysis
You'll recall that contingency reserves hold project funds, time, or resources in reserve
to offset any unavoidable threats or opportunities that might impact the project scope,
524        Chapter 11      Controlling Work Results



schedule, budget, or quality. This tool and technique examines the remaining reserves
and compares this to the remaining risks to ensure there are enough reserves to cover any
potential risks that may occur from now through the end of the project.

Risk Audits
Risk audits are carried out during the entire life of the project by risk auditors. Risk audi-
tors are not typically project team members and are expertly trained in audit techniques
and risk assessment. Risk audits are specifically interested in examining the risk manage-
ment process. Risk audits also evaluate the implementation of response plans and their
effectiveness at dealing with risks and their root causes. According to the PMBOK (R) Guide,
the project manager is responsible for making certain audits are performed throughout the
project as appropriate and/or according to plan.

Meetings
Periodic, scheduled risk reviews of identified risks, risk responses, and risk priorities should
occur during the project. The idea here is to monitor risks and their status and determine
whether their consequences still have the same impact on the project objectives as when
they were originally planned. If the risk is no longer viable, it should be closed. Every status
meeting should have a time set aside to discuss and review risks and response plans, and
risk review meetings should be scheduled periodically for the sole purpose of reviewing risk
responses.
   Risk identification and monitoring is an ongoing process throughout the life of the
project. Risks can change, and previously identified risks might have greater impacts than
originally thought as more facts are discovered. Reassessment of risks should be a regular
activity performed by everyone involved on the project. Monitor the risk register (includ-
ing those risks that have low scores) and risk triggers. You should also monitor the risk
responses that have been implemented for their effectiveness in dealing with risk. You
might have to revisit the Perform Qualitative and Perform Quantitative Risk Analysis pro-
cesses when new risk consequences are discovered or risk impacts are found to be greater
than what was originally planned.


Monitor Risks Outputs
Monitor Risks should occur throughout the life of the project. Identified risks are moni-
tored and plans are reexamined to determine whether they will adequately resolve the risk
as it approaches during this process. Several outputs might come about as a result of moni-
toring risks:
      Work performance information
      Change requests
      Project management plan updates (any component)
                                                  Monitoring and Controlling Risk             525



    Project documents updates (assumption log, issue log, lessons learned register, risk
    register, risk report)
    Organizational process assets updates
   I've discussed these outputs before, so I'll just bring to your attention the new points you
need to know here about change requests and project documents updates.

Work Performance Information
This is updated to include how the project risk management approach and performance
compares against the planning processes where you identified anticipated risks, docu-
mented their expected outcomes, and documented response plans. In other words, did you
do a good job of identifying risks, did their impacts manifest as you expected, and were the
response plans effective in reducing threats or gaining opportunities?

Change Requests
Change requests must be processed through the Perform Integrated Change Control pro-
cess. You might fi nd that change requests take the form of corrective actions or preventive
actions and that implementing a contingency plan or a workaround may bring about the
need for a change request. A workaround is an unplanned response to a negative risk event.
It attempts to deal with the risk in a productive, efficient manner. If no risk response plan
exists (this might be the case when you accept a risk event during the Planning processes) or
an unplanned risk occurs, workarounds are implemented to deal with the consequences of
the risk.

Project Documents Updates
Some of the project documents that may require updating include the assumption log,
issue log, lessons learned register, the risk register, and the risk report. The risk register is
updated with new risks, with updated risk response plans, and identifying risks that are no
longer relevant or have been closed out.
   The risk report is updated with the status of current individual risks and the up-to-
date level of overall project risk. It may also include the results of the risk events that have
occurred, the effectiveness of the risk response plans, and updates regarding risk owners.
The risk report should be updated when a risk audit or risk reassessment concludes that
some element of the original risk information has changed--for example, the impact
or probability scores are updated to reflect new conditions, the priority of the risk has
changed, the owner of the risk has changed, or the response plan has been updated.


                  According to the PMBOK (R) Guide, this process is performed throughout the
                  life of the project and ensures that stakeholders understand and are aware
                  of the up-to-date risk exposure, and that the work of the project is continu-
                  ally monitored to identify new risks, to review existing risks and determine
                  if they've changed, and to identify risks that are no longer relevant.
526         Chapter 11      Controlling Work Results




Controlling Cost Changes
The Control Costs process monitors the project budget and manages changes to the cost
baseline. It's concerned with monitoring project costs to prevent unauthorized or incorrect
costs from being included in the cost baseline. This means you'll also use Control Costs
to ensure that the project budget isn't exceeded (resulting in cost overruns). If a change
is implemented, you'll have to make certain the budget for the changed item stays within
acceptable limits. All budget changes should be agreed to and approved by the project
sponsor where applicable (the criteria for approvals should be outlined in the change con-
trol system documentation). Increases to the authorized budget should be submitted as
change requests and approved through the Perform Integrated Change Control process.
Stakeholders should be made aware of all budget changes.
    The following list includes some of the activities you'll be involved in during this
process:
      Monitoring changes to costs or the cost baseline and understanding variances from the
      baseline
      Monitoring change requests that affect cost and resolving them in a timely manner
      Informing stakeholders of approved changes and their costs
      Ensuring that the project budget does not exceed acceptable limits by taking action
      when overruns are imminent
      Ensuring that the project budget does not exceed the total funding authorized for the
      project or for the project phase


Control Costs Inputs
The Control Costs process includes the following inputs:
      Project management plan (cost management plan, cost baseline, performance measure-
      ment baseline)
      Project documents (lessons learned register)
      Project funding requirements
      Work performance data
      Organizational process assets
   These inputs are examined using the tools and techniques of this process to determine
whether revised cost estimates or budget updates are required. One thing you should note
regarding the project management plan input is that it includes the cost baseline and the
cost management plan. You'll use the cost baseline to compare actual expenditures to date
on the project to the baseline. The cost management plan details how costs should be moni-
tored and controlled throughout the life of the project. I've covered each of these inputs in
previous chapters.
                                                      Controlling Cost Changes               527




Control Costs Tools and Techniques
The tools and techniques of the Control Costs process are as follows:
    Expert judgment
    Data analysis (earned value analysis [EVA], variance analysis, trend analysis, reserve
    analysis)
    To-complete performance index (TCPI)
    Project management information system
   We'll look at each of these next, with the exception of PMIS. This tool and technique
has been discussed previously, but you should know that in this process it can help auto-
mate and calculate the formulas we're going to examine next. It can also display the results
in graphical form for status reporting purposes.

Data Analysis--Earned Value Analysis
Earned value analysis (EVA) is an analysis technique that compares the actual schedule and
cost to the performance measurement baseline. You can accomplish performance measure-
ment analysis using a technique called earned value management (EVM). Simply stated,
EVM compares what you've received or produced to what you've spent. The EVM continu-
ously monitors the planned value, earned value, and actual costs expended to produce the
work of the project (I'll cover the defi nition of these terms shortly). When variances that
result in cost changes are discovered (including schedule variances and cost variances),
those changes are managed using the project change control system. The primary function
of this analysis technique is to determine and document the cause of the variance, to deter-
mine the impact of the variance, and to determine whether a corrective action should be
implemented as a result. We'll walk through various examples that illustrate how to deter-
mine these variances later in this chapter.
   EVM looks at schedule, cost, and scope baselines and compares them to the actual work
completed to date. You may recall that the schedule, cost, and scope baselines together
make up the performance measurement baseline (PMB). PMB performance is determined
using EVM and will be used throughout the project to measure the progress and perfor-
mance of the project. Remember that it does not include management reserves but it does
include contingencies.
   EVM is the most often used performance measurement method. EVM is performed on
the work packages and the control accounts of the WBS. To perform the EVM calculations,
you need to fi rst gather the three measurements mentioned earlier: the planned value (PV),
actual cost (AC), and earned value (EV).


                 If you do any research on your own regarding these values, you might
                 come across acronyms that are different from what you see here. I've
                 included their alternative names and acronyms at the end of each descrip-
                 tion. I recommend you memorize planned value (PV), actual cost (AC), and
                 earned value (EV) and make certain you understand the meaning of each
                 before you continue.
528         Chapter 11      Controlling Work Results



   Let's take a look at some definitions of these key measurements before diving into the
actual calculations:
Planned Value The planned value (PV) is the cost of work that has been authorized and
budgeted for a schedule activity or WBS component during a given time period or phase.
These budgets are established during the Planning processes. For any given day, PV equals
the planned cost of work that is scheduled to be completed on that day, whether or not the
work is actually completed. PV is also called budgeted cost of work scheduled (BCWS).



Exam Spotlight

Remember to read exam questions carefully. PV might mean present value (as I talked
about in Chapter 2, "Creating the Project Charter") or planned value, as defined here.


Actual Cost Actual cost (AC) is the actual cost of completing the work component in a
given time period. Actual costs might include direct and indirect costs but must correspond
to what was budgeted for the activity. If the budgeted amount did not include indirect
costs, do not include them here. Later you'll see how to compare this to EV to come up with
variance calculation results. Actual costs include whatever is spent to complete the work
regardless of what was budgeted. AC is also called actual cost of work performed (ACWP).
Earned Value Earned value (EV) is the value of the work completed to date as it com-
pares to the authorized budgeted amount assigned to the work component. EV is typically
expressed as a percentage of the work completed compared to the budget. For example, if
our budgeted amount is $1,000 and we have completed 30 percent of the work so far, our
EV is $300. Therefore, EV cannot exceed the PV budget for the activity. EV is also called
budgeted cost of work performed (BCWP).



Exam Spotlight

PV, AC, and EV are easy to mix up. In their simplest forms, here's what each means:

      PV--The approved budget assigned to the work to be completed during a given
      time period
      AC--Money that's actually been expended during a given time period for
      completed work
      EV--The value of the work completed to date compared to the budget


  According to the earlier definition, EV is the sum of the cumulative budgeted costs for
completed work for all activities that have been accomplished as of the measurement date.
For example, if your total budget is $1,000 and 50 percent of the work has been completed
                                                             Controlling Cost Changes     529




as of the measurement date, your EV would equal $500. You can plot all the PV, AC, and
EV measurements graphically to show the variances between them. If there are no vari-
ances in the measurements, all the lines on the graph remain the same, which means the
project is progressing as planned. Figure 11.1 shows an example that plots these three
measurements.

   All of these measurements include a cost component. Costs are displayed in an S curve
because spending is minimal in the beginning of the project, picks up steam toward the
middle, and then tapers off at the end of the project. This means your earned value mea-
surements will also take on the S curve shape.
   Now you can calculate whether the project is progressing as planned or if variances exist
in the approved baseline by using a variety of formulas discussed in the following sections.
Use Figure 11.1 as your example for the formulas that follow. The Figure 11.1 totals are as
follows:
                                PV = 400, EV = 375, AC = 325

Data Analysis--Variance Analysis
Variance analysis in the Control Costs process examines the difference between the base-
line cost or baseline schedule as they compare to actual performance, and/or the variance
at completion of the project. Variances in this process are usually due to cost or schedule
impacts, making cost and schedule the most commonly analyzed variances.
   Cost variances are determined by subtracting AC from EV:
                                       CV = EV - AC
   If the cost variance is positive, your costs are under what was planned and you are doing
better than expected. If they are negative, you are over what was planned.

      Schedule variances are determined by subtracting PV from EV:
                                          SV = EV - PV
   If the schedule variance is positive, you are ahead of schedule; if it is negative, you are
behind schedule.
   Variance at completion (VAC) calculates the difference between the budget at comple-
tion and the estimate at completion. It looks like this:
                                        VAC = BAC - EAC
   If the result is a negative number, it means you're not doing as well with costs as you
anticipated and that variance exists. If the result is positive, your costs are better than you
planned. Assuming your project performance is improving, variances will become smaller
as the project progresses.

Cost Variance
Cost variance is one of the most popular variances that project managers use. It's the dif-
ference between EV (where you are at this point) and AC (what you've spent). In other
words, it tells you whether your actual costs are higher than expected (with a resulting
negative number) or lower than expected (with a resulting positive number) at a certain
point in time. It measures the actual performance to date (or during the period) against
what's been spent.
   The cost variance (CV) is calculated as follows:
                                          CV = EV - AC
      Let's calculate the CV using the numbers from Figure 11.1:
                                          375 - 325 = 50
   The CV is positive, which means you're spending less than what you planned for the
work that you have completed as of July 1 (which Figure 11.1 shows because AC is less
than EV).
   If you come up with a negative number as the answer to this formula, it means that costs
are higher than what you had planned for the work that was completed as of July 1 and
these costs are usually not recoverable.

Schedule Variance
Schedule variance, another popular variance, tells you whether the schedule is ahead of or
behind what was planned for this period. It's the difference between where you are at this
point (EV) and what was planned for this point (PV). This formula is most helpful when
you've used the critical path methodology to build the project schedule. The schedule
variance (SV) is calculated as follows:
                                          SV = EV - PV
      Let's plug in the numbers:
                                         375 - 400 = -25
                                                          Controlling Cost Changes          531




   The resulting schedule variance is negative, which means you are behind schedule, or
behind where you planned to be as of July 1.
   Together, the CV and SV can be converted to efficiency indicators for the project and
can be used to compare performance of all the projects in a portfolio.

Performance Indexes
Cost and schedule performance indexes are primarily used to calculate performance effi-
ciencies, and they're often used to help predict future project performance.
    The cost performance index (CPI) measures the cost efficiency of the work completed
against actual cost. Generally speaking, it is the most critical of all the EVM measurements
because it tells you the cost efficiency for the work completed to date, or at the completion
of the project. If CPI is greater than 1, you're spending less than anticipated to date. If CPI
is less than 1, you are spending more than anticipated for the work completed and have a
cost overrun on your hands.
    The cost performance index (CPI) is calculated this way:
                                        CPI = EV / AC
   Let's plug in the numbers and see where you stand:
                                       375 / 325 = 1.15
   This means cost performance is better than expected. You get an A+ on this assignment!
   The schedule performance index (SPI) measures the efficiency of the project team to
date in completing work tasks against the progress that was planned. This formula should
be used in conjunction with an analysis of the critical path activities to determine if the
project will finish ahead of or behind schedule. If SPI is greater than 1, you are ahead of
schedule and have completed more work than was planned. If SPI is less than 1, you are
behind schedule and have not completed as much work as you planned to complete by the
measurement date.
   The schedule performance index (SPI) is calculated this way:
                                        SPI = EV / PV
   Again, let's see where you stand with this example:
                                       375 / 400 = 0.94
   Uh-oh, not so good. Schedule performance is not what you expected. Let's not grade
this one.
   There are two more indexes associated with cost and schedule that you should under-
stand for the exam: cumulative CPI and cumulative SPI.
   Cumulative CPI is a commonly used calculation to predict project costs at the comple-
tion of the project. It also represents the cumulative CPI of the project at the point the mea-
surement is taken. First, you need to sum the earned value calculations taken to date, or
cumulative EV, and the actual costs to date, or cumulative AC. The formula looks just like
the CPI formula except that it uses the cumulative sums as follows:
                     Cumulative CPI = cumulative EV / cumulative AC
532        Chapter 11      Controlling Work Results



   The difference between this and the CPI formula earlier is that the CPI formula is used
for a single work period whereas the cumulative CPI is calculated using the sum of all the
costs of every work component for the project. Additionally, you might also use cumulative
CPI to calculate the total cost of a work component such as a deliverable, for example. Let's
say you have a deliverable that has five work packages. You would total the EV and AC at
the measurement date for all five work packages to determine the cost performance index
for the deliverable.
   Cumulative SPI predicts schedule performance at the completion of the project. Like
cumulative CPI, it also represents the cumulative SPI of the project at the point the mea-
surement is taken. The formula is as follows:
                     Cumulative SPI = cumulative EV / cumulative PV

Data Analysis--Trend Analysis
According to the PMBOK (R) Guide, trend analysis determines whether project performance
is improving or worsening over time by periodically analyzing project results. These results
are measured with mathematical formulas that attempt to forecast project outcomes based
on historical information and results. You can use several formulas to predict project
trends, but it's outside the scope of this book to go into all of them. For the exam, you're
expected to understand the concept behind trend analysis, and to know that you can use
charts (such as S curves we discussed earlier) or forecasting to display trends. You can use
the results you've analyzed to predict future project behavior or trends. Let's look at some
of the formulas associated with forecasting next. Forecasting uses the information you've
gathered to date and estimates the future conditions or future performance of the project
based on what you know when the calculation is performed. Forecasts are based on work
performance data (an output from the Executing process group) and your predictions of
future performance.
    The forecasting formulas you'll see later in this section are used to determine an
estimate at completion (EAC) and an estimate to complete (ETC). The EAC estimates (or
forecasts) the expected total cost of a work component, a schedule activity, or the project
at its completion by calculating the actual costs to date and then adding an estimate of
what the remaining work will cost. The ETC is the anticipated cost estimate to finish the
work of the project.
    EAC is most often calculated by using actual costs incurred to date plus a bottom-up
ETC estimate. The formula for the most typical EAC looks like this:
                                EAC = AC + bottom-up ETC
   The bottom-up ETC estimate is usually provided by the members of the project team
who are actually working on the project activities. They provide the project manager
with an estimate of the amount of effort remaining (and, therefore, the cost of the effort)
based on the activities they have completed to date and what they believe will occur in
the future. Their estimates are summed to come up with a total ETC, also known as a
bottom-up ETC.
                                                      Controlling Cost Changes             533




    There are three other EAC forecasting formulas outlined in the PMBOK (R) Guide that
we'll look at next. A new term you'll need to know before we look at these formulas is
budget at completion (BAC). BAC is the total amount of PV (approved budgeted costs) for
all of the work of a work component or all the work of the project. It is the sum of all the
budgets established for all the work in the work package, control account, schedule activity,
or project.


                 You may find that the EAC (estimate at completion) differs from the BAC
                 (budget at completion). This could be due to changes in performance,
                 risks, project changes, or any number of reasons. That means the BAC
                 may no longer be a reasonable estimate given the changes in perfor-
                 mance. When that occurs, use the EAC to project the cost of the project
                 at completion.

   The fi rst EAC formula is called "EAC forecast for ETC work performed at the budgeted
rate." I know that's a mouthful. Here's what you should know. This formula calculates EAC
based on the actual costs to date and the assumption that ETC work will be completed at
the budgeted rate. The formula looks like this:
                                 EAC = AC + (BAC - EV)
  Let's assume your AC to date is $800, BAC is $1,200, and EV is $600. EAC, assuming
ETC work will be completed at the budgeted rate, is as follows:
                             $800 + ($1,200 - $600) = $1,400
   In English, you'll spend $1,400 to complete this work component, assuming the remain-
ing work is performed at the budgeted rate. That is $200 more than what you have bud-
geted because your EV is less than the actual cost to date. I recommend examining the
quality of the work to date. You aren't getting what you're paying for.
   The next EAC formula is called "EAC forecast for ETC work performed at the present
CPI." (I didn't make up these titles!) Here's what you need to know. This forecast assumes
that future performance will be just like the past performance for the project. The formula
looks like this:
                                     EAC = BAC / CPI
   For this example, let's assume that BAC is $2,200 and CPI is 1.2. The formula looks
like this:
                                 $2,200 / 1.2 = $1,833.33
   This result predicts you will spend less than the originally budgeted amount for the
project. In this case, you are getting more work or goods for the dollars you're spending.
Good for you.
534        Chapter 11      Controlling Work Results



   The last formula is called "EAC forecast for ETC work considering both SPI and CPI
factors." This formula assumes two things: there is a negative cost performance to date and
the project schedule dates must be met. The formula looks like this:
                            EAC = AC + [(BAC - EV) / (CPI x SPI)]
  Let's assume AC is $1,000, BAC is $1,500, EV is $900, CPI is 0.97, and SPI is 1.05.
Here's the resulting EAC:
                   $1,000 + [($1,500 - $900) / (0.97 x 1.05)] = $1,589.10
    Based on the assumptions that cost performance to date is negative (AC is higher than
EV) and that we must meet the project schedule date, EAC is $1,589.10. We will have a
slight cost overrun at the end of the project in order to meet the schedule date.



Exam Spotlight

For study purposes, the EAC formula and the three EAC calculations are shown here.
Remember that if you monitor EAC regularly, you'll know if the project is within accept-
able tolerances. The formulas are as follows:

The EAC formula:

                                  EAC = AC + bottom-up ETC

EAC using actual costs to date and assuming ETC uses budgeted rate:

                                    EAC = AC + (BAC - EV)

EAC assuming future performance will behave like past performance:

                                        EAC = BAC / CPI

EAC when cost performance is negative and schedule dates must be met:

                              EAC = AC + [(BAC - EV) / (CPI x SPI)]


   In addition to the bottom-up ETC provided by the project team, there are four other
formulas for calculating ETC that you should be aware of for the exam. They are dis-
cussed next.
   When you believe that the work will continue to proceed as planned, use this formula to
calculate ETC:
                                       ETC = EAC - AC
   When you anticipate significant changes in the work and believe it will not continue as
planned, you need to reestimate ETC from the bottom up. The formula, oddly enough,
looks like this:
                                       ETC = reestimate
                                                        Controlling Cost Changes            535




  When you believe that future cost variances will be similar to the types of variances
you've seen to date, you'll use this formula to calculate ETC:
                                  ETC = (BAC - EV) / CPI
   Assuming your earned value is 725, CPI is 1.12, and BAC is 1,000, plug in the numbers:
                                (1,000 - 725) / 1.12 = 245.54
   Therefore, at the measurement date, you need $245.54 to complete all the remaining
work of this work component (or project if you're using project totals), assuming variances
in the future will be the same as they have been to date. That's a little less than the BAC, so
this is good news.
   When you believe that future cost variances will not be similar to the types of variances
you've seen to date, you'll use this formula to calculate ETC:
                               ETC = (BAC - cumulative EV)
   Now calculate your value:
                                     (1,000 - 725) = 275
   In this case, you need $275 to complete all the remaining work of this work component,
assuming variances in the future are different than they have been to date. In this case,
your project is on track and won't need any measure to correct performance.



Exam Spotlight

For study purposes, the ETC formulas are shown here.

Bottom-up ETC
Manual summation of the costs of the remaining work based on estimates from the proj-
ect team members working on these activities.

ETC when work is anticipated to proceed as planned:

                                       ETC = EAC - AC

ETC when work is not anticipated to proceed as planned:

                                      ETC = Reestimate

ETC when future cost variances will be similar to past variances:

                                    ETC = (BAC - EV) / CPI

ETC when future cost variances are expected to be atypical:

                                ETC = (BAC - cumulative EV)
536          Chapter 11      Controlling Work Results



Data Analysis--Reserve Analysis
Reserve analysis is used to monitor the project's contingency reserves and management
reserves and determine if and when they are needed, how they will be applied, and if there
is a change in the reserve amounts. Additional reserves may be needed in the case of risk
events, risk mitigation, or other unforeseen events. If the reserves are no longer needed, you
can give them up to be used on other projects.

To-Complete Performance Index
To-complete performance index (TCPI) is the projected cost performance the remaining
work of the project must achieve in order to meet the BAC or EAC. It's calculated by divid-
ing the work that's remaining by the funds that are remaining.
   The formula for TCPI when using the BAC is as follows:
                                TCPI = (BAC - EV) / (BAC - AC)
      Assume for this example that BAC is $1,000, EV is $700, and AC is $800.
                             ($1,000 - $700) / ($1,000 - $800) = 1.5
    This means you'll need to reach a CPI rate that's 1.5 times what you've experienced to
date in order to meet the BAC goal. You will have to improve the level of performance in
this scenario in order to bring costs back into alignment with the authorized budget. This
may or may not be possible given other project factors such as risk, schedule, and other per-
formance factors. If the result is less than 1, future work does not have to be performed as
efficiently as past performance.
    When the BAC is no longer attainable, the project manager should calculate a new EAC.
This new estimate becomes the goal you'll work toward once it's approved by management.
The TCPI formula when EAC is the goal you're aiming for is as follows:
                                TCPI = (BAC - EV) / (EAC - AC)
   We'll use the same assumptions we used in the formula earlier and note that EAC is
$1,200. The formula looks like this:
                             ($1,000 - $700) / ($1,200 - $800) = 0.75
    This result means that in order to complete the work within the EAC target, the project
team needs to continue performing at an efficiency of 0.75. However, also remember that
you revised the original BAC and are now using EAC as your estimate to complete, so addi-
tional costs were incurred.
    There is one last thing to note regarding these formulas: if cumulative CPI falls below 1,
all future project work must be performed at the TCPI in order to stay within your autho-
rized project budget (BAC). That may or may not be possible given the risks, resources,
schedule, and other considerations. If it is not possible, you as the project manager should
calculate a new EAC and use this as the new goal.

                  You'll be given some scratch paper when you go into the exam. I recom-
                  mend that you write these formulas down on a piece of your scratch paper
                  right after you start the test but before you start answering questions.
                  Keep your list handy. That way, the formulas are off your mind and you've
                  got them in front of you to reference when you get to the portion of the
                  exam where these questions appear. You might want to use this tip for
                  other items you've memorized as well. If you write them down before you
                  begin, you don't have to jog your memory on every question. If you forget
                  something, leave a blank space where it goes and as soon as you remem-
                  ber it or see a question that reminds you what it is, fill in the blank.


Control Costs Outputs
The Control Costs process has five outputs:
    Work performance information
    Cost forecasts
    Change requests
    Project management plan updates (cost management plan, cost baseline, performance
    measurement baseline)
    Project documents updates (assumption log, basis of estimates, cost estimates, lessons
    learned register, risk register)
   I've discussed all of these outputs before.



Recap of formulas

You have a lot of formulas to memorize. Keep in mind that you'll be given a calculator
when you take the exam, so you don't have to do the math manually. Here are the formu-
las I've covered in this chapter:

Performance Indexes
Cost performance index : CPI = EV / AC

Results > 1 are under planned cost.

Results < 1 are over planned cost.

Cumulative cost performance index : cumulative CPI = cumulative EV / cumulative AC

Results > 1 are under planned cost.

Results < 1 are over planned cost.
538        Chapter 11      Controlling Work Results




Schedule performance index: SPI = EV / PV

Results > 1 are ahead of schedule.

Results < 1 are behind schedule.

Cumulative schedule performance index: cumulative SPI = cumulative EV / cumulative PV

Results > 1 are ahead of schedule.

Results < 1 are behind schedule.

Variance Analysis
Cost variance: CV = EV - AC

Positive results mean the costs are under what was planned.

Negative results mean the costs are over what was planned.

Schedule variance: SV = EV - PV

Positive results mean the schedule is ahead of what was planned.

Negative results mean the schedule is behind what was planned.

Variance at completion: VAC = BAC - EAC

Forecasting
EAC formula: EAC = AC + bottom-up ETC

EAC using actual costs to date and assuming ETC uses budgeted rate:

                                     EAC = AC + (BAC - EV)

EAC assuming future performance will behave like past performance:

                                        EAC = BAC / CPI

EAC when cost performance is negative and schedule dates must be met:

                              EAC = AC + [(BAC - EV) / (CPI x SPI)]

Bottom-up ETC: Summation of the costs of the remaining work based on estimates from
the project team members working on these activities

ETC when work is anticipated to proceed as planned: ETC = EAC - AC

ETC when work is not anticipated to proceed as planned: ETC = reestimate

ETC when future cost variances will be similar to past variances: ETC = (BAC - EV) / CPI

ETC when future cost variances are expected to be atypical: ETC = (BAC - EV)
                                                      Controlling Cost Changes              539




To-Complete Performance Index
TCPI using BAC : TCPI = (BAC - EV) / (BAC - AC)

Results > 1 are more difficult to complete.

Results < 1 are easier to complete.

TCPI using EAC : TCPI = (BAC - EV) / (EAC - AC)

Results > 1 are more difficult to complete.

Results < 1 are easier to complete.




                  Problems with costs come about for many reasons, including incorrect
                  estimating techniques, predetermined or fixed budgets with no flexibility,
                  schedule overruns, inadequate WBS development, and so on. Good proj-
                  ect management planning techniques during the Planning processes might
                  prevent cost problems later in the project. At a minimum, proper planning
                  will reduce the impact of these problems if they do occur.

   Always inform appropriate stakeholders of revised budget or cost estimates and any
changes of significant impact to the project. Keep them updated on changes, status, and
risk conditions during regularly scheduled project meetings.




new accounting system for Mustang enterprises

You are a stakeholder of the New Accounting System project for Mustang Enterprises.
The existing accounting system resides on a mainframe, and some of the programs used
to process data are more than 15 years old. Your company decided to hire a contract soft-
ware services firm to write a thin-client, browser-based version of the accounting system
so that the mainframe programs could be retired. You've also assigned a senior program-
mer to act as the project manager on behalf of your organization.

The project is in the Monitoring and Controlling process group, and the project manager
keeps reporting that everything is okay and on schedule. When you asked him detailed
questions and requested performance data, the project manager patted you on the back
and said, "Don't worry, I've got everything under control."

You are a little worried because some of the key project team members have come to you
confidentially to inform you of the progress of the project.
540        Chapter 11      Controlling Work Results




After further investigation, you discover that the project manager changed the database
from SQL to Oracle midway through the project and didn't tell anyone except the proj-
ect team. The project scope stated specifically that project development required a SQL
database. The change in database products changed the project scope and product scope
without letting the stakeholders know.

This change has caused schedule delays because the project team members have told
you they need to be trained to use the new database development tools before they can
proceed. Additionally, many of the programs have already been written to interface with
SQL, not Oracle, and will have to be modified. To add insult to injury, the database switch
will impact the project budget in two ways. First, purchasing the Oracle database involves
substantially more money than purchasing the SQL database, and it requires the pur-
chase of new development tools for the programming team. Second, several members of
the programming staff will have to attend multiple training sessions on the new database
product to fully integrate the programs and system. Training is currently running $2,200
per session per person.

Because you're a key stakeholder, you decide to bring this information out into the open
at the next project status meeting. Additionally, you plan to meet with the project spon-
sor and the procurement department to determine what alternatives you have to request
that the contracting firm realign the project to meet the original contractual requirements.
However, you fear that because the project manager is the one who gave the orders to
change the database, your organization might not have a lot of recourse. You will also
make the project sponsor aware that the project manager doesn't have the skills needed
to conduct this project and a new project manager should be hired as soon as possible.
The project manager is invaluable to the organization as a programmer, but he doesn't
have the project management experience needed to conduct a project of this size and
complexity. This might cause further setback to the project, but the project management
plan and project schedule will require updates anyway as a result of the existing project
manager's decisions. You also determine to document all that has happened as a lesson
learned and to set up a change control process to prevent this from happening in the
future.




Monitoring and Controlling
Schedule Changes
The Control Schedule process involves determining the status of the project schedule, deter-
mining whether changes have occurred or should occur, taking corrective or preventive
action when needed, and influencing and managing schedule changes, including changes to
the schedule baseline.
                                 Monitoring and Controlling Schedule Changes               541




   When you're using an Agile project management methodology, this process examines
the work delivered and compares it to the work estimates for the iteration. Retrospective
reviews are conducted to determine if the process is working or if improvements are
needed. The remaining backlog is prioritized, and an analysis of the time it takes to pro-
duce, validate, and accept deliverables during an iteration is performed. Last but not least,
you'll also determine if the schedule has changed and manage those changes as they occur.
   In the following sections, you'll look at this process's inputs, tools and techniques, and
outputs.


Control Schedule Inputs
Control Schedule inputs include the following:
    Project management plan (schedule management plan, schedule baseline, scope base-
    line, performance measurement baseline)
    Project documents (lessons learned register, project calendars, project schedule,
    resource calendars, schedule data)
    Work performance data
    Organizational process assets
   I've covered each of these inputs previously. Keep in mind that the Control Schedule pro-
cess works hand in hand with the Perform Integrated Change Control process we covered
in Chapter 10 (as all the change control processes do) and that means any changes to the
schedule baseline must be processed through Perform Integrated Change Control.


                 Keeping the schedule on track means you're monitoring and controlling
                 time--one of the classic triple constraints.



Control Schedule Tools and Techniques
The tools and techniques of the Control Schedule process are as follows:
    Data analysis (earned value analysis, iteration burn-down chart, performance reviews,
    trend analysis, variance analysis, what-if scenario analysis)
    Critical path method
    Project management information system
    Resource optimization
    Leads and lags
    Schedule compression
   We've covered most of these tools and techniques previously. I'll give you a few new
points you should know, and we'll look at iteration burn-down chart and performance
reviews.
542        Chapter 11      Controlling Work Results



Iteration Burn-down Chart
Earlier in this section I mentioned that you'll perform an analysis of the time it takes to
produce, validate, and accept deliverables during an iteration. This can be tracked on an
iteration burn-down chart. The chart shows the actual work that's been completed and the
ideal amount of remaining work in the iteration. If there is a variance between the actual
work and ideal work remaining, you can plot this on a forecast trend line so you can see
the likely variance at the end of the iteration. If a large variance exists, you'll want to take
action to get the remaining work completed on time, or reprioritize it into a later iteration.

Performance Reviews
Performance reviews examine elements such as actual start and end dates for schedule
activities and the remaining time to fi nish uncompleted activities. There are several tech-
niques you can use in this process, including trend analysis, critical path method, critical
chain method, and earned value management. If you've taken earned value measurements,
the SV and SPI will be helpful in determining the impact of the schedule variations and in
determining whether corrective actions are necessary.
    You will recall that the critical path is the longest path on the project schedule with
zero or negative float. If there are variances in critical path tasks, your schedule is likely at
risk. Examining critical path tasks, or those near a critical path task, can help alert you to
schedule risk.
    If you're using the critical chain method to construct the schedule, you should compare
the amount of buffer needed to the amount of buffer remaining to help determine if the
schedule is on track. This will also indicate whether corrective actions are necessary to
adjust the schedule.
    In the Control Schedule process, because you're dealing with time issues, it's impera-
tive that you act as quickly as possible to implement corrective actions so that the schedule
is brought back in line with the plan and the least amount of schedule delay as possible is
experienced.


                  Schedule changes might be potential hot buttons with certain stakeholders
                  and can burn you if you don't handle them correctly. No one likes to hear
                  that the project is going to take longer than originally planned. That doesn't
                  mean you should withhold this information, however. Always report the
                  truth. If you've been keeping your stakeholders abreast of project status,
                  they should already know that the potential for schedule changes exists.
                  Nevertheless, be prepared to justify the reason for the schedule change or
                  start dusting off your resume--maybe both, depending on the company.

   Make sure to examine the float variance of the critical path activities when monitoring
the schedule. Thinking back to the Develop Schedule process, you'll recall that float is the
amount of time you can delay starting an activity without increasing the amount of time it
takes to complete the project. Because the activities with the least amount of float have the
potential to cause the biggest schedule delays, examine float variance in ascending order of
critical activities.
                                 Monitoring and Controlling Schedule Changes               543




    Keep in mind that not all schedule variances will impact the schedule. For example, a
delay to a noncritical path task will not delay the overall schedule and might not need cor-
rective action. Use caution here, though--if a delay occurs on a noncritical path task or
its duration is increased for some reason, that task can actually become part of the critical
path. Delays to critical path tasks will always cause delays to the project completion date
and require corrective action. Careful watch of the variances in schedule start and end
dates will help you control the total time element of the project.


Control Schedule Outputs
The Control Schedule process has the following outputs:
    Work performance information
    Schedule forecasts
    Change requests
    Project management plan updates (schedule management plan, schedule baseline, cost
    baseline, performance measurement baseline)
    Project documents updates (assumption log, basis of estimates, lessons learned register,
    project schedule, resource calendars, risk register, schedule data)
    Project management plan updates include making updates to the schedule manage-
ment plan, the schedule baseline, the cost baseline, and/or the performance measurement
baseline. Changes to the cost baseline may be necessary when you've used a schedule com-
pression or crashing technique. Changes to approved schedule start and end dates in the
schedule baseline are called revisions. They generally occur as a result of a project scope
change, or changes to activity estimates, and might result in a schedule baseline update.
Schedule baseline updates occur when significant changes to the project schedule, such as
the changes just mentioned, are made. This means a new schedule baseline is established
that reflects the changed project activity dates. Once the new baseline is established, it
is used as the basis for future performance measurements. Never re-baseline a schedule
without fi rst having it approved by the project sponsor and archiving a copy of the original
baseline and schedule.


                 Take care when re-baselining a project schedule. Don't lose the original
                 baseline information. Why do you care? Because the original baseline
                 serves as historical information to reference for future projects. Make a
                 backup copy of the original schedule so that you have a record of the origi-
                 nal baseline as a reference. Even though some project management soft-
                 ware allows you to save several baselines plus the original, it's still good
                 practice to make a backup copy of the original.

   Changes to the project schedule might or might not require updates to other elements of
the project management plan as well. For example, extending a schedule activity involving
a contractor might impact the costs associated with that activity.
544         Chapter 11      Controlling Work Results



   The project documents updates output may require updates to the assumption log, basis
of estimates, lessons learned register, schedule data, project schedule, resource calendars,
and/or the risk register. For example, project schedule network diagrams require updates
as a result of schedule model data updates. Don't forget to document these changes and
inform your stakeholders.



Exam Spotlight

For the exam, remember that when any changes are made to a project, as the project
manager you must ensure that the team is working toward the revised project goals.
Once the changes are accepted and agreed on by the stakeholders, the newly revised
project goals--including new schedule dates, scope changes, and so on--are what you
and the team should work toward. Project success will be measured against the revised
goals, not the original goals.




Utilizing Control Quality Techniques
Plan Quality Management, Manage Quality, and Control Quality are part of the Project
Quality Management Knowledge Area. These processes work together to define and moni-
tor the work of the project and to make certain the quality activity results meet the quality
requirements laid out in the plan.
   Control Quality is specifically concerned with monitoring work results and project
deliverables to see whether they comply with the stakeholders' expectations. You should
practice Control Quality throughout the project to identify and remove the causes of unac-
ceptable results. Remember that Control Quality is concerned with project results both
from a management perspective, such as schedule and cost performance, and from a prod-
uct perspective. In other words, the end product should conform to the requirements and
product description defined during the Planning processes.


Control Quality Inputs
Control Quality includes the following inputs:
      Project management plan (quality management plan)
      Project documents (lessons learned register, quality metrics, test and evaluation
      documents)
      Approved change requests
      Deliverables
      Work performance data
                                             Utilizing Control Quality Techniques             545



    Enterprise environmental factors
    Organizational process assets
   I've discussed each of these inputs previously, so I'll move on to tools and techniques.


Control Quality Tools and Techniques
The tools and techniques in the Control Quality process are as follows:
    Data gathering (checklists, check sheets, statistical sampling, questionnaires and
    surveys)
    Data analysis (performance reviews, root cause analysis)
    Inspection
    Testing/product evaluations
    Data representation (cause-and-effect diagrams, control charts, histogram, scatter
    diagrams)
    Meetings


                  We talked about the fishbone diagram (a cause-and-effect diagram), also
                  known as the Ishikawa diagram, in Chapter 9, "Conducting Procurements
                  and Sharing Information." Recall that the fishbone diagram is used to help
                  determine root causes. Kaoru Ishikawa is known not only for the fishbone
                  diagram; he was also a significant contributor in the realm of quality.

   The primary purpose of the tools and techniques in this process is to examine the prod-
uct, service, or result of the project, as well as the project processes, for conformity to
standards. They are used with the Plan-Do-Check-Act cycle we talked about in Chapter 1,
"What Is a Project?," to help identify and resolve problems related to quality defects. If the
results fall within the tolerance range specified, the results are acceptable. Alternatively, if
the results fall within the control limits set for the product (as defi ned by the various tools
and techniques I'll discuss in the following sections), the process you are examining is said
to be in control. Spend time understanding these tools and their individual uses because
you might see exam questions about each of them.
   We will look at some of the new tools and techniques in more detail in the following
sections.

Data Gathering--Check Sheets
Check sheets, also known as tally sheets, are used to help organize data when you're per-
forming inspections and gathering information on defects. They are similar to checklists.
The frequencies or impacts of defects that are recorded on a check sheet can be displayed as
a Pareto diagram.
546        Chapter 11      Controlling Work Results



Data Gathering--Statistical Sampling
Statistical sampling involves taking a sample number of parts from the whole population
and examining them to determine whether they fall within acceptable variances. The for-
mula for calculating the correct sample size is beyond the scope of this book. However,
Creative Research Systems has an online calculator and an explanation of statistical sam-
pling that you might find useful; visit www.surveysystem.com/sscalc.htm.
   Perhaps you determine to statistically sample 25 parts out of a lot or run. The quality
plan outlines that the lot will pass if four parts or fewer fall outside the allowable variance.
   Statistical sampling might also involve determining the standard deviation for a process,
as discussed in the control chart tool and technique. The quality management plan deter-
mines whether plus or minus two standard deviations--95.44 percent of the population--is
adequate or whether plus or minus three standard deviations--99.73 percent--is adequate.

Inspection
Inspection involves physically looking at, measuring, or testing results to determine
whether they conform to the requirements or quality standards. It's a tool used to gather
information and improve results. Inspections might occur after the final product is pro-
duced or at intervals during the development of the product to examine individual com-
ponents. Acceptance decisions are made when the work is inspected and the work is either
accepted or rejected. When work is rejected, it might have to go back through the process
for rework. According to the PMBOK (R) Guide, inspection is also known as reviews, peer
reviews, audits, or walkthroughs.
   Inspection might take actual measurements of components to determine whether they
meet requirements. Maybe a component part for your product must be exactly 5 mm in
length. To pass inspection, the parts are measured and must meet the 5 mm length require-
ment. If they measure 5 mm, they pass; if they do not, they fail.



Exam Spotlight

Don't confuse inspection with prevention; they're two different tools. Inspection keeps
errors in the product from reaching the customer. Prevention keeps errors from occurring
in the process. It always costs less to prevent problems in the first place than it does to
fix problems built into the product after the fact. Rework, labor costs, material costs, and
potential loss of customers are all factors to consider when weighing prevention costs
versus the cost of rework. Philip Crosby developed the theory of Zero Defects, which
deals with prevention costs. Loosely translated, Zero Defects means doing it right the
first time.


   Measurements can vary even if the variances are not noticeable. Machines wear down,
people make mistakes, the environment might cause variances, and so on. Measurements
that fall within a specified range are called tolerable results. So, instead of 5 mm exactly,
                                             Utilizing Control Quality Techniques              547




maybe a range between 4.98 mm and 5.02 mm is an acceptable or tolerable measurement
for the component. If the samples that are measured fall within the tolerable range, they
pass; otherwise, they fail inspection.
   One inspection technique uses measurements called attributes. The measurements taken
during attribute sampling determine whether they meet one of two options, conforming
or nonconforming. In other words, the measurements conform or meet the requirement or
they do not conform. This can also be considered a pass/fail or go/no-go decision.
   Attribute conformity and inspections are not necessarily performed on every component
part or every end product that's produced. That's time-consuming and inefficient when
you're producing numerous components. Inspection in cases like this is usually performed
on a sampling of parts or products where every x number of parts is tested for conformity
or measurement specifics.
   Inspection will tell you where problems exist and will give you the opportunity to cor-
rect them, thereby leading to quality improvements. The other tools and techniques I'll
talk about in these sections also lead to quality improvements in the product or process or
in both.




An Ounce of Prevention

One of the main thoroughfares into your city requires a bridge replacement. You were
appointed the project manager for the city and have managed this project since its initia-
tion 15 months ago. The project entailed hiring a contractor to build the new bridge and
manage the contract.

Approximately 28,000 vehicles travel across this bridge daily, carrying commuters and
college students back and forth to the downtown area. One of the requirements was no
more than three of the six lanes of traffic could be closed at one time during construction.
Another requirement was that each piece of steel had to be painted with two coats before
it was brought on site. A third coat of paint was to be applied at the site after construc-
tion. The paint was to be guaranteed to last 25 to 30 years.

An onsite quality control inspection revealed that some of the paint was peeling. After
further investigation, you discovered that the contractor did not allow the first coat of
paint to cure properly, so when the second coat was applied, it peeled and flaked.

You informed the contractor that, according to the terms of the contract and the SOW
specifications, they were required to apply three coats of paint to the bridge, and the
paint was required to last 25 to 30 years. Paint that peeled before construction was com-
pleted did not comply with specifications. Corrective action was needed. As a result, the
contract company decided to subcontract the painting work to another company while
they finished their remaining tasks on the project.
548        Chapter 11      Controlling Work Results




Unfortunately, the subcontractor they hired was not up to the task and was unable to
complete the paint job. Several months passed, and the original project completion
date was missed. Obviously, revisions to the project schedule were required when it
became clear that the subcontractor wasn't going to make the deadline to complete the
painting task.

The original contractor found another subcontractor capable of completing the paint job.
Because it was the middle of winter and temperatures were cold, the painting crew had
to hang insulated tarps between the bays on the bridge and use heaters to warm up small
areas of steel to the proper temperature to apply the paint. This process extended the
completion date by more than three times its original estimate and ultimately delayed the
completion of the project by two years. Additional costs were incurred to hire the subcon-
tractor and rent the heaters.

Corrective action was taken as a result of the inspection, and eventually the project was
completed, but not without schedule delays, schedule changes, scope changes, and
rework--not to mention the increased cost to the original contractor. Because the contract
was a fixed-price contract, the contractor's profit was eaten away paying for the paint-
ing job. The cost to correct the quality issue did not impact the city, but it did impact the
contractor. This is a case where an ounce of prevention would have been worth several
gallons of cure, as the old saying goes.



Testing/Product Evaluations
Testing is a structured activity that measures or observes whether the product, service, or
result meets the project requirements and the quality objectives. Testing can take many
forms depending on the type of deliverables produced by the project.
   The quality management plan outlines the type and amount of testing needed to ensure
that the quality of the product, service, or result of the project conforms to the project
requirements. Testing ensures that the product is free from errors and defects or any other
nonconformance issues. Conversely, testing and product evaluation will alert you that cor-
rections need to be made to get the product, service, or result into an error-free state that
meets the quality standards for the project.

Data Representation--Control Charts
Control charts measure the results of processes over time and display the results in graph
form. Control charts are a way to measure variances to determine whether process vari-
ances are in control or out of control.
   A control chart is based on sample variance measurements. From the samples chosen
and measured, the mean and standard deviation are determined. Control Quality is usu-
ally maintained--or said to be in control--within plus or minus three standard devia-
tions. In other words, Control Quality says that if the process is in control (that is, the
                                            Utilizing Control Quality Techniques             549




measurements fall within the control limits), you know that 99.73 percent of the parts
going through the process will fall within an acceptable range of the mean. If you discover
a part outside of this range, you should investigate and determine whether corrective action
is needed.
    Figure 11.2 illustrates an example of a control chart.

                                                                     Upper
                                                                     Control
               5.06                                                  Limit




               5.00                                                  X (Mean)




               4.94                                                  Lower
                                                                     Control
                                                                     Limit


   Let's assume you've determined from your sample measurements that 5 mm is the mean
in the example control chart. One standard deviation equals 0.02. Three standard devia-
tions on either side of the mean become your upper and lower control points on this chart.
Therefore, if all control points fall within plus or minus three standard deviations on either
side of the mean, the process is in control. If points fall outside the acceptable limits, the
process is not in control and corrective action is needed.
   Differences in results will occur in processes because there is no such thing as a per-
fect process. When processes are considered in control, differences in results might occur
because of common causes of variances or special-cause variances.
   Common causes of variances come about as a result of circumstances or situations that
are relatively common to the process you're using and are easily controlled at the opera-
tional level. Special-cause variances are variances that are not common to the process. For
example, perhaps you have very detailed processes with specific procedures that must be
followed in order to produce the output, and a process gets missed. Or maybe your project
requires the manufacturing of a certain part, and a machine on the line has a problem and
requires a special calibration. This is an easy set of terms to remember because their names
logically imply their definitions.
   For the exam, you should understand the three types of variances that make up common
causes of variances:
Random Variances Random variations might be normal, depending on the processes
you're using to produce the product or service of the project, but they occur, as the name
implies, at random.
550        Chapter 11      Controlling Work Results



Known or Predictable Variances Known or predictable variances are variances that you
know exist in the process because of particular characteristics of the product, service, or
result you are processing. These are generally unique to a particular application.
Variances That Are Always Present in the Process The process itself will have inherent
variability that is perhaps caused by human mistakes, machine variations or malfunctions,
the environment, and so on, which are known as variances always present in the process.
These variances generally exist across all applications of the process.
   Common cause variances that do not fall within the acceptable range are difficult to cor-
rect and usually require a reorganization of the process. This has the potential for signifi-
cant impact, and decisions to change the process always require management approval.



Exam Spotlight

When a process is in control, it should not be adjusted. When a process falls outside the
acceptable limits, it should be adjusted.


    The Rule of 7 is another way for the project team to use control charts and determine
if the process is in control. The Rule of 7 works like this. If seven consecutive points
or more fall on one side of the mean, this may indicate there are factors influencing the
result, and they should be investigated. So, while the overall results are within the control
limits, the process may not necessarily be in control, and those factors should be exam-
ined more closely.
    Control charts are used most often in manufacturing settings where repetitive activities
are easily monitored. For example, the process that produces widgets by the case lot must
meet certain specifications and fall within certain variances to be considered in control.
However, you aren't limited to using control charts only in the manufacturing industry.
You can use them to monitor any output. You might consider using control charts to track
and monitor project management processes. You could plot cost variances, schedule vari-
ances, frequency or number of scope changes, and so on to help monitor variances.

Data Representation--Pareto Diagrams (Histograms)
You have probably heard of the 80/20 rule. Vilfredo Pareto, an Italian economist and soci-
ologist, is credited with discovering this rule. He observed that 80 percent of the wealth
and land ownership in Italy was held by 20 percent of the population. Over the years, oth-
ers have shown that the 80/20 rule applies across many disciplines and areas. As an exam-
ple, generally speaking, 80 percent of the deposits of any given financial institution are held
by 20 percent of its customer base. Let's hope that rule doesn't apply to project managers,
though, with 20 percent of the project managers out there doing 80 percent of the work!
   The 80/20 rule as it applies to quality says that a small number of causes (20 percent)
create the majority of the problems (80 percent). Have you ever noticed this with your proj-
ect or department staff? It always seems that just a few people cause the biggest headaches.
But I'm getting off track.

    Pareto diagrams are displayed as histograms that rank-order the most important factors--
such as delays, costs, and defects, for example--by their frequency over time. Pareto's theory
is that you get the most benefit if you spend the majority of your time fixing the most impor-
tant problems. The information shown in Table 11.1 is plotted on an example Pareto chart
shown in Figure 11.3.

   The problems are rank-ordered according to their frequency and percentage of
defects. The defect frequencies in this figure appear as bars, and the cumulative percent-
ages of defects are plotted as circles. The rank-ordering of these problems shows you
where corrective action should be taken first. You can see in Figure 11.3 that problem
A should receive priority attention because the most benefit will come from fixing this
problem.

Data Representation--Scatter Diagrams
Scatter diagrams use two variables: an independent variable, which is an input, and a
dependent variable, which is an output. Scatter diagrams, also known as correlation
charts, display the relationship between these two elements as points on a graph. The
independent variable is shown on the horizontal axis on the graph, and the dependent
variable is shown on the vertical axis. This relationship is typically analyzed to prove
or disprove cause-and-effect relationships. As an example, maybe your scatter dia-
gram plots the ability of your employees to perform a certain task. The length of time
(in months) they have performed this task is plotted as the independent variable on the
x-axis, and the accuracy they achieve in performing this task, which is expressed as a
score--the dependent variable--is plotted on the y-axis. The scatter diagram can help
you determine whether cause-and-effect (in this case, increased experience over time
versus accuracy) can be proved. Scatter diagrams can also help you look for and analyze
root causes of problems.
   The important point to remember about scatter diagrams is that they plot the dependent
and independent variables, and the closer the points resemble a diagonal line, the closer
these variables are related. Figure 11.4 shows a sample scatter diagram.

Control Quality Outputs
Quality improvement, as mentioned in the Manage Quality process discussed in Chapter 9,
is a primary goal of the quality processes. Failure to meet quality requirements can have a
significant impact on the project and the project team and might result in rework. Rework
causes a project to take longer and cost more than originally planned because the proj-
ect team has to repeat processes to correct the work. You should try to keep rework to a
minimum so as not to impact the project schedule and budget. Rework has the potential to
cause morale issues as well, especially if the team members thought they were doing a good
job all along. Rework might require the project team to put in long hours, which in turn
might cause more errors or other negative consequences. Monitor quality periodically so
that rework is kept to a minimum.


                 Manage Quality is concerned with ensuring that the project is using the
                 correct and most efficient processes to meet the project requirements;
                 Control Quality is concerned with the accuracy of the project results.

   Control Quality has several outputs:
    Quality control measurements
    Verified deliverables
    Work performance information
    Change requests
    Project management plan updates (quality management plan)
    Project documents updates (issue log, lessons learned register, risk register, test and
    evaluation documents)
   I've already discussed many of these outputs, but I'll add a few quick notes here.
   Verifying deliverables involves using the tools and techniques of this process to deter-
mine if the deliverable is correct and accurate and meets the user's needs. This output
becomes an input to the next process we'll discuss, Validate Scope, which entails accepting
the deliverables.
   Lessons learned should include the causes of variances found during this process and
why the corrective actions were recommended. It should also include how quality defects
could have been avoided.
   The results of changes, defect repairs, or variances that have been inspected and cor-
rected are called validated changes. Validated changes, particularly corrective and preven-
tive actions, can contribute to overall quality improvements and should be noted in the
lessons learned documentation. Remember that processes that are in control should not be
adjusted. Processes that are out of control might require adjusting, but this should occur
only as a result of a management decision.
554         Chapter 11      Controlling Work Results




Validating Project Scope
Managing and reporting on project progress make up the primary focus of the Monitoring
and Controlling processes. The primary purpose of the Validate Scope process, which is
one of those processes, is to formally accept completed deliverables and obtain sign-off that
the deliverables are satisfactory and meet stakeholders' expectations and the documented
requirements.
    The inputs of the Validate Scope process are the project management plan (scope
management plan, requirements management plan, scope baseline), project documents
(lessons learned register, quality reports, requirements documentation, requirements trace-
ability matrix), verified deliverables, and work performance data. This process involves
evaluating these inputs to determine whether the work is complete and whether it satis-
fies the project objectives. Evaluation is performed using inspection and decision-making
techniques (voting), the only tools and techniques of this process. Even if the project is
canceled, you should perform Validate Scope to document the degree to which the project
was completed. This will serve as historical information, and if the project is ever started
up again, you will have documentation that tells you what was completed and how far the
project progressed.



Exam Spotlight

The most important fact you should know about the Validate Scope process is that Vali-
date Scope formalizes the acceptance of the project scope and is primarily concerned
with the acceptance of project deliverables. Don't confuse this process with the Control
Quality process I just discussed.

You can remember the difference between Validate Scope and Control Quality this way:

      Control Quality = checking for correct work results and assuring that the quality
      requirements are met
      Validate Scope = accepting work results


   The outputs of Validate Scope are accepted deliverables, work performance information,
change requests, and project documents updates (lessons learned register, requirements
documentation, requirements traceability matrix). Accepted deliverables are concerned
with the formal acceptance of the work by the stakeholders. Remember that stakehold-
ers include customers, the project sponsor, the project team, the management team, and
so on. Document their acceptance with formal sign-off, and keep this with your project
documents.
                                                              Controlling Scope           555




Controlling Scope
The Project Scope Management Knowledge Area includes Plan Scope Management, Collect
Requirements, Define Scope, Create WBS, Validate Scope, and Control Scope. You'll recall
that project scope describes the work required to produce the product, service, or result
of the project. This broad statement usually includes the product scope statement and the
product description, which describes the characteristics, features, and functionality of
the product, service, or result. The Control Scope process involves monitoring the status
of both the project and the product scope, monitoring changes to the project and prod-
uct scope, and managing changes to the scope baseline. As with all the change processes,
change requests and preventive and corrective actions that come about during this process
are managed through the Perform Integrated Change Control process.
   Any modification to the agreed-on WBS is considered a scope change. (It has been eons
ago that you looked at this, so remember that the work breakdown structure is a deliver-
ables-oriented hierarchy that defines the total work of the project.) This means the addition
or deletion of activities or modifications to the existing activities on the WBS constitute a
project scope change.
   Changes in product scope require changes to the project scope as well. Let's say one of
your project deliverables is the design of a piece of specialized equipment that's integrated
into your final product. Now let's say that because of engineering setbacks and some mis-
calculations, the specialized equipment requires design modifications. The redesign of this
equipment impacts the end product or product scope. Because changes to the product scope
impact the project requirements, which are detailed in the scope document, changes to
project scope are also required. This change, along with recommended corrective actions,
should be processed through the Perform Integrated Change Control process.
   Unapproved or undocumented changes that sometimes make their way into the proj-
ect are referred to as scope creep. How often have you overheard a stakeholder speaking
directly with a project team member and asking them to make "this one little change that
doesn't impact anybody...really, no one will notice"? Make certain your project team mem-
bers are well versed in the change control process and insist that they inform you of she-
nanigans like this. Scope creep can kill an otherwise viable project. Little changes add up
and eventually impact budget, schedule, and quality.


Control Scope Inputs
The Control Scope process has four inputs, all of which you've seen before:
    Project management plan (scope management plan, requirements management plan,
    change management plan, configuration management plan, scope baseline, perfor-
    mance measurement baseline)
    Project documents (lessons learned register, requirements documentation, requirements
    traceability matrix)
    Work performance data
    Organizational process assets
556         Chapter 11      Controlling Work Results



    There is no new information you need to know about these inputs for this process, so
let's move on to tools and techniques.


Control Scope Tools and Techniques
The Control Scope process has one tool and technique: data analysis (variance analysis,
trend analysis). Variance analysis includes reviewing project performance measurements to
determine whether there are variances in project scope. It's also important to determine and
document the cause and amount of variances and examine those against the scope baseline
so that you can implement corrective or preventive actions if needed.
   We discussed trend analysis earlier in this chapter. You'll recall that trend analysis deter-
mines whether project performance is improving or worsening over time by periodically
analyzing project results


                  If you are using a configuration management system to control product
                  scope, the change control system must also integrate with it. The
                  configuration management system manages changes to product and
                  project scope and ensures that these changes are reasonable and make
                  sense before they're processed through the Perform Integrated Change
                  Control process.


Control Scope Outputs
The outputs of the Control Scope process are as follows:
      Work performance information
      Change requests
      Project management plan updates (scope management plan, scope baseline, schedule
      baseline, cost baseline, performance measurement baseline)
      Project documents updates (lessons learned register, requirements documentation,
      requirements traceability matrix)
   Changes to scope will likely require that you repeat some of the project Planning pro-
cesses and make any needed adjustments, including updating the project documents. Scope
changes require an update to the project scope statement. This may require an update to the
WBS and WBS dictionary as well.



Pop Quiz

The project scope statement, WBS, and WBS dictionary are collectively known as what?
The answer is the scope baseline. Scope baseline updates are part of the project manage-
ment plan updates output of this process.
                                                          Controlling Resources           557




   Scope changes include any changes to the project scope as defi ned by the agreed-on
WBS. This in turn might require changes or updates to project objectives, costs, quality
measures or controls, performance measurements baselines, or time in the form of sched-
ule revisions. Scope changes almost always affect project costs and/or require schedule
revisions.


                 Schedule revisions are almost always needed as a result of scope changes,
                 but not all scope changes lengthen the project schedule. Some scope
                 changes (a reduction in overall project requirements, for example) might
                 reduce the number of hours needed to complete the project, which in
                 turn might reduce the project budget. This most often occurs when the
                 schedule is the primary constraint on the project and the start or end dates
                 cannot be changed.

   When scope changes are requested, all areas of the project should be investigated to
determine what the changes will impact. The project team should perform estimates of the
impact and of the amount of time needed to make the changes. Sometimes, however, the
change request is so extensive that even the time to perform an estimate should be evalu-
ated before proceeding. In other words, if the project team is busy working on estimates,
they aren't working on the project. That means extensive change requests could impact the
existing schedule because of the time and effort needed just to evaluate the change. Cases
like these require you to make a determination or ask the change control board (CCB) to
decide whether the change is important enough to allow the project team time to work on
the estimates.
   Always remember to update your stakeholders regarding the changes you're implement-
ing and their impacts. They'll want to know how the changes affect the performance base-
lines, including the project costs, project schedule, project scope, and quality.



Controlling Resources
The Control Resources process concerns making certain the right physical resources are
available at the time they are needed and at the location they are needed. Resources are
assigned earlier in the Planning process group and when they are fi nished performing
their work, this process ensures their release. This process also concerns taking corrective
action when the resources are not being utilized as planned. You will perform this process
throughout the project as resources are deployed and released.
   You have seen all of the inputs to this process before. They are: project management
plan (resource management plan), project documents (issue log, lessons learned register,
physical resource assignments, project schedule, resource breakdown structure, resource
requirements, risk register), work performance data, agreements, and organization pro-
cess assets.
558        Chapter 11      Controlling Work Results



   The tools and techniques for Control Resources are: data analysis (alternatives analysis,
cost-benefit analysis, performance reviews, trend analysis), problem solving, interpersonal
and team skills (negotiation, influencing), and project management information system.
   The performance review in this process concerns the performance of the physical
resource. You will use this review to determine if the resource utilization is on track with
what was planned. This may involve analyzing schedule performance and cost performance
as well to help determine how and why the resources are not being used (or performing) as
planned.
   We first looked at problem solving in Chapter 9 in the Manage Quality process. In this
process, problem solving looks at solving issues and finding answers to problems and chal-
lenges surrounding the physical resources and their utilization during the project. Problems
can come from inside or outside the organization. Typically, the problems you'll encounter
outside of the organization will have more to do with the vendor or organization provid-
ing the equipment or resource than the resource itself. As you'll recall, according to the
PMBOK (R) Guide, problem solving identifies and defines the problem, investigates and ana-
lyzes the data, determines possible solutions, implements the best solution, and then checks
the solution to ensure the problem is fixed.
   The outputs of the Control Resources process are: work performance information,
change requests, project management plan updates (resource management plan, schedule
baseline, cost baseline), and project documents updates (assumption log, issue log, les-
sons learned register, physical resource assignments, resource breakdown structure, risk
register).
   A quick note about the physical resource assignments update: resource availability
can change. Hopefully, during the Planning and Procurement processes you were able to
secure some type of assurance from your vendors that the resources will be available at
the time and location agreed upon. However, many things could happen that may impact
resource assignments that are outside of anyone's control such as weather, scarcity, trans-
portations issues, and so on. This may require an update to the physical resources assign-
ments as well as the project schedule, cost baseline, and other project management plans
and documents.
   This process concludes the Monitoring and Controlling process group. You'll look at the
Closing process in the next chapter.




Project Case Study: New Kitchen Heaven Retail Store

Stakeholders have asked for an updated status on the project schedule as well as a
remaining cost projection. You decide to provide several cost and schedule performance
figures for the project on the status report.

"Build-out is behind schedule. They were scheduled to be completed by the 15th of January,
but they aren't going to finish up until the 24th."
                                                             Controlling Resources               559




"What's that going to do to my schedule?" Jill asks. "I'm starting interviews for the store
positions on the 16th. I hope to have that wrapped up by the 19th. As long as I have the major-
ity of the staff hired by the 20th, we can have them stocking shelves starting the 22nd."

"Let's finish up the status of the other items, and I'll come back to that."

You've calculated some performance measurements, including earned value measures,
and you show them to Jill and Dirk (all figures are in millions of dollars):

    BAC = 2, PV = 1.86, EV = 1.75, AC = 1.70.
    SPI is 0.94 (1.75 / 1.86).
    CPI is 1.03 (1.75 / 1.70).
    EAC is 1.96; 1.70 + [(2 - 1.75) / (1.03 x 0.94)].
    ETC is 0.30 (2 - 1.70).

"What is all this telling us?" Dirk asks.

"The cost performance index tells us we're getting a good return for the money spent on
the project so far. In other words, we've experienced a $1.03 value for every dollar spent
to date," you respond.

"The schedule performance index isn't as cheery, but it's not dreadful news either. This
performance indicator says that work is progressing at 94 percent of what we anticipated
by this point.

"The estimate at completion tells us that based on what we know today, the total project
will cost $1.96 million. That's coming in under the original $2 million we had budgeted
for completion, so we're on track with the project budget. The last figure is the estimated
cost of the remaining work."

"It looks like we're a little behind schedule based on what you have figured here," Dirk says.

"Yes, that's correct," you reply. "That brings us back to Jill's question. I have two alterna-
tives to propose. One, we overlap the schedule and allow Gomez's crew to complete their
work while Jill's staff starts stocking shelves."

Jill says, "I don't like this option. We'll be tripping over each other, and I don't want mer-
chandise damaged by workers who are still dragging equipment around inside the store.
What's your other option?"

"We could ask Gomez to increase the crew size so that they complete on time according
to the contract. We have a provision in the contract that stipulates they add crew mem-
bers if it looks as though they'll miss the scheduled completion date. I will instruct the
contract management department to inform Gomez that we're requiring additional crew
members."
560         Chapter 11      Controlling Work Results




"That will do the trick," Jill says. "We need the storefront to ourselves when stocking and
preparing for opening. I'm glad you had that stipulation in the contract."

You report that sign-off has been obtained for the completed deliverables to date. Quality
inspections and comparisons of the deliverables to the acceptance criteria were com-
pleted to Jill and Ricardo's satisfaction on the work performed to date.

Understanding How This Applies
to Your Next Project
With the exception of the Perform Integrated Change Control process, we covered the
meaty portion of the Monitoring and Controlling process group in this chapter. It's critical
to monitor every process we discussed in order to keep the project in alignment with the
objectives and to be able to take corrective action as soon as possible.
   Monitoring Risks is a process you'll perform once the work of the project begins and
throughout the remainder of the project. Just like change, risk is something that will occur
on most projects you undertake. I've never managed a project (except for projects that
were started and finished within a matter of days) that didn't encounter risk. My experi-
ence has been that most risks are known-unknown, which makes contingency reserves
(both time and money) essential on any project. Unknown-unknown risks are common
also and require adequate management reserves. For example, during the writing of this
book, we moved to a new home. I did the smart thing and got three estimates from three
reputable moving companies in the area. The estimates were based on an hourly rate for a
certain number of movers. Two estimates came back very close to each other, and the third
                         Understanding How This Applies to Your Next Project               561




was more than double the other estimates. I picked the company that said they could get
us moved in two days rather than the three their competitor quoted. Fortunately, we don't
move very often. Unfortunately, I didn't realize moving companies woefully underbid the
amount of time it actually takes to pack you up, load the truck, and unload at the other
end. By the third day, I had to insist they complete the job in four hours because we were at
more than double the original quote at that point. It's a good thing I had a reserve tucked
away for the unexpected, but this overrun wiped out the entire contingency fund! Taking
on a project without knowing that risks will occur and without having some contingency
set aside is a huge gamble because even the smallest projects can have risks.
    Earned value management is a tool you can't live without for measuring performance on
your project, particularly the cost and schedule variance and the cost and schedule perfor-
mance indexes. The size and complexity of the project will dictate how often you should
run the performance measurements. The mantra of stakeholders everywhere is "on time
and on budget." Therefore, controlling the project budget and the schedule will likely be
two of your most time-consuming project management tasks. Use the tools we discussed in
this chapter to keep yourself and your stakeholders informed of what's happening regarding
these two important areas. If cost or schedule changes must occur, it's imperative you com-
municate what happened, why it happened, and if it's expected to happen again and that
you realign stakeholders' expectations with the new forecasted estimates.
    Control Quality and Validate Scope work together to measure, inspect, and accept the
project deliverables. Validating and accepting the work of the project shouldn't be a mind-
boggling task at this point if you've been following the project management processes all
along. For example, you should monitor and inspect deliverables as they're completed. At
project's end, additional testing or inspection might be needed to verify that all the deliv-
erables work together (if they're required to do so), but many issues or problems you've
discovered regarding the deliverables should have been discovered already. However, I
know that exceptions do exist. It isn't always possible to inspect the work of the project as
it progresses because some projects aren't complete until the last piece of the puzzle is put
into place. In that case, inspection, testing, and deliverables acceptance won't occur until
the end of the project. However, if you've used sound Monitoring and Controlling tools
and techniques to monitor the processes, ideally you won't encounter any big surprises at
this stage.
    Control Scope is absolutely essential for all projects. Time and again I've seen changes to
scope end up pitting stakeholders against the project team because the requirements weren't
defined adequately in the first place and because neither party clearly understood what was
being requested. Scope changes can kill a project by significantly delaying the finish date or
by so drastically modifying the original objective of the project that it no longer resembles
what it set out to accomplish. I try to keep the questions regarding scope change simple, as
in, "Do you absolutely have to have this to meet the objective of this project?" That isn't
always easy for people to understand because we often confuse wants with needs. So, I
might come up with an analogy they can relate to--something like this: "Let's say your one
and only culinary skill is boiling water. Do you really need a designer stove with dual fuel
options and a built-in warming oven to boil water? Wouldn't a simple store brand work in
that case?"
562        Chapter 11      Controlling Work Results




Summary
We covered a lot of material in this chapter, and we also closed out the Monitoring and
Controlling process group.
   The Monitor Risks process responds to risks as they occur and implements workarounds
for unplanned risk events. Some risk events planned for during the Plan Risk Responses
process will occur, and some will not. Perhaps risk events that were previously identified do
occur, and their impacts are much greater than anticipated during the Plan Risk Responses
process. These will require updates to the risk management plan or workarounds.
   Control Costs involves managing changes to project costs. It's also concerned with mon-
itoring project budgets to prevent unauthorized or incorrect costs from getting included
in the cost baseline. Control Costs uses tools and techniques such as earned value man-
agement (CV, SV, CPI, SPI), forecasting (ETC, EAC, and TCPI), variance analysis, trend
analysis, and EVM to monitor costs.
   Control Schedule involves determining the status of the project schedule, determining
whether changes have occurred or should occur, and influencing and managing schedule
changes.
   Control Quality monitors work results to see whether they fulfill the quality standards
outlined in the quality management plan. Control Quality should occur throughout the life
of the project. It uses many tools and techniques. Inspection measures results to determine
whether the results conform to the quality standards. Attributes are measurements that
either conform or do not conform. Control charts measure the results of processes over
time, and Pareto charts are histograms that rank-order the most important quality factors
by their frequency over time. You should not adjust processes that are in control; however,
you can change these processes to realize improvements.
   Validate Scope involves validating and accepting work results. Control Scope is con-
cerned with controlling changes to project scope.
   Control Resources makes certain the right physical resources are available at the time
they are needed and at the location they are needed. This process also ensures the resources
are released when their job is completed and that corrective actions are taken when
resources are not utilized as planned.



Exam Essentials
Describe the purpose of Monitor Risks. Monitor Risks involves identifying and respond-
ing to new risks as they occur. Risk monitoring and reassessment should occur throughout
the life of the project.

with monitoring project costs to prevent unauthorized or incorrect costs from being
included in the cost baseline.
                                                                 Exam Essentials           563




Be able to describe earned value management techniques. Earned value manage-
ment (EVM) monitors the planned value (PV), earned value (EV), and actual costs (AC)
expended to produce the work of the project. Cost variance (CV), schedule variance (SV),
cost performance index (CPI), and schedule performance index (SPI) are the formulas used
with the EVM technique.
Be able to name the purpose of the Control Quality process. The purpose of the Control
Quality process is to monitor work results to see whether they comply with the standards
set out in the quality management plan.
Name the purpose of the Validate Scope process. The purpose of Validate Scope is to
determine whether the work is complete and whether it satisfies the project objectives.
Be able to describe product verification. Product verification confirms that all the work of
the project was completed accurately and to the satisfaction of the stakeholder.
Be able to name the purpose of the Control Resources process. The purpose of Control
Resources is to make certain the right physical resources are available at the time they are
needed and at the location they are needed. This process also ensures the resources are
released when their job is completed and that corrective actions are taken when resources
are not utilized as planned.

Review Questions
You can find the answers in Appendix A.

1.    You are working on a project that was proceeding well until a manufacturing glitch
      occurred that requires corrective action. It turns out the glitch was an unintentional
      enhancement to the product, and the marketing people are absolutely crazy about its
      potential. The corrective action is canceled, and you continue to produce the product with
      the newly discovered enhancement. As the project manager, you know that a change has
      occurred to the product scope because the glitch changed the characteristics of the product.
      Which of the following statements is true?
      A. Changes to product scope should be reflected in the project scope.
      B.   Changes to product scope should be documented in the scope management plan.
      C.   Changes to product scope will result in cost changes.
      D.   Changes to product scope are a result of corrective action.

      the newly discovered enhancement. As the project manager, you know that a variance has
      occurred. Which of the following is true?
      A. Common causes of variance, also known as special-cause variances, are situations that
         are unique and not easily controlled at the operational level.

           present in the process are known as common causes of variance.
      C.   Attribute inspection determines whether measurements fall within tolerable results.
      D.   Scatter diagrams display the relationships between an independent and a dependent
           variable to show variations in the process over time.

3.    Your project has experienced some changes to the agreed-on WBS elements. The changes
      were approved through the proper change control process. The WBS changes might in turn
      require which of the following?

      B.   Cost changes
      C.   Schedule revisions
      D.   Risk response changes

4.    You are a project manager for Dakota Software Consulting Services. You're working
      with a major retailer that offers its products through mail-order catalogs. It is interested
      in knowing customer characteristics, the amounts of first-time orders, and similar
      information. The stakeholders have accepted the project scope. Work has begun on the
      project, and you're confirming some of the initial work results with the stakeholders.
      You've asked for acceptance of the work results. Which process are you performing?

5.   You are the project manager for a top-secret software project for an agency of the United
     States government. Getting top-secret clearances for contractors takes quite a bit of time,
     and waiting for clearances would jeopardize the implementation date. Your mission--
     should you choose to accept it--is to complete the project using internal resources. Your
     programmers are 80 percent of the way through the programming and testing work
     when your agency appoints a new executive director. Your programmers are siphoned off
     this project to work on the executive director's hot new project. Which of the following
     addresses the purpose of Validate Scope in this case?
     A. Validate Scope determines the correctness and completion of all the work.
     B.   Validate Scope documents the level and degree of completion.
     C.   Validate Scope determines whether the project results comply with quality standards.
     D.   Validate Scope documents the correctness of the work according to stakeholders'
          expectations.

6.   Which of the following statements is true regarding schedule variances?
     A. Schedule variances impact scope, which impacts the schedule.
     B.   Schedule variances sometimes impact the schedule.
     C.   Schedule variances always impact the schedule.
     D.   Schedule variances never impact the schedule.

     over budget and requires a cost change through the cost change control system. You know
     all of the following statements are true regarding Control Costs except for which one?
     A. A description of how cost changes should be managed and controlled is found in the
        cost management plan.
     B.   Approved cost changes are reflected in the cost baseline.
     C.   EVM is used to determine the cost performance that must be realized for the remaining
          work of the project to meet the BAC goal.
     D.   This equation, EAC = BAC / cumulative CPI, is used to forecast an estimate at
          completion assuming future project performance will be the same as past performance.

8.   Which of the following might require re-baselining of the cost baseline?
     A. Corrective action
     B.   Revised cost estimates
     C.   Updates to the cost management plan
     D.   Budget updates

9.   What are the performance measurements for the Control Schedule process?
     A. SV = (EV - PV) and SPI = (EV / PV)
     B.   SV = (EV - AC) and SPI = (EV / AC)

          and Applying
          Professional
          Responsibility

          The PMP(R) exam content from the
          Closing performance domain
          covered in this chapter includes
          the following:

           Task 1: Obtain final acceptance of the project deliverables
           from relevant stakeholders in order to confirm that
           project scope and deliverables were achieved.

           Task 2: Transfer the ownership of deliverables to the
           assigned stakeholders in accordance with the project plan
           in order to facilitate project closure.

           Task 3: Obtain financial, legal, and administrative closure
           using generally accepted practices and policies in order to
           communicate formal project closure and ensure transfer
           of liability.

           Task 4: Prepare and share the final project report
           according to the communications management plan in
           order to document and convey project performance and
           assist in project evaluation.

           Task 5: Collate lessons learned that were documented
           throughout the project and conduct a comprehensive
           project review in order to update the organization's
           knowledge base.

           Task 6: Archive project documents and materials using
           generally accepted practices in order to comply with
           statutory requirements and for potential use in future
           projects and audits.
 Task 7: Obtain feedback from relevant stakeholders
 using appropriate tools and techniques and based on the
 stakeholder management plan in order to evaluate their
 satisfaction.

                               Congratulations! You've made terrific progress, and after
                               fi nishing this chapter you will be well equipped to take the
                               Project Management Professional (PMP)(R) exam.
   The Closing process group, which is the last process group we'll cover, has one process:
Close Project or Phase. The Close Project or Phase process is concerned with verifying that
the work of the project was completed correctly and to the stakeholders' satisfaction. The
Close Project or Phase process also verifies that the work of the project was completed cor-
rectly and the deliverables were accepted.
   Once you've obtained the PMP(R) designation, you have an obligation to maintain integ-
rity, apply your subject matter and project management knowledge, and maintain the code
of conduct published by the Project Management Institute(R). You'll also be required to bal-
ance the interests and needs of stakeholders with the organization's needs. The exam might
include questions on any of these topics.
   As a project manager, you'll fi nd yourself in many unique situations, different organiza-
tions, and possibly even different countries. Even if you never get involved in international
project management, you will still come in contact with people from cultures and back-
grounds different from yours. If you work as a contract project manager, you'll be exposed
to many different organizations; each will have its own culture and ways of doing things.
You should always strive to act in a professional, courteous manner in these situations.
   I'll talk about each of these topics in this chapter.


                 The process names, inputs, tools and techniques, outputs, and
                 descriptions of the project management process groups and related
                 materials and figures in this chapter are based on content from A Guide
                 to the Project Management Body of Knowledge (PMBOK (R) Guide),
                 Sixth Edition (PMI(R), 2017).




Formulating Project Closeout
All good projects must come to an end, as the saying goes. Ideally, you've practiced all the
topics I've talked about that have led up to this point, and you've delivered a successful
project to the stakeholders and customers. You've also put some of the vital tools of project
management into play--planning, executing, controlling, and communicating--to help you
reach that goal.
572           Chapter 12      Closing the Project and Applying Professional Responsibility



   But how do you know when a project has ended successfully? Delivering the product or
service of the project doesn't mean it has been completed satisfactorily. Remember back to
the opening chapters, where I said a project is completed successfully when it meets stake-
holders' expectations and satisfies the goals of the project. During the Closing process--
Close Project or Phase--you'll document the acceptance of the product of the project
with a formal sign-off and file it with the project records for future reference. The formal
sign-off is the way stakeholders indicate that the goals have been met, that the project
scope and deliverables were achieved, and that the project meets their expectations so the
project ends.


Characteristics of Closing
A few characteristics are common to all projects during the Closing processes. One is that
the probability of completing the project is highest during this process and risk is lowest.
You've already completed the majority of the work of the project--if not all of the work--
so the probability of not finishing the project is very low.
   Stakeholders have the least amount of influence during the Closing process, whereas
project managers have the greatest amount of influence. Costs are significantly lower
during this process because the majority of the project work and spending has already
occurred. Remember those costly S curves we talked about in the Determine Budget pro-
cess? This is where they taper off as project spending comes to an end.
   One last common characteristic of projects during closing is that weak matrix organi-
zations tend to experience the least amount of stress during the Closing processes. This is
because, in a weak matrix organization, the functional manager assigns all tasks (project-
related tasks as well) so the team members have a job to return to once the project is
completed and there's no change in reporting structure.
   All projects do eventually come to an end. You'll now examine a few of the reasons for
project endings before getting into the Close Project or Phase process.


Project Endings
Projects come to an end for several reasons:
       They're completed successfully.
       They're canceled or killed prior to completion.
       They evolve into ongoing operations and no longer exist as projects.
      Four formal types of project endings exist that you might need to know for the exam:
       Addition
       Starvation
       Integration
       Extinction
      You'll look at each of these ending types in detail in the following sections.
                                                    Formulating Project Closeout              573




Addition
Projects that evolve into ongoing operations are considered projects that end because of
addition; in other words, they become their own ongoing business unit. An example of this
is the installation of an enterprise resource planning system. These systems are business
management systems that integrate all areas of a business, including marketing, planning,
manufacturing, sales, financials, and human resources. After the installation of the soft-
ware, these systems can develop into their own business unit because ongoing operations,
maintenance, and monitoring of the software require a full-time staff. These systems usually
evolve into an arm of the business reporting system that no one can live without once it's
installed.
    A project is considered a project when it meets these criteria: It is unique, has a definite
beginning and ending date, and is temporary in nature. When a project becomes an ongo-
ing operation, it is no longer a project.

Starvation
When resources are cut off from the project or are no longer provided to the project, it's
starved prior to completing all the requirements, and you're left with an unfinished project
on your hands. Starvation can happen for any number of reasons:
    Other projects come about and take precedence over the current project, thereby cut-
    ting the funding or resources for your project.
    The customer curtails an order.
    The project budget is reduced.
    A key resource quits.
   Resource starving can include cutting back or withholding human resources, equipment
and supplies, or money. In any case, if you're not getting the people, equipment, or money
you need to complete the project, it's going to starve and probably end abruptly.
   In such cases, documentation becomes your best friend. Organizations tend to have
short memories. As you move on to bigger and better projects, your memory regarding
the specifics of the project will fade. Six months after the fact when someone important
wonders why that project was never completed and begins the finger-pointing routine, the
project documents will clearly outline the reasons the project ended early. That's one of the
reasons project documentation is such an important function. I'll talk more about docu-
menting project details shortly.

Integration
Integration occurs when the resources of the project--people, equipment, property, and
supplies--are distributed to other areas in the organization or are assigned to other proj-
ects. Perhaps your organization begins to focus on other areas or other projects, and the
next thing you know, functional managers come calling to retrieve their resources for
other, more important things. Again, your project will come to an end due to lack of
resources because they have been reassigned to other areas of the business or have been
pulled from your project and assigned to another project.
574        Chapter 12      Closing the Project and Applying Professional Responsibility




                  The difference between starvation and integration is that starvation is the
                  result of staffing, funding, or other resource cuts whereas integration is
                  the result of reassignment or redeployment of the resources.

   Again, good documentation describing the circumstances that brought about the end
of a project because of integration should be archived with the project records for future
reference.

Extinction
This is the best kind of project end because extinction means the project was completed
and accepted by the stakeholders. As such, it no longer exists because it had a defi nite end-
ing date, the goals of the project were achieved, and the project was closed out.




Pied Piper

Jerome Reed is the project manager for Pied Piper's newest software project. His team is
working on a program that will integrate the organization's human resources information,
including payroll records, leave-time accruals, contact information, and so on. His top
two programmers, Brett and Kathy, are heading up the coding team and are in charge of
the programming and testing activities.

Pied Piper recently hired a new CIO who started working with the company just a few
weeks ago. Jerome is concerned about his human resources project. It was the former
CIO's pet project, but he's not sure where it falls on the new CIO's radar screen.

Jerome is in the computer room checking out the new hardware that just arrived for his
project. Liz Horowitz, the director of network operations, approaches Jerome.

"That's a nice piece of hardware," Liz comments.

"It sure is. This baby is loaded. It's going to process and serve up data to the users so fast
they'll be asking us to upgrade all the servers."

Liz replies, "You're right about that. I've asked Richard to burn it in and load the soft-
ware."

"What software?" Jerome asks.

"You know, the new customer relationship management software. The CIO hired some
vendor she has worked with before to come in and install their CRM system here. She
said it was our top priority. I knew this new server was already on order, and it happens to
be sized correctly for the new CRM system."
                                                           Closing Out the Project             575




"I purchased this server for the human resources project. What am I supposed to use
for that?"

Liz answers, "I've got a server over there on the bottom of the third rack that might work,
or maybe you can order another one. But you should take this up with the CIO. All I know
is she authorized me to use this server. She understood I was taking it from your project,
so maybe she's thinking about going another direction with the human resources project.

"You probably should know I also asked to have Brett and Kathy assigned to the CRM
project. Even though it's a vendor project, it still requires some of our coders. The CIO
wanted the best, and they're the best we've got. It shouldn't take them long to make the
changes I need, and then you can have them back for your project. In the meantime, they
can give directions to your other programmers so they can keep working."

"I'm going to go see whether the CIO is in," Jerome replies.

This is a case where Jerome's project ends by integration because of the reassignment
of resources. The new CIO came on board and changed the direction and focus of the
project priorities, making her new project a higher priority than the previous project. As a
result, Jerome's hardware and his top two resources were reassigned to the new project.
Had the CIO cut the resources and equipment on the original project altogether, it would
have ended because of starvation.




Closing Out the Project
The key activity of Close Project or Phase is concerned with completing all the activities
associated with closing out the project management processes in order to officially close
out the project or phase and releasing team members. The work of the project was accepted
and validated back in the Validate Scope process. In this process, you (as the project man-
ager) will review the scope baseline and other project documents to make certain the work
reflected in the documents was completed and met the objectives of the project. Remember
that the project scope is measured against the project management plan, so by this point
in the project, the project management plan and associated project documents should be
complete and up-to-date. For example, perhaps some scope change requests were imple-
mented that changed some of the characteristics of the final product. The project informa-
tion you're collecting during this process should reflect the characteristics and specifications
of the final product. Don't forget to update your resource assignments as well. Some team
members will have come and gone over the course of the project; you need to double-check
that all the resources and their roles and responsibilities are noted.
   Once the project outcomes are documented, you'll request formal acceptance from the
stakeholders or the customer. They're also interested in knowing whether the product or
service of the project meets the goals the project set out to accomplish. If your documenta-
tion is up-to-date, you'll have the project results at hand to share with them.
576        Chapter 12      Closing the Project and Applying Professional Responsibility




                 Remember that you obtained acceptance of the deliverables back in the
                 Validate Scope process. In this process, you'll obtain final sign-off for the
                 project or phase itself, verifying that all the exit criteria have been met.

   The Close Project or Phase process is also responsible for analyzing the project manage-
ment processes to determine their effectiveness and to document lessons learned concerning
them. One of the other key functions of the Close Project or Phase process is to archive all
project documents for historical reference and to perform administrative closure procedures
for the project. This may include documenting the exit criteria for the project or phase,
transferring the results of the phase or project to the operations area of the organization,
and/or collecting project records and performing audits and lessons learned. You can prob-
ably guess that Close Project or Phase belongs to the Project Integration Management
Knowledge Area since this process touches so many areas of the project.
   Every project requires closure. According to the PMBOK (R) Guide, the completion of
each project phase requires project closure as well. Before we dive into the inputs of this
process, let's examine some of the administrative closure procedures you will perform as
part of the project or phase closeout.



exam spotlight

Project closure occurs at the end of each phase of the project in order to properly
document project information and keep it safe for future reference. You shouldn't
wait until project completion to perform the Close Project or Phase process but rather
perform it at the end of every phase, no matter whether the project phase was completed
successfully or ended for some other reason.




Administrative Closure Procedures
Administrative closure procedures involve collecting all the records associated with the
project, performing activities to satisfy the exit criteria, performing a comprehensive analy-
sis of the project success (or failure), documenting and gathering lessons learned, archiving
project records, updating the organization's knowledge base, and measuring stakeholder
satisfaction with the project and the processes. The project records may include legal, fi nan-
cial, procurement, and other administrative records. Keep in mind that when projects are
performed under contract, the archiving of fi nancial records is especially important. These
records might need to be accessed if there are payment disputes, so you need to know where
they are and how they were fi led. Projects with large fi nancial expenditures also require
particular attention to the archiving of fi nancial records for the same reasons. Financial
information is especially useful when estimating future projects--so again, be sure to
archive the information so it's easily accessible.

   All of these documents should be indexed for reference and stored in a safe place. Don't
forget to include electronic databases and electronic documents as part of your project
archives as well. These records can be stored on a network drive or other data repository.
When records are stored electronically, don't forget that they are subject to your organiza-
tion's retention policies, and depending on the organization, they may also be subject to
statutory requirements regarding their storage, retention, and destruction. These policies
will describe when it is appropriate to archive and eventually delete the records.
   Administrative closure procedures also document the project team members' and stake-
holders' roles and responsibilities in performing this process. According to the PMBOK (R)
Guide, this should include the processes and methodologies for the following:
    Documenting approval requirements of the stakeholders for project deliverables and
    changes to deliverables
    Assuring and confirming that the project meets the requirements of the stakeholders,
    customers, and sponsor. This includes documenting necessary actions to verify that the
    deliverables have been delivered and accepted and exit criteria have been met.
    Ensuring that all activities associated with transferring the product, service, or result to
    the operations area (or next phase of the project) are complete
    Ensuring and confirming that the exit criteria for the project are satisfied
    Releasing resources (both human and material) from the project
    Finalizing procurement documents, including open claims
    Determining and measuring stakeholder satisfaction with the project and project man-
    agement processes
   Next, we'll look at the inputs of the Close Project or Phase process.


Close Project or Phase Inputs
The Close Project or Phase process gathers all the project records and verifies that they are
up-to-date and accurate. According to the PMBOK (R) Guide, the overall purpose of this
process is to finalize all the activities associated with all of the project management process
groups in order to formally complete the project or project phase.
   The project records must correctly identify the final specifications of the product or ser-
vice the project set out to produce. Close Project or Phase is the place to ensure that this
information accurately reflects the true results of the project.
   The inputs to the Close Project or Phase process are as follows:
    Project charter
    Project management plan (all components)
    Project documents (assumption log, basis of estimates, change log, issue log, lessons
    learned register, milestone list, project communications, quality control measurements,
    quality reports, requirements documentation, risk register, risk report)
    Accepted deliverables
578           Chapter 12      Closing the Project and Applying Professional Responsibility



       Business documents (business case, benefits management plan)
       Agreements
       Procurement documentation
       Organizational process assets
   There is more information you should know regarding procurement documentation and
closing out procurements. I've devoted a section to this topic that follows the Close Project
or Phase process. I've talked about all of the other inputs previously.


Close Project or Phase Tools and Techniques
The three tools and techniques of Close Project or Phase are expert judgment, data analysis
(document analysis, regression analysis, trend analysis, variance analysis), and meetings.
When you're conducting administrative closure activities, which we talked about earlier,
the subject matter experts can help ensure that the process is performed according to the
organization's and project management standards. The data analysis tool and technique
includes analyzing documents to identify lessons learned and capturing knowledge for
future projects. Regression analysis helps determine why the project performed the way it
did by examining different variables on the project and determining how those variables
contributed to the outcomes of the project. This is for improving future projects. We've
looked at trend and variance analysis in previous chapters. Trends use past performance to
help determine future performance. Variance analysis examines and compares what was
planned against what actually took place. Meetings in this process are used to validate that
the exit criteria for the project has been met; for final reviews or validation of the deliver-
ables, lessons learned, and closeout contracts; to measure stakeholder satisfaction; and to
celebrate success (hopefully).


Close Project or Phase Outputs
Sometimes you'll work on projects where everything just clicks, your project team functions
at the performing stage, the customers and stakeholders are happy, and things just fall into
place according to plan. I often find it difficult to perform Close Project or Phases on proj-
ects that have progressed particularly well, just because I don't want them to end. Believe it
or not, the majority of your projects can fall into this category if you practice good project
management techniques and exercise those great communication skills.
   The Close Project or Phase process has the following outputs:
       Project document updates (lessons learned register)
       Final product, service, or result transition
       Final report
       Organizational process assets updates
      We'll take a brief look at the last three outputs in the following sections.
                                                           Closing Out the Project           579




Final Product, Service, or Result Transition
The name of this output is somewhat misleading. This actually refers to the turnover of the
product, service, or result of the project to the organization. This usually requires a formal
sign-off (I'll talk about that next), and in the case of a project performed on contract, it
defi nitely requires a formal sign-off or receipt indicating acceptance of the project.
   Formal acceptance includes distributing a notice of the acceptance of the product or
service of the project by the stakeholders, customer, or project sponsor to stakeholders and
customers. You should require formal sign-off indicating that those signing accept the prod-
uct of the project. It's important to note that you'll want fi nancial, legal, and administrative
sign-off so that you can communicate formal project closeout and transfer liability to the
owner of the product of the project. You will use the communications management plan as
your guide in distributing the fi nal project report and the notice of acceptance.


                  The final product, service, or result is concerned with transitioning the
                  final product, service, or result to the organization; organizational process
                  assets updates involve documenting and archiving formal acceptance.


Final Report
The fi nal report, typically written by the project manager, contains a summary of what
occurred on the project. It may include information on scope, cost, schedule, risk, and
quality outcomes, as well as whether the benefits of the fi nal project were achieved.
Remember that the benefits were outlined in the benefits management plan way back in
the pre-Initiating phase of the project. This was one of the inputs to the Develop Project
Charter process (and it's one of the project document inputs of this process). That seems
like a long time ago. Since we're on memory lane, you might recall that another input of
that process was the business case. The fi nal report will also summarize whether the objec-
tives and business needs outlined in the business plan were met.

Organizational Process Assets Updates
The organizational process assets updates output is where the formal sign-off of the
acceptance of the product is documented, collected, and archived for future reference.
Documenting formal acceptance is important because it signals the official closure of the
project, and it is your proof that the project was completed satisfactorily.
   Another function of sign-off is that it kicks off the beginning of the warranty period.
Sometimes project managers or vendors will warranty their work for a certain time period
after completing a project. Projects that produce software programs, for example, might
be warrantied from bugs for a 30- or 60-day time frame from the date of implementation
or acceptance. Typically in the case of software projects, bugs are fi xed for free during
the warranty period. Watch out, because users will try to squeeze new requirements into
the "bug" category mold. If you offer a warranty, it's critical that the warranty spells out
exactly what is covered and what is not.
580        Chapter 12      Closing the Project and Applying Professional Responsibility



   This is also where the other project records and fi les are collected and archived. This
includes the project planning documents (for example, the project scope statement, budget,
schedule, risk responses, and quality plan and baselines), change records and logs, issue
logs, lessons learned, and so on.
   Project or phase closure documents are included in this output. These include documen-
tation showing that the project or phase is completed and that the transfer of the product
of the project to the organization (or department responsible for ongoing maintenance and
support) has occurred in accordance with the project plan. In the case of a phase comple-
tion, the transfer would be the official handoff to the next phase of the project rather than
to an operations or maintenance group. If your project is canceled or ends prematurely, you
should document the reasons for its premature end as well as the procedures for transfer-
ring the completed and uncompleted deliverables.



exam spotlight

According to the PMBOK (R) Guide, the project manager is responsible for reviewing docu-
mentation from prior phases of the project, reviewing and obtaining customer accep-
tance documentation (formal acceptance of the deliverables occurs in the Validate Scope
process, but you will collect and store the sign-off document during this process), and
reviewing the contract if applicable to make certain all the requirements of the project are
completed. If the requirements are not complete, you should not proceed with the Close
Project or Phase process unless the project or phase has been terminated.


   Historical information and lessons learned are used to document the successes and
failures of the project. You should collate all of the lessons learned throughout the project
and hold one last comprehensive review of the project. As an example, lessons learned
document the reasons specific corrective actions were taken, their outcomes, the causes of
performance variances, unplanned risks that occurred, mistakes that were made and that
could have been avoided, and so on.
   Unfortunately, sometimes projects do fail. You can learn lessons from failed projects as
well as from successful projects, and you should document this information for future ref-
erence. Most project managers, however, do not document lessons learned. The reason for
this is that employees don't want to admit to making mistakes or learning from mistakes
made during the project. They do not want their names associated with failed projects or
even with mishaps on successful projects.


                  Lessons learned can include some of the most valuable information you'll
                  take away from a project. We can all learn from our experiences, and what
                  better way to have even more success on your next project than to review
                  a similar past project's lessons learned document? However, lessons
                  learned will be there only if you document them now. I strongly recom-
                  mend you not skip this step.
                                                          Closing Out the Project             581




   You and your management team will have to work to create an atmosphere of trust
and assurance that lessons learned are not reasons for reprimanding or dismissing
employees but are learning opportunities that benefit all those associated with the project.
Lessons learned allow you to carry knowledge gained on this project to other projects
you'll work on going forward. They'll also prevent repeat mistakes in the future if you
take the time to review the project documents and lessons learned prior to undertaking
your new project.
   Post-implementation audits aren't an official output, but they are a good idea. They go
hand in hand with lessons learned because they examine the project from beginning to
end and look at what went right and what went wrong. They evaluate the project goals
and determine whether the product or service of the project satisfies the objectives. Post-
implementation audits also examine the activities and project processes to determine
whether improvements are possible on future projects.
   Organizations, or the PMO, might conduct post-implementation audits instead of les-
sons learned sessions. Documenting and gathering information during this procedure can
serve the same function as lessons learned if you're honest and include all the good, the
bad, and the ugly. Let's hope there's very little ugly.




Cimarron Research Group

The Cimarron Research Group researches and develops organic pesticides for use on
food crops. It is a medium-sized company and has established a project management
office (PMO) to manage all aspects of project work. The PMO consists of project
managers and administrative staff who assist with information handling, filing, and
disbursement.

Terri Roberts is the project manager for a project that has just closed. Terri diligently
filed all the pertinent project documents as the project progressed and has requested
the research files and engineering notes from the director of engineering. All information
regarding the research on this project should be included with the project archives
because it's important that all the information about the project be in one place. The
engineering department complies with her request but chooses to keep its own set of
research records as well.

Terri's assistant has named all the project documents in accordance with the
organization's records management policies, and recently sent notice of formal
acceptance and approval of this project to the stakeholders, project sponsor, and
management team. This notice officially closes the project. The next step is to archive the
files and store them.
582        Chapter 12      Closing the Project and Applying Professional Responsibility




Closing Out the Procurements
You'll recall from Chapter 10, "Measuring and Controlling Project Performance," that
closed procurements is an output of the Control Procurements process. That was where you
provided formal notice to the seller that the procurement is complete and the formal accep-
tance and closure of the procurement occurred.
   Some of the administrative functions of closing out the procurement documents occur
during the Close Project or Phase process.
   Here is where you'll confirm formal acceptance of the work described in the contract
and ensure it was completed accurately and satisfactorily. You'll update records to docu-
ment the final results of the contract or agreement, close out open claims, and archive the
procurement documents for future reference.
   Procurement documents include the contract itself (or other procurement documents)
and all the supporting documents that go along with it. These might include things such as
the WBS, the project schedule, change control documents, technical documents, financial
and payment records, quality control inspection results, and so on. This information--along
with all the other information gathered during the project--is filed or stored according to
the organization's records management policies once the project is closed out so that any-
one considering a future project of similar scope can reference what was done. Procurement
documents might have specific terms or conditions for completion and closeout. You
should be aware of these terms or conditions so that project closure isn't held up because
you missed an important detail. If you are not administering the procurement yourself, be
certain to ask your procurement department whether there are any special conditions that
you should know about so that your project team doesn't inadvertently delay contract or
project closure.



Exam Spotlight

For the exam, remember that closed procurements is an output of the Control Procure-
ments process. This output is where formal notice is given to the vendor that the contract
is complete. The Close Project or Phase process is where contract documents are gath-
ered and archived. Remember that product documentation and deliverables are validated
and accepted during the Validate Scope process. One more note: When projects end pre-
maturely, the Validate Scope process is where the level of detail concerning the amount
of work completed gets documented.



Celebrate!
I think it's a good idea to hold a celebration at the conclusion of a successfully completed
project or a successfully completed phase on a large project. The project team should cel-
ebrate their accomplishment, and you should officially recognize their efforts and thank
                             Balancing Stakeholders' Interests at Project Close           583




them for their participation. Any number of ideas come to mind here--a party, a trip to a
ball game, pizza, and sodas at lunchtime. This shouldn't be the only time you've recognized
your team, as discussed during the Develop Team process, but now is the time to officially
close the project and thank your team members. Even if no funds are available for a formal
celebration, your heartfelt "thank you" can go a long way with the members of your team.
It's tough for team members to remain disgruntled, and it's easier to revive them, when they
know their efforts are appreciated.
    A celebration helps team members formally recognize the project end and brings closure
to the work they've done. It also encourages them to remember what they've learned and to
start thinking about how their experiences will benefit them and the organization during
the next project.


Releasing Project Team Members
Releasing project team members is not an official process. However, it should be noted that
at the conclusion of the project, you will release your project team members, and they will
go back to their functional managers or be assigned to a new project if you're working in a
matrix-type organization.
   You will want to keep the functional managers or other project managers informed as
you get closer to project completion so that they have time to adequately plan for the return
of their employees. Start letting them know a few months ahead of time what the schedule
looks like and how soon they can plan on using their employees on new projects. This gives
the other managers the ability to start planning activities and scheduling activity dates.
   In all the excitement of wrapping up the project, we shouldn't forget about our stake-
holders. In the next section, we take a look at balancing the stakeholders' interests and
ensuring we've met their expectations.



Balancing Stakeholders' Interests
at Project Close
I know we discussed Manage Stakeholder Engagement in Chapter 9, "Conducting
Procurements and Sharing Information." Although stakeholder satisfaction is the key to
project success and acceptance, I want to add some closing thoughts on this topic and dis-
cuss a few new concepts.
   Projects are undertaken at the request of customers, project sponsors, executive manag-
ers, and others. You'll recall that stakeholders are those who have something to gain or lose
by implementing the project. As such, stakeholders have different interests and needs, and
one of your jobs is to balance the needs of the stakeholders.
   Customer satisfaction is probably the primary goal you're striving for in any project. If
your customer is satisfied, it means you've met their expectations and delivered the product
or service they were expecting. You've got a winning combination when the customer is
584        Chapter 12      Closing the Project and Applying Professional Responsibility



satisfied with the product, and you've also provided excellent customer service along the
way. Satisfied customers tell others about your success and will most likely use your ser-
vices in the future.
   One of the key ways to ensure that customer satisfaction is achieved is to apply appropri-
ate project management techniques to your project. This includes taking the time to dis-
cover all the requirements of the project and documenting them in the scope statement. You
will find that stakeholders who have a clear understanding of the requirements and have
signed off on them won't suffer from faulty memory or pull the ever-famous "I thought that
was included" technique. Take the time to define your requirements and get stakeholder
sign-off. You can't forget or fudge what's written down.
   At project closure, you will once again meet with the stakeholders to obtain their obser-
vations and feedback on the project processes and evaluate their satisfaction with the proj-
ect results. The stakeholder management plan will be your guide for this meeting because it
describes the strategies for encouraging stakeholder participation and the process for deci-
sion making. Together, you will examine if these processes were successful and document
what worked well and what needs improvement on future projects.
   In the following sections, I'll discuss how to juggle the competing needs of stakeholders,
how to handle the issues and problems with stakeholders, and finally, how to balance proj-
ect constraints against stakeholder needs.


Competing Needs
Stakeholders come from all areas of the organization and include your customer as well.
Because stakeholders do not all work in the same areas, they have competing needs and
interests. One stakeholder's concern on a typical IT project might take the form of system
security issues, whereas another stakeholder is concerned about ease of use. As the project
manager, you will have situations in which stakeholder needs compete with each other, and
you'll have to decide between them and set priorities. Sometimes you'll be able to accom-
modate their needs, and sometimes you'll have to choose. You want to examine the needs
against the project objectives and then use your negotiation and communication skills to
convince the stakeholders of priorities.
   Individual stakeholders might or might not have good working relationships with
other stakeholders. Because of this, office politics come into play. I advise you to stay
away from the politics game but get to know your stakeholders. You'll want to under-
stand their business processes and needs in order to make decisions about stakeholder
requirements.


Dealing with Issues and Problems
Problems will occur on your project--they're part of the process. Throughout this book,
I've talked about how to deal with problems and risks and how to use conflict resolution
techniques in handling problems. Balancing stakeholder needs comes into play here also.
                             Balancing Stakeholders' Interests at Project Close             585




   You'll have to determine alternatives that will meet the key requirements of the project
without jeopardizing the competing needs of stakeholders. Once you're into the Executing
processes of the project and beyond, redefining scope becomes less and less of an option.
So your responsibility is to resolve issues and determine alternative solutions to problems as
they occur without changing the original objectives of the project. Enlist the help of your
project team members and stakeholders during these times. Use some of the techniques I
talked about in Chapter 6, "Risk Planning," such as brainstorming and the Delphi tech-
nique, to find solutions.
   You might also have difficulty trying to make stakeholders understand your decision
or the technical nature of a problem. Again, this is where communication skills help you
immensely. Take the case of a technical problem that's cropped up on your project. You
should not expect your stakeholder to understand the technical aspects of rocket science if
they work in the finance department, for example. It's up to you to keep the explanation at
a level they can understand without loading them down with technical jargon and specifica-
tions. Keep your explanations simple, yet don't skip important details they'll need to make
decisions.


Balancing Constraints
Your toughest issues will almost always center on the triple constraints: time, cost, and
scope. Because of the nature of the constraints, one of these is the primary driver, and one
is the least important. Keep a close eye on stakeholders who want to switch the priority of
the constraints for their own purposes. Let's say the project sponsor already told you that
time is the primary constraint. Another stakeholder tells you that a requirement of the proj-
ect is being overlooked and quality is suffering. Be careful that the stakeholder isn't trying
to divert the primary constraint from time to quality to suit their own objectives.




The Geographic Information System

Ryan Loveland is a project manager for a multinational company. He's working on a
complex software project that involves rewriting the organization's sales commission
system. A major problem with the existing system occurs when new accounts are
entered into the system or account information changes. The accounts are tied to
geographic areas, which are assigned to individual sales associates. Sales commissions
are paid based on where the account resides. To date, the process of determining which
territory an account belongs to has been done manually by looking at a map.

The project sponsor, Victor, requested a geographic information system (GIS) as part
of the requirements of this project. The hope is that errors will be eliminated and
commissions will be processed correctly. Let's drop in on Ryan and Victor's conversation.
586        Chapter 12       Closing the Project and Applying Professional Responsibility




"I just don't understand," Victor says. "I can go onto that Internet site and plug in an
address and get directions and a map detailing those directions from my house to
anywhere in the country. It seems easy enough to me. Why can't your team write code
like that?"

"It isn't that we can't write a program to do that. But there are several issues surrounding
this request that I'd like to explain to you. I'd like you to understand why I'm asking
to purchase a software product from an external vendor that will take care of these
functions for us."

"Let's hear it," Victor says.

"One of the first problems is that our salesforce is multinational. It would take us months
just to obtain address information to populate the program. The second issue is that
our sales districts are not divided by any known boundaries. Most GIS systems work
off latitude and longitude or geographic boundaries such as county borders or zip code
boundaries."

Victor interrupts, "Well, here's what we do. You give me a set of maps, I'll hand-draw in
the sales districts, and then you can scan it into the system."

"Unfortunately, it's not that easy. Our sales district boundaries are not consistent with
known boundaries, and our existing address database is not standardized. For example,
some addresses use the word Street spelled out; some use the abbreviation St. All of the
addresses need to be standardized, and then we'll have to figure out which addresses
belong to which territory.

"This process could take a great deal of time. There are vendors specializing in GIS that
could have us operational in a matter of weeks. I've already checked on a couple of the
top vendors, and there aren't any problems interfacing with our new system. The time
we'd save in the long run far outweighs the cost associated with purchasing this system
from a vendor. And one last point: If I were to build this system internally, I'd have to
take our top programming team off existing project priorities to put them on this. GIS is
extremely complicated. We're talking several months' delay--if not a year or more--to get
our programmers up to speed on GIS techniques and then write the programs."

Victor says, "If we're talking about a major delay in the schedule as you say, we can at
least look at what these vendors have to offer. It's important that this system be accurate
as well, and I think I hear you saying, `Why reinvent the wheel?' Let's have a look at the
costs."


   We have officially closed out the project and hopefully satisfied our stakeholders' expec-
tations. We have also completed our study of all the project management processes from
Initiating to Closing. But there's one more area you need to know about for the exam. We'll
look at it next.
                                                       Professional Responsibility             587




Professional Responsibility
As a certified Project Management Professional, you are required to adhere to the PMI (R)
Code of Ethics and Professional Conduct. You can fi nd a copy of this code on the
PMI (R) website, www.pmi.org.
    You should read and understand this code because you will be agreeing to adhere to
its terms as part of the certification process. The PMI (R) Code of Ethics and Professional
Conduct outlines four areas of focus:
    Responsibility
    Respect
    Fairness
    Honesty



exam spotlight

Each of these areas is described in the code, along with sections called "Aspirational
Standards" and "Mandatory Standards" for each one. We will not cover every standard
in this chapter, so I recommend you read them and understand them for the exam. The
PMI (R) Code of Ethics and Professional Conduct notes that although it might be difficult to
measure the aspirational standards, they are something we should hold ourselves and
other practitioners accountable to and they are not optional.




                  There is no section on the exam that pertains solely to professional
                  responsibility. Instead, the exam incorporates professional responsibil-
                  ity concepts into other questions throughout the exam. For example, you
                  may find that many of the questions in the Executing process group (and
                  others) pertain to Executing concepts and professional responsibility con-
                  cepts combined into one question. To make it easier to learn the principles
                  in the professional responsibility area, I've broken this topic out into its
                  own section in this chapter with questions based on these principles.

  You may fi nd at least a few exam questions regarding professional responsibility on the
exam, so we'll look at each of these areas and a few others for good measure.


Responsibility
Responsibility is the act of making decisions that are for the good of the organization
rather than ourselves, admitting our mistakes, being responsible for the decisions we make
(or those we don't make) and the consequences that result, along with other actions. We'll
look at several elements that fall within the responsibility arena.
588        Chapter 12      Closing the Project and Applying Professional Responsibility



Ensuring Integrity
As a project manager, one of your professional responsibilities is to ensure integrity of the
project management process, the product, and your own personal conduct. I've spent the
majority of this book discussing how to achieve project management integrity by following
the project management processes.


                 A product that has integrity is one that is complete and sound or
                 fit for use.


   Correctly applying the project management processes you've learned will ensure
the integrity of the product. The effective execution of the Planning, Executing, and
Monitoring and Controlling processes--including documenting scope, performing qual-
ity inspections, measuring performance, and taking corrective actions--will ensure that a
quality product that satisfies the requirements of the stakeholders (and the project manage-
ment plan) is produced. As you learned earlier, you will seek acceptance of the product
from the stakeholders and customer during the Closing process group.

Accepting Assignments
This topic, as well as many of the others discussed in these sections, crosses two of the
areas noted in the PMI (R) Code of Ethics and Professional Conduct-- responsibility and
honesty. You should always honestly report your qualifications, your experience, and
your past performance of services to potential employers, customers, PMI (R), and oth-
ers. You should not knowingly accept assignments that are beyond your capabilities or
experience.
    Be honest about what you know and what you don't know as it relates to your experi-
ence. For example, the Quality Management processes as described in the PMBOK (R) Guide
are used extensively in the manufacturing industry. However, the information technology
field looks at quality issues in different ways. If you're a project manager in the information
technology field, you've probably never used control charts and cause-and-effect diagram-
ming techniques. Don't lead others to believe that you have used techniques you haven't
used or that you have experience you don't have.
    Emphasize the knowledge you do have and how you've used it in your specific industry,
and don't try to fudge it with processes and techniques you've never used. Potential clients
and employers would much rather work with you and provide training where you might
need it than think they've got someone fully experienced with the project or industry tech-
niques needed for a project when they don't.
    If you're working on contract or you're self-employed, you have a responsibility to ensure
that the estimates you provide potential customers are accurate and truthful. Clearly spell
out what services you're providing and let the customer know the results they can expect at
the end of the project. Accurately represent yourself, your qualifications, and your estimates
in your advertising and in person.
                                                      Professional Responsibility           589




Laws and Regulations Compliance
This might seem obvious, but as a professional, you're required to follow all applicable
laws and rules and regulations that apply to your industry, organization, or project. This
includes PMI (R) organizational rules and policies as well. You should also follow any ethical
standards and principles that might govern your industry or the state or country in which
you're working. Remember that rules or regulations you're used to in the United States
might or might not apply to other countries, and vice versa.

Confidential Information
Many project managers work for consulting fi rms where their services are contracted out
to organizations that need their expertise for particular projects. If you work in a situ-
ation like this, you will likely come across information that is sensitive or confidential.
Again, this might seem obvious, but as part of the PMI (R) Code of Ethics and Professional
Conduct, you agree not to disclose sensitive or confidential information or use it in any way
for personal gain.
   Often when you work under contract, you'll be required to sign a nondisclosure agree-
ment. This agreement simply says that you will not share information regarding the project
or the organization with anyone--including the organization's competitors--or use the
information for your personal gain.
   However, you don't have to work under contract to come into contact with sensitive or
private information. You might work full-time for an organization or a government agency
that deals with information regarding its customer base or citizens. For example, if you
work for a bank, you might have access to personal account information. If you work for a
government agency, you might have access to personal tax records or other sensitive mate-
rial. It would be highly unethical and maybe even illegal to look up the account informa-
tion of individuals not associated with the project at hand just to satisfy your own curiosity.
In my organization, that is grounds for dismissal.


                 Don't compromise your ethics or your organization's reputation by sharing
                 information that is confidential to the organization or that would jeopardize
                 an individual's privacy.


Company Data
Although it might seem obvious that you should not use personal information or an organi-
zation's trade secrets for personal gain, sometimes the organization has a legitimate need to
share information with vendors, governmental agencies, or others. You need to understand
which vendors or organizations are allowed to see sensitive company data. In some cases,
you might even need to help determine which individuals can have access to the data. When
in doubt, ask.
   Here are some examples. Maybe the company you're working with has periodic mail-
ings it sends to its customer base. If one of your project activities includes fi nding a new
vendor to print the mailing labels, your organization might require the vendor to sign a
590        Chapter 12      Closing the Project and Applying Professional Responsibility



nondisclosure agreement to guard the contents of the customer lists. Discovering just who
should have access to this information might be tricky.
   Another example involves data on citizens that is maintained by the government. You
might think that because the data belongs to one agency of the government--say the
Internal Revenue Service--any other agency of the government can have access to it. This
isn't the case. Some agencies are refused access to the data even though they might have
good reason to use it. Others might have restricted access, depending on the data and the
agency policy regarding it. Don't assume that others should have access to data because it
seems logical.
   Most organizations require vendors or other organizations to sign nondisclosure agree-
ments when the vendors or others will have access to sensitive company data. It's your
responsibility to ensure that the proper nondisclosure agreements are signed prior to releas-
ing the data. The procurement department often handles this function.

Intellectual Property
You are likely to come into contact with intellectual property during the course of your
project management career. Intellectual property includes items developed by an orga-
nization that have commercial value but are not tangible and copyrighted material such
as books (including this one), software, and artistic works. It might also include ideas or
processes that are patented. Or it might involve an industrial process, business process, or
manufacturing process that was developed by the organization for a specific purpose.
   Intellectual property is owned by the business or person who created it. You might have
to pay royalties or ask for written permission to use the property. Intellectual property
should be treated just like sensitive or confidential data. It should not be used for personal
gain or shared with others who should not have access to it.


Respect
Respect involves several areas as well, including the way we conduct ourselves, the way we
treat others, listening to other viewpoints, conducting ourselves in a professional manner,
and so on. We'll look at some of the elements of respect next.

Professional Demeanor
Acting in a professional manner is required of almost everyone who works in the busi-
ness world. Although you are not responsible for the actions of others, you are responsi-
ble for your own actions and reactions. Part of acting professionally involves controlling
yourself and your reactions in questionable situations. For example, a stakeholder or
customer might lash out at you but have no basis for their outburst. You can't control
what they said or did, but you can control how you respond. As a professional, your
concern for the project and the organization should take precedence over your con-
cern for your own feelings. Therefore, lashing out in return would be unprofessional.
Maintain your professional demeanor, and don't succumb to shouting matches or ego
competitions with others.
                                                     Professional Responsibility           591




   As project manager, you have a good deal of influence over your project team members.
One of the items on the agenda at the project team kickoff meeting should be a discussion
of where the team members can find a copy of organizational policies regarding conflict of
interest, cultural diversity, standards and regulations, and customer service and standards
of performance. Better yet, have copies with you that you can hand out at the meeting or
have available the addresses of websites where they can find these documents.
   When you see project team members acting out of turn or with less-than-desirable cus-
tomer service attitudes, coach and influence those team members to conform to the stan-
dards of conduct expected by you and your organization. Your team members represent
you and the project. As such, they should act professionally. It's your job as the project
leader to ensure that they do.

Reporting Ethics Violations
When you hold the PMP(R) certification, one of the responsibilities that falls into this cat-
egory is your responsibility to report violations of the PMP(R) code of conduct. To maintain
integrity of the profession, everyone who holds the PMP(R) certification must adhere to the
code of conduct that makes all of us accountable to each other.
   When you know a violation has occurred and you've verified the facts, notify PMI (R). Part
of this process--and a requirement of the code of conduct--is that you'll verify that an eth-
ics violation has occurred (in other words, don't report bogus or unsubstantiated reports)
and will assist PMI (R) in the investigation by supplying information, confirming facts and
dates, and so on. This includes anything listed as violations in the PMI (R) Code of Ethics
and Professional Conduct, such as conflicts of interest, untruthful advertising, false report-
ing of project management experience and credentials, appearances of impropriety, and so
on. This one calls for some judgment on your part, but it's mostly based on common sense.
For example, in most situations, a project manager with the PMP(R) designation should not
have a family member working on the project team reporting to them (unless they own and
run a family business).

Cultural Awareness
More and more companies compete in the global marketplace. As a result, project manag-
ers with multinational experience are increasingly in demand. This requires a heightened
awareness of cultural influences and customary practices of the country where they're tem-
porarily residing.
   If you are used to working in the United States, for example, you know that the culture
tends to value accomplishments and individualism. U.S. citizens tend to be informal and call
each other by their first names, even if they've just met. In some European countries, people
tend to be more formal, using surnames instead of first names in a business setting, even
when they know each other well. Their communication style is more formal than in the
United States, and although they tend to value individualism, they also value history, hier-
archy, and loyalty. The Japanese, on the other hand, tend to communicate indirectly and
consider themselves part of a group, not as individuals. The Japanese people value hard
work and success, as most of us do.
592        Chapter 12      Closing the Project and Applying Professional Responsibility



    One thing I've witnessed when working in foreign countries is U.S. citizens trying to
force their own culture or customs on those with whom they're visiting or working. That
isn't recommended, and it generally offends those you're trying to impress. Don't expect
others to conform to your way of doing things, especially when you're in their country.
You know the saying "When in Rome, do as the Romans do." Although you might not
want to take that literally, the intent is good. For example, a quick kiss on both cheeks
is a customary greeting in many countries. If that is the case and it's how you're greeted,
respond with the same.

Culture Shock
Working in a foreign country can bring about an experience called culture shock. When
you've spent years acting certain ways and expecting normal, everyday events to follow a
specific course of action, you might fi nd yourself disoriented when things don't go as you
expected.
   One of the ways you can avoid culture shock is to read about the country you're going to
work in before getting there. The Internet is a great resource for information such as this.
Your local library is another place to research customs and acceptable practices in foreign
countries.
   When in doubt about a custom or what you should do in a given situation, ask your
hosts or a trusted contact from the company you'll be working with to help you. People are
people all over the world, and they love to talk about themselves and their cultures. They're
also generally helpful, and they will respect you more for asking what's expected rather
than acting as though you know what to do when you clearly do not.

Diversity Training
Sometimes you might fi nd yourself working with teams of people from different countries
or cultures. Some team members might be from one country and some from another. The
best way to ensure that cultural or ethical differences do not hinder your project is to pro-
vide training for all team members.
   Team-building activities are ways to build mutual trust and respect and bond team mem-
bers with differing backgrounds. Choose activities that are inoffensive and ones in which
everyone can participate.
   Diversity training makes people aware of differences between cultures and ethnic
groups, and it helps them to gain respect and trust for those on their team. Provide training
regarding the project objectives and the company culture as well.


                 Remember that project objectives are why you are all together in the first
                 place. Keeping the team focused on the objectives cuts across cultural
                 boundaries and will help everyone concentrate on the project and tasks at
                 hand rather than on each other.


Respecting Your Neighbors
Americans tend to run their lives at high speed and get right down to business when work-
ing with vendors or customers. It isn't unusual for a businessperson to board a plane in the
                                                     Professional Responsibility           593




morning, show up at the client site and take care of business, and hop another fl ight to the
next client site that night.
   You'll fi nd that this is not that common in many other countries. People in other coun-
tries will often expect you to take time to get to know them fi rst, building an atmosphere
of trust and respect. Some cultures build relationships fi rst and then proceed to business.
Don't expect to do that relationship building in a few hours. It could take several days,
depending on the culture. They might even want you to meet their family and spend time
getting to know them. Resist the urge to get right down to business if that's not customary
in the culture because you'll likely spoil the deal or damage relationships past the point of
repair.


                 Spend time building relationships with others. Once an atmosphere of
                 mutual trust and cooperation is established, all aspects of project planning
                 and management--including negotiating and problem solving--are much
                 easier to navigate.


Perceiving Experiences
All of us see the world through our own experiences. Your experiences are not someone
else's experiences; therefore, what you perceive about a situation might be very different
from what others believe. Keep this in mind when it appears that a misunderstanding has
occurred or that someone you're working with doesn't respond as you expect. This is espe-
cially true when you're working with someone from another country. Always give others
the benefit of the doubt and ask for clarification if you think there is a problem. Put your
feelings in check temporarily, and remember that what you think the other person means is
not necessarily as it appears.


Fairness
Fairness includes avoiding favoritism and discrimination against others, avoiding and
reporting confl ict of interest situations, and maintaining impartiality in a decision-making
process. We'll focus on confl ict of interest in this section.

Conflict of Interest
The PMI (R) Code of Ethics and Professional Conduct discusses your responsibility to report
to the stakeholders, customers, or others any actions or circumstances that could be con-
strued as a conflict of interest.
   A confl ict of interest is when you put your personal interests above the interests of the
project or when you use your influence to cause others to make decisions in your favor
without regard for the project outcome. In other words, your personal interests take prece-
dence over your professional obligations, and you make decisions that allow you to person-
ally benefit regardless of the outcome of the project. Let's look at a few examples.
594        Chapter 12      Closing the Project and Applying Professional Responsibility



Associations and Affiliations
Confl icts of interest might include your associations or affi liations. For example, perhaps
your brother-in-law owns his own construction company and you are the project manager
who has just published an RFP. Your brother-in-law bids on the project and ends up win-
ning the bid.
    If you sit on the decision committee and don't tell anyone about your association with
the winning bidder, that is clearly a confl ict of interest. If you influence the bid decision
so that it goes to your brother-in-law, he benefits from your position. Alternatively, if you
are not so fond of your brother-in-law, you could influence the decision against him, in
which case he loses the bid. Either way, this is a confl ict of interest. You put your personal
interests--or in this case the interests of your associations--above the project outcome.
Even if you did not influence the decision in any way, when others on the project discover
the winning bidder is your brother-in-law, they will assume a confl ict of interest occurred.
This could jeopardize the awarding of the bid and your own position as well.
    The correct thing to do in this case would be to, fi rst, inform the project sponsor and the
decision committee that your brother-in-law intends to bid on the project. Second, refrain
from participating on the award-decision committee so as not to unduly influence others in
favor of your brother-in-law. Last, if you've done all these things and your brother-in-law
still wins the bid, appoint someone else in your organization to administer the contract and
make the payments for the work performed by him. Also, make certain you document the
decisions you make regarding the activities performed by him and keep them with the proj-
ect fi les. The more documentation you have, the less likely someone can make a confl ict of
interest accusation stick.

Vendor Gifts
Some professionals work in situations where they are not allowed to accept gifts in excess of
certain dollar amounts. This might be driven by company policy, the department manager's
policy, and so on. I have worked in organizations where it was considered a conflict of inter-
est to accept anything from a vendor, including gifts (no matter how small), meals, or even a
cup of coffee. Vendors and suppliers often provide their customers and potential customers
with lunches, gifts, ball game tickets, and the like. It's your responsibility to know whether
a policy exists that forbids you from accepting these gifts. It's also your responsibility to
inform the vendor if they've gone over the limit and you are unable to accept the gift.
   The same situation can occur here as with the brother-in-law example earlier. If you
accept an expensive gift from a vendor and later award that vendor a contract or a piece
of the project work, it looks like and probably is a confl ict of interest. This violates PMI (R)
guidelines and doesn't look good for you personally either.


                  Using the "I didn't know there was a policy" excuse probably won't
                  save you when there's a question about conflict of interest. Make it your
                  business to find out whether the organization has a conflict of interest
                  policy and understand exactly what it says. Get a copy, and keep it with
                  your files. Review it periodically. Put a note on your calendar every
                  six months to reread the policy to keep it fresh in your mind. This is a
                  case where not knowing what you don't know can hurt you.
                                                       Professional Responsibility              595




   Don't accept gifts that might be construed as conflicts of interest. If your organization
does not have a policy regarding vendor gifts, set limits for yourself depending on the situ-
ation, the history of gift acceptance by the organization in the past, and the complexity of
the project. It's always better to decline a gift you're unsure about than to accept it and later
lose your credibility, your reputation, or your PMP(R) status because of bad judgment.

Stakeholder Influence
Another potential area for conflict of interest comes from stakeholders. Stakeholders are
usually folks with a good deal of authority and important positions in the company. Make
certain you do not put your own personal interests above the interests of the project when
you're dealing with powerful stakeholders. They might have the ability to promote you or
reward you in other ways. That's not a bad thing--but if you let that get in the way of the
project or let a stakeholder twist your arm with promises of rewards, you're getting mighty
close to a conflict of interest. Always weigh your decisions with the objectives of the project
and the organization in mind--not your own personal gain.
   Keep in mind that you might not always be on the receiving end of the spectrum. You
should not offer inappropriate gifts or services or use confidential information you have at
your disposal to assist others because this can also be considered a conflict of interest.




The Golf Trip

Amanda Anderson is the project manager for a network upgrade project for her organiza-
tion. This project will be outsourced to a vendor, and Amanda will manage the vendor's
work. She also wrote the RFP and is a member of the selection committee.

The project consists of converting the organization's network from 100 MB Ethernet to
Gigabit Ethernet. This will require replacing all of the routers and switches. Some of the
cabling in the buildings will need to be replaced as well. The RFP requires that the vendor
who wins the bid install all the new equipment and replace the network interface cards
in each of the servers with Gigabit Ethernet cards. The grand total for this project is esti-
mated at $1.2 million.

Steve James is a vendor with whom Amanda has worked in the past. Steve is very inter-
ested in winning this bid. He drops in on Amanda one day shortly after the RFP is posted.

"Amanda, it's good to see you," Steve says. "I was in the neighborhood and thought I'd
stop in to see how things are going."

"I'm great," Amanda replies. "I'll bet you're here to talk to me about that RFP. You know I
can't say anything until the whole process closes."

"You bet we bid on the project. I know you can't talk about the RFP, so I won't bring it
up. I wanted to chat with you about something else. My company is sending 15 lucky
596        Chapter 12      Closing the Project and Applying Professional Responsibility




contestants and one friend each to Scottsdale, Arizona, for a `conference.' The conference
includes the use of the Scottsdale Golf Club (green fees paid, of course), and all the hotel
and meal expenses are on us for the length of the trip. I know Scottsdale is one of your
favorite places to golf, so I thought of you. What do you say?"

Amanda sits forward in her chair and looks at Steve for a minute. "That sounds fabulous,
and I do love Scottsdale. But you and I both know this isn't a conference. I wouldn't feel
right about accepting it."

"Come on, Amanda. Don't look a gift horse in the mouth. It is a conference. I'll be there
and so will the top brass from the company. We have some presentations and demonstra-
tions we'd like to show you while you're there, no obligation of course, and then you're
free to spend the rest of the time however you'd like."

"I appreciate the offer. Thanks for thinking of me, but no thanks. I'm on the selection
committee for the RFP, and it would be a conflict of interest if I attended this conference.
Besides, the value of the conference is over the $100 limit our company sets for vendor
gifts and meals," Amanda says.

"Okay, we'll miss you. Maybe next time."



Honesty
Honesty can include a lot of topics: reporting the truth regarding project status, being hon-
est about your own experience, not deceiving others, not making false statements, and so on.
   One of the aspects of honesty includes your truthfulness about your PMP(R) application
and certification, your qualifications, and the continuing reports you provide to PMI (R) to
maintain your certification. Let's look at a few others.

Personal Gain
Honesty involves not only information regarding your own background and experience
but information regarding the project circumstances as well. For example, let's say you're a
project manager working on contract. Part of your compensation consists of a bonus based
on total project billing. Now, let's suppose your project is finishing sooner than antici-
pated, and this means your personal profit will decrease by $1,500. Should you stretch the
work to meet the original contracted amount so that your personal bonus comes in at the
full amount even though your project team is finished? I think you know the answer is of
course not.
   Your personal gain should never be a consideration when billing a customer or work-
ing on a project. Personal gain should never be a factor in any project decision. If the
project finishes sooner than planned, you should bill the customer according to the terms
of the procurement agreement. Compromising the project for the sake of your personal
gain shows a lack of integrity, which could ultimately cost you your PMP(R) status and
even your job.
                                                      Professional Responsibility              597




Truthful Reporting
As a project manager, you are responsible for truthfully reporting all information in your
possession to stakeholders, customers, the project sponsor, and the public when required.
Always be up front regarding the project's progress.


                  Nothing good will come of telling stakeholders or customers that the proj-
                  ect is on track and everything looks great when in fact the project is behind
                  schedule or several unknown risk events have occurred that have thrown
                  the project team a curveball. I've personally witnessed the demise of the
                  careers of project managers who chose this route.

   Tell the truth regarding project status, even when things don't look good. Stakeholders
will likely go to great lengths to help you solve problems or brainstorm solutions.
Sometimes, though, the call needs to be made to kill the project. This decision is usually
made by the project sponsor or the stakeholders based on your recommendation and pre-
dictions of future project activities. Don't skew the reporting to prevent stakeholders from
making this decision when it is the best solution based on the circumstances.
   Truthful reporting is required when working with the public as well. When working in
situations where the public is at risk, truthfully report the facts of the situation and what
steps you're taking to counteract or reduce the threats. I recommend you get approval from
the organization regarding public announcements prior to reporting the facts. Many orga-
nizations have public relations departments that will handle this situation for you.


                  You probably remember something your mother always told you: Actions
                  speak louder than words. Always remember that you lead by example.
                  Your team members are watching. If you are driven by high personal ethics
                  and a strong desire for providing excellent customer service, those who
                  work for you will likely follow your lead.


Role Delineation Study
In addition to the areas covered in the PMI (R) Code of Ethics and Professional Conduct,
you should be aware of four other focus areas that PMI (R) discusses in its role delineation
study. This study was published in PMI (R)'s publication Project Management Professional
(PMP(R)) Examination Specification. The four focus areas are as follows:
    Ensure personal integrity and professionalism.
    Contribute to the project management knowledge base.
    Enhance personal professional competence.
    Promote interaction among team members and other stakeholders.
   Throughout this chapter, I've covered most of the concepts surrounding these focus
areas with the exception of contributing to the project management knowledge base. We'll
look at that topic next.
598        Chapter 12      Closing the Project and Applying Professional Responsibility




Applying Professional Knowledge
Professional knowledge involves the knowledge of project management practices as well as
specific industry or technical knowledge required to complete an assignment.
   As a PMP(R) credential holder, you should apply project management knowledge to all
your projects. Take the opportunity to educate others by keeping them up-to-date on project
management practices, training your team members to use the correct techniques, inform-
ing stakeholders of the correct processes, and then sticking to those processes throughout
the course of the project. This isn't always easy, especially when the organization doesn't
have any formal processes in place. But once the stakeholders see the benefits of good project
management practices, they'll never go back to the "old" way of performing their projects.
   One way to apply professional knowledge is to become and remain knowledgeable in
project management best practices techniques. I'll cover this topic next, along with how to
become a PMI(R) education provider and the importance of having industry knowledge.


Project Management Knowledge
Project management is a growing field. Part of the responsibility when you hold the PMP(R)
designation is to stay abreast of project management practices, theories, and techniques.
You can do this in many ways, one of which includes joining a local PMI (R) chapter. There
are hundreds of local chapters throughout the United States and in other countries as well.
You can check the PMI (R) website to find a chapter near you.
   Chapter meetings give you the opportunity to meet other project managers, find out
what techniques they're using, and seek advice regarding your project. Usually, guest speak-
ers appear at each chapter meeting and share their experiences and tips. Their stories are
always interesting, and they give you the opportunity to learn from someone else's experi-
ences and avoid making wrong turns on your next project. You might have a few stories of
your own worth sharing with your local chapter. Volunteer to be a speaker at an upcoming
meeting, and let others learn from your experiences.
   One of the things you'll get when you join the PMI (R) organization and pay your yearly
dues is its monthly magazine. This publication details real-life projects and the techniques
and issues project managers have to deal with on those projects. Reading the magazine is
a great way to learn new project management techniques or reinforce the information you
already know. You might discover how to apply some of the knowledge you've already
learned in more efficient ways as well.
   PMI (R) offers educational courses through its local chapters and at the national level as
well. These courses are yet another way for you to learn about project management and
meet others in your field.


Education Providers
PMI (R) has a program that allows you or your organization to become a Registered

Industry Knowledge
Contributing and applying professional knowledge goes beyond project management expe-
rience. You likely have specific industry or technical experience as well. Part of applying
your professional knowledge includes gaining knowledge of your particular industry and
keeping others informed of advances in these areas.
   Information technology has grown exponentially over the past several years. It used to
be that if you specialized in network operations, for example, it was possible to learn and
become proficient in all things related to networks. Today that is no longer the case. Each
specialized area within information technology has grown to become a Knowledge Area in
and of itself. Many other fields have either always had individual specialties or just recently
experienced this phenomenon, including the medical field, bioengineering, manufacturing,
and pharmaceuticals, to name a few. You need to stay up-to-date regarding your industry
so that you can apply that knowledge effectively. Today's fast-paced advances can leave you
behind fairly quickly if you don't stay on top of things.
   Earlier in the book, I mentioned that as a project manager you are not required to be
a technical expert, and that still holds true. But it doesn't hurt to stay abreast of industry
trends and knowledge in your field and have a general understanding of the specifics of
your business. Again, you can join industry associations and take educational classes to
stay on top of breaking trends and technology in your industry.




Project Case Study: New Kitchen Heaven Retail Store

Dirk strolls into your office maintaining his formal and dignified manners as always and
then sits down in the chair beside your desk.

"I just want to congratulate you on a job well done," he says. "The grand opening was
a success, and the store had a better-than-expected first week. I'm impressed you were
able to pull this off and get the store opened prior to the Home and Garden Show. That
was the key to the great opening week."

"Thank you, Dirk. Lots of people put in a lot of hard work and extra hours to get this job
done. I'm glad you're happy with the results."
600        Chapter 12        Closing the Project and Applying Professional Responsibility




"I thought the banner with our logo, `Great Gadgets for People Interested in Great Food,'
was a wonderful touch."

"That was Jill's idea. She had some great ideas that made the festivities successful.
As you know, though," you continue, "we did have some problems on this project.
Fortunately, they weren't insurmountable, but I think we learned a thing or two during
this project that we can carry forward to other projects."

"Like what?" Dirk asks.

"We should have contracted with Gomez Construction sooner so that we didn't have to
pay overtime. We had a very generous budget, so the overtime expense didn't impact
this project, but it might impact the next one. And we came fairly close to having a
hardware disaster on our hands. Next time, we should order the equipment sooner, test
it here at headquarters first, and then ship it out to the site after we know everything is
working correctly."

"Good ideas. But that's old news." Dirk continues, "Now that this project is over, I'd like
to get you started on the next project. We're going to introduce cooking classes in all of
our retail stores. The focus is the home chef, and we might just call the classes the Home
Chef Pro series. We'll offer basic classes all the way to professional-series classes if the
project is a hit. We'll bring in guest chefs from the local areas to give demos and teach
some of the classes as well."

"I'm very interested in taking on this project and can't wait to get started. I'm thrilled that
you want me to head this up. But I do have a few things here to wrap up before I start
work on the new project," you reply.

Dirk says, "The project is over. The grand opening was a success. It's time to move on.
Let Jill take over now; the retail stores are her responsibility."

"Jill has taken over the day-to-day operations. However, I've got to finish collecting the
project information, close out the contract with Gomez, and make the final payment. Jake
verified that all the work was completed correctly and to his satisfaction. Then I need to
publish the formal acceptance notice to all of the stakeholders via email. I will also create
a document that outlines the things I mentioned earlier that we should remember and
reference during the next project; that document is called lessons learned. Then, after all
those things are completed, all of the project records need to be indexed and archived. I
can have all that done by the end of the week and will be free starting Monday to work on
requirements-gathering and the charter document for the new project."

"This is just like the Planning process discussion we got into with the tree, the breakdown
structure thing, and all the planning, I suspect. I do have to admit all the planning paid
off." As he gets up to leave, Dirk continues, "I'll give you until the end of the week to close
out this project. Come see me Monday to get started on Home Chef Pro."
                                               Applying Professional Knowledge                   601




Jill Overstreet thought you did such a great job of managing this project that she
has offered to buy you lunch at one of those upscale, white-tablecloth-type French
restaurants. The iced teas have just been delivered, and you and Jill are chatting about
business.

"I'm impressed with your project management skills," she remarks. "This store opening was
the best on record. And you really kept Dirk in line--I admire that. He can be headstrong, but
you had a way of convincing him what needed doing and then sticking to it."

"Thanks," you reply. "I've got several years of project management experience, so
many of those lessons learned on previous projects helped me out with this project. I
enjoy project management and read books and articles on the subject whenever I get
the chance. It's nice when you can learn from others' mistakes and avoid making them
yourself."

Jill takes a long drink of tea. She glances at you over the top of her glass and pauses
before setting it down. "You know," she begins, "we almost didn't hire anyone for your
position. Dirk wanted to do away with the project management role altogether. He had a
real distaste for project management after our last project."

"Why is that?"

"The last project manager got involved in a conflict of interest situation. She was working
on a project that involved updating and remodeling all the existing stores. Things like
new fixtures, signs, shelving, display cases, and such were up for bid--and it was a very
sizable bid. Not only did she accept an all-expenses-paid weekend visit to a resort town
from one of the vendors bidding on the contract, she also revealed company secrets to
them, some of which leaked to our competitors."

Your mouth drops open. "I can't believe she would accept gifts like that from a vendor.
Revealing company secrets is even worse. Conflict of interest situations and not
protecting intellectual property violate the code of professional conduct that we agree to
when we gain PMP(R) certification. I can understand why Dirk didn't want to hire another
project manager. Behavior like that makes all project managers look bad."

"I'm glad you kept things aboveboard and won Dirk back over. The project management
role is important to Kitchen Heaven, and I know your skills in this discipline are what
made this project such a success."

"Jill, not only would I never compromise my own integrity through a conflict of interest
situation, I would report the situation and the vendor to the project sponsor and to
PMI(R) as an ethics violation. It's better to be honest and let the project sponsor or
key stakeholders know what's happening than to hide the situation or, even worse,
compromise your own integrity by getting involved in it in the first place. You have
my word that I'll keep business interests above my own personal interests. I'll report
602         Chapter 12      Closing the Project and Applying Professional Responsibility




anything that even looks like it would call my actions into question just to keep things
honest and out in the open."

"That's good to hear," Jill replies. "Congratulations on your new assignment. Dirk and
I were discussing the new Home Chef Pro project yesterday. We're venturing into new
territory with this project, and I'm confident you'll do an excellent job heading it up. Dirk
made a good choice."

Understanding How This Applies
to Your Next Project
Closing out the project should always include a formal sign-off (from the project spon-
sor and key stakeholders at a minimum) that the work of the project is acceptable and
complete. You've probably experienced, as I have, stakeholders with short-term memory
lapses. For example, I'll get to the end of the project and find that a stakeholder has a list
                         Understanding How This Applies to Your Next Project                603




of additional requirements longer than their arm. Some of this goes back to ensuring that
requirements are accurately defined during the Planning processes and that ongoing com-
munication regarding project status, along with feedback from the stakeholders, is occur-
ring on a regular basis. Another key here is making certain you are managing stakeholder
expectations throughout the project. You might indeed have identified all the requirements
and accurately documented the objectives of the project. However, if the stakeholder had
expectations that weren't captured or that took shape after the work of the project began,
you could end up with a very unhappy stakeholder on your hands and, potentially, a failed
project. In my experience, stakeholder expectations tend to stray midway through the proj-
ect. That's because they are beginning to see nearly completed deliverables, and new pos-
sibilities for the product are developing that weren't thought of during the Planning stage.
It's similar to buying a new house based on blueprints and then going on that first walk-
through when the framing is finished. It's during walk-through that you think, "Gee, I
thought that closet was bigger than this." Tune into what your stakeholders are saying and
get at the basis of their questions (dig deep) so that there are no hidden expectations and
you're able to manage any new expectations that pop up.
    The professional responsibility section of this chapter can easily be boiled down to the
Golden Rule: "Do unto others as you would have them do unto you." I wish I could tell
you that everything I talked about here is practiced by all project managers everywhere.
Unfortunately, you've likely read, as I have, the endless stories in the news about corpo-
rate execs acting in their own best interest rather than that of their organizations. Project
managers make the news as well, especially when they're working on projects that involve
public funds or charitable organizations. In my humble opinion, ignoring the practices and
advice in this chapter isn't worth the damage it might cause to my organization, to the proj-
ect, or to my career.
    I'd also add that if your first thought on a new project is what a great resume builder it's
going to be for you and how you'll likely score that next big promotion after the project is
complete, you've started off on the wrong foot. Although I'm the first to admit big projects
(when they are executed well and satisfy the stakeholder expectations) are resume build-
ers, it's the wrong reason to take on a project. Consider your experience level and how and
what you'll be able to contribute to the project to make it a success. It's okay if the project
is a stretch for you--you can't grow your experience without taking on more complex proj-
ects as your career progresses. But also be wise enough to know when you might be in over
your head.
    There's no substitute for integrity and honesty when conducting your projects. Once
you've tarnished your integrity, whether intentionally or not, it's almost impossible to
regain the trust of your stakeholders and management staff. Because of this, I'm never
afraid of telling anyone, "I don't know," but I always follow it up with, "But I'll find out."
You're a project manager, not a miracle worker. No one expects you to have all the answers
any more than they expect you to perform every single task on the project.
    I had the unfortunate experience of being instructed to lie about project status and
to purposely withhold project information from oversight boards. I spent a few sleepless
nights worrying about where I'd find my next job because I immediately disobeyed those
orders and reported the truth. I knew it would cost me my job. But I also knew it was better
604         Chapter 12      Closing the Project and Applying Professional Responsibility



for me to lose the job than to compromise my integrity. As it turned out, I found a new job
quickly. In retrospect, if I had not left the position when I did, my reputation would have
taken a hit--not because of anything I had done but through association with the people on
the project who compromised when they shouldn't have.
   I hope you've found this study guide helpful both for your studies for the PMP(R) exam
and for your next project. Thank you for spending some time with me in the pages of this
book. I wish you the best of luck in your project management endeavors.



Summary
Project closure is the most often neglected process of all the project management processes.
The Close Project or Phase process is the only process in the Closing process group. The
four most important tasks of closure are as follows:
      Checking the work for completeness and accuracy
      Documenting formal acceptance
      Disseminating project closure information
      Archiving records and lessons learned
    Close Project or Phase involves analyzing the project management processes to deter-
mine their effectiveness and to document lessons learned concerning them. It also involves
archiving all project documents for historical reference and performing administrative clo-
sure procedures for the project. Documenting the formal acceptance of the project product
is an important aspect of project closure as well because this ensures that the project scope,
compared to the project management plan, is complete and accurate and meets the exit cri-
teria. Ultimately, you want to assure that the stakeholder or customer is satisfied with the
work of the project and that it meets their needs.
    Projects come to an end in one of four ways: addition, starvation, integration, or
extinction. Addition is when projects evolve into their own business unit. Starvation hap-
pens because the project is starved of its resources. Integration occurs when resources are
taken from the existing project and dispersed back into the organization or assigned to
other projects. Extinction is the best ending because the project was completed, accepted,
and closed.
    Close Project or Phase is performed at the end of each phase of the project as well as at
the end of the project. Close Project or Phase involves documenting formal acceptance and
disseminating notice of acceptance to the stakeholders, customer, and others. All documen-
tation, including procurement documentation, gathered during the project and collected
during this process is archived and saved for reference purposes on future projects.
    Lessons learned document the successes and failures of the project and of the procure-
ment processes. Many times lessons learned are not documented because staff members
do not want to assign their names to project errors or failures. You and your management
team need to work together to assure employees that lessons learned are not exercises used
                                                                  Exam Essentials           605




for disciplinary purposes but benefit both the employee and the organization. Documenting
what you've learned from past experiences lets you carry this forward to new projects so
that the same errors are not repeated. It also allows you to incorporate new methods of per-
forming activities that you learned on past projects.
    Project management professionals are responsible for reporting truthful information
about their PMP(R) status and project management experience to prospective customers, cli-
ents, employers, and PMI (R). As a project manager, you're responsible for the integrity of the
project management process and the product. In all situations, you are responsible for your
own personal integrity.
    Personal integrity means adhering to an ethical standard. As part of your PMP(R) designa-
tion, you'll be required to adhere to the Code of Ethics and Professional Conduct estab-
lished by PMI (R). Part of this code involves avoiding putting your own personal gain above
the project objectives.
    As a professional, you should strive to maintain honesty in project reporting. You're
required to abide by laws, rules, and regulations regarding your industry and project man-
agement practices. You should also report any instance that might appear to be a conflict
of interest. It's always better to inform others of an apparent conflict than to have it discov-
ered by others and have your methods called into question after the fact.
    You will likely come across confidential information or intellectual property during your
project management experiences. Respect the use of this information and always verify
who might have permission to access the information and when disclosures are required.
    Stakeholders have competing needs and business issues and as such will sometimes cause
conflict on your project. You will be required to balance the needs and interests of the
stakeholders with the project objectives.
    Many project managers today are working in a global environment. It's important to
respect and understand the cultural differences that exist and not try to impose your cul-
tural beliefs on others. Culture shock is an experience that occurs when you find yourself in
an unfamiliar cultural environment. Training is a good way to provide project team mem-
bers with relationship management techniques regarding cultural and ethnic differences.



Exam Essentials
Be able to name the primary activity of the Close Project or Phase process. The key activity
of this process is concerned with completing all the activities associated with closing out the
project management processes in order to officially close out the project or phase. It also
ensures all project work is complete.
Be able to describe when the Close Project or Phase process is performed. Close Project or
Phase is performed at the close of each project phase and at the close of the project.
Be able to define the purpose of lessons learned. The purpose of lessons learned is to
describe the project successes and failures and to use the information learned on future
projects.
606       Chapter 12      Closing the Project and Applying Professional Responsibility



Be able to name the publication that describes the ethical standards to which PMP(R) cre-
dential holders are required to adhere. The ethical standards PMP(R) credential holders are
required to adhere to are described in the PMI (R) Code of Ethics and Professional Conduct.
Describe the areas in which PMP(R) credential holders must apply professional knowledge.
PMP(R) credential holders must apply professional knowledge in the areas of project manage-
ment practices, industry practices, and technical areas.
Know the key activity that ensures customer satisfaction. The key activity that ensures
customer satisfaction is documenting project requirements and meeting them.
Define how multinational project managers must manage relationships. Multinational
project managers manage relationships by building relationships based on mutual trust and
acceptance and by recognizing and respecting diverse cultures and ethnic beliefs.

    One of the competing vendors invites you to lunch. What is the most appropriate response?
    A. Thank them, but let them know this could be a conflict of interest since you haven't
       made a decision about which vendor you're going to choose.
    B.   Thank them, and decline. You know this could be considered personal gain, which
         could call your integrity into question.
    C.   Thank them, and accept. You don't believe there is a conflict of interest or a personal
         integrity issue.
    D.   Thank them, and decline. You believe this could be a conflict of interest on the part of
         the vendor, and you don't want to encourage that behavior.

12. You are a project manager for a telecommunications firm. You're working on a project that
    entails upgrading technical hardware and equipment. The estimated cost of the hardware
    and equipment is $1,725,000. You are reviewing products from three vendors. One of the
    vendors offers you and your family the use of the company yacht for the upcoming three-

         part of the vendor.
610          Chapter 12      Closing the Project and Applying Professional Responsibility



13. You are a project manager working on contract with a company in a foreign country. At the
    project kickoff meeting, you are given an expensive-looking gift. The person who presented
    this to you said that it is customary in their country to give their business partners gifts.
    What is the most appropriate response?
      A. Thank them, and decline. Explain that this is considered personal gain, which is
         unacceptable in your country.
      B.   Thank them, and accept. You don't believe there is a conflict of interest or an integrity
           issue at stake.
      C.   Thank them, and decline. Explain that this is considered a conflict of interest, which is
           unacceptable in your country.
      D.   Thank them, and accept because you know that it would be considered offensive to
           decline the gift in their culture. Immediately report the acceptance of the gift to the
           appropriate parties at your company so that your actions are not called into question
           later.

14. Life seems to be going very well for your close friend, a project manager, who like you has
    PMP (R) certification. She has taken a trip to France, purchased a new car, and stocked her
    wine cellar with a couple dozen expensive bottles of wine, all within the last six months.
    After a few cocktails one evening, she tells you her secret. The vendor she's working with
    on the $4 billion project she's managing has given her all of these items as gifts. Which
    scenario is the most appropriate?
      A. You tell your friend these gifts probably aren't appropriate and leave it at that.
      B.   You and your friend have a long conversation about the gifts, and she decides to return
           them (with the exception of the trip) and not accept any more gifts in the future.
      C.   You're happy for your friend and say nothing.
      D.   Your friend doesn't see a problem with accepting these gifts at all. You know this is a
           conflict-of-interest situation and should be reported as an ethical violation.

15. As a project manager, you know that the most important activity to ensure customer and
    stakeholder satisfaction is which of the following?
      A. Documenting and meeting the requirements
      B.   Documenting and meeting the performance measurements
      C.   Reporting changes and updating the project plan and other project documents where
           appropriate
      D.   Reporting project status regularly and in a timely manner

16. Your upcoming project includes project team members from a foreign country. To make
    certain that cultural differences don't interfere with team performance, thereby affecting

      A. Provide diversity training to all the team members.
      B.   Colocate the project team.
                                                                   Review Questions             611



    C.   Perform team-building exercises.
    D.   Inform the team members of the organization's rules and standards.

17. You are a contract project manager working with the State of Bliss. Your latest project
    involves rewriting the Department of Revenue's income tax system. One of the key
    stakeholders is a huge movie buff, and she has the power to promote you into a better
    position at the conclusion of this project. She has discovered that one of her favorite
    superstars lives in the State of Bliss and, therefore, must file income tax returns in that
    state. She asks you to look up the account of this movie star. What is the most appropriate
    response?
    A. Report her to the management team.
    B.   Refuse to comply with the request, citing conflict of interest and violation of
         confidential company data.
    C.   Look up the information she has requested. Because the data is considered part of the
         project, there is no conflict of interest.
    D.   You believe that tax records are public information, so you comply with the request.

18. You are a contract project manager working with the State of Bliss. Your latest project
    involves rewriting the Department of Revenue's income tax system. As project manager,
    you have taken all the appropriate actions regarding confidentiality of data. One of the
    key stakeholders is a huge movie buff, and she has the power to promote you into a better
    position at the conclusion of this project. She's reviewing some report data that just happens
    to include confidential information regarding one of her favorite movie superstars. What is
    the most appropriate response?
    A. Report her to the management team.
    B.   Request that she immediately return the information, citing conflict of interest and
         violation of confidential company data.
    C.   Do nothing, because she has the proper level of access rights to the data and this
         information showed up unintentionally.
    D.   Request that she immediately return the information until you can confirm that she
         has the proper level of access rights to the data.

19. You are a project manager with several years of experience in project management. You've
    accepted your first project in a foreign country. You've been in the country a week or two
    and are experiencing some disorientation. This is known as which of the following?
    A. Colocation
    B.   Diversity shock
    C.   Global culturing

612          Chapter 12      Closing the Project and Applying Professional Responsibility



20. You are a project manager for a software manufacturing firm. The project you just finished
    created a new software product that is expected to become a number-one seller. All
    prerelease of software is handled through the marketing department. A friend of yours,
    who is a certified software instructor, asks you for a copy of the software prior to the beta
    release so they can become familiar with it. What is the most appropriate response?
      A. Decline the request because the software is the intellectual property of the company.
      B.   Ask them to sign a nondisclosure agreement before releasing a copy of the software.
      C.   Decline the request because you stand to gain from this transaction by receiving free
           training.
      D.   Because your friend is certified to teach your company's brand of software, provide
           them with a copy of the software.

           Questions
614         Appendix A        Answers to Review Questions




Chapter 1: What is a Project?
1.    C. The Project Management Institute (PMI(R)) is the industry-recognized standard for
      project management practices.

2.    B. Projects exist to create a unique product, service, or result. The logon screen in this
      question is not a unique product. A minor change has been requested, indicating that this is
      an ongoing operations function. Some of the criteria for projects are that they are unique,
      temporary with definitive start and end dates, and considered complete when the project
      goals are achieved.

3.    A. This is a project. The product line is new, which implies that this is a unique product--it
      hasn't been done before. You can discern a definite start and end date by the fact that the
      new appliances must be ready by the spring catalog release.

4.    D. Progressive elaboration is the process of determining the characteristics and features
      of the product of the project. Progressive elaboration is carried out via steps in detailed
      fashion.

5.    D. A project is considered successful when it achieves its objectives and stakeholder needs
      and expectations are met.

6.    B. Conflicts between stakeholders should always be resolved in favor of the customer. This
      question emphasizes the importance of identifying your stakeholders and their needs as
      early as possible in the project.

7.    C. Project management brings together a set of tools and techniques to organize project
      activities. Project managers are the ones responsible for managing the project management
      processes.

8.    B. There are three ways phases can be performed in a multiphased project: sequential,
      iterative, and overlapping. Iterative is when more than one phase is being performed at the
      same time and overlapping occurs when one phase starts before the prior phase completes.
      All phases should perform a phase gate review.

9.    D. Portfolios are collections of projects and/or programs. The projects or programs do not
      have to be directly related or interdependent to reside within the portfolio.

10. A. Team members choose items from the backlog list to work on during the upcoming
    sprint at the sprint planning meeting.

11. A. The storyboard is a deliverable. Because the phases are performed sequentially, the
    deliverable must be approved before the next phase of the project can begin.

12. C. The best answer to this question according to the PMBOK(R) Guide is to negotiate with
    the functional manager to participate in the business analyst's annual performance review.
    Option D is an appropriate response but doesn't include the direction that the project
    manager should participate in the performance review.
                                           Chapter 2: Creating the Project Charter             615



13. B. The level of authority the project manager has is determined by the organizational
    structure, interactions with various management levels, and the project management
    maturity level of the organization.

14. A. Advantages for employees in a functional organization are that they have only one
    supervisor and a clear chain of command exists.

15. D. Employees in a balanced matrix often report to two or more managers. Functional
    managers and project managers share authority and responsibility for projects. There is a
    balance of power between the functional managers and project managers.

16. C. This question describes the Agile methodology, which uses daily standups, sprint
    planning meetings, and retrospectives, and works with a Scrum master and product owner.

17. D. Remember the acronym that sounds like syrup of ipecac: IPECC (Initiating, Planning,
    Executing, Monitoring and Controlling, and Closing).

18. B. An iterative phase relationship allows you to work more than one phase at a time.

19. C. The Initiating process group is where stakeholders have the greatest ability to influence
    outcomes of the project. Risk is highest during this stage because of the high degree of
    unknown factors.

20. A. The three types of PMOs are supportive, controlling, and directive.



Chapter 2: Creating the Project Charter
1.   A. OPAs are internal to the organization. EEFs can be internal or external to the
     organization but they are always outside the control of the project team.

2.   B. This came about because of an organizational need. Staff members were spending
     unproductive hours producing information for the management report that wasn't
     consistent or meaningful.

3.   A. Develop Project Charter has four inputs, and they are business documents, agreements,
     enterprise environmental factors, and organizational process assets.

4.   C. The most correct answer is to perform a feasibility study. Because this project is taking
     the company into a new, unknown market, there's lots of potential for error and failure. A
     feasibility study would help the stakeholders determine whether the project is viable and
     cost effective and whether it has a high potential for success.

5.   D. Project Schedule Management involves the following processes: Plan Schedule
     Management, Define Activities, Sequence Activities, Estimate Activity Durations, Develop
     Schedule, and Control Schedule.
616          Appendix A       Answers to Review Questions



6.    B. The benefits management plan outlines the benefits of the project (both tangible and
      intangible), describes a timeline in which the benefits will be realized, and describes the
      strategic alignment of the benefits. Commercial databases are an example of an internal
      EEF.

7.    B. Historical information on projects of a similar nature can be helpful when initiating new
      projects. They can help in formulating project deliverables and identifying constraints and
      assumptions and will be helpful later in the project Planning processes as well.

8.    C. The Project Integration Management Knowledge Area consists of the following
      processes: Develop Project Charter, Develop Project Management Plan, Direct and Manage
      Project Work, Manage Project Knowledge, Monitor and Control Project Work, Perform
      Integrated Change Control, and Close Project or Phase.

9.    A. Option B describes the project exit criteria. Option C is not true, and Option D is
      partially true. The project manager does not dictate what the approval requirements are.
      The stakeholders and sponsor will come to an agreement on the success criteria, and the
      project manager may or may not have a voice in the decision.

10. B. Projects with NPV greater than 0 should be given an accept recommendation.

11. B. Projects with the highest IRR value are favored over projects with lower IRR values.

12. A. Net present value (NPV) assumes reinvestment is made at the cost of capital.

13. C. Year 1 and 2 inflows are each $100,000 for a total of $200,000. Year 3 inflows are an
    additional $300,000. Add one more quarter to this total, and the $575,000 is reached in
    three years and three months, or 39 months.

14. D. IRR assumes reinvestment at the IRR rate and is the discount rate when NPV is
    equal to 0.

15. C. The purpose of the business case is to understand the business need for the project and
    determine whether the investment in the project is worthwhile. This may include analysis
    using benefit measurement methods. The benefits, how they're measured, and how they're
    obtained are contained in the benefits management plan.

16. A. Salience models are displayed as Venn diagrams but are more useful for large, complex
    projects. The power/interest grid is useful for smaller projects with uncomplicated
    stakeholder interactions.

17. B. Project B has a payback period of 21 months; $50,000 is received in the first 12 months,
    with another $75,000 coming in over each of the next three quarters, or nine months.

18. C. Payback period does not consider the time value of money and is, therefore, the least
    precise of all the cash flow analysis techniques.

19. C. The project should be kicked off with a project charter that authorizes the project to
    begin, assigns the project manager, and describes the project objectives and purpose for the
    project. Doing so ensures that everyone is working with the same purposes in mind.

20. D. According to the PMBOK(R) Guide, the project charter should be issued by the project
    sponsor or the project initiator.
                             Chapter 3: Developing the Project Scope Statement                  617




Chapter 3: Developing the Project
Scope Statement
1.   A. The policies, rules, systems, relationships, and norms are part of the organizational
     governance framework, which is part of the EEF input for the Develop Project Management
     Plan process. Management elements include authority levels of works, disciplinary actions,
     chain of command, fair treatment, fair payment, communication channels, and safety of
     staff members.

2.   C. The project management plan describes the processes you'll use to perform the project
     and describes how the project will be executed, monitored, and controlled and how the
     work of the project will be executed to meet the objectives.

3.   B. The scope management plan describes how project scope will be defined and validated,
     how the scope statement will be developed, how the WBS will be created and defined,
     and how project scope will be managed and controlled. Project scope is measured against
     the project management plan, whereas product scope is measured against the product
     requirements. It is based on the approved project scope.

4.   D. These four decision-making techniques belong to the Collect Requirements process and
     are part of the decision-making tool and technique in this process.

5.   B. The project scope statement further elaborates the project deliverables and documents
     the product scope description, acceptance criteria, and project exclusions. It serves as a
     basis for future project decisions.

6.   D. The requirements traceability matrix links requirements to their origin and traces them
     throughout the project. Option A describes the requirements management plan, not the
     requirements document. Option B is partially true with the exception of the first statement.
     Requirements documents do not have to be formal or complex. Option C refers to the
     project scope statement, not the requirements.

7.   C. The scope baseline consists of the approved project scope statement, the WBS, work
     packages, planning packages, and the WBS dictionary.

8.   D. Alternatives analysis is a part of the data analysis tool and technique of the Define
     Scope process that includes brainstorming and lateral thinking techniques.

9.   C. You could use each product as a level one entry on the WBS so Option A is correct,
     but you may choose to construct the WBS differently. Option C is not correct because
     rolling wave planning is the process of fully elaborating near-term WBS work packages
     and expanding others, like the third product in this question, at a later time when all
     information is known.

10. D. Option A might seem like a correct answer, but Option D is more correct. There isn't
    enough information to determine whether stakeholders will require overtime. We do know
    that poor scope definition might lead to cost increases, rework, schedule delays, and poor
    morale.
618         Appendix A        Answers to Review Questions



11. D. Each element in the WBS is assigned a unique identifier called a code of accounts
    identifier. Typically, these codes are associated with a corporate chart of accounts and are
    used to track the costs of the individual work elements in the WBS.

12. A. The work package level is the lowest level in the WBS and facilitates resource
    assignment and cost and time estimates. In this question, the work package level contains
    four subprojects, so it would not be used to create the activity list. The activity list will be
    created from the work package level for each WBS created for each subproject.

13. C. The primary constraint is time. Since the trade show demos depend on project
    completion and the trade show is in late September, the date cannot be moved. The budget
    is the secondary constraint in this example.

14. A. Decomposition subdivides the major deliverables into smaller components. It is a
    tool and technique of the Create WBS process and is used to create a WBS. Level two
    components might be deliverables, phases, subprojects, or some combination.

15. B. Product analysis includes techniques such as value engineering, value analysis, systems
    analysis, systems engineering, product breakdown, and functional analysis.

16. D. The primary constraint is quality. If you made the assumption as stated in Options A,
    B, and C, you assumed incorrectly. Clarify these assumptions with your stakeholders and
    project sponsors.

17. C. This is an example of an assumption. You've used this vendor before and haven't had
    any problems. You're assuming there will be no problems with this delivery based on your
    past experience.

18. B. Constraints restrict the actions of the project team.

19. A. The project came about because of a business need. The phones have to be answered
    because that's the core business. Upgrading the system to handle more volume is a business
    need. An assumption has been made regarding vendor availability. Always validate your
    assumptions.

20. B. The steps of decomposition include identify major deliverables, organize and determine
    the structure, identify lower-level components, assign identification codes, and verify
    correctness of decomposition.



Chapter 4: Creating the Project Schedule
1.    C. The tools and techniques for Estimate Activity Durations are expert judgment,
      analogous estimating, parametric estimating, three-point estimating, bottom-up estimating,
      data analysis (alternatives analysis, reserve analysis), decision making, and meetings.

2.    B. The Sequence Activities process produces project schedule network diagrams and project
      documents updates, which include updating the activity list, activity attributes, assumption
      log, and milestone list. The purpose of this process is to identify all activity dependencies.
                                            Chapter 4: Creating the Project Schedule                 619



3.   C. Reserve analysis takes schedule risk into consideration and adds a percentage of time or
     additional work periods to the estimate to prevent schedule delays.

4.   A. Parametric estimating uses an algorithm or formula that multiplies a known element--
     such as the quantity of materials needed--by the time it takes to install or complete one
     unit of materials. The result is a total estimate for the activity. In this case, 10 servers
     multiplied by 16 hours per server gives you a 160-hour total duration estimate.

5.   C. The activity list is a component of the project schedule, not the WBS. The activity list
     includes all the project activities, an identifier, and a description of the activity. The activity
     list is an output of the Define Activities process.

6.   D. This is an example of a mandatory dependency, also known as hard logic. Mandatory
     dependencies are inherent in the nature of the work. Discretionary dependencies, also called
     preferred logic, preferential logic, and soft logic, are defined by the project management
     team.

7.   A. The precedence diagramming method is also known as the activity on node (AON)
     diagramming method. GERT stands for Graphical Evaluation and Review Technique, a
     diagramming method that allows for conditions, branches, and loops.

8.   B. The arrow diagramming method uses only finish-to-start dependencies.

9.   D. Finish-to-start (FS) is the most commonly used logical relationship in PDM and the
     default relationship in most project management software packages.

10. C. CPM calculates a single early and late start date and a single early and late finish date
    for each activity. Once these dates are known, float time is calculated for each activity to
    determine the critical path. The other answers contain elements of PERT calculations.

11. B. The only information you have for this example is activity duration; therefore, the
    critical path is the path with the longest duration. Path A-D-E-H with a duration of 34 days
    is the critical path.

12. D. The only information you have for this example is activity duration, so you must
    calculate the critical path based on the durations given. The duration of A-B-C-E-H
    increased by 3 days, for a total of 35 days. The duration of A-F-G-H and A-F-G-E-H each
    increased by 3 days. A-F-G-E-H totals 36 days and becomes the new critical path.

13. D. You calculate the critical path by adding together the durations of all the tasks with zero
    or negative float. The critical path can be compressed using crashing techniques.

14. C. The calculation for PERT is the sum of optimistic time plus pessimistic time plus four
    times the most likely time divided by 6. The calculation for this example is as follows:
    [48 + 72 + (4 x 60)] / 6 = 60.

15. D. You calculate the standard deviation by subtracting the optimistic time from the
    pessimistic time and dividing the result by 6. The calculation for this example is as follows:
    (72 - 48) / 6 = 4.

16. D. There is a 95 percent probability that the work will finish within plus or minus two
    standard deviations. The expected value is 500, and the standard deviation times 2 is 24, so
    the activity will take from 476 to 524 days.
620          Appendix A       Answers to Review Questions



17. B. A 68 percent probability is calculated using plus or minus one standard deviation,
    a 95 percent probability uses plus or minus two standard deviations, and a 99 percent
    probability uses plus or minus three standard deviations.

18. A. Crashing the schedule includes tasks such as adding resources to the critical path tasks
    or speeding up deliveries of materials and resources.

19. C. Resource leveling is used for overallocated resources and allows for changes to the
    schedule completion dates. Crashing and fast tracking are schedule compression techniques
    that shorten the schedule. Resource smoothing techniques will not allow for changes to
    the critical path or project end date, and since you are concerned about not overusing this
    resource, lengthening the schedule is a better option.

20. A. Project management software is a useful tool for the project manager, and it automates
    project scheduling, allowing for what-if analysis and easy changes. But if you focus too
    much on the tool and ignore the project, the tool becomes a hindrance.



Chapter 5: Developing the Project
Budget and Communicating the Plan
1.    A. The communications management plan defines and manages the flow of project
      information, not the stakeholder engagement plan. The stakeholder engagement plan does
      contain information about the distribution, reasons, and timing of information.

2.    D. The cost management plan, an output of the Plan Cost Management process, is used to
      establish the criteria for planning, estimating, budgeting, and controlling costs. It is based
      on the approved project charter, project schedule, the risk management plan, and other
      information in order to manage project costs.

3.    D. Control thresholds are variance thresholds (typically stated as a percentage of deviation
      from the baseline) used for monitoring cost performance.

4.    C. A control account can be placed at any level of the WBS and is used for earned value
      measurement calculations regarding project costs.

5.    A. Scope definition is the key component of determining cost estimates. It should be
      completed early in the project because costs are more easily influenced at the beginning of
      the project.

6.    B. Three-point estimating can improve activity cost estimates because they factor in
      estimation uncertainty and risk.

7.    A. Reserve analysis accounts for cost uncertainty by including a contingency reserve,
      usually expressed as a percentage of the estimated cost.
       Chapter 5: Developing the Project Budget and Communicating the Plan                       621



8.   C. The expected activity cost using the three-point beta distribution formula (also known
     as PERT) is calculated this way: [(4 x most likely) + optimistic + pessimistic] / 6. Therefore,
     the answer is [(4 x 42) + 35 + 54] / 6 = 43.

9.   C. Future period operating costs are considered ongoing costs and are not part of project
     costs.

10. B. Bottom-up techniques are the most time-consuming and generally the most accurate
    estimates you can use. With bottom-up estimating, each work item is estimated and rolled
    up to a project total.

11. A. Funding limit reconciliation concerns reconciling the funds to be spent on the project
    with funding limits placed on the funding commitments for the project.

12. B. The cost baseline is displayed as an S-curve because of the way project spending occurs.
    Spending begins slowly, picks up speed until the spending peak is reached, and then tapers
    off as the project winds down.

13. D. Cost of quality is part of the data analysis tool and technique of Estimate Costs. The
    tools and techniques of Determine Budget are cost aggregation, data analysis (reserve
    analysis), expert judgment, historical information review, funding limit reconciliation, and
    financing.

14. A. Analogous--or top-down--estimating techniques are a form of expert judgment.
    Because this project is similar to another recent project, you can use the cost estimates
    from the previous project to help you quickly determine estimates for the current
    project.

15. D. There are 36 channels of communication, yourself plus 8 stakeholders. The formula
    is 9(9-1)/2 = 36. Lines of communication are considered when using the communications
    requirements analysis tool and technique.

16. D. Expert judgement, communications requirements analysis, communication
    technology, communication models, communication methods, interpersonal and team
    skills (communication styles assessment, political awareness, cultural awareness), data
    representation (stakeholder engagement assessment matrix), and meetings are the tools and
    techniques of the Plan Communications Management process.

17. C. Acknowledgment means the receiver has received the message but does not mean they
    agree with the message.

18. A. Push communication ensures that information is distributed to specific recipients but
    does not certify that it was understood by the intended recipients.

19. B. This describes interactive communication. It is a communication method, which is a tool
    and technique of Plan Communications Management.

20. C. Reasons for the distribution of information belong in the communications management
    plan.
622          Appendix A        Answers to Review Questions




Chapter 6: Risk Planning
1.    B. Ambiguity risk is addressed using gap analysis or benchmarking. Document what you
      know, and identify what is uncertain or not understood and work with experts outside of
      the organization to fill in the gaps in knowledge.

2.    C. The purpose of Perform Qualitative Risk Analysis is to determine what impact the
      identified risk events will have on the project and the probability they'll occur. It also puts
      risks in priority order according to their effects on the project objectives and assigns a risk
      score for the project.

3.    B. The risk management plan details how risk management processes will be implemented,
      monitored, and controlled throughout the life of the project. The risk management plan
      does not include responses to risks or triggers. Responses to risks are documented in the
      risk register as part of the Plan Risk Responses process.

4.    C. Continuous probability distributions graphically display the probability of risk to the
      project objectives as well as the time or cost elements.

5.    D. The data representation tool and technique called a bubble chart is a way to graphically
      display three factors of risk characteristics.

6.    C. Criticality analysis determines the risk impact to critical path tasks on the project
      schedule.

7.    C. Forecasted results of the project schedule and costs as determined by the outcomes of
      risk analysis is an update that is produced from the Perform Quantitative Risk Analysis
      process.

8.    B. This risk event has the potential to save money on project costs, so it's an opportunity,
      and the appropriate strategy to use in this case is the exploit strategy.

9.    D. This risk event has the potential to save money on project costs. Sharing involves using a
      third party to help ensure that the opportunity occurs.

10. A. The best answer is A. Triggers are warning signs of an impending risk event.

11. C. The probability and impact matrix multiplies the probability and impact to determine
    a risk score. Using this score and a predetermined matrix, you determine if the score is a
    high, medium, or low designation.

12. B. Monte Carlo analysis is a simulation technique that computes project costs many times
    in an iterative fashion.

13. C. Mitigation attempts to reduce the impact of a risk event should it occur. Making plans
    to arrange for the leased equipment reduces the consequences of the risk.

14. B. Risk appetite and risk threshold are the components of risk attitude.
                                            Chapter 7: Planning Project Resources                623



15. A. This question describes risk threshold levels of the stakeholders. Risk triggers are
    recorded in the risk register during the Plan Risk Responses process. The risk of buying
    a machine from a new supplier would pose a threat to the project, not an opportunity.
    Interviewing might have been used, but this question wasn't describing the Identify Risks
    process.

16. B. The question describes sensitivity analysis, which is a tool and technique of the Perform
    Quantitative Risk Analysis process. Tornado diagrams are often used to display sensitivity
    analysis data.

17. B. This question describes a prompt list, used in the Identify Risks process as a tool and
    technique to help the team determine risks for the project.

18. D. The RBS describes risk categories, and the lowest level can be used as a prompt list to
    help identify risks. Risk owners are not assigned from the RBS but typically are assigned as
    soon as the risk is identified.

19. D. This is a response strategy known as passive acceptance because the team has decided
    to take no action and make no plans for the risk. This is a strategy that can be used for
    either positive or negative risks.

20. C. Perform Qualitative Risk Analysis is a fast and easy method of determining probability
    and impact.



Chapter 7: Planning Project Resources
1.   D. Make-or-buy analysis is determining whether it's more cost effective to purchase the
     goods or services needed for the project or more cost effective for the organization to
     produce them internally.

2.   C. Firm fixed-price (FFP) contracts have the highest risk to the seller and the least amount
     of risk to the buyer. However, the price the vendor charges for the product or service will
     compensate for the amount of risk they're assuming.

3.   B. Either the buyer or the seller can write the SOW. Sometimes the buyer will write the
     SOW and the seller might modify it and send it back to the buyer for verification and
     approval.

4.   A. The cost plus incentive fee (CPIF) contract reimburses the seller for the seller's allowable
     costs and includes an incentive or bonus for exceeding the performance criteria laid out in
     the contract.

5.   D. The RAM and RACI charts are part of the data representation tool and technique of
     this process.
624         Appendix A       Answers to Review Questions



6.    C. Source selection criteria can be based on price alone when there are multiple vendors who
      can readily supply the goods or services. The question states that only three vendors make
      the machine, which means source selection criteria should be based on more than price.

7.    A. A constraint can be anything that limits the option of the project team. Organizational
      structures, collective bargaining agreements, and economic conditions are all constraints
      that you might encounter during this process.

8.    B. Fixed-price contracts can include incentives for meeting performance criteria, but the
      question states the vendor helping with the programming task will be reimbursed for their
      costs and, depending on your satisfaction with their results, may receive an additional
      award. This describes a cost plus award fee contract.

9.    A. RACI stands for responsible, accountable, consult, and inform.

10. B. Plan Procurement Management can directly influence the project schedule, and the
    project schedule can directly influence this process.

11. B. This is a cost-reimbursable contract that includes a fee as a percentage of allowable
    costs. This type of contract is known as a cost plus percentage of cost (CPPC) contract.

12. A. Design of experiments is not a named tool and technique of any process but is
    commonly used in the Plan Quality Management process to provide statistical analysis for
    changing key product or process elements all at once (not one at a time) to optimize the
    process.

13. C. Philip Crosby devised the zero defects theory, meaning do it right the first time. Proper
    Plan Quality Management leads to less rework and higher productivity. Joseph Juran's
    fitness for use says that stakeholders' and customers' expectations are met or exceeded.

14. A. W. Edwards Deming conjectured that the cost of quality is a management problem 85
    percent of the time and that once the problem trickles down to the workers, it is outside
    their control.

15. C. The benefits of meeting quality requirements are increased stakeholder satisfaction,
    lower costs, higher productivity, and less rework.

16. A. Internal failure costs are costs associated with not meeting the customer's expectations
    while you still had control over the product. This results in rework, scrapping, and
    downtime.

17. B. Quality metrics are an output of the Plan Quality Management process and not part of
    the quality management plan.

18. D. This is an example of design of experiments.

19. B. Six Sigma is a measurement-based strategy that focuses on process improvement and
    variation reduction by applying Six Sigma methodologies to the project.

20. C. Teaming agreements are not a named input of the Plan Procurement Management
    process, but they are an input to all of the Planning processes collectively.
                                           Chapter 8: Developing the Project Team                 625




Chapter 8: Developing the Project Team
1.   B. Corrective action brings anticipated future project outcomes back into alignment with
     the project management plan. Because an important deadline that depends on a positive
     outcome of this test is looming, the equipment is exchanged so that the project plan and
     project schedule are not impacted.

2.   A. The most difficult aspect of the Direct and Manage Project Work process is
     coordinating and integrating all the project elements. The clue to this question is in the
     next-to-last sentence.

3.   A. The Executing process group and Monitoring and Controlling process group serve as
     inputs to each other.

4.   B. This question describes the deliverable output. Deliverables can be intangibles, such as
     the completion of training.

5.   D. Work performance data includes elements such as schedule status, the status of
     deliverables completion, lessons learned, and resource utilization.

6.   C. The enterprise environmental factors input of the Acquire Resources process considers
     elements such as prior experience, interest in working on the project, cost rates, and
     availability of potential team members.

7.   A. This question describes a defect repair that was discovered and implemented. Defect
     repairs come about as a result of approved changes. Approved changes are implemented in
     the Direct and Manage Project Work process. The question implies that the change request
     was approved because the problem was corrected and the rest of the production run went
     smoothly.

8.   B. Teams in the norming stage of team development exhibit affection and familiarity with
     one another and make joint decisions.

9.   C. The introduction of a new team member will start the formation and development of
     the team all over again with the forming stage.

10. D. Delegating is a situational leadership style that is used when team members have
    performed the task before and need little to no input from the manager. The supporting
    style requires some input from the leader. An autocratic manager makes all the decisions
    with no input from the team, and the laissez-faire leader lets the team make all the decisions
    and has little involvement with the team. Neither the autocratic nor laissez-faire leadership
    style is a named style in the Blanchard Situational Leadership II Model.

11. B. The Expectancy Theory says that people are motivated by the expectation of good
    outcomes. The outcome must be reasonable and attainable.

12. B. Colocation would bring your team members together in the same location and allow
    them to function more efficiently as a team. At a minimum, meeting in a common room,
    such as a war room, for all team meetings would bring the team closer together.
626          Appendix A       Answers to Review Questions



13. B. Collaborate/problem solve is a problem-solving technique that seeks to determine the
    facts and find solutions based on the facts. It involves hearing multiple viewpoints and
    examining several perspectives. This results in a win-win resolution for all parties.

14. A. Referent power is power that is inferred on a leader by their subordinates as a result of
    the high level of respect for the leader.

15. B. Theory Y managers believe that people will perform their best if they're provided with
    the proper motivation and the right expectations.

16. A. Improving competencies, team interactions, and the team environment are
    characteristics of the Develop Team process, not the Manage Team process.

17. D. This technique is called 360-degree feedback. It's part of the project performance
    appraisals tool and technique of the Manage Team process.

18. C. This question refers to preassignments, which are a tool and technique of the Acquire
    Resources process. The other tools and techniques of this process are decision making,
    interpersonal and team skills, and virtual teams.

19. B. Smoothing (also known as accommodating) and withdrawal (also known as avoidance)
    are both lose-lose techniques. Forcing is a win-lose technique. Compromise and reconcile is
    where neither side wins or loses.

20. D. Theory Z encourages employee loyalty because jobs are offered for life. This leads to
    increased productivity, morale, and high employee satisfaction.



Chapter 9: Conducting Procurements
and Sharing Information
1.    D. Procurement documentation include bids, quotations, RFIs, IFBs, RFPs, RFQs, and so
      on as you learned in the Plan Procurement Management process. They are an input of the
      Conduct Procurements process.

2.    C. Receivers filter information through cultural considerations, knowledge of the subject
      matter, language abilities, geographic location, emotions, and attitudes.

3.    A. Project reports describe project status and are an item that is distributed, not a
      distribution tool.

4.    B. Groups of 5 to 11 participants make the most accurate decisions.

5.    B. Lessons learned (which is what this question describes) are useful for activities and
      processes for the current project as well as future projects.

6.    A. Weighted systems are a type of proposal evaluation technique, which is part of the data
      analysis tool and technique of this process used to evaluate vendors based on selection
      criteria defined by the organization.
                 Chapter 9: Conducting Procurements and Sharing Information                    627



7.   D. Bidder conferences are also known as vendor conferences, prebid conferences, and
     contractor conferences, according to the PMBOK (R) Guide.

8.   D. Qualified seller lists are a component of the organizational process assets input of
     Conduct Procurements. Their purpose is to provide information about the sellers.

9.   C. The cause-and-effect diagram--also called fishbone diagrams or Ishikawa diagrams--
     show the relationships between the causes and effects of problems.

10. C. Fait accompli is a tactic used during contract negotiations where one party convinces
    the other that the particular issue is no longer relevant or cannot be changed.

11. B. Market research is a part of the data gathering tool and technique of the Plan
    Procurement Management process. The tools and techniques of Conduct Procurements
    are expert judgment, advertising, bidder conferences, data analysis (proposal evaluation
    techniques), and interpersonal and team skills (negotiation).

12. B. The acceptance of work results happens later during the Validate Scope process, not
    during a quality audit.

13. A. Process analysis is part of the data analysis tool and technique in the Manage Quality
    process and involves examining constraints, problems, and activities that don't add value to
    create process improvements.

14. C. The data representation tool and technique of Manage Quality includes: affinity diagrams,
    cause-and-effect diagrams, flowcharts, histograms, matrix diagrams, and scatter dia-
    grams. This question refers to tree diagrams that are other data representation tools you
    could use in this process, including PDPCs, interrelationship digraphs, tree diagrams,
    prioritization matrices, and activity network diagrams.

15. C. Face-to-face meetings are the most effective means for resolving stakeholder issues,
    provided these meetings are practical.

16. B. Status meetings are to report on the progress of the project. They are not for demos or
    show-and-tell. Option C is not correct because stakeholders are not concerned about the
    content of the technical documentation; they need to know that a qualified technician has
    reviewed the technical documentation and that the documentation task is accurate and
    complete.

17. D. Agreements include contracts, purchase orders, a work order against an existing
    contract, or other forms.

18. A. The project manager alone is responsible for managing stakeholder expectations.

19. B. Procurement negotiations, part of the interpersonal and team skills tool and technique
    of Conduct Procurements, can become its own process with inputs and outputs for large or
    complex projects.

20. C. The requirements phase is where the SOW is prepared. The fourth phase is where the
    contract is awarded. The solicitation phase is where bids and proposals are prepared.
    However, evaluation criteria are not applied and reviewed until the award phase. The
    requisition phase is where the RFP is prepared.
628         Appendix A        Answers to Review Questions




Chapter 10: Measuring and Controlling
Project Performance
1.    D. The Monitor and Control Project Work process involves reporting actual project results
      and how they compare to the project management plan, analyzing performance data,
      monitoring change requests, and more.

2.    C. You are in the Monitor and Control Project Work process and should recommend a
      change request that can take the form of a corrective action. Preventive actions reduce the
      possibility of negative impacts from risk events and do not apply to this situation.

3.    D. Negotiation, using ADR, is the preferred method of settling claims or disputes in the
      Control Procurements process.

4.    D. Inspections and audits are both tools and techniques of the Control Procurements
      process.

5.    C. The contract change control system describes the processes you'll use to make changes
      to the contract; it is not a means of communication. The changes might include contract
      term changes, date changes, and termination of a contract.

6.    B. According to the PMBOK (R) Guide, the Control Procurements process is closely
      coordinated with the Direct and Manage Project Work, Control Quality, Perform
      Integrated Change Control, and Monitor Risks processes.

7.    A. Status review meetings are a type of work performance report, which is an output of
      Monitor and Control Project Work.

8.    A. This question describes the Monitor Communications process, which is concerned
      with collecting and reporting information regarding project progress and project
      accomplishments to the stakeholders.

9.    A. The tools and techniques of the Monitor Communications process are: expert
      judgement, PMIS, data representation (stakeholder engagement assessment matrix),
      interpersonal and team skills (observation/conversation), and meetings. Data analysis listed
      in Option A is from the Control Procurements process.

10. B. The Delphi method, technology forecasting, scenario building, and forecast by analogy
    are all in the judgmental methods category of forecasting.

11. B. This question describes the project documents-issue log input of the Monitor
    Communications process. It is used to track issues, assign owners, track due dates, and
    more. Options A and C are tools and techniques of this process, and Option D is an input.

12. B. When you are dealing with contested changes, ADR (alternative dispute resolution)
    is the technique you should use first to try to reach resolution. The other options are
    alternatives after you've tried ADR.
                                              Chapter 11: Controlling Work Results               629



13. B. Change requests are submitted through other processes like the Monitor and Control
    Project Work process, and they are reviewed, tracked, managed, analyzed, and documented
    in this process.

14. D. Change control systems are documented procedures that describe how to submit change
    requests. They track the status of the change requests, document the management impacts
    of change, track the change approval status, and define the level of authority needed to
    approve changes. Change control systems do not approve or deny the changes--that's the
    responsibility of the change control board (CCB).

15. C. The key to this question was that the characteristics of the product were documented
    with this tool. Configuration management documents the physical characteristics and the
    functionality of the product of the project.

16. C. Change control boards (CCBs) review change requests and have the authority to
    approve or deny them. Their authority is defined by the configuration control and change
    control process.

17. A. The three activities associated with configuration management are configuration
    identification, configuration status accounting, and configuration verification and auditing.

18. D. Configuration management systems are a way to manage approved changes and
    baselines.

19. C. These are elements with which the Monitor and Control Project Work process is
    concerned.

20. C. The other names for CCB's may include TAB, which stands for technical assessment
    board; TRB, which is a technical review board; and ERB, which is an engineering review
    board.



Chapter 11: Controlling Work Results
1.   A. Changes to product scope should be reflected in the project scope.

2.   D. Scatter diagrams display the relationship between an independent and dependent
     variable over time.

3.   C. WBS element changes are scope changes. According to the PMBOK (R) Guide, schedule
     revisions are often required as a result of scope changes.

4.   C. The Validate Scope process is concerned with the acceptance of work results. It also
     formalizes the acceptance of the project scope.

5.   B. Validate Scope should document the level and degree of completion of the project given
     the circumstances in this question. If you come back at a later date and restart this project,
     Validate Scope will describe how far the project progressed and give you an idea of where
     to start.
630          Appendix A       Answers to Review Questions



6.    B. Schedule variances will sometimes--but not always--impact the schedule. Changes to
      noncritical path tasks will not likely impact the schedule, but changes to critical path tasks
      will always impact the schedule.

7.    C. The To-complete performance index determines the cost performance that must be
      realized for the remaining work of the project to meet a goal such as BAC or EAC.

8.    D. Budget updates might require cost re-baselining.

9.    A. Schedule variance is (EV - PV) and the schedule performance index is (EV / PV).

10. C. Earned value is referred to as the value of the work that's been completed to date
    compared to the budget.

11. D. The CV is a positive number and is calculated by subtracting AC from EV as follows:
    250 - 200 = 50. A positive CV means the project is coming in under budget, meaning
    you've spent less than you planned as of the measurement date.

12. A. The SV calculation is EV - PV. If PV is a higher number than EV, you'll get a negative
    number as a result.

13. B. CPI is calculated as follows: EV / AC. In this case, 250 / 200 = 1.25.

14. B. When you accept project performance to date and assume future ETC work will be
    performed at the budgeted rate, EAC is calculated as follows: AC + (BAC - EV). Therefore,
    the calculation for this question looks like this: 200 + (800 - 250) = 750.

15. C. The correct formula for ETC for this question is as follows: EAC - AC. Therefore, ETC
    is as follows: 375 - 200 = 175.

16. A. When project performance is expected to behave like past performance, EAC is
    calculated as follows: EAC = BAC / CPI. Therefore, the calculation for this question looks
    like this: 800 / 1.25 = 640.

17. D. You first have to calculate EAC in order to calculate VAC. EAC for variances that
    are atypical is AC + (BAC - EV). So, our numbers are 275 + (500 - 250) = 525. VAC is
    calculated this way: BAC - EAC. Therefore, 500 - 525 = -25. Our costs are not doing as
    well as anticipated.

18. C. You must first calculate CPI in order to calculate ETC. CPI is EV / AC. We have 1150 /
    1275 = .90. ETC with typical cost variances is (BAC -EV) / CPI. Our numbers are (2500 -
    1150) / .90 = 1500.

19. B. Workarounds are unplanned responses. They deal with negative risk events as they
    occur. As the name implies, workarounds were not previously known to the project team.
    The risk event was unplanned, so no contingency plan existed to deal with the risk event,
    and thus it required a workaround.

20. C. Control Resources ensures physical resources are available at the time they are needed
    and at the location they are needed. It also ensures the resources are released when their
    job is completed and that corrective actions are taken when resources are not utilized as
    planned.
     Chapter 12: Closing the Project and Applying Professional Responsibility                   631




Chapter 12: Closing the Project and
Applying Professional Responsibility
1.   D. Integration occurs when resources, equipment, or property are reassigned or redeployed
     back to the organization or to another project.

2.   A. Starvation occurs because the project no longer receives the resources needed to
     continue. Resources include people, equipment, money, and the like.

3.   A. Extinction is the best type of project end because it means the project was completed
     successfully and accepted by the sponsor or customer.

4.   C. Written notice of contract closure is part of the Control Procurements process. This
     process involves the project manager documenting the formal acceptance of the work of the
     contract.

5.   A. Document analysis is performed to identify lessons learned and capture and share
     knowledge for use on future projects.

6.   B. Lessons learned document the experiences, successes, and failures that occurred
     during this project for future reference. There isn't enough information in the question to
     determine whether Option A or D is correct. Option C is not correct because the project
     was completed.

7.   C. Regression analysis examines project variables and how they contributed to project
     outcomes for the purpose of improving performance on future projects.

8.   B. You are not responsible for the personal integrity of others, but as project manager you
     do have influence over others, such as your project team members.

9.   C. Integrity means you'll honestly report project outcomes and status. Your personal gain
     should not be placed above the satisfaction of the customer.

10. D. The best answer to this problem is to develop alternative solutions to address the
    design error. Reducing technical requirements might be an alternative solution, but it's not
    one you'd implement without looking at all the alternatives. Ignoring the error and going
    forward with production will result in an unsatisfactory product for the customer.

11. A. A luncheon date could be considered a conflict of interest prior to awarding a contract
    to a vendor. Consider what a competitor of this vendor would think if they spotted you
    having lunch together.

12. B. The best response to this situation is to thank the vendor and decline based on the fact
    that this could be considered personal gain on your part. Option D might seem correct,
    but remember, you're not responsible for the integrity of others. It's often common business
    practice for vendors to offer gifts to potential customers.
632         Appendix A       Answers to Review Questions



13. D. The best response in this case is to accept the gift because it would cause great offense
    to the other party if you were to decline. Report the gift and the circumstances as soon as
    possible to the appropriate parties at your company.

14. D. This is a conflict of interest situation, and you should report it as a violation of the
    PMI (R) Code of Ethics and Professional Conduct.

15. A. Documenting the requirements and meeting them is one of the key things you can do
    to ensure customer satisfaction. The requirements describe what the customer is looking
    for, and the final product is compared against them to determine whether all of the
    requirements were met.

16. A. The most correct response is to first provide training to your team members to educate
    them regarding how to respect and work with others from different cultures. Colocation
    might not be possible when you're working with team members from two different
    countries. Team-building exercises are a good idea as well but are not your first course of
    action.

17. B. The situation presented here requires you to put the interest of the company and the
    confidentiality of the data above your own personal interests or those of your stakeholders.
    Option D is not the most correct response because it says you believe the information is
    public. This implies you haven't verified whether the data is private or public. Until you
    know, treat the data as confidential. In this case, the information is confidential and should
    be shared only with those who have a valid reason for using it.

18. C. As project manager, you have taken all the appropriate actions regarding confidentiality
    of data; this question indicated that you did that. In this case, Option D is not correct
    because it implies that you did not verify ahead of time that the stakeholder had the proper
    levels of approval to use the data.

19. D. Culture shock is the disoriented feeling that people might experience when working in a
    foreign country.

20. A. The most appropriate response is to deny the request. Software is considered intellectual
    property and should not be used for personal gain or given to others without prior consent
    from the organization. This question states that the release of the beta software is handled
    through the marketing department, so you should not give your friend a copy of the
    software outside of this process.
