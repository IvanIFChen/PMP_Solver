Preface
 ESI has been teaching people how to prepare for the PMP(R) since January 1991, using our popular and
 proven PMP(R) Exam Preparation course to thousands of people who tell us it works Using information from
 this course and A Guide to the Project Management Body of Knowledge (PMBOK(R) Guide)--Fifth Edition, 2013, we
 developed the PMP Challenge! to assist you as you prepare for this exam. We developed 60 questions for
 each of the ten knowledge areas, or 600 questions, which will challenge you to examine the PMBOK(R) Guide
 at the level of detail required to dramatically increase your probability of passing the exam. We also included
 references to the five project management process groups--the focus of the PMP(R) exam. Study hard--it is
 worth it. Good luck in pursuing your PMP(R).

 We also believe that this book is a valuable reference for those of you who are pursuing the CAPM(R). Study
 hard, and we wish you success in attaining the CAPM(R).

Introduction
Preparing for and passing the PMP(R) exam is no small feat. Even though the number of certified PMP(R)s
continues to grow at a phenomenal rate, the failure rate also remains high. PMP(R) Exam Challenge! has
been designed to help you pass the exam in an easy-to-use, highly portable publication, containing the key
relevant topics you may encounter on the exam. And, in this Sixth Edition, we have updated the content of
the ten knowledge areas to reflect the PMBOK(R) Guide, Fifth Edition.

Featuring an entirely new section on Program Stakeholder Management, PMP(R) Exam Challenge! uses a
flash-card format to help you drill through the essential points of the PMBOK(R) Guide. The pages are tabbed so
you can directly go to the knowledge area you need to study. Each page has plenty of white space that you
may use to write notes.

Carry, and, of course, use PMP(R) Exam Challenge! everywhere you go during the days leading up to the
exam. Start with any section. Proceed to a new section only after you have mastered the one you are cur-
rently studying. Use this book again and again. Work with your spouse, a friend, or colleague. Prior to the
exam, do not allow a day pass without studying the questions and answers.
IN T R O D U C T IO N C ONTINUED
Note that answers list the five project management process groups-- Initiating, Planning, Executing,
Monitoring and Controlling, and Closing. These references help you to answer questions that test your
knowledge of when certain events or actions take place during the project management life cycle.

We hope this book makes drilling questions and answers fun. It is hard work, but earning the PMP(R) is a pres-
tigous achievement-- one that contributes to your professional growth in many ways. Whether you have
been in project management for 30 years or 30 days, you will learn a lot by studying PMP(R) Exam Challenge!
