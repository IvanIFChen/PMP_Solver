                 More than once, I've said that I'm the luckiest guy in the room. I get to write and talk
                 for a living--what could be better than that? I'm so grateful for the opportunity to
                 write, and I must thank the wonderful group of people at McGraw-Hill for their belief
                 in me to write yet another book on project management. Thank you to Tim Green, my
                 good friend and editor, for his guidance, patience, and confidence. Thank you to
                 Stephanie Evans and Mary Demery--two wonderful people. Thank you both for keep-
                 ing me organized, focused, and consistent. Thank you to James Ward, the accurate and
                 persistent technical editor, for all of his hard work. Thanks to Mike McGee for helping
                 me be a better writer, and to Rachel Gunn for helping me be a better project manager.
                 And thank you to Peter Hancik who took my scribbles and created all the artwork in
                 this book.
                     I would also like to thank the hundreds of people who have attended my PMP Boot
                 Camps and project management courses over the past years. Your questions and con-
                 versations have helped me create this book and will help thousands of others earn their
                 PMI certifications. A big thank you to my friend Kerry Kuehn and his team at Sedona
                 Learning. Thanks also to my friends Fred and Carin McBroom, Jim Chambers, Lamont
                 Hatcher, Jonathan Acosta, Don Kunhle, Jo and Andy Diaczyk, Greg and Mary Huebner,
                 Greg Kirkland, and Gareth Hancock. Finally, I must thank my parents Don and Vir-
                 ginia Phillips and my fine brothers Steve, Mark, Sam, and Ben.

                                                         INTRODUCTION

                   This book is divided into two major sections. Part I, which consists of Chapters 1, 2, and
                   3, discusses the broad overview of project management and how it pertains to the Certi-
                   fied Associate in Project Management (CAPM) and the Project Management Profession-
                   al (PMP) examinations. Part II contains Chapters 4 through 14, which detail each of the
                   ten knowledge areas and the PMI Code of Ethics and Professional Conduct.
                       If you are just beginning your PMP or CAPM quest, you should read the first section
                   immediately, as it will help you build a strong foundation for your exam. If you already
                   have a strong foundation in project management and need specific information on the
                   knowledge areas, then move on to the second section. You'll find this section specific
                   to the exam knowledge areas that will help you--gulp--pass the PMI examination.
                       The book is designed so that you can read the chapters in any order you like. How-
                   ever, if you examine the Guide to the Project Management Body of Knowledge (PMBOK),
                   you'll notice that the order of information presented is the same as the order of infor-
                   mation in this book. In other words, you can read a chapter of the PMBOK and then
                   read a more detailed explanation in this book. This book is a guide to the guide.

                      * Qualify for your exam




                 This is a book on how to pass the Project Management Professional (PMP) and the
                 Certified Associate in Project Management (CAPM) exams.

                     If you're looking for a book on how to do project management, look elsewhere. If

                 of excellent books are available that can help you reach those goals.

                 plain how to pass your certification exam the first time. And then you can get back to
                 your life. After all, the exams aren't fun, and I'm certain you have more important
                 things to do than spend more time than necessary to pass an exam.

                 CAPM/PMP Project Management Certification All-in-One Exam Guide
                 4
                                 * Tell you how to pass the PMP or CAPM exam--not just take the exam
                                 * Offer you "roadmaps" for each chapter's content
                                 * Give you over 800 practice questions (fun!)
                                 * Make your life more exciting(!)

                                This first chapter covers many things that will help you prepare for and pass your
                            project management certification exam.
                                Not everyone can take the PMP or the CAPM exam--you have to qualify first. I
                            think this is great. We, and soon you, don't need the market flooded with the "paper
                            certifications" that other industries have experienced. This certification is special--it
                            proves that the certified professional has documented project management experi-
                            ence and education, and has passed a tough, rigorous exam. If it were easy, everyone
                            would do it.

                                          NOTE As this book covers the PMP and the CAPM examinations, sometimes
                                          I'll hop from details on one exam to details on the other. Don't worry--these
                                          exams overlap so much that these awkward moments will be few and far
                                          between. Besides, if the information I'm sharing doesn't relate to you, yawn,
                                          stretch, and then move along to the information that does. I won't hold it
                                          against you.


                            All About the PMP Exam
                            To become a PMP, you need the following (check out Figure 1-1; it's pretty):

                                 * A bachelor's degree or the global equivalent, and 36 non-overlapping
                                   months of project management experience totaling 4,500 hours of project
                                   management activities within the last eight years.
                                    Or:
                                 * A high school diploma, associate's degree, or the global equivalent, and 60
                                   non-overlapping months of project management experience totaling 7,500
                                   hours of project management tasks within the last eight years.
                                 * Regardless of your degree, you will need 35 contact hours of project
                                   management education. (Ahem--I teach project management classes for
                                   companies around the world, including an Exam Boot Camp that satisfies this
                                   requirement. E-mail me for details at pmpcapm@projectseminars.com.) Here
                                   are the PMI (Project Management Institute)-approved methods for accruing
                                   the project management education contact hours:
                                    * Courses offered by PMI-registered education providers.
                                    * University or college project management courses.

                        * Courses offered by PMI component organizations.
                        * Courses offered through your organization.
                        * Distance learning education companies if they offer an end-of-course
                          assessment.
                        * Courses offered by training companies.
                        * No, the PMI chapter meetings and self-study don't count. (Darn! Just
                          reading this book won't satisfy your project management education hours.)
                      * Extensive review of your application. Every application will pass through a
                        review period. If your application needs an audit, you'll be notified via e-mail.
                      * Audit! Not every application is audited, but if your application is selected for
                        an audit, you'll have to provide documentation of your experience, education,
                        and verification of the projects you've worked on. It's fun, fun, fun. Oh, and
                        the PMI can even audit you after you've "earned" your certification. (Yikes!
                        Here's where honesty is the best policy.)
                      * Applicants must provide contact information on all projects listed on their
                        PMP exam application. In the past, applicants did not have to provide project

                                 * Once the application has been approved, candidates have one year to pass the
                                   exam. If you procrastinate and wait a year before taking the exam, you'll have
                                   to start the process over.
                                 * Be good. You will also agree to abide by the PMP Code of Ethics and
                                   Professional Conduct. You can get your very own copy through the PMI's web
                                   site: www.pmi.org. We'll cover this code in Chapter 14--something for you to
                                   look forward to (no peeking!).
                                 * The PMI doesn't reveal what the actual passing score is for the PMP exam--
                                   you'll only receive a pass or fail score for the entire exam. The exam has 200
                                   questions, 25 of which don't actually count toward your passing score. These
                                   25 "seeded" questions are scattered throughout your exam and are used to
                                   collect stats on candidates' responses to see if these questions should be
                                   incorporated into future examinations. You won't know if you're answering a
                                   seeded question or a live question, so you have to answer all the exam
                                   questions with the same degree of focus and attention.

                                          CAUTION PMP candidates are limited to three exam attempts within one
                                          year. If they fail three times within one year, they'll have to wait one year after
                                          the third exam attempt before resubmitting their exam application again.
                                          Don't focus on this--focus on passing your exam the first time.

                                The PMP exam will test you on your experience and knowledge in five different ar-
                            eas, as Table 1-1 shows. You'll have to provide specifics on tasks completed in each
                            knowledge area on your PMP examination application. The following domain specifics
                            and their related exam percentages are correct as of this writing. I strongly encourage
                            you to double-check these specifics at www.pmi.org. It's possible they've changed since
                            this writing.


                            All About the CAPM Exam
                            The CAPM exam also has requirements to qualify to take it--and to pass it. This part is
                            just a bit different from the PMP exam objectives. The Project Management Institute
                            (PMI), the fine folks who govern these certifications, have not provided the same level
                            of exam details as they have for the PMP as of this writing. Don't flip out; the require-
                            ments are lighter and the exam required score is lower--and this book will prepare you
                            for CAPM success. Figure 1-2 demonstrates the following CAPM examination details:

                                 * A high school diploma, global equivalent, or better (basically, if you
                                   graduated from high school, you're on your way).
                                    And either:
                                 * A whopping 1,500 hours or more as a project team member. You'll have to
                                   document what you did on your projects through the PMI's Experience
                                   Verification Form--and that's one form per project. The PMI is a stickler that

                                    and a definite ending--ongoing endeavors do not count.
                                    Or:
                                 * Complete 23 hours of project management education, which you'll document
                                   on the PMI's Project Management Education Form. (The PMI really loves
                                   these formal documents, don't they?) Here's the cool thing: There's no time
                                   limit on when to complete this project management education, as long as you
                                   can prove it. Note that the class has to be completed prior to completing the
                                   CAPM application (finish your class and then finish the CAPM application).
                                   (Ahem--I teach project management classes for companies around the world,
                                   including an Exam Boot Camp that satisfies this requirement. E-mail me for
                                   details: cs@instructing.com.) Here are the PMI-approved methods for
                                   accruing the project management education hours:
                                    * Courses offered by PMI-registered education providers.
                                    * University or college project management courses.
                                    * Courses offered by PMI component organizations.
                                    * Courses offered through your organization.
                                    * Distance learning education companies if they offer an end-of-course
                                      assessment.
                                    * Courses offered by training companies.
                                    * No, the PMI chapter meetings and self-study don't count. (Darn! Just
                                      reading this book won't satisfy your project management education hours.)
                                 * As with the PMP candidates, your CAPM application could be audited. If your
                                   application is selected for an audit, you'll have to provide documentation of
                                   your experience, education, and proof of the projects you worked on.
                                 * Once your application has been approved, you have one year to pass the
                                   exam. If you procrastinate and don't take the exam before a year is out, you'll
                                   have to start the process over.
                                 * CAPM candidates must also agree to abide by the PMI's Code of Ethics and
                                   Professional Conduct. You can get your very own copy through the PMI's web
                                   site at www.pmi.org. We'll cover this code in Chapter 13--something for you

                              CAUTION Once you're a CAPM, you're a CAPM for up to five years. At the




                                                                                                                                             PART I
                              end of the five years, you can move on to the PMP certification, take the
                              CAPM examination again, or choose not to renew your title. Ideally, you'll have
                              accrued enough project management experience to sit for the PMP exam.

                     The CAPM exam has 150 test questions, 15 of which are considered "pretest" ques-
                 tions that don't count toward or against your passing score. Despite the term "pretest,"
                 these questions are seeded throughout the exam to test their worthiness for future exam
                 questions. They don't count against you, but you won't know if you're answering a live
                 question or a pretest question. Either way, you'll have three hours to complete the
                 CAPM exam.
                     The CAPM exam objectives don't go into the same level of detail as the PMP certifica-
                 tion does. Our pals at the PMI have painted the CAPM objectives with some very broad
                 strokes--which may be a good thing. Table 1-2 provides a breakdown on the CAPM
                 objectives (double-check www.pmi.org to confirm that these objectives are still valid).


                 Money and Your Exam
                 These exams aren't free, and you don't want to waste your hard-earned cash by failing
                 the exam. Focus on passing the exam on your first shot. But just in case some of your
                 colleagues ask, I've included the retake fees. You can, and should, confirm the costs I've
                 listed here with the PMI through their web site. They've changed fees in the past, and
                 you don't want your exam fees to dig into your beer and pizza cash:

                      * Join the PMI: $119 (join the PMI first because it lowers your exam fee by a
                        few bucks; if you join your local PMI chapter, as you should, there will be an
                        additional chapter fee, usually around $25.)

                         Passing the Exam
                         Let's face the facts: This isn't much fun. Learning is hard work. The PMI's book, A Guide to
                         the Project Management Body of Knowledge, 5th edition (which I'll just call the PMBOK
                         from now on, thank you), reads like the literary equivalent of a sleeping pill. You don't
                         want this process to last any longer than necessary, and your goal should be--it better
                         be--to pass your certification exam on your first attempt. So don't simply think of "taking
                         the exam." Instead, focus on "passing your exam," so you can get back to your real life.
                             Just as your projects have plans, you need a plan for how to study, how to prepare,
                         and then how to pass the exam. You can relax on this part--I've done most of the work
                         for you.

                                       EXAM COACH I'm not knocking the PMBOK--really! It's a fine reference
                                       book and it's what your PMI exam is based on. The book is written, edited, and
                                       reviewed by hundreds of volunteer project managers. These are good people
                                       who've invested their life into the book. Thank you to them for their hard
                                       work and contribution to the project management community. Having said
                                       that, know that it's a tough book to actually sit and read. Use it as a reference
                                       point for your exam prep.

                         Creating Your Study Strategy
                         I'll be your study buddy. You need a realistic timeline and a realistic expectation for
                         studying to pass your exam. You can create whatever strategy you like, but here's my
                         recommended approach to passing your exam. This book has 14 chapters and two ap-
                         pendixes. Each chapter in my book corresponds directly with the PMBOK--except I'm
                         goofy and the PMBOK is boring. Chapter 14, while it doesn't relate directly to the PM-
                         BOK, deals with the PMI's Code of Ethics and Professional Conduct. Appendix A ex-
                         plains every project management document mentioned directly in the PMBOK. Appen-
                         dix B is the summary of all the stuff you absolutely must know to pass your exam. The
                         glossary is a glossary--all the terms I use in this book (yeah, all of them).

                                video now.

                      Throughout this book, you'll see an icon that looks like this one. It means that you
                  should hop out to the digital content or use your e-reader and watch a video of me
                  discussing the key concepts for that chapter. Sometimes I'll include more than one
                  video per chapter, depending on the topic. I recommend that you watch the chapter video
                  before moving on to the next chapter. The videos are usually short, and I'm providing
                  some good stuff. These are packed with information, I promise--no sales pitches.
                      At the end of each chapter, you'll find key terms. Get a stack of index cards and make
                  flashcards of the key terms. It's not that tricky to make yourself a set of flashcards: write
                  the term on one side of the card in big, fat letters. On the other side of the index card,
                  write the definition. The idea is that you'll "flash" through these every day as you plow
                  through this beast of a book--it'll help you keep the early chapters fresh in your mind
                  as you happily move toward the end of this fine piece of literature. Look at the name of
                  the term and define the term aloud; flip the card over and make certain you're correct.
                      At the end of each chapter, you'll find 20 practice exam questions. These questions
                  test your comprehension of the chapter. I've written these questions to be tougher than
                  what you'll likely encounter on the live exam. My logic is that if you can answer my
                  questions, you can answer the PMI's questions, too. In the digital content, you'll find a
                  Microsoft Excel spreadsheet titled "Exam Scores"--you can see it in Figure 1-3. Enter
                  your chapter scores in the spreadsheet, and you can track which chapters you need
                  more work in and focus your study time accordingly.

              CAPM/PMP Project Management Certification All-in-One Exam Guide
              12
                             In the Total Tester Premium test engine that comes with this book, there are 750
                         total CAPM and PMP practice exam questions. You can customize your practice exams
                         by domain or by chapter, and you can even select how many questions you want in-
                         cluded and how much time you have to complete it. Check out Appendix C for more
                         information about how the Total Tester Premium test engine works. There are three
                         pools of practice questions for you:

                              * PMP Practice Exam Questions There are over 400 practice exam questions
                                in this pool that emulate those you'll find on the actual PMP exam. If you
                                choose take a PMP practice exam, it will pull 200 questions from the pool,
                                weighted with the same balance you'll find on the actual PMP exam, and
                                you'll have four hours to complete it. If you're going for your CAPM, you
                                can still use these questions as practice, as most of the project management
                                concepts are the same.
                              * CAPM Practice Exam Questions There are over 300 practice exam
                                questions in this pool that emulate those you'll find on the actual CAPM
                                exam. If you're a PMP candidate, don't dismiss these questions. While the
                                150-question CAPM practice exam is shorter in length at 3 hours, the
                                questions can be a good review of the project management principles for your
                                exam, too.
                              * Process Review Quiz This 200-question quiz is good for both CAPMs and
                                PMPs. It is, however, a bit different than the practice exam questions you'll
                                find in the CAPM and PMP pool of questions. This exam only quizzes you on
                                the processes, inputs, tools and techniques, and outputs of project
                                management. It's a tough review quiz, but it will help you really learn the 47
                                processes of project management and their components.

                              I recommend you complete these exams after you've completed reading and taking
                         the end-of-chapter exams in this book. Keep taking each exam over and over until you
                         can answer every question correctly. (I'm assuming that you won't get 100 percent on
                         the first attempt on this exam. My apologies if you do.) I love to say in my project man-
                         agement certification boot camps that repetition is the mother of learning. Repetition
                         is the mother of learning.
                              I've outlined quick references for how you should study and then pass your exam.
                         You may be slightly ahead of other readers in your exam preparations, so I've intention-
                         ally left dates and timelines to your discretion. I think a couple of chapters a week is
                         realistic--but I wouldn't do more than five chapters a week. Take some time and create
                         a schedule of when you'll study, and then take measures to make certain you can keep
                         the schedule you create.
                              Table 1-3 provides a sample strategy that you can modify as you see fit. Your sched-
                         ule may take more or less time--this is just a sample strategy. I've included a document
                         titled "My Exam Strategy" in the digital content so you can create your own schedule
                         and strategy.

                         What Your Exam Is Based On
                         Your project management exam is based on the PMI's publication A Guide to the Project
                         Management Body of Knowledge. This is commonly called the PMBOK (pronounced
                         PIM-bach), and that's how I'll refer to it from now on. I'm not looking to pick fights or
                         be critical, but the PMBOK is drier than wheat toast. It's not an easy read, a fun read, or,
                         much of the time, a complete read.
                             The PMBOK doesn't aim to define all of the avenues of project management in
                         great detail. Rather, it tries to provide a general overview of the good practices of proj-
                         ect management. The PMBOK defines the generally accepted project management
                         practices that are most widely utilized. The funny thing about the PMBOK--it's not
                         the project management body of knowledge, it's a guide to the project management
                         body of knowledge. Everything you need to know about project management isn't in
                         that book--but most of the things are. You'll need experience and other sources of
                         exam preparation (like this book), along with constant effort to pass the PMP and the
                         CAPM exams.

                                                                                                Chapter 1: Preparing for the Exam

                                                                                                                                 15
                       One of my favorite lines from the PMBOK comes from section 1.1: "Good practice
                  does not mean that the knowledge described should always be applied uniformly on




                                                                                                                                             PART I
                  all projects." I love this quote, because it's a fancy way of saying, "Calm down. You don't
                  have to do every freaking process, activity, and system within this book--just determine
                  the processes that are best for your project and then do them correctly."

                               EXAM TIP Your exam, however, will quiz you on all of the processes,
                               systems, and documents identified by the PMBOK, because all of these
                               characteristics are appropriate for projects, but probably not appropriate for
                               every project you'll manage.

                      When you join the PMI, you'll get an online-based copy of the PMBOK as part of
                  your membership, or you can plunk down a few bucks at your favorite bookstore (or
                  through the PMI's web site) and get a printed version of the book today. As of this writ-
                  ing, I think the online version of the PMBOK is clunky, hard to read, and it prints tiny--
                  hopefully your access will be better than mine. I gave up and bought the printed version.
                  I recommend you have a copy of the PMBOK for several reasons:

                       * Your exam is based on the PMBOK. As much as I'd like for your exam to be
                         based on just my writings, it isn't. The PMBOK is what your exam is based
                         on, so you should always reference that book along with the one you're
                         reading now.
                       * This book is based on the PMBOK. Okay, I gave myself an out in the
                         preceding paragraph, but truthfully, I've worked very hard for my book to be
                         in sync with the PMBOK. I'll occasionally reference the PMBOK as we move
                         through the chapters, but you can always double-check my facts, questions,
                         and figures with the PMBOK if you really want to.
                       * The PMBOK, as dry as it may be, is an excellent book to have in your project
                         management arsenal. It defines processes, systems, and documents that you'll
                         likely encounter in your project management endeavors.
                       * Having a copy of the PMBOK on your desk strikes fear and awe into your
                         uncertified colleagues. Well, maybe just the ones from Carlisle, Pennsylvania.

                               EXAM COACH Throughout this book, I'll pop into my coaching mode. Like
                               right now. Do you really need to read the PMBOK to pass the exam? That's a
                               tough question and I get it a bunch. For some people, no, they don't need to.
                               For others, yes, they do. I've made a genuine effort to write for the exam
                               objectives so you can study this book instead of the PMBOK. I do believe,
                               however, that you should have a copy of the PMBOK as a handy reference for
                               your exam prep. The PMBOK is not an easy or fun read, but it can help
                               support your exam efforts.

                         What Is a Project?
                         You're a project manager, so you've probably got a good idea of what a project is al-
                         ready. I'm hoping. The PMBOK defines a project as "a temporary endeavor to create a
                         unique product, service, or result." Projects, like good stories, have a definite beginning
                         and a definite end. A project is over when the product, service, or result is created, the
                         scope is fulfilled, and the customer has accepted the end result. Or, in not so pleasant
                         times, it's over when it becomes evident that the project won't be able to create the de-
                         sired product, service, or result for whatever reason (skills, cost, time, and so on).

                         Temping a Project
                         Some project managers get hung up on the idea of a project being temporary. After all,
                         some projects can last for years or decades--but they don't last forever. Projects are
                         temporary in that they have a definite ending somewhere in the future. Projects--at
                         least, most projects--create something that will last for some time, usually longer than
                         the project team or longer than the time it took to complete the project itself. Consider
                         a project to build a house, create a park, or develop a software application. These deliv-
                         erables will be utilized for some time. In other words, the project ends, but the benefits
                         and deliverables of the project continue.
                             Notice I said that project deliverables usually last longer than the project itself. For
                         some special projects, this isn't true--such as for a project to host a trade show, an
                         event, or a fantastic party. Once the event is over, the project is also over.
                             "Temporary" can also refer to the market window status. Remember the Internet
                         dot-com boom? It was definitely temporary. I'm sure in your business you can identify
                         examples of market windows that were temporary. Project teams are also examples of
                         temporary structures: the team comes together, does the work of the project, and then
                         once the project is over, so is the project team.

                         Defining a Project's Uniqueness
                         Ready for a horrible joke? How do you catch a unique rabbit? Unique up on him. (As
                         in, "You sneak up on him." My son loved this joke when he was eight ... not so much
                         anymore.) The point of the joke is that a project should be unique from the rest of your
                         organization's operations. Consider the creation of a new car. The designing, drafting,
                         modeling, and the creative process of creating a new car could be a project. The manu-
                         facturing of the automobile, however, typically isn't a project--that's operations. Unique
                         things that a project can create include:

                              * Products such as software
                              * Products that are components for other projects, such as the blueprints for a
                                new warehouse
                              * A new service that will be integrated into your organization's functions, such
                                as a help desk or an Internet application
                              * A feasibility study, research and development outcomes, or trend analysis

                  Progressively Elaborating a Project




                                                                                                                                             PART I
                  Progressive elaboration is a process that all projects move through. The project manager
                  and the project team start very broadly--typically with a project's concepts--and then
                  the concept is refined with details, studies, and discussion until a project scope statement
                  is formed. The scope statement may pass through additional steps to continue to refine
                  the project's objectives.
                       Did you ever read any of the Sherlock Holmes stories? Holmes would create a very
                  broad theory of the mystery's solution and then, through a scientific approach and
                  deductive reasoning, narrow his theory over and over until he finally solved the case.
                  He started very broad and then narrowed his hypothesis. This is one example of pro-
                  gressive elaboration, although Sir Arthur Conan Doyle never called it that. Basically,
                  progressive elaboration means that you start with a very broad concept and then,
                  through steady progressions, you gather more detail to clarify the concept your project
                  centers on. Figure 1-4 is a simple example of progressive elaboration with a project to
                  create a new home.

                  Why Do Projects?
                  Projects are typically endeavors that don't fall into an organization's normal opera-
                  tions. Basically, projects are chunks of work that need to be completed, but the work
                  doesn't necessarily fall into any predefined function of an organization, such as ac-
                  counting or sales.
                      Projects can also be managed by organizations that complete projects all the time
                  for other organizations. Consider an IT consulting company that swoops into company
                  after company to install and configure new networks, servers, or computer software. Or
                  consider an architectural firm that designs buildings for other companies. Or think of
                  practically any service-based business, and you'll find a performing organization that
                  completes projects for other entities.


                  Figure 1-4
                  Progressive
                  elaboration means
                  progressing through
                  steady, incremental
                  steps.

                             Organizations that treat practically every undertaking as a project are likely partici-
                         pating in management by projects. This means they operate by relying heavily on proj-
                         ect management principles to complete their work. This isn't unusual in consulting
                         agencies, construction firms, or IT shops--they exist through management by projects.
                             Projects are most likely undertaken for any of the following reasons:

                              * Opportunity The market demand may call for a project to create a new
                                product, service, or solution.
                              * Organizational needs I bet you can identify some needs within your
                                company that would make dandy projects: upgrading computers, training
                                your staff, changing the menu in the company cafeteria. Usually,
                                organizational needs focus on reducing costs or increasing revenue, and
                                sometimes both (bonus!).
                              * Customers Your customers have things that they want you to create for
                                them. Sometimes these requests develop into projects.
                              * Technology Technology seems to change and advance daily, and this often
                                spurs new projects to keep up with or ahead of competitors. Know any IT
                                gurus out there managing technical projects?
                              * Legal requirements Laws and regulations can give rise to new projects.
                                Publicly traded companies have been required to secure their IT data in
                                compliance with the Sarbanes-Oxley Act. Health-care organizations must
                                adhere to HIPAA (Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of
                                1996) requirements. And U.S. companies have been working with OSHA
                                requirements for years and years. Initial conformance to these requirements
                                often creates new projects.


                         What Is Project Management?
                         You know what projects are, so what's project management? I can hear you sighing and
                         saying, "It's just the management of a project." And I'd concur, but your exam will
                         likely need a more robust definition. The PMBOK defines project management as "the
                         application of knowledge, skills, tools, and techniques to project activities to meet proj-
                         ect requirements."
                             Managing a project centers on four things:

                              * Identifying your project's requirements
                              * Establishing clearly defined project objectives
                              * Managing project stakeholders by adapting your plans and approaches to
                                keep those folks happy and the project moving along
                              * Keeping scope, schedule, costs, risk, resources, and quality all in balance

                             This last point really defines the Iron Triangle of Project Management. Sometimes
                         this is also called the Triple Constraints of Project Management. Figure 1-5 demon-

                                                                                                                                  19

                  Project Management
                  comprises time, cost,
                  and scope.




                  strates the Iron Triangle's concept: All three sides must remain in balance, or the proj-
                  ect's quality or other facets will suffer. It's not rocket science: If your scope is enormous
                  but your budget and/or schedule is puny, your project will likely suffer or even fail.
                  Chapters 5, 6, and 7 in this book (and in the PMBOK) focus on these three constraints
                  of scope, time, and cost, so you'll see the Iron Triangle at least three more times.


                  Back to the PMBOK
                  I follow the PMBOK section by section throughout this book. Of course, I take the
                  PMBOK and expound on it just a bit--I hope you like it. This section reflects the PMBOK's
                  navel-gazing. For some reason, the authors of the PMBOK interject a logical discussion
                  on project management with a pondering on how their book is organized. Okay. You
                  won't be tested on this specifically, but it's helpful to know as you organize your
                  thoughts and study strategy. So here's the scoop on the PMBOK contents and how this
                  book treats them:

                       * Chapter 1: The "Introduction" sets the tone and paints the big picture of what
                         the PMBOK can do for you. It's breezy and gets you moving into the book,
                         kind of like this chapter.
                        * Chapter 2: "Organizational Influences and Project Life Cycle" discusses the
                          environment where projects happen. The project life cycle describes the
                          phases a project moves through from start to completion.
                        * Chapter 3: "Project Management Processes for a Project." It discusses the 47
                          project management processes and the five process groups they live within.
                          It's meaty, and we'll discuss it in depth in Chapter 3 of this book.

                     Section 3: "The Project Management Knowledge Areas" has ten chapters, and each
                  knowledge area gets its own chapter in the PMBOK. Here's a brief overview of each chapter:

                       * Chapter 4: "Project Integration Management" defines how each knowledge
                         area is affected by the control and outcome of the other knowledge areas.
                         Project integration management is the gears of project management.

              20
                              * Chapter 5: "Project Scope Management" defines how a project manager
                                should create, monitor, control, and complete the project scope.
                              * Chapter 6: "Project Time Management" defines how the project manager
                                should estimate the project duration, create the schedule, do some fancy math
                                problems with time, and control and react to all aspects of managing the
                                project schedule.
                              * Chapter 7: "Project Cost Management" focuses on the project budget and how
                                it is estimated, spent, audited, and controlled through the project. Cha-ching!
                              * Chapter 8: "Project Quality Management" centers on defining and adhering to
                                the quality expectations of the project stakeholders. We'll examine a whole
                                bunch of charts that measure quality within a project.
                              * Chapter 9: "Project Human Resources Management" delves into the methods
                                to organize, lead, and manage your project team. We'll also discuss some
                                philosophies and human resource theories.
                              * Chapter 10: "Project Communications Management" is all about how a
                                project manager should gather, create, and disperse project information. The
                                basic theme for this chapter is who needs what information, when they need
                                it, and in what modality.
                              * Chapter 11: "Project Risk Management" describes how you, your project team,
                                and other experts will identify, analyze, and plan responses to risks within
                                your project. We'll cover risk matrixes, contingency reserves, and ways to track
                                risks within your project.
                              * Chapter 12: "Project Procurement Management" is all about buying the
                                products and services your project may need to be successful. Procurement
                                management includes obtaining acquisitions, selecting sellers, and creating
                                contracts. Get your wallet ready.
                              * Chapter 13: "Project Stakeholder Management" defines the (new to PMBOK,
                                5th Edition) stakeholder management planning, executing, and controlling
                                processes. Once you've identified the stakeholders, in project initiation, you'll
                                create a plan to keep the stakeholder in control throughout the project.
                              * Chapter 14, in this book, doesn't correspond directly to the PMBOK, but
                                correlates to the PMI's Code of Ethics and Professional Conduct. I'll explain
                                how you can answer these questions directly and accurately for your exam.
                                Keep in mind that agreement to abide by the Code of Ethics and Professional
                                Conduct for both the PMP and the CAPM candidates is required, and you'll
                                have several exam questions on ethics and on adhering to the PMI's
                                professional code. I'm certain you'll do fine.

                                                                                                                                               PART I
                  You can take a project management class and not be an expert in project management. You
                  can even be a PMP or a CAPM and not be a good project manager. Sorry, but it's true. To
                  be an expert in project management, you need to rely on more than just the tools, tech-
                  niques, and other mechanics of project management. You'll need five things:

                      * A Guide to the Project Management Body of Knowledge
                       * Expertise in your application area and an understanding of the relevant
                         standards and regulations
                       * An understanding of the environment in which your project takes place
                       * General management knowledge and skills
                       * The ability to deal with people (your interpersonal skills)

                      These five attributes and how they interact with one another are depicted in Figure
                  1-6. The goal of this book is to help you pass your certification exam, but I'm certain
                  the goal of passing the exam is to help you advance your career and become a better,
                  more valuable project manager. With that thought process, it's easy to see how these
                  skills are interdependent. Let's take a quick look at each of these project management
                  attributes.

                         Using the Project Management Body of Knowledge
                         Yep, back to the PMBOK. (Technically, the Project Management Body of Knowledge is
                         the wealth of information that is available to the project management community.) As
                         far as your exam is concerned, A Guide to the Project Management Body of Knowledge is
                         what's important.

                         Working with Your Application Area
                         An application area is your area of expertise, whether it be construction, manufacturing,
                         sales, technology, or something else. And an application can get even more specific if
                         we break down an organization into more detail: functional departments, technical
                         domains, management arenas, and even industry groups, like automotive, health care,
                         and so on. An application area is simply the area of expertise with which the project
                         interacts.
                             Most, if not all, application areas have specific standards and regulations that the
                         project management team must consider as they plan their work and implement
                         their project plan. A standard is a generally accepted guideline for your industry, where-
                         as a regulation is a rule that your industry must follow, or risk fines and penalties. I like
                         to say that standards are optional and regulations are not. No one ever went to jail be-
                         cause they didn't follow a standard. Plenty of people have visited the big house for not
                         following regulations.

                                       EXAM TIP You probably won't see questions on specific application areas,
                                       because the PMP and CAPM certifications focus on project management, not
                                       on the arenas in which projects take place. Just know that application areas are
                                       industries and technologies that can host projects.

                         Understanding Your Project Environment
                         Every project takes place in an environment--a location and culture where the project will
                         operate. Specifically, the project will affect and be affected by the social, economic,
                         and environmental variables of the project environment. It's paramount for the proj-
                         ect manager and the project team to understand the project environment. Every project
                         manager and the project team should consider the following.

                         Cultural and Social Environment
                         You and the project team must understand how your project affects people and how
                         those people may affect you and your project. This means it'll behoove you to under-
                         stand the economic, educational, ethical, religious, demographic, and even the ethnic
                         composition of the people your project affects. We'll discuss this more in Chapter 9,
                         Chapter 13, and Chapter 14.
                             Your project may not have a wide impact on people outside of your organization,
                         but you should still understand and consider the culture of your project and organiza-
                         tion. You'll also need to consider the cultural achievability of your project, the stake-

                                                                                                                                 23
                  holders within your organization, their political power, and the project manager's
                  autonomy over the project.




                                                                                                                                             PART I
                  International and Political Environment
                  If your project spans the globe, you and the project team will need to consider the inter-
                  national and local laws of where your project will operate and how the conditions of the
                  project may vary based on where the work is being completed. You'll also need to con-
                  sider fun things like differences in languages, time zones, and holidays; travel issues;
                  non-collocated teams; and the headaches associated with video and teleconferences.

                               NOTE "Non-collocated" is just another way to describe virtual teams or
                               project teams that aren't located in one geographical spot.


                  Physical Environment
                  If your project will change the landscape or physical structure of a building, you'll need
                  to consider the ecology, geography, and the environmental concerns, laws, and risks
                  that are associated with these changes. Consider a project to build a bridge over a wet-
                  land area--there will definitely be ecological, geographical, and environmental con-
                  cerns to deal with. (I'd worry about alligators, too.)

                  Relying on General Management Skills
                  To be a project manager, you have to be a manager. This means you're focused on one
                  important thing: key results. And how do you get results? You'll rely on:

                       * Accounting skills
                       * Procurement
                       * Sales and marketing
                       * Contracting abilities
                       * Manufacturing and distribution principles
                       * Organization and logistics
                       * Strategic, tactical, and operational planning
                       * Leverage of the organizational structure and the organizational behavior
                       * Administration of your project team, reasonable compensation, rewards and
                         recognition, and career paths
                       * Health and safety standards and regulations
                       * Using IT to your advantage

                     If you come from a business background, you'll have an edge on your project man-
                  agement exam. Much of project management is based on management skills, and you

                         can rely, to some extent, on your experience to help answer exam questions. A word of
                         caution, however: The exam is based first upon the PMBOK and then on your skills.
                         Answer your questions according to the PMBOK first. In most organizations, however,
                         the project manager needs three things to be successful:

                              * Knowledge Understanding the business environment and how project
                                management operates.
                              * Performance Understanding the business and project management is great,
                                but the project manager must get things done. Apply the knowledge you know
                                to get the results you want.
                              * Personal Your personality, character, likeability, and effectiveness all
                                contribute to how well the project manager accomplishes the project
                                objective. I believe that people want to work with people they like. It's always
                                better to have someone want to work for you, the project manager, than
                                someone who has to work for you.

                         Dealing with People
                         As a project manager, you have to interact with people--lots of people. You need inter-
                         personal skills to work with, motivate, lead, and manage other people. Specifically,
                         you'll need the following interpersonal skills:

                              * The ability to effectively communicate Communication is the core of
                                project management and will likely take up most of your time.
                              * A knack for influencing the organization This is simply the ability to get
                                things done. (Wink, wink--I am hinting at politics, power, negotiations, and
                                trade-offs.)
                              * A penchant for leading Project managers are leaders, not followers. You
                                need to be able to lead the project team, stakeholders, and even vendors
                                toward the vision of the project.
                              * Motivating people         Can you energize and excite people about your project?
                                You need to.
                              * Negotiating and managing conflicts A good project manager has the ability
                                to negotiate, lead negotiations, and resolve conflicts in the best interest of the
                                project.
                              * Solving problems Projects are often full of problems that you'll need to
                                figure out. Want to know a secret? Your project management certification
                                exam is just one example you can apply problem solving to. The questions are
                                tricky, and you'll have to use some brain power to deduce the right choice.

                           Many of these interpersonal skills also overlap with general management skills.
                         Management is all about getting key results; it's about getting things done. Leadership,

                  something good project managers have, is about aligning people, directing people, and
                  motivating people to do their work with passion.




                                                                                                                                             PART I
                  Examining the Project Management Context
                  Projects typically fall under some umbrella within an organization: project portfolio
                  management, project offices, or programs. The project management context describes
                  all the different scenarios where a project may reside.
                       Your real-life organization may have one, all, or even none of these descriptions--
                  don't sweat it. For your exam, however, you'll need to be familiar with these different or-
                  ganizational situations and how each one affects the project and the project manager.

                  Working with Programs
                  A program is a collection of related projects organized to gain benefits from the projects
                  that wouldn't be realized if the projects were managed independently. Consider a pro-
                  gram of building a skyscraper. There could be lots of projects within the skyscraper
                  program: structure, elevators, electrical, plumbing, and tons more.
                      If each project were managed independently, a lot of work would have to be dupli-
                  cated within the construction of the new skyscraper. But by creating a program, you can
                  save time and effort by managing projects collectively. For example, the electrician, the
                  telephone installer, and the network engineer can pool their resources to pull the elec-
                  trical cables, telephone cables, and network cables all at once.
                      The point to take away from this discussion on programs is that projects are usually
                  contributing one major deliverable and can work together to save time, effort, and dollars.

                  Opening Your Portfolio
                  Project portfolio management is the selection, management, and collection of projects
                  within an organization. Unlike a program, the projects may not be directly related, but
                  they contribute to the organization's overall strategic plan. For example, a construction
                  company may have a collection of projects in which some are high-profile projects that
                  could change a city skyline, and other projects are minor, such as the construction of a
                  small garage or home.
                      The portfolio of projects defines the rules for selecting, maintaining, and even fund-
                  ing the projects within an organization. We all know that a company usually has only
                  so much money to invest in the projects it selects. Project portfolio management de-
                  fines the projects that should be selected based on need, risk and reward, return on
                  investment, and practically any other issues an organization identifies.
                      Unfortunately, or fortunately, depending on how you look at it, project managers
                  aren't usually directly involved in project portfolio management. This activity is gener-
                  ally reserved for senior management, because they decide which projects best propel an
                  organization's mission, purpose, and strategy. Project managers inherit upper manage-
                  ment's vision and then manage the projects they've been assigned.

                         Working with Subprojects
                         A subproject is just a project that's been lopped off from a larger project. For example,
                         a project to build a new house may create a subproject for all of the home automation,
                         home theater, and home network installation. The subproject is managed as its own
                         project, but has constraints and requirements within the confines of the larger project
                         to create the new home. Other examples of subprojects include:

                              * A single phase within a project life cycle A good example is the phases of
                                construction on a new home: permits, excavation, foundation, framing, and
                                so on. Each phase could be a subproject.
                              * Human resource skill sets Consider all of the work that plumbers,
                                electricians, carpenters, and other skilled workers can do. The related work of
                                each professional could form a subproject.
                              * Specialized technology, materials, or activities The installation of a new
                                type of siding for our home construction project could be considered a
                                subproject, where we'd use a team of specialists to manage and complete the
                                subproject.

                         Working with Project Management Offices
                         A project management office, often just called a PMO, oversees all of the projects and
                         supports all of the project managers within an organization. PMOs can be organized to
                         manage all projects within an organization, within departments, or even by the nature
                         of the project work, such as IT versus marketing. Sometimes a project management of-
                         fice might be called a "project office" or a "program office."
                             Most PMOs support the project manager and the project team through software,
                         training, templates, standardized policies, and procedures. PMOs often coordinate
                         communications across projects, offer mentoring to project managers, and help resolve
                         issues between project team members, project managers, and stakeholders. Project
                         managers working with a PMO typically report to a chief project officer or program of-
                         ficer, depending on the organizational structure.


                         Chapter Summary
                         You're done with Chapter 1. Congrats!
                             In this chapter, we talked about what it takes to be a Project Management Profes-
                         sional (PMP) and what it takes to be a Certified Associate in Project Management
                         (CAPM). Which one are you geared for? Depending on which certification you're going
                         to achieve, you'll create a strategy on how you'll use this book, your time, and the
                         PMBOK to pass the examination.
                             You'll need to know the 47 management processes and how these processes map to
                         the nine knowledge areas of project management. This book discusses clearly and in

                      I also discussed what a project is--and is not. You now know that a project is a
                  short-term endeavor to create a unique product or service. Projects are created for
                  any number of reasons, from marketplace demand to solving a problem within an
                  organization.
                      Projects, regardless of why they were created, move through a progressive elabora-
                  tion to provide accurate and complete descriptions of their goals and objectives. Recall
                  that progressive elaboration typically starts with a broad synopsis of a project's goals,
                  and through rounds of discussion, analysis, and brainstorming, the characteristics of a
                  project become more detailed until, finally, the project vision is created.
                      A project manager must understand the environment and circumstances that the
                  project will operate in. The locale, culture, and conditions surrounding the project can
                  affect the project success as much as the project manager's ability to lead and manage
                  the facets of the project and the project team. If a project management office exists, it
                  can provide training and support for the project manager to effectively lead the project
                  team to complete the project work.
                      Your next step in your certification quest is to create flashcards on the key terms and
                  then to complete the 20-question exam. When you're done with the exam, fire up the
                  Exam Scores spreadsheet and record your chapter score. Keep moving!

                  Key Terms

                  cation that defines widely accepted project management practices. The CAPM and the
                  PMP exam are based on this book.
                  Application areas The areas of expertise, industry, or function where a project is
                  centered. Examples of application areas include architecture, IT, health care, and

                  Cultural and social environment Defines how a project affects people and how those
                  people may affect the project. Cultural and social environments include the economic,
                  educational, ethical, religious, demographic, and ethnic composition of the people af-
                  fected by the project.
                  Deliverable A product, service, or result created by a project. Projects can have mul-

                         Iron Triangle of Project Management A triangle with the characteristics of time, cost,
                         and scope. Time, cost, and scope each constitute one side of the triangle; if any side of
                         the Iron Triangle is not in balance with the other sides, the project will suffer. The Iron
                         Triangle of Project Management is also known as the Triple Constraints of Project Man-
                         agement, as all projects are constrained by time, cost, and scope.
                         Physical environment         The physical structure and surroundings that affect a proj-
                         ect's work.

                         deliverable.
                         Progressive elaboration The process of gathering project details. This process uses
                         deductive reasoning, logic, and a series of information-gathering techniques to identify
                         details about a project, product, or solution.
                         Project A temporary endeavor to create a unique product, service, or result. The end
                         result of a project is also called a deliverable.
                         Project environment The location and culture of the environment where the project
                         work will reside. The project environment includes the social, economic, and environ-
                         mental variables the project must work with or around.
                         Project Management Institute (PMI) An organization of project management pro-
                         fessionals from around the world, supporting and promoting the careers, values, and
                         concerns of project managers.
                         Project management office (PMO) A central office that oversees all projects within
                         an organization or within a functional department. A PMO supports the project man-

                         tion, and other services.
                         Project Management Professional (PMP) A person who has proven project manage-
                         ment experience and has qualified for and then passed the PMP examination.
                         Project portfolio management The management and selection of projects that sup-
                         port an organization's vision and mission. It is the balance of project priority, risk, re-
                         ward, and return on investment. This is a senior management process.
                         Subprojects A smaller project managed within a larger, parent project. Subprojects
                         are often contracted work whose deliverable allows the larger project to progress.
                         Triple Constraints of Project Management Also known as the Iron Triangle. This
                         theory posits that time, cost, and scope are three constraints that every project has.

                        following?
                        A. A program
                        B. An operation
                        C. A project
                        D. A subproject
                        C. A project is a temporary endeavor to create a unique product, service, or
                        result. Deadlines and cost constraints are tied to the project. A is incorrect
                        because programs are a collection of projects working toward a common
                        cause. B is incorrect because operations are ongoing activities of an
                        organization. D, a subproject, describes a project that is part of and supports
                        a larger project, so it is also incorrect.

                                 A. Providing electricity to a community is the best example of operations
                                 because it is an ongoing activity. B, C, and D are all examples of projects, as
                                 they are temporary and create a unique product, service, or result.
                              3. You are the project manager of the HBH Project to install 40 new servers for
                                 your company network. You recommend, as part of your project planning,
                                 using progressive elaboration. Some of the project team members are
                                 confused on this concept. Of the following, which one is the best example of
                                 progressive elaboration?
                                  A. It is the process of decomposing the work into small, manageable tasks.

                                 B. According to the PMBOK, progressive elaboration means developing in
                                 steps and then continuing by increments. Choice A describes the process of
                                 breaking down the project scope into the task list. C is not a valid choice for
                                 this question. D is part of determining if a project should be chartered and
                                 thus is not the best answer for this question.
                              4. Your organization would like to create a new product based on market
                                 research. This new product will be created by a project. This is an example of
                                 which one of the following reasons to launch a new project?
                                  A. Organizational need
                                  B. Customer request
                                  C. Market demand
                                  D. Legal requirement
                                 C. Projects can be created for a number of reasons, and this example supports
                                 the market demand choice. A, an organizational need, is a project to satisfy
                                 an internal need. B is incorrect because no specific customer asked for this new
                                 product. D is incorrect because there is no legal requirement to create the
                                 new product.
                              5. Your organization utilizes projects, programs, and portfolios. Some of the
                                 project team members are confused on what a program is. A program is which
                                 one of the following?
                                  A. A very large, complex project
                                  B. A collection of small projects with a common goal
                                  C. A collection of projects with a common objective
                                  D. A collection of subprojects with a common customer
                                 C. A program is a collection of projects working together to gain benefits by
                                 managing the projects as a group rather than on an individual basis. A, B, and

                                                                                                                           35
                    D are not attributes of programs because projects within a program neither
                    are necessarily small nor are they subprojects.

                  6. Sam and Sarah are in a heated discussion over a new program in the
                     organization. They are trying to determine who will make the tactical
                     decisions in the projects within the program. Who manages programs?
                     A. Management
                     B. Project sponsors
                     C. Project managers
                    D. Program managers
                    D. Programs are managed by program managers. A, B, and C are incorrect
                    choices.
                  7. You have an excellent idea for a new project that can increase productivity by
                     20 percent in your organization. Management, however, declines to approve
                     the proposed project because too many resources are already devoted to other
                     projects. You have just experienced what?
                     A. Parametric modeling
                     B. Management by exception
                     C. Project portfolio management
                    D. Management reserve
                    C. Project portfolio management is the management, selection, and
                    assignment of projects that support an organization's business objectives. A,
                    B, and D are not valid answers.
                  8. While the project manager must balance risks, resources, and other aspects
                     of the project, one of the fundamental concepts is the Iron Triangle. Of the
                     following, which is not part of the Iron Triangle?
                     A. Quality
                     B. Time
                     C. Scope
                    D. Cost
                    A. Quality, while important, is not part of the Iron Triangle of Project
                    Management. B, C, and D make up the Iron Triangle.
                  9. Holly is a new project manager and she's working toward her CAPM
                     certification. She is having some trouble understanding which processes she
                     should implement in her new project based on the available processes in the
                     PMBOK Guide. Of the following, which statement is correct?
                     A. A project manager must use every process identified within the PMBOK on
                        every project.

                                  B. A project must use every tool and technique as identified within the
                                     PMBOK on every project.
                                  C. A project manager must use the most appropriate processes on every
                                     project.
                                  D. A project manager must agree that he will use all of the project
                                     management tools and techniques on every project.
                                 C. A project manager does not have to use all of the processes within the
                                 PMBOK, only the most appropriate. A, B, and D are incorrect statements
                                 because the project manager does not use every process or tool and technique
                                 within the PMBOK.
                             10. Projects are temporary endeavors to create a unique product, service, or result.
                                 Which one of the following does not relate to the concept of "temporary" in
                                 project management?
                                  A. The project team
                                  B. The market window status on which the project is capitalizing
                                  C. The project deliverable
                                  D. The project manager
                                 C. Most projects create a deliverable that will outlive the project itself. A, B,
                                 and D are incorrect because these attributes are temporary in nature.
                             11. Harold is the project manager of the JHG Project for his company and he's
                                 meeting with the key stakeholders to describe the deliverables of the project
                                 that will be implemented. Hanna, one of the stakeholders, is confused on why
                                 Harold talks about results of the project that aren't necessarily implemented.
                                 As an example, Harold says that a project creates a unique product, service, or
                                 result. Which one of the following is a result?
                                  A. A new piece of software
                                  B. A new airplane
                                  C. A feasibility study
                                  D. A call center
                                 C. The PMBOK classifies the concept of creating feasibility as a result. A, B,
                                 and D describe products and services.
                             12. You are the project manager of the GHY Project for your company and you're
                                 working with the key project stakeholders to define the requirements of the
                                 project. One of the stakeholders mentions that there are industry standards,
                                 but there are also regulations for the project to consider. What is the
                                 difference between a standard and a regulation?
                                  A. A standard is optional; regulations are not.
                                  B. A standard is not optional; a regulation may be.

                      C. A standard is rarely optional; regulations are never optional.




                                                                                                                                         PART I
                      D. A standard is a guideline; a regulation is a request.
                      A. This is the best choice because standards are optional while regulations are
                      not. B, C, and D do not accurately describe the difference between standards
                      and regulations.
                  13. A project manager needs five areas of expertise to be successful. Which one is
                      not one of the five areas of expertise?
                      A. Application area knowledge
                      B. An understanding of the project environment
                      C. PMP or CAPM certification
                      D. Interpersonal skills
                      C. Believe it or not, you don't have to be a PMP or a CAPM to be a successful
                      project manager. A, B, and D are valid characteristics of a project manager.
                  14. Project managers must be aware of the political and social environments that
                      the project operates within. These environments can affect the project's ability
                      to operate, can limit working hours, or cause embarrassment when the project
                      manager assumes other cultures are the same as hers. Which one of the
                      following is not a characteristic of a project's cultural and social environment?
                      A. Economics
                      B. Time zone differences
                      C. Demographics
                      D. Ethics
                      B. Time zone differences are not part of the cultural and social environment,
                      but are part of the international and political environment. A, C, and D are
                      part of the cultural and social environment.
                  15. You are the project manager of the KHGT Project, which will span four
                      countries around the world. You will need to consider all of the following
                      characteristics of the international and political environment except for which
                      one?
                      A. International, national, regional, and local laws
                      B. Customs
                      C. Customers
                      D. Holidays
                      C. Customers are not part of the international and political environment. A,
                      B, and D are part of this environment.

                             16. Project managers need interpersonal skills, such as likeability, to help get
                                 the project work done. The project manager needs interpersonal skills to be
                                 effective in any organization and project. Which one of the following is not an
                                 example of an interpersonal skill?
                                  A. Financial management and accounting
                                  B. Influencing the organization

                                  D. Problem solving
                                 A. Financial management and accounting is not an interpersonal skill. B, C,
                                 and D are examples of interpersonal skills, so these choices are invalid for
                                 this question.
                             17. Jane is a senior project manager in your company. Wally is a new project
                                 manager who is working toward his CAPM certification. Jane decides that
                                 Wally would be a good candidate to manage a subproject in the organization.
                                 Brenda, the project sponsor, isn't certain what Jane means by a subproject.
                                 What is a subproject?
                                  A. It is a smaller project that supports a parent project.
                                  B. It is a project that is performing below expectations.
                                  C. It is a project that has been experiencing project spin-off.
                                  D. It is the delegation of a project phase.
                                 A. A subproject is a project that is typically smaller than the original that
                                 supports a parent project. B, C, and D do not accurately describe a subproject.
                             18. Erin is a new project manager who is working toward her CAPM. She has
                                 been assigned a small project in her organization, but she feels that she could
                                 use some additional training, coaching, and mentoring. Where will a project
                                 manager most likely get project management mentoring?
                                  A. Project Management International
                                  B. The American Society for Quality
                                  C. The project management office

                                 management office. A is not a valid choice. B is not a valid choice because
                                 ASQ does not provide mentoring for project managers. D is not the best
                                 choice for the question because the PMBOK specifically identifies the PMO as
                                 a source for mentoring.
                             19. Project managers and functional managers need to be able to recognize a
                                 condition that is best suited for a project, and a condition that is an operation
                                 within an entity. Which one of the following is an example of operations?

                      work is done every month. A, B, and D are all unique endeavors that may be
                      done once or just occasionally, but are not part of ongoing operations.
                  20. When considering the selection of projects to be initiated, project portfolio
                      management considers all of the following except for which one?
                      A. Risk/reward categories
                      B. Lines of business

                      D. General types of projects
                      C. While the experience of the project manager is likely considered during
                      the assignment of projects, it is not considered during project portfolio
                      management. A, the risk and reward of the project is considered. B and D,
                      the lines of business and the general types of projects, are also considered as
                      part of project portfolio management.

                    In this chapter, you will
                       * Learn how a project moves through phases
                       * Discover how to work with project stakeholders
                       * Understand how different organizations operate
                       * Learn the types of organizational structures and their characteristics




                  You've got lots of work to do as a project manager: meetings, planning, coordination,
                  leading the project team, and ensuring that the project work is done according to the
                  project plan. You're with the project all the way, from the get-go to the final closure re-
                  port. You work with project stakeholders to gather requirements, keep them posted on
                  the progress, and manage their influence over the project as much as possible. It's an
                  ongoing job that ends just after the project work does.

                      While your job as the project manager centers on getting the project work done, we
                  know that it's really more than just doing the project work. Logistics and problem solv-
                  ing cling to the project like socks to a wool skirt. That's what you'll learn in this chapter
                  (no, not about socks).

                  Identifying the Project Life Cycle
                  Projects are born, they live, and then they die. Morbid, isn't it? But that simple meta-
                  phor of being born, living, and dying is exactly what the Project Management Institute
                  (PMI) calls the duration of a project: the project life cycle. A project life cycle is the
                  project from start to finish. Every project in the world has its own life cycle. Consider
                  any project you've ever worked on, whether it was in construction, manufacturing, or
                  information technology. Every project was born (initiated), lived (planned, executed,
                  monitored, and controlled), and then died (closed). That's the project life cycle.
                      If we were to visit a technology guru and check out his projects, they'd have a differ-
                  ent life cycle from what a construction company's projects might have. Every project life
                  cycle is unique to the nature of the work being completed.

                                                                                                                     41

                                       EXAM TIP Because every project has its own life cycle, regardless of the
                                       application area, it's tough for PMI to ask specific questions on this subject.
                                       You'll likely encounter questions about what a project life cycle is, but not on
                                       the activities that would take place in a project's life cycle.

                         Examining a Project Life Cycle
                         A project is an uncertain business, and the larger the project, the more uncertainty. For
                         this reason, among others, projects are broken down into smaller, more manageable
                         phases. A project phase allows a project manager to see the project as a whole and yet
                         still focus on completing the project one phase at a time.
                              A life cycle is almost always comprised of multiple phases. You can most often iden-
                         tify a project life cycle by the phases that exist within the project. A construction project
                         may, for example, move through these phases:

                              * Research
                              * Pre-construction
                              * Site work
                              * Foundation
                              * Framing
                              * Rough-in
                              * Interior finishes
                              * Exterior finishes
                              * Landscaping

                              The end result of a phase generally creates a project deliverable and allows the proj-
                         ect to move toward its completion. Check out the preceding list. Just because a phase
                         has been completed does not necessarily mean that the next phase can automatically
                         begin. A phase-end review is needed to determine that the phase has met all of its obliga-
                         tions, and then to authorize the initiation of the subsequent phase. A phase-end review
                         is also known as a phase exit, phase gate, or a kill point.

                                       EXAM TIP You might also know the end of a project phase as a decision
                                       gate, stage gate, or kill point. A kill point is an ideal opportunity to "kill" a
                                       project at the end of a phase.

                             Imagine a construction project to build a new sports complex for your city. The founda-
                         tion of the entire sports complex may not need to be 100 percent complete for the framing
                         of the building to begin. The framing could begin as long as the risk associated with starting
                         this phase of the project was acceptable. The practice of overlapping phases is called fast
                         tracking (we'll see this again in Chapter 6 in a discussion on project time management).
                         While fast tracking does save project time, it can increase project risk.

                              EXAM TIP Fast tracking is an example of schedule compression, as it allows




                                                                                                                                              PART I
                              project phases to overlap. Fast tracking can, however, increase project risk. Fast
                              tracking is not the same as lead time, which is the negative time between
                              project activities. Some project managers do a type of fast tracking by adding
                              lead time to activities on the critical path. Technically, fast tracking allows entire
                              phases to overlap, whereas lead time allows activities to overlap.

                      In most organizations, regardless of the project manager's experience, manage-
                  ment wants to see proof of progress, evidence of work completed, and good news of
                  how well the project is moving. Phases are an ideal method of keeping management
                  informed of the project progression. The following illustration depicts a project mov-
                  ing from conception to completion. At the end of each phase is some deliverable that
                  the project manager can show to management and customers.




                      Some projects use an iterative relationship. These special projects are great for
                  endeavors where there's a fair amount of uncertainty surrounding the project's lon-
                  gevity or technology, or the market conditions are shifting. These projects only plan
                  for one phase of a project at a time, and the next phase of the project is planned while
                  the current phase of the project is being executed. This approach allows the project
                  manager and the organization to adapt to circumstances, create usable benefits in
                  each phase, and maximize resource utilization across the organization.
                      A predictive life cycle, more commonly called a plan-driven or waterfall approach,
                  is a life cycle that "predicts" the work that will happen in each phase of the project.
                  Through a series of waterfalls, where the outputs of one phase allow the next phase to
                  begin, the project moves through a defined approach in each phase. Each phase in this
                  approach usually requires different resources and skills, so the project team may be
                  large, but may not necessarily all work on the project together other than the scope
                  definition activities. Changes to the scope are more tightly controlled in this plan-
                  driven approach than in other project management approaches.
                      While the predictive life cycle approach seems tightly controlled, the adaptive ap-
                  proach can seem like change is encouraged. You might also know the adaptive approach
                  as the agile method to project management. Change does happen often in the adaptive
                  approach because there's an expectation for change and the project's stakeholders are
                  actively involved in the entire project. Adaptive projects move through iterations of

                         planning and execution (usually in two to four weeks), alternating from planning and

                         Project Life Cycle Characteristics
                         Because every project in the world is unique, it's impossible to say exactly what must
                         happen in every phase of the project life cycle. There are, however, characteristics of
                         every project life cycle that are universal:

                              * Phases are typically sequential and the completion of a phase allows
                                subsequent phases to begin.
                              * Project costs and staffing requirements are generally low at the project
                                beginning phases, while costs and resources are highest in the project
                                intermediate phases. As the project moves toward completion, the cost and
                                resource requirements generally wane.
                              * The likelihood of the project's success is always lowest during the early phases
                                of the project. As the project moves toward completion, the likelihood of the
                                project's success increases.
                              * Stakeholders have the highest influences on the project product during the
                                initiating phases, as Figure 2-1 demonstrates.

                            Every project moves through phases, and phases compose the project life cycle.
                         Phases are logical approaches to segmenting the work, but they primarily allow man-
                         agement, an organization, or a project manager to have better control over the work
                         done in each phase. Each phase within a project determines:

                              * The work that will happen in that phase
                              * The deliverables that will be created as a result of that phase
                              * How the phase deliverables will be reviewed, approved, and validated
                              * The needed resources for that phase
                              * How that phase will be approved to allow successor phases to launch

                         Comparing Project Life Cycles and Product Life Cycles
                         There must be some distinction between the project life cycle and the product life cycle.
                         We've covered the project life cycle--the accumulation of phases from start to comple-
                         tion within a project--but what is a product life cycle?
                             A product life cycle is the whole life of the product the project has created. If your
                         company had a brilliant idea to create a new piece of software, initiated and managed
                         a project to create the software, and then implemented the software, that would be
                         most of the product life cycle. The remainder of the product life cycle is the usage and
                         support of the software until someday, sadly, the software is determined to be out-of-
                         date and retired from your organization. The product life cycle is the whole gosh-darn
                         span of time, from concept to project to usage to retirement.

                  Figure 2-1 Stakeholder influence wanes as the project moves toward completion. Cost due to
                  changes increases as the project moves toward completion.



                  Meeting the Project Stakeholders
                  Stakeholders are those fine folks and organizations who are involved in the project or
                  who will be affected by its outcome--in other words, people, groups, businesses, cus-
                  tomers, and communities that have a vested interest in the project. If you're a project
                  manager who is working with a senior project manager, or if you are assisting the proj-
                  ect manager, you are a stakeholder as well. One of the first project management pro-
                  cesses you'll do is to identify the project stakeholders--something that's essential for
                  stakeholder management throughout the project. If you overlook stakeholders, they'll
                  be offended, but more likely you'll be missing out on key information you'll need for
                  project planning and execution.
                      Stakeholders may like, love, or hate your project. Consider an organization that is host-
                  ing a project to move all their workers to a common word processing application. Every-
                  one within this organization must now use the same word processing application. Your
                  job, as the project manager, is to see that it happens.
                      Within your project, you've got stakeholders who like the project; they favor the
                  project deliverable. Other stakeholders love the project--they cannot wait for all of




02-ch02.indd 45                                                                                                                  7/12/2013 3:55:15 AM

                         the organization to use the same application for word processing. These people are
                         considered positive stakeholders. And, sigh, there are those stakeholders who hate
                         your project and want to do everything they can to make your project fail. Yep, these
                         people are negative stakeholders. It's possible that you may have some neutral stake-
                         holders who can affect your project, but they're indifferent to what your project is
                         aiming to accomplish.
                              Stakeholders, especially negative stakeholders, may try to influence the project it-
                         self. This can be attempted in many ways:

                              * Political capital leveraged to change the project deliverable
                              * Change requests to alter the project deliverable
                              * Scope addendums to add to the project deliverable
                              * Sabotage, through physical acts or rumors, gossip, and negative influence


                                       EXAM TIP Any stakeholder who is opposed to, is threatened by, or wants
                                       your project to just go away is a negative stakeholder.


                              Your role as a project manager is to identify and align stakeholders, and to ascertain
                         their expectations of the project. You may lead the project or work with another project
                         manager to confirm the alignment of stakeholder priorities within the project. Stake-
                         holder identification is not always as clear-cut as in the preceding example. Because
                         stakeholders are defined as people who are affected by the outcome of your project,
                         external customers may be stakeholders in your project, too.
                              Consider a company that is implementing a frequent-customer discount project.
                         External customers will use a card that tracks their purchases and that gives them dis-
                         counts on certain items they buy. Is the customer in this instance a stakeholder? What
                         if the customer doesn't want to use the card? Is she still a stakeholder?
                              Stakeholders can go by many different names: internal and external customers,
                         project owners, financiers, contractors, family members, government regulatory agen-
                         cies, communities, cities, citizens, project team members, and more. The classification
                         of stakeholders into categories is not as important as realizing and understanding stake-
                         holders' concerns and expectations. However, the identification and classification of
                         stakeholders does allow the project manager to deliver effective and timely communi-
                         cations to the appropriate stakeholders.

                                       NOTE In high-profile projects, where stakeholders will conflict over the
                                       project purpose, deliverables, cost, and schedule, the project manager may
                                       want to use the Delphi Technique to gain anonymous consensus among
                                       stakeholders. The Delphi Technique allows stakeholders to offer opinions and
                                       input without fear of retribution from management, by using rounds of
                                       anonymous surveys to find a consensus among the key project stakeholders.

                  Key Project Stakeholders




                                                                                                                                            PART I
                  Beyond those stakeholders affected by the project deliverable are key stakeholders on
                  every project. Let's meet them:

                      * Project manager The project manager is the person--which could also
                        be you, the Certified Associate in Project Management (CAPM) or Project
                        Management Professional (PMP)--who is accountable for managing the
                        project. He or she guides the team through the project phases to completion.
                       * Customer/user The customer is the person or group that will use the project
                         deliverable. In some instances, a project may have many different customers.
                         Consider a book publisher for children. The bookstores distribute the
                         children's book; the adults pay for the book; the children read the book. There
                         is also some consideration given to the user versus the customer. The user uses
                         the product; the customer pays for it. A stakeholder can be both a user and a
                         customer.
                       * Functional management Functional management consists of the managers
                         of the administration or functional units of an organization. They have their
                         own staff, are part of ongoing operations, and may lend resources to your
                         project. Often it's the functional management that employs the people
                         responsible for completing the project work.
                       * Project team members The project team is the collection of individuals who
                         will, hopefully, work together to ensure the success of the project. The project
                         manager works with the project team to guide, schedule, and oversee the
                         project work. The project team completes the project work.
                       * Sponsor The sponsor authorizes the project. This person or group ensures
                         that the project manager has the necessary resources, including monies, to get
                         the work done. The project sponsor is someone within the performing
                         organization who has the power to authorize and sanction the project work,
                         and who is ultimately responsible for the project's success. Ideally, project
                         sponsors shield the project manager from attacks, scope changes, and
                         authority challenges.
                       * Sellers and business partners These are people who may not be directly
                         affected by the project's product, but their interaction with the organization
                         can influence a project. Sellers and business partners are the vendors,
                         suppliers, and contractors for your project.
                       * PMO The project management office (PMO) is considered a stakeholder of
                         the project it oversees. If an organization does not have a PMO, then this
                         stakeholder, of course, doesn't exist. The PMO provides project management
                         support, templates, and training, and helps direct the project management
                         activities of the organization.
                       * Portfolio managers This entity is a high-level committee or board within
                         the organization that decides which projects and programs the organization




02-ch02.indd 47                                                                                                                7/12/2013 3:55:15 AM

                                 should invest in. The board will review each proposed endeavor, evaluating its
                                 cost, benefits, return on investment, and other project characteristics to
                                 determine if the project is worthy for the organization to pursue. This board
                                 may also be known as the portfolio review board.
                              * Program managers Program managers lead programs for the organization.
                                A program is a collection of projects that are working in concert to create
                                benefits for the organization that the organization could not realize by
                                managing the projects as individual efforts. All projects that reside in a
                                program automatically include the program manager as a stakeholder in their
                                project.
                              * Operations management "Operations" describes the typically ongoing, day-
                                to-day activities at the core function of an organization. Operations
                                management is slightly different from functional management; operations
                                deal with the saleable goods and services at the heart of the organization's
                                overall purpose.


                         Managing Stakeholder Expectations
                         Have you ever had an experience that didn't live up to your expectations? Not much
                         fun, is it? With project management and the large number of stakeholders, it's easy to
                         see how some stakeholders' expectations won't be realistic due to cost, schedule, or
                         feasibility. A project manager must find solutions to create win-win scenarios between
                         stakeholders.

                                       EXAM TIP If you want to manage stakeholders' expectations, you have to
                                       know who they are first. Identify the stakeholders, and then you can identify
                                       their requirements. Once the expectations for a project are identified, get
                                       them on paper! Nothing beats documentation.

                         Managing Expectations in Action
                         Consider a project to implement new customer relationship management (CRM) soft-
                         ware. This project has three primary stakeholders with differing expectations:

                              * The sales director primarily wants a technical solution that will ensure fast
                                output of order placements, proposals, and customer contact information--
                                regardless of the cost.
                              * The marketing director primarily wants a technical solution that can track call
                                volume, customer sales history, and trends with the least cost to implement.
                              * The IT director wants a technical solution that will fan into the existing
                                network topology, have considerable ease of use, and be reliable--without
                                costing more than 20 percent of his budget for ongoing support.

                                                                                                                                  49
                      In this scenario, the project manager will have to work with each of the stakeholders
                  to determine a winning solution that satisfies all of the project requirements while ad-




                                                                                                                                              PART I
                  dressing the stakeholders' demands. The project manager assistant and the project
                  manager may interview these stakeholders to rank their priorities, along with required
                  and optional results for the project deliverables.
                      Specifically, the solution for the conflict of stakeholders is to satisfy the needs of the
                  customer first. Customer needs, or the business need of why the project was initiated,
                  should guide the project through its life cycle. Once the project scope is aligned with
                  the customer's needs, the project manager may work to satisfy the differing expecta-
                  tions of the stakeholders.

                  Identifying the Organizational Influences
                  Projects happen within organizations, and in most instances, the organization is larger
                  than the project. This means that your project has to answer to someone, some depart-
                  ment, or even a customer of the organization. As much as I'd like to call all of the shots
                  on all the projects I manage, and I'm sure you wish the same, we both know we have to
                  answer to someone within our organization. The people that project managers answer
                  to are the influencers within an organization.

                               EXAM TIP Cultural norms describe the culture and the styles of an
                               organization. Cultural norms, such as work ethics, hours, view of authority, and
                               shared values, can affect how the project is managed. It's important for the
                               project manager to know what the cultural norms are and to operate
                               accordingly.

                     How a project is influenced is largely based on the type of organization that the
                  project is occurring within. Project-centric organizations fall under two big umbrellas:

                       * Organizations that exist primarily to perform projects for others. Think of architects,
                         IT consulting firms, engineering firms, consultants, and just about any other
                         agency that completes work for others on a contract basis. (This is what I do as
                         a writer and corporate educator.)
                       * Organizations that use management by projects to manage their business. These
                         organizations manage their work through their project management system.
                         An IT department, for example, may treat an upgrade of all their network
                         servers as a project. A manufacturer may treat a customer's job as a project. In
                         the traditional sense, these activities are part of their operations, but because
                         there's a definite beginning and ending to that specific work, they're taking
                         advantage of a project management system they've adapted or created.

                      You also have to consider the maturity of the organization where the project is be-
                  ing hosted. A large internal organization that's been established for years will likely
                  have a more detailed project management system than a startup entrepreneurial com-
                  pany. The standards, regulations, culture, and procedures influence how the project

                         should be managed, how the project manager will lead and discipline the project team,
                         the reporting relationships, and the flow of communications that will take place. Con-
                         sider the cultural components within an organization:

                              * Defined values, beliefs, and expectations of the project work
                              * Policies and procedures, both within the organization and external to the
                                organization (consider the policies that govern the banking industry, for
                                example)
                              * Defined authority for the project manager and over the project managers
                              * Defined working hours and work ethics of the project team, project manager,
                                and management


                         Completing Projects in Different Organizational
                         Structures
                         Organizations are structured into one of six models, the organizational structure of
                         which will affect the project in some aspect. In particular, the organizational structure
                         will set the level of authority, the level of autonomy, and the reporting structure that the
                         project manager can expect to have within the project. Figure 2-2 shows the level of
                         authority for the project manager and the functional manager in each of the organiza-
                         tional structures. The organizational structures include:

                              * Functional
                              * Weak matrix
                              * Balanced matrix
                              * Strong matrix
                              * Projectized
                              * Composite


                                       NOTE Understanding the type of organizational structure you're working in
                                       will help you be a better project manager.


                         Functional Organizations
                         Functional organizations are entities that have clear divisions regarding business units
                         and their associated responsibilities. For example, a functional organization may have
                         an accounting department, manufacturing department, research and development de-
                         partment, marketing department, and so on. Each department works as a separate en-
                         tity within the organization, and each employee works in a department unique to their
                         area of expertise. In these classical organizations, there is a clear relationship between
                         an employee and a specific functional manager.

                                                                                                                                 51

                  the authority that
                  the project manager
                  and functional
                  manager will have




                      Functional organizations do complete projects, but these projects are specific to the
                  function of the department that the project falls into. For example, the IT department
                  could implement new software for the finance department. The role of the IT depart-
                  ment is separate from the finance department, but the need for coordination between
                  the two would be evident. Communication between departments flows through func-
                  tional managers down to the project team. Project managers in functional organiza-
                  tions have the following attributes:

                       * Little power
                       * Little autonomy
                       * Report directly to a functional manager
                       * May be known as a project coordinator, project expeditor, project
                         administrator, or team leader (or project scapegoat)
                       * Project role is part time
                       * Project team is part time
                       * Little or no administrative staff to expedite the project management activities

                  Matrix Structures
                  Matrix structures are organizations that blend departmental duties and employees to-
                  gether on a common project. These structures allow for project team members from
                  multiple departments to work toward the project completion. In these instances, the
                  project team members have more than one boss. Depending on the number of projects
                  a team member is participating in, she may have to report to multiple project managers
                  as well as to her functional manager.

                         Weak Matrix
                         Weak matrix structures map closely to functional structures. The project team may come
                         from different departments, but the project manager reports directly to a specific func-
                         tional manager. Project managers in weak matrix organizations have the following at-
                         tributes:

                              * Limited authority
                              * Management of a part-time project team
                              * Part-time project role
                              * May be known as a project coordinator, project expeditor, project
                                administrator, or team leader
                              * May have part-time administrative staff to help expedite the project

                         Balanced Matrix
                         A balanced matrix structure has many of the same attributes as a weak matrix, but the
                         project manager has more time and power regarding the project. A balanced matrix still
                         has time-accountability issues for all the project team members, because their func-
                         tional managers will want reports on their time within the project. Project managers in
                         a balanced matrix have the following attributes:

                              * Reasonable authority
                              * May manage a part-time project team
                              * Have a full-time role as a project manager
                              * May have part-time administrative staff to help expedite the project

                         Strong Matrix
                         A strong matrix equates to a strong project manager. In this type of organization, many
                         of the same attributes for the project team exist, but the project manager gains power
                         when it comes to project work. The project team may also have more time available for
                         the project, even though the members may come from multiple departments within the
                         organization. Project managers in a strong matrix have the following attributes:

                              * A reasonable-to-high level of power
                              * Management of a part-time to nearly full-time project team
                              * Have a full-time role as a project manager
                              * Have a full-time administrative staff to help expedite the project

                         Projectized Structure
                         The projectized structure is at the pinnacle of project management structures. This or-
                         ganizational type groups employees, collocated or not, by activities on a particular proj-
                         ect. The project manager in a projectized structure may have complete, or very close to

                  sibility regarding the project's success.
                      Project managers in a projectized structure have the following attributes:

                       * High-to-complete level of authority over the project team
                       * Work full-time on the project with his or her team (though there may be
                         some slight variation)
                       * Have a full-time administrative staff to help expedite the project

                  Composite Organizations
                  On paper, all of these organizational structures look great. In reality, few companies
                  map to only one of these structures all of the time. For example, a company using the
                  functional model may create a special project consisting of talent from many different
                  departments. Such project teams report directly to a project manager and will work on
                  a high-priority project for its duration. These entities are called composite organizations
                  because they may be a blend of multiple organizational types.
                      Table 2-1 summarizes the most common organizational structures and their at-
                  tributes.

                  Managing Project Teams
                  Depending on which organizational structure you're operating within will also deter-
                  mine the type of project team you're managing. As you might guess, in a projectized

                         you're working with project team members that float from project to project, as in a
                         matrix environment, you'll have to coordinate with the other project managers, the
                         functional managers, and even the project team members about your project plans and
                         need for resources.
                             Project teams in a functional, matrix, or projectized organizational structure often
                         utilize contract-based workers to help achieve the project scope. These contractors are
                         individuals who are represented by third parties or consulting agencies. When you're
                         working with companies that have been hired to help and become part of the project
                         team, you've created a partnership among your company and the vendor's company.
                         This partnership is ruled by the contract and may conflict with the project manager's
                         approach, style, and project governance. You can alleviate much of the strain in a part-
                         nership by clearly communicating expectations of the entire project team and deter-
                         mining as early as possible if the contractors have issues with the way the project team
                         will be managed.
                             In today's electronic-based world, it's more and more common to work with virtual
                         teams. Virtual teams use web-collaboration software to host meetings, to share elec-
                         tronic workspaces, and to allow employees to work remotely. This, of course, saves on
                         travel expenses, allows utilization of talented workers from all areas of an organization,
                         and permits easier communications than just telephone conversations and e-mail. Vir-
                         tual teams do face additional problems that need to be addressed: time zone differ-
                         ences, language barriers, technology reliability, and cultural differences.

                         Working with Your PMO
                         Recall that a PMO is a schmancy club where all the project managers get together for
                         cigars and martinis. Not really--I just wanted to see if you were paying attention. The
                         PMO coordinates the activities of all the project managers. Its primary goal is to create
                         a uniform approach on how projects operate within the organization. PMOs can exist
                         in any structure, but are most commonly used in matrix structures and in projectized
                         environments.
                             The role of the PMO is typically to support the project management in the form of
                         providing templates, project management software, training, leadership, and even
                         granting authority for the project's existence. Often, the PMO provides the administra-
                         tive support a project manager can expect in a projectized environment.
                             Here's the big caveat with PMOs: Project team members in a projectized environ-
                         ment are traditionally working on one project at a time. A PMO, however, may elect to
                         share project team members among projects if it best serves the organization. So basi-
                         cally, there's no hard-and-fast rule for the assignment of project team members to an
                         individual project if they are reporting to the PMO rather than directly to the project
                         manager. For your CAPM or PMP exam, keep this in mind: The project managers report
                         to the PMO, and the PMO may exercise its authority over the project managers' control
                         of the project team.

                  Defining a Project Management System




                                                                                                                                              PART I
                  A project management system is a collection of tools, resources, a project management
                  methodology, and defined procedures a project manager uses to complete a project.
                  Project management is typically defined for the organization, and the collection of
                  tools and resources is considered the project management system--it's the approach to
                  managing projects within an organization.
                      Your project management plan defines how your project will work with and utilize
                  the project management system on which your organization relies. Of course, you don't
                  have to have a project management system, but most companies do. A project manage-
                  ment system will vary based on the project's application area, organizational structure,
                  and the project complexity.
                      If an organization is using a PMO, the PMO will likely control and dictate the func-
                  tions of the project management system. For your CAPM or PMP exam, know that a
                  project management system defines the processes and procedures a project manager is
                  to follow to complete a project.


                  Chapter Summary
                  Studying for your project management exam can be its own project. You have a sense
                  already where this project is going: to earn your certification. Sooner or later, your cer-
                  tification project will end, and you'll move on to other goals. Projects are the same way.
                  They have a life of their own, and it's called the project life cycle.
                       Every project, regardless of the application area, follows its own logical path from
                  initiation to closure. Within the project life cycle, phases allow the project to move to-
                  ward completion. At the end of a phase, the project should create some deliverable or
                  condition that allows the next phase to begin. Sometimes, depending on the associated
                  risk, phases are allowed to begin even when previous phases are not completed. This is
                  called fast tracking.
                       A project has the most uncertainty of finishing successfully at the beginning be-
                  cause it's a long, long way from completion. As a project moves closer to completion,
                  the likelihood of project success increases, because the completion of phases moves the
                  project closer to completing the project objectives. Also, at the start of the project, stake-
                  holders have the highest influence on the project's deliverables. This means they can
                  easily pick and choose, and change their minds over and over because nothing has been
                  created yet. When the project begins to create deliverables and move toward closure, it
                  becomes increasingly difficult for stakeholders to change their minds on what the proj-
                  ect deliverable should be. Stakeholders can still change their mind (and they often do),
                  but it'll usually cost more time and money the later they wait to announce changes to
                  the project requirements.
                       Speaking of stakeholders (the folks who have a vested interested in the outcome of
                  a project), it's up to the project team to define all of the stakeholders within a project.
                  If the project team fails to identify a key stakeholder, trouble and risk can ensue. Recall

                         that stakeholders can also be classified as positive, neutral, or negative, depending on
                         their position on the project's purpose and the desired project deliverable.
                             The organizational structure can help the project team identify the stakeholders,
                         and the organizational structure also identifies the project manager's authority. This
                         authority ranks from low to high in the following order of organizational structures:
                         functional, weak matrix, balanced matrix, strong matrix, projectized.
                             Project management offices support the project manager by providing software,
                         templates, training, and often administrative staffing.
                             For your exam, pay special attention to the attributes of a project life cycle and its
                         phases. You'll also want to zoom in on the organizational structures and their charac-
                         teristics. You'll likely encounter questions in which you, as the project manager, will
                         need to respond to a scenario. The response will be determined by the organizational
                         structure within which the project manager is operating.

                         Key Terms
                         Adaptive life cycle This is a project life cycle that anticipates many changes to the
                         project scope and demands highly involved project stakeholders. Because change hap-
                         pens often, change control is managed tightly by the project manager. This approach is
                         also known as the agile project management methodology.
                         Balanced matrix structure An organization where organizational resources are
                         pooled into one project team, but the functional managers and the project managers
                         share the project power.
                         Composite structure An organization that creates a blend of the functional, matrix,
                         and projectized structures.
                         Customer/user       The person(s) who will pay for and use the project's deliverables.
                         Deliverable A verifiable, measurable product or service created by a phase and/or a
                         project.
                         Functional structure An organization that is divided into functions, and each em-
                         ployee has one clear functional manager. Each department acts independently of the
                         other departments. A project manager in this structure has little to no power and may
                         be called a project coordinator.
                         Influencers Persons who can positively or negatively influence a project's ongoing
                         activities and/or the project's likelihood of success.
                         Kill point The review of a phase to determine if it accomplished its requirements. A
                         kill point signals an opportunity to kill the project if it should not continue.
                         Negative stakeholder A stakeholder who does not want a project to succeed. He or
                         she may try to negatively influence the project and help it fail.
                         Performing organization The organization whose employees or members are most
                         directly involved in the project work.

                  Phase The logical division of a project based on the work or deliverable completed
                  within that phase. Common examples include the phases within construction, software

                  development, or manufacturing.
                  Phase exit The review of a phase to determine if it accomplished its requirements. It
                  signals the exiting of one phase and the entering of another.
                  Phase gate The review of a phase to determine if it accomplished its requirements.
                  Like a phase exit, a phase gate shows the qualifications to move from one phase to
                  another.
                  Phase-end review The review of a phase to determine if it accomplished its require-
                  ments. A phase-end review is also called a phase exit, a phase gate, and a kill point.
                  Positive stakeholder A stakeholder who wants a project to exist and succeed. He or
                  she may try to positively influence the project and help it succeed.
                  Predictive life cycle A predictive life cycle, also called a plan-driven approach, is a life
                  cycle that "predicts" the work that will happen in each phase of the project. The project
                  plan, time, cost, and scope are defined early in the project and predict what is to hap-
                  pen in the project.
                  Product life cycle The life cycle of the product a project creates. For example, a project
                  can create a piece of software; the software then has its own life cycle until it becomes
                  defunct.
                  Project life cycle The collection of phases from the start of a project to its completion.

                  and procedures of all projects within the organization. The PMO supports the project
                  manager through software, templates, and administrative support. A PMO can exist
                  in any organizational structure, but it is most common in matrix and projectized
                  structures.

                         Case Study
                         Managing Projects from Start to Completion
                         This case study examines the project process and the phases a project moves through to
                         reach its conclusion. The Riverside Community Park Project was an endeavor to create
                         a 140-acre community recreation park alongside the White River. The project, led by
                         Thomas Stanford and assisted by Jan Steinberg, included many deliverables for the
                         community, including:

                              * A walkway along the river, connecting restaurants and neighborhoods
                              * Hiking trails
                              * Baseball and soccer fields
                              * Water access points
                              * Picnic areas
                              * Children's playgrounds
                              * An indoor swimming facility
                              * Parking areas


                         Examining the Project Deliverables
                         The first phase the project moved through was in-depth planning and development.
                         The project scope was broken down into four major categories:

                              * River-related deliverables, such as docks and fishing areas
                              * Structural-related deliverables, such as the indoor swimming facility
                              * Environment-related deliverables, such as the hiking trails
                              * Common areas, such as the picnic and parking areas

                             Each of these deliverables was broken down into components that could, in turn,
                         be broken down into exact deliverables for the project. For example, the indoor swim-
                         ming facility included the excavation of the grounds for the building, the construction
                         of the building, and the construction of the indoor swimming pool.
                             Each deliverable was broken down to ensure that all of the required components
                         were included in the project plan. Each category of deliverables went through a similar
                         process to ensure that all of the deliverables were accounted for and that the project
                         plans were complete. Stanford and Steinberg worked with a large project team that
                         specialized in different disciplines within the project work.
                             For example, Holly Johnson of EQHN Engineering served as team lead for the river-
                         related deliverables. Johnson has years of experience in construction projects dealing

                                                                                                                                 59
                  with lakes, rivers, and manufactured waterways. Her expert judgment contributed to the
                  development of the plan and the breaking down of the work.




                                                                                                                                             PART I
                       Don Streeping of RHD Architecture and Construction helped Stanford develop the
                  requirements, features, and components of the indoor swimming facility. RHD archi-
                  tects designed the building and swimming facilities for the project and helped map out
                  the timeline for a feasible completion and successful opening day.
                       Grey Jansen with the Department of Natural Resources and Marci Koening with the
                  Department of Urban Planning worked with Stanford to create several different hiking
                  trails and a pedway along the riverfront. The elaborate trail system offers trails ranging
                  from challenging hikes to pleasant strolls. In addition, the pedway allows visitors to
                  walk through more than 50 acres along the river and to visit restaurants, shopping cen-
                  ters, and other commercial ventures within the park. Without Jansen's and Koening's
                  expertise, the project would not have been a success.
                       Finally, John Anderson led the team responsible for the common areas. The chil-
                  dren's playgrounds are topnotch, and there is ample parking and access to the park.
                  In addition, Anderson's team created soccer fields and two Little League baseball
                  diamonds.

                  Examining the Project Phases
                  When the project was launched, the 140-acre tract was a marshy, brush-filled plot of
                  land that was mostly inaccessible to the general public. For this undertaking to be suc-
                  cessful, the project had to move through several phases. Many of the deliverables, such
                  as the parking areas and maintenance roads, had to be created first in order to allow the
                  equipment and workers to access the sites throughout the park.

                  Phase One
                  The first phase of the project was in-depth planning. Stanford and Steinberg worked
                  with each of the team leaders and other experts to coordinate the activities to create the
                  deliverables in a timely fashion. To maximize the return on investment, the project's
                  plan called for immediate deliverables for the public.
                      The planning phase of the project resulted in:

                       * The project plan and subsidiary plans, such as cost, risk, and scope
                         management plans
                       * Design specifications for each of the major deliverables
                       * A schedule that allowed for the deliverables to work in tandem and for them
                         to support one another throughout the project plan
                       * The creation of a work authorization system
                       * Continued community buy-in for the project

                         Phase Two
                         Once the project's plan and coordination between teams was realized, John Anderson's
                         crew went to work on Phase Two of the project: creating accessibility. This phase of the
                         project became known as the "Rough-In" phase because roads, parking, and prepara-
                         tion of the park were needed immediately. This phase resulted in:

                              * Access roads throughout the park
                              * Entry roads to the park at several points throughout the city
                              * Junction roads that allowed easy access for construction equipment to be
                                stored on-site for the project's duration

                         Phase Three
                         Phase Three of the project allowed each team to begin its work independently, with an
                         eye toward common delivery dates. For example, Johnson and Jansen had expertise in
                         separate deliverables: the water access points and the trails throughout the park. The
                         project plan called for trails along the river and through the woods, which would be
                         built by Johnson's crew. In tandem with creating the hiking trails, Johnson's team went
                         to work on the river pedway. At several points along the river pedway, trails from the
                         woods would connect to the paved surface. These two deliverables were timed so that
                         both teams would work together on connecting the nature trails with the river pedway.
                         In addition, caution had to be taken to preserve the environment in the woods and in
                         the water.
                              Streeping's primary responsibility was the creation of the indoor swimming facility.
                         This deliverable required excavation, the digging and creation of the indoor swimming
                         pool, and the construction of the facility to house the indoor swimming pool. Streep-
                         ing had to coordinate the construction with Anderson, as the swimming pool needed
                         the largest parking area in the compound. Stanford and Steinberg worked with each
                         team leader to facilitate a common schedule for each of the deliverables.
                              This phase saw its first completed deliverable for the project: A children's play-
                         ground was opened near the park entrance that the public could begin using immedi-
                         ately. The playground can easily host up to 75 children at once and has parking for up
                         to 50 cars. In addition, a picnic shelter was opened adjacent to the playground. Because
                         of the proximity of the park and playground to nearby shops and restaurants, this de-
                         liverable was well-received by the community, and the public began enjoying the fa-
                         cilities immediately.
                              Other deliverables in the phase included:

                              * Restroom facilities installed at several points throughout the park
                              * Excavation of several water access points
                              * Excavation for the swimming facility
                              * Clearing and leveling for the soccer and baseball fields

                                                                                                                                61
                  Phase Four




                                                                                                                                            PART I
                  Phase Four of the project focused on creating more usable deliverables for the general
                  public. The focus was on the hiking trails throughout the park and on partial comple-
                  tion of the river pedway. The hiking trails required brush to be removed, some trees to
                  be removed, and the land to be graded for passable hiking. The pedway was initially
                  formed as a concrete path that would be blacktopped once it was connected through-
                  out the park. Like the hiking trails, the pedway required the removal of brush and trees
                  while considering the environmental preservation of the river.
                      Jansen's and Anderson's teams worked together to clear the pedway, remove the
                  brush along the riverbank, and preserve the older trees to create a stunning walk along
                  the river. To create maximum deliverables, the pedway was implemented at opposite
                  ends of the 50-acre trail, with plans to be connected at acre 25. This allowed the public
                  to enjoy the deliverables in increments from either end of the park.
                      This phase created these deliverables:

                       * Seven of the ten hiking trails in the system were cleared and opened for public
                         usage.
                       * A total of 30 acres of the river pedway were completed (15 acres on both ends
                         of the pedway).
                       * The swimming pool was excavated and the concrete body of the pool was
                         installed.

                  Phase Five
                  Phase Five of the project was perhaps the most exciting, as it completed several de-
                  liverables:

                       * The remaining three of the hiking trails were completed. These trails included
                         bridges over small creeks that feed into the White River.
                       * The remaining 20 acres of the river pedway were excavated and completed
                         with the concrete pour. People can now walk or ride their bikes the entire 50-
                         acre length alongside the river.
                       * The soccer and baseball facilities were installed, which included restrooms,
                         concession stands, bleachers, fences, and dugouts. The fields were also seeded
                         and fertilized, and will be officially open for public use next spring when the
                         grass is healthy.

                  Phase Six
                  Phase Six of the project was the longest, but most satisfying. This phase focused on the
                  completion of the indoor swimming facility. The structure includes two Olympic-size
                  swimming pools, diving boards, locker rooms, sauna and steam facilities, and a restau-
                  rant. The building is situated on a hill that overlooks the river pedway--it is the crown
                  jewel of the park. The facility was completed as planned and was opened to the public.

                             This phase also included:

                              * The closing and sodding of the temporary construction equipment corral
                              * Installing the remaining playgrounds and picnic areas throughout the park
                              * Opening the water access points, including a commercial dock for fishers and
                                boaters
                              * The official opening of the soccer and baseball fields


                         Controlling Project Changes
                         Throughout the project, the public had many requests for changes to the project scope.
                         The project scope was quite large, and the project budget had limited room for addi-
                         tional changes without requesting additional funds.
                             When changes were proposed, such as the addition of tennis courts to the common
                         areas, they were considered for validity, cost, risk, and the impact on the project scope.
                         A change control board, which Stanford initiated, considered the proposed changes
                         and then approved or declined the changes based on predetermined metrics such as
                         time, cost, and overall change to the original project scope.
                             When the project was initiated, a public meeting was held to gather input from the
                         community on the deliverables they would most like to see in the park. At this point of
                         the project, the stakeholders--the community at large--had a great opportunity to
                         voice their opinions on what the park should and should not include. Once a consen-
                         sus was created for the park deliverables and a scope was created, it became challenging
                         for anyone to add to it.
                             Some changes, however, proved valuable and were added to project deliverables.
                         For example, the commercial fishing and boating dock within the park was a viable op-
                         portunity for a local businessperson to provide a service for boaters and the commu-
                         nity at no cost to the project. Koening and Johnson worked with the business to ensure
                         that it met the city codes, safety regulations, and fit within the scheme and overall effect
                         of the project.
                             Other changes, such as the tennis courts, were declined. While there very well may
                         be many tennis players in the community, this request was denied for several reasons:

                              * The city already supports many tennis courts in the community.
                              * A private tennis club is in the vicinity of the park, and they protested the
                                addition of the tennis courts, as this would be an economic blow to their
                                business.
                              * No tennis players had requested the courts at any of the public meetings
                                discussing the creation of the park.

                  Questions
                       1. There is a difference between the project, the project life cycle, the project
                          schedule, and the overall project objective. At the core of these terms is the
                          project life cycle. The project life cycle comprises which of the following?
                          A. Phases

                       3. You are the project manager of the GHY Project for your organization. You
                          have been tasked with creating new software for your web site which must
                          also be available to users on mobile devices. There are several deliverables
                          that must be documented for this project. Which of the following best
                          describes a project deliverable?
                          A. The resources used by the project to complete the necessary work
                          B. The resources exported from the project as a result of the project work

                                 closure. It's important to understand the fluctuation of costs, schedules,
                                 resources, and risks within the logical progression of the project life cycle.
                                 Which of the following describes the early stages of a project?
                                  A. High costs and high demands for resources
                                  B. A high demand for change
                                  C. A high demand for project team time

                              6. Management has asked you to help them identify the points of the project
                                 where the risk of failure is highest and lowest. As a general rule, at which
                                 point is the risk of failure the lowest, but the consequence of failure the
                                 highest?
                                  A. During the early stages.
                                  B. During the middle stages.
                                  C. During the final stages.
                                  D. The risk of failure is even across all project phases.
                              7. Project team members are most likely to work full-time on a project in which
                                 of the following organizational structures?
                                  A. Functional

                              8. Marcy is the project manager of the GQD Project for her organization. She is
                                 working with Stan, the project sponsor, and they are identifying the most
                                 likely phases for this type of project work. Why would an organization divide
                                 a project into phases?
                                  A. To provide better management and control of the project
                                  B. To identify the work that will likely happen within a phase of the project
                                  C. To identify the resources necessary to complete a phase of the project
                                  D. To define the cash-flow requirements within each phase of the project
                              9. You are the project manager for your organization. Gary, a new project team
                                 member, approaches you because he's confused about the concept of the
                                 project life cycle. If you were explaining the project life cycle to Gary, you
                                 could say that all of the following are true statements about the project life
                                 cycle except for which one?
                                  A. The project life cycle defines the work to be done in each phase of the
                                     project.

                      project. And based on your influence, stakeholders' attitudes toward the
                      project can change. You want to work with the project team to ensure that
                      all of the project stakeholders have been identified as part of the project
                      initiation. None of the following are key project stakeholders except for

                                 that the organization has decided to kill a project. When is this decision most
                                 likely made?
                                  A. At the end of a phase
                                  B. At the start of a phase
                                  C. When the project is not meeting its financial requirements
                                  D. When technology has superseded some of the technology used within the
                                     project
                             17. Nancy is a project manager for the NHG Corporation. She has identified
                                 several positive stakeholders for her construction project and a few negative
                                 stakeholders. Nancy and the project team have been meeting regularly with
                                 the positive stakeholders but have not met with the negative stakeholders.
                                 What can happen if Nancy ignores negative stakeholders?
                                  A. Her project will likely succeed without any objections.
                                  B. Her project may suffer poor political capital from the negative
                                     stakeholders.
                                  C. Her project will risk failure to bring the project to a successful end.
                                  D. The negative stakeholders will not have an opportunity to communicate
                                     with the project manager.
                             18. Don is the project manager for his organization. In this project, his team will
                                 be comprised of local workers and workers from Scotland, India, and
                                 Belgium. Don knows that he needs to consider the working hours, culture,

                    19. You are a new project manager for your organization. Management has asked
                        you to begin creating a project management plan with your project team
                        based on a recently initiated project. The project management plan defines
                        which one of the following?
                        A. Who the project manager will be
                        B. How the project manager will use the project management system
                        C. When the project team will be assembled and released
                        D. How the deliverable will be shipped to the customer
                    20. You are the project manager in your organization. Unlike your last job, which
                        used a functional structure, this organization is utilizing a weak matrix. Who
                        has full authority over project funding in a weak matrix?
                        A. The project manager
                        B. The functional manager
                        C. The PMO

                  Questions and Answers
                     1. There is a difference between the project, the project life cycle, the project
                        schedule, and the overall project objective. At the core of these terms is the
                        project life cycle. The project life cycle comprises which of the following?
                        A. Phases
                        B. Milestones
                        C. Estimates
                        D. Activities
                        A. The project life cycle is comprised of phases. B is incorrect because milestones
                        may exist within the project plan but they do not constitute the project life cycle.
                        C is wrong because estimates are not directly related to the project life cycle. D is
                        incorrect because activities are performed within the phases of the project life
                        cycle, but not the project life cycle itself.

                              2. Marci Koening, the project manager for the ERP Project, is about to complete
                                 the project phase review. The completion of a project phase is also known as
                                 which of the following?
                                  A. Lessons learned
                                  B. The kill point
                                  C. Earned value management
                                  D. Conditional advancement
                                 B. The completion of a project phase may also be known as a kill point.
                                 Lessons learned is a collection of information and knowledge gained through
                                 an experience, typically a phase, within the project, so A is wrong. Earned
                                 value management can happen at different times throughout the project, not
                                 just at the end of a project phase; therefore, C is wrong. D, conditional
                                 advancement, is a term that describes the conditions that must be present for
                                 the work to continue on a project. Conditional advancement, however, does
                                 not have to happen only at the end of a project phase.
                              3. You are the project manager of the GHY Project for your organization. You
                                 have been tasked with creating a new software for your website which must
                                 also be available to mobile users. There are several deliverables that must be
                                 documented for this project. Which of the following best describes a project
                                 deliverable?
                                  A. The resources used by the project to complete the necessary work
                                  B. The resources exported from the project as a result of the project work
                                  C. The end result of a project planning session
                                  D. A verifiable, measurable work product
                                 D. A deliverable is something that can be verified and measured. A defines
                                 the resources in order to create the deliverable. B is an inaccurate statement.
                                 C defines how the work and resources will be utilized to create the project
                                 deliverable, not the deliverable itself.
                              4. As the project manager, you must work with your project team to identify the
                                 project and the project phases within the project schedule. This identification
                                 helps to communicate expectations and outcomes of the project work. The
                                 compilation of all the phases within a project equates to the
                                 ____________________.
                                  A. Project life cycle
                                  B. Product life cycle
                                  C. Project completion
                                  D. Project processes
                                 A. The project life cycle comprises all of the project phases within a project. B
                                 is incorrect because the product life cycle describes how long a product will be

                    in use after it is created. C and D are incorrect because they do not accurately
                    describe the project life cycle.




                                                                                                                                       PART I
                  5. Projects move through a logical progression from the initiation to the project
                     closure. It's important to understand the fluctuation of costs, schedules,
                     resources, and risks within the logical progression of the project life cycle.
                     Which of the following describes the early stages of a project?
                     A. High costs and high demands for resources
                     B. A high demand for change
                     C. A high demand for project team time
                    D. Low costs and low demands for resources
                    D. Projects typically have low costs and low demands for resources early in
                    their life cycle. A, B, and C are incorrect statements in regard to projects.
                  6. Management has asked you to help them identify the points of the project
                     where the risk of failure is highest and lowest. As a general rule, at which
                     point is the risk of failure the lowest, but the consequence of failure the
                     highest?
                     A. During the early stages.
                     B. During the middle stages.
                     C. During the final stages.
                    D. The risk of failure is even across all project phases.
                    C. As the project moves closer to completion, the likelihood of risk
                    diminishes, but should the project fail, its consequence is the highest because
                    of the time, monies, and effort invested in the project. A, B, and D are
                    incorrect in regard to risk assessment in a project.
                  7. Project team members are most likely to work full-time on a project in which
                     of the following organizational structures?
                     A. Functional
                     B. Weak matrix
                     C. Strong matrix
                    D. Projectized
                    D. Projectized structures often have project team members assigned to the
                    project on a full-time basis. A, B, and C are incorrect because these structures
                    have part-time project teams.
                  8. Marcy is the project manager of the GQD Project for her organization. She is
                     working with Stan, the project sponsor, and they are identifying the most
                     likely phases for this type of project work. Why would an organization divide
                     a project into phases?
                     A. To provide better management and control of the project




02-ch02.indd 69                                                                                                           7/12/2013 3:55:19 AM

                                  B. To identify the work that will likely happen within a phase of the project
                                  C. To identify the resources necessary to complete a phase of the project
                                  D. To define the cash-flow requirements within each phase of the project
                                 A. Organizations often divide projects into phases to make the management
                                 and control of the project easier and more productive. B and C are incorrect
                                 because these statements identify an attribute of a phase, not the reason to
                                 create all phases. D is incorrect because this statement is not true for all
                                 projects. In addition, cash-flow forecasting is part of planning and is not
                                 universal to all project phases.
                              9. You are the project manager for your organization. Gary, a new project team
                                 member, approaches you because he's confused about the concept of the
                                 project life cycle. If you were explaining the project life cycle to Gary, you
                                 could say that all of the following are true statements about the project life
                                 cycle except for which one?
                                  A. The project life cycle defines the work to be done in each phase of the
                                     project.
                                  B. The project life cycle defines the deliverables that each phase will create.
                                  C. The project life cycle defines who is involved in each phase.
                                  D. The project life cycle defines how much each phase will cost.
                                 D. The project life cycle does not define how much each phase of the project
                                 will cost. The project life cycle does define the work to be done in each phase,
                                 the deliverables each phase will create, and the resources needed in each
                                 phase, so choices A, B, and C are incorrect.
                             10. You are the project manager of a new project. When is the likelihood of
                                 failing to achieve the objectives the highest within your project?
                                  A. There is not enough information provided to know for certain.
                                  B. At the start of the project.
                                  C. At the end of the project.
                                  D. During the intermediate phases of the project.
                                 B. Projects are most likely to fail at the start of the project. As the project
                                 moves closer to the project completion, its odds of finishing successfully
                                 increase. A is not an accurate statement. C is incorrect because the project is
                                 more likely to finish successfully at the end of the project. D is also incorrect
                                 because the intermediate phases show progress toward project completion.
                                 The closer the project moves away from its start and toward completion, the
                                 higher the odds of success are.
                             11. You are the project manager for your organization and a new project has just
                                 been initiated. You know it is important to identify stakeholders and their

                                                                                                Chapter 2: Managing a Project

                                                                                                                             71
                      attitudes toward the project as early as possible in the project life cycle. Which
                      one of the following is an example of a positive stakeholder?




                                                                                                                                         PART I
                      A. The comptroller within your organization
                      B. A customer who is eager for your project's deliverable
                      C. An environmental group that has claims against your project
                      D. A union
                      B. The eager customer is an example of a positive stakeholder. A, the
                      comptroller, is usually an influencer and not a positive or negative
                      stakeholder for most projects. C, the environmental group that has claims
                      against your project, is an example of a negative stakeholder. D, the union, is
                      another example of a project influencer. In this example, the union is neutral,
                      but there are instances when a union could become either a positive or
                      negative stakeholder.
                  12. You know that there are positive, negative, and neutral stakeholders in your
                      project. And based on your influence, stakeholders' attitudes toward the
                      project can change. You want to work with the project team to ensure that
                      all of the project stakeholders have been identified as part of the project
                      initiation. None of the following are key project stakeholders except for
                      which one?
                      A. Union
                      B. Sellers
                      C. Technical interface
                      D. Inspector
                      B. The seller is the only key stakeholder the PMBOK specifically addresses out
                      of those listed in this question. A, the union, and C, the technical interface,
                      could be examples of influencers, but not in every project. D, an inspector, is
                      not a key stakeholder in every project, although an inspector could be
                      considered an influencer if one were involved with your project.
                  13. You are a project manager acting in a functional organization. The functional
                      manager and you disagree about several deliverables the project will be
                      creating. The functional manager insists that you begin the project work now.
                      What must you do?
                      A. Begin work.
                      B. Resolve all of the issues with the functional manager before you begin
                         working.
                      C. Continue planning because you are the project manager.
                      D. Begin work as long as the issues don't affect the project deliverables.

                                 A. Because you are working within a functional organization, you have little
                                 to no power, and the functional manager has all of the power. You must obey
                                 the functional manager and get to work. B, C, and D are all incorrect choices
                                 for the project manager in a functional structure.
                             14. You are a project manager working under a PMO. Your project resources are
                                 shared among several projects. To whom will the project team members
                                 report?
                                  A. The project manager of each project
                                  B. The functional managers
                                  C. The PMO
                                  D. The project manager of their primary project
                                 A. When resources are shared and a PMO exists, the project resources report
                                 to the PMO for staff assignments, but they'll report to the project manager of
                                 each project they're assigned to. B is correct in a functional structure. C is
                                 incorrect because the PMO may be responsible for staff alignment and
                                 assignment, but the project team does not report to the PMI. D is not valid.
                             15. You are the project manager for your organization and you're working with
                                 the project team to explain the approach of the project life cycle and how
                                 you'll be managing proposed changes to the project scope. As a general rule,
                                 at what point in the project may stakeholders most cost-effectively
                                 recommend changes to the project deliverable?
                                  A. Before the project charter is created
                                  B. At the start of the project
                                  C. During the intermediate phases
                                  D. During the final phase of the project
                                 B. It's easiest and least costly for stakeholders to ask for changes at the start of
                                 the project. A is incorrect because changes can easily be requested after the
                                 charter is created but before the project work begins. C is not true because
                                 changes may affect work that has already been completed. D is absolutely
                                 false because these changes may have the highest cost on the project.
                             16. Beth is the project manager for her organization and she's just received word
                                 that the organization has decided to kill a project. When is this decision most
                                 likely made?
                                  A. At the end of a phase
                                  B. At the start of a phase
                                  C. When the project is not meeting its financial requirements
                                  D. When technology has superseded some of the technology used within the
                                     project

                      A. The end of a phase is also known as a kill point. B is inaccurate because
                      projects are most likely killed at the end of a project phase, not at its start. C




                                                                                                                                         PART I
                      is incorrect because the most likely answer is A. D is also incorrect because
                      technology may change, but the demand for the project deliverable may not.
                      If technology has changed, the project may elect to upgrade the technology
                      being used to the newer available technology.
                  17. Nancy is a project manager for the NHG Corporation. She has identified
                      several positive stakeholders for her construction project and a few negative
                      stakeholders. Nancy and the project team have been meeting regularly with
                      the positive stakeholders but have not met with the negative stakeholders.
                      What can happen if Nancy ignores negative stakeholders?
                      A. Her project will likely succeed without any objections.
                      B. Her project may suffer poor political capital from the negative
                         stakeholders.
                      C. Her project will risk failure to bring the project to a successful end.
                      D. The negative stakeholders will not have an opportunity to communicate
                         with the project manager.
                      C. Nancy cannot simply ignore the negative stakeholders. Their influence on
                      the project may cause the project to fail. Nancy must work with the negative
                      stakeholders to squelch their protests, or consider their demands to ensure
                      compliance or agreement with their issues. A, B, and D are all inaccurate
                      outcomes of ignoring the stakeholders.
                  18. Don is the project manager for his organization. In this project, his team will
                      be composed of local workers and workers from Scotland, India, and
                      Belgium. Don knows that he needs to consider the working hours, culture,
                      and expectations of this virtual team in order to manage it successfully. All of
                      the following are cultural attributes of an organization except for which one?
                      A. Policies and procedures
                      B. Work ethics
                      C. View of authority relationships
                      D. Experience of the project management team
                      D. The experience of the project management team is not a cultural attribute
                      of an organization. A, B, and C--the policies and procedures, the work ethics,
                      and the view of authority relationships--are all classic examples of an
                      organization's culture.
                  19. You are a new project manager for your organization. Management has asked
                      you to begin creating a project management plan with your project team
                      based on a recently initiated project. The project management plan defines
                      which one of the following?




02-ch02.indd 73                                                                                                             7/12/2013 3:55:19 AM

              74
                                  A. Who the project manager will be
                                  B. How the project manager will use the project management system
                                  C. When the project team will be assembled and released
                                  D. How the deliverable will be shipped to the customer
                                 B. The project plan defines how the project management system will be used.
                                 A is incorrect. The project charter defines the project manager. C is incorrect
                                 because the staffing management plan (see Chapter 9) defines how the
                                 project team will be assembled and managed. Technically, the staffing
                                 management plan is part of the overall project management plan, but B is the
                                 most correct answer presented. D is incorrect because not every project will
                                 need to ship a deliverable to a customer.
                             20. You are the project manager in your organization. Unlike your last job, which
                                 used a functional structure, this organization is utilizing a weak matrix. Who
                                 has full authority over project funding in a weak matrix?
                                  A. The project manager
                                  B. The functional manager
                                  C. The PMO
                                  D. The project sponsor
                                 B. The functional manager has the power over the project funding, not the
                                 project manager. In a weak matrix, the functional manager is likely to be
                                 the project sponsor. A, C, and D are all incorrect statements because these do
                                 not define the authority of the project manager in a weak matrix structure.

                  Projects are chockablock with processes. A process is a set of actions and activities to
                  achieve a product, result, or service. It's the work of project management to move the
                  work of the project toward the deliverable the project aims to create. As you'll discover
                  in this chapter, there are 47 project management processes that a project manager and
                  the project team use to move a project along. The goal of these processes is to have a
                  successful project, but a project's success is based on more than just leveraging these
                  processes. A successful project depends on four things:

                       * Using the appropriate processes at the appropriate times. A project manager must
                         recognize situations within the project that call for different processes and
                         then determine which process or combination of processes is most needed to
                         meet the project objectives.
                       * Following a defined project management approach for execution and project
                         control.
                       * Developing and implementing a solid project management plan that addresses
                         all areas of the project.
                       * Conforming the project and the project management approach to the customer
                         requirements and expectations.
                       * Balancing the project time, cost, scope, quality, resources, and risks while
                         meeting the project objectives.

                             Sure, all of this sounds so easy on paper, doesn't it? But project management is not
                         an easy task, and the goal of a certified project manager is to recognize the situations,
                         react to the problems or opportunities, and move the project work toward achieving the
                         customer's requirements. The 47 project management processes are the actions that
                         help any project manager do just that.
                             This chapter covers the entire project management life cycle. We'll follow the activi-
                         ties that happen in each of the project management process groups, and see what the
                         results of those actions are.

                         Exploring the Project Management Processes
                         Before we get too deep into this chapter, learn this: You do not have to do every single project
                         management process on every single project. The project manager and the project team must
                         determine which project management processes are most appropriate for each project.
                         Once the necessary processes have been identified, the project manager and project team
                         must also determine to what extent the processes are needed. The processes are tailored
                         to their project. Larger projects require more detail than smaller ones.
                             The 47 project management processes have been recognized as good practices
                         for most projects, but they are not a mandate for good practices on all projects. For your
                         Project Management Institute (PMI) examination, however, you'll be tested on all
                         of the project management processes in detail. Yep. Although you may not use all of
                         the project management processes in the real world, the exam will test you on all
                         of the processes as if you do. Why? Because there is, no doubt, more than one way to
                         manage a project. The PMI isn't stubborn enough to say it's our way or no way--that'd
                         be unreasonable.
                             The approach that the PMI does take, however, is based somewhat on W. Edwards
                         Deming's plan-do-check-act cycle, as Figure 3-1 demonstrates. In Deming's model,
                         adapted by the American Society for Quality (ASQ), the end of one process launches
                         the start of another. For example, the end of the planning process allows the launch of

                         check-act cycle.

                                                                                                                                 77
                  the doing process. Once the work has been completed, you check it. This approach is
                  called the Deming PDCA cycle. If the work checks out, you move right into the acting




                                                                                                                                             PART I
                  process.
                      The project management model, which we'll see throughout this chapter, is a bit
                  more involved than the plan-do-check-act approach. Figure 3-2 demonstrates the big
                  picture of project management:

                       1. The project starts with initiating, where the project manager is assigned.
                       2. The project moves into planning the project work.
                       3. The results of planning allow the plans to be executed.
                       4. Monitoring and controlling processes oversee and overlap the other process
                          groups, and can shift the project back into execution or back to planning.
                       5. The project moves into closing the project or phase.

                      The components of the model are called the process groups. Process groups are col-
                  lections of the processes you'll be performing in different situations within your proj-
                  ect. You've experienced, I'm sure, that projects are initiated, planned, executed,
                  monitored and controlled, and then closed. Distinct actions fit nicely within each one
                  of the process groups--that's the gist of this chapter.

                  Examining the Process Group Interactions
                  At first glance, the project management model seems simple. With more study, however,
                  you'll see how complex the interactions between the groups can be. First, project manag-
                  ers realize that there is more than one way to manage a project. Second, these processes
                  and their interactions are the generally accepted best approach to project management.
                  Having said that, there is no hard-and-fast rule as to the order in which processes should
                  occur once the project is in motion. The nature of the project, the scenario, and the ex-
                  perienced conditions, along with the culture and maturity of the organization, will dic-
                  tate which process is the best process at any given project moment.

                  All projects move
                  through five process
                  groups to reach their
                  completion.

                             The general consensus, not necessarily the order, of the process groups is as follows:

                              1. Initiating
                              2. Planning
                              3. Executing
                              4. Monitoring and controlling
                              5. Closing

                             The caveat is that a project manager can move between the planning, executing, and
                         monitoring and controlling process groups on an as-needed basis. For example, during
                         project execution, a new risk could be identified. The project manager and project team
                         would then move back into the planning phase to determine how to respond to the new
                         risk, and then they'd continue to monitor and control the project for additional risks.

                                       EXAM TIP The generally accepted flow of the process groups can also apply
                                       to more than just projects. A project manager can use the processes within
                                       these groups for each phase of a project.

                         Choosing the Appropriate Processes
                         A moment of clarity: There's a bunch of processes in project management. Sure, we've
                         already established that you won't need all these processes for every project you man-
                         age, but you can be darned certain you'll need all of the processes to pass your Certified
                         Associate in Project Management (CAPM) or Project Management Professional (PMP)
                         exam. Let's dive in and check out these process groups and all their kids--the 47 project
                         management processes.
                              You've already learned the five process groups: initiating, planning, executing, mon-
                         itoring and controlling, and closing. These groups are universal to all projects, from
                         building the pyramids to rolling out the latest, greatest whiz-bang software over your IT
                         network. It doesn't matter; project management is project management. Figure 3-3 cap-
                         tures all of the processes in the most likely order in which they should happen--if
                         they're going to happen (remember, you don't need all of the processes on every proj-
                         ect, every single time).
                              In addition to project management processes, there are also product-oriented pro-
                         cesses. These processes are unique to the organization that is creating the product of the
                         project. Product processes are also unique to the type of work required to create the prod-
                         uct. Let's put this in the real world. If you're creating a new software application, or build-
                         ing a house, or designing a brochure, there are some processes that are unique to that type
                         of work. In addition, imagine all the different home construction companies in the world.
                         Each company could have similar projects, but their internal product processes and ter-
                         minology could be unique to each company. The good news is that you won't have to
                         know much about product processes for your CAPM or the PMP exam.

                  Working with Process Groups
                  Project management is more than just getting the project work done. It's the manage-
                  ment, leadership, and execution of the work performed by the project team. (And by
                  execution, I mean the project team executing the project plan, not you executing the
                  team--although that can be tempting at times.) You'll move through some logical ac-
                  tivities to get your project moving along. These are the process groups that are universal
                  to project management. Let's take a more detailed look at these process groups and the
                  type of work that will be happening in each:

                       * Initiating Management and/or your customer is authorizing the project or a
                         project phase to begin.
                       * Planning You and the key stakeholders are defining and refining the project
                         goals and objectives. Once the project objectives have been defined, you and
                         the key stakeholders will plan on how to reach those objectives.
                       * Executing Now that you have a project plan, it's time to put the plan into
                         action. You've heard the saying, "Plan your work and now work your plan"?
                         This is the "working your plan" part.

                                to you to measure and monitor things to ensure that the project team is doing

                                cost, time, scope, and quality--will show discrepancies between what was
                                planned and what was experienced. These discrepancies are your project
                                variances.
                              * Closing Boy, howdy! There's nothing more fun, usually, than closing a
                                project. This process group focuses on formal acceptance of the project's final
                                deliverable. Note that technically the approval of the deliverable is the result
                                of the verify scope process, a monitoring and controlling process. The close
                                project process makes that acceptance formal with a project sign-off. The
                                closing process group also focuses on bringing the project or project phase to
                                a tidy ending.

                             Now that you've got the big picture on these process groups, let's take that in-depth
                         look at each group and all the business that happens within each one. Each subheading
                         in the five process group sections discussed next covers one of the 47 project manage-
                         ment processes. (Thus, the "Initiating Your Project" process group includes two pro-
                         cesses: "Developing the Project Charter" and "Identifying the Stakeholders.") Hold
                         your excitement!

                         Initiating Your Project
                         The initiating process group starts all the project fun. It contains the formal processes
                         that start a project or a project phase. These initiating processes, which I'll delve into in
                         one moment, are often done outside of the project manager's domain of control. For
                         example, a company's project portfolio management may not include any input from
                         the project managers within their firm. The senior management could choose which
                         projects should be initiated and funded long before the project managers get involved.
                         In other organizations, the project manager may be involved from the project concep-
                         tion all the way through the project closure. As a general rule, the initiation of a project
                         happens, to some extent, without the project manager, but the initiation process group
                         is included as part of the project management life cycle.

                                       EXAM TIP Projects are authorized, not the project manager.You do not have
                                       a project until you have an approved charter.


                             The project manager is assigned during initiation, and the inputs from the original
                         project initiator and/or the project sponsor are considered throughout the initiation
                         processes. One of the first activities of the project is to document the project assump-
                         tions and constraints. Here's the difference between these two:

                              * Assumptions are things believed to be true but not proven to be. For example,
                                construction projects plan to complete their work during the spring and

                                                                                          Chapter 3: Examining the Project Processes

                                                                                                                                    81
                          summer months because of cooperating weather. It's an assumption that the
                          weather will be agreeable for their work during these seasons as opposed to




                                                                                                                                                PART I
                          the winter months, although this isn't always true.
                       * Constraints are anything that restricts a project manager's options. For
                         example, a customer must have the project deliverable by a specific date.
                         Or the project cost must not exceed $2 million. Or the software must be
                         compatible with an Oracle database. Usually, any project requirement
                         preceded by "must" is a good sign of a constraint.

                      Assumptions and constraints are documented in the project charter. The project
                  charter officially authorizes the project and is authorized outside of the project bound-
                  aries. This means that the charter should come from some entity that is above the proj-
                  ect manager and the functional managers involved in the project. Figure 3-4 illustrates
                  this concept. While the project management team may help write the charter, the fund-
                  ing and authorization come from higher up in the organization or from the project
                  customer.
                      At the start of each project phase, especially on larger projects, it's ideal to repeat the
                  initiating processes for the phase you're about to begin. This helps to ensure that
                  the project remains focused on the business needs the project is to solve. This includes
                  confirming the availability of the needed project resources (cash, people, materials,
                  and equipment). Based on this discovery, the project should be allowed to continue on
                  to the next phase, delayed, or (gulp!) canceled. Another benefit of moving through
                  these initiating processes at the start of each phase is that it allows the performing

                         organization to determine if the original business need that the project was created to
                         solve is still valid; if not, the project can be killed. Yes, killed; remember that the end of
                         a phase is called a project kill point.
                             When a project or phase is moving through the initiating process group, the project
                         manager needs to include the key stakeholders in the processes. This is a "PMI-ism,"
                         but it's also some real-world advice: Including the stakeholders during the initiating
                         phase accomplishes several things for the project:

                              * It creates shared ownership of the project.
                              * It ensures deliverable acceptance at project or phase closure.
                              * It improves stakeholder satisfaction.
                              * It facilitates communication between the project manager and the
                                stakeholders.

                         Developing the Project Charter
                         The project charter is created during the initiating process group. Recall that the proj-
                         ect charter authorizes the project or, in a larger project, the charter initiates the project
                         phase. The charter documents the business need, defines the project deliverable, and
                         authorizes the project manager to expend organizational resources. To create the
                         project charter, you'll need the following inputs:

                              * Contract You won't always need a contract, but if an organization performs
                                projects for other organizations, such as a consulting firm, the contract serves
                                as a key input to creating the project charter.
                              * Business case This document defines why the project is worthy of the
                                investment for the deliverables the project will bring. The business case
                                defines the cost-benefit analysis for the organization.
                              * Project statement of work This document defines the product, service, or
                                result that the project will be creating.
                              * Enterprise environmental factors This is a new term that you'll be seeing
                                lots of throughout the remainder of this book. Enterprise environmental
                                factors are any external or internal organizational factors that can affect
                                project success. Enterprise environmental factors include the culture,
                                organizational structure, resources, the commercial databases the project will
                                use, market conditions, and your project management software.
                              * Organizational process assets This is another term that you'll see
                                throughout the PMBOK and during our time together in this book.
                                "Organizational process assets" is a fancy way of describing how a company
                                does business. It includes the processes and procedures unique to an
                                organization, plans, guidelines, and knowledge bases, such as the lessons
                                learned documentation from past projects and any relevant historical
                                information.

                  Identifying Stakeholders




                                                                                                                                             PART I
                  Stakeholders are the people and organizations actively involved in the project and the
                  people and organizations that are affected by the project. The process of identifying
                  the project stakeholders should happen early in the project to prevent rework, chang-
                  ing requirements, and new threats to the project success. Stakeholder identification
                  happens throughout the entire project. You don't want to accidentally overlook stake-
                  holders, so at the onset of each project life cycle phase, you and the project team (and
                  sometimes other stakeholders) should pause and determine if all the correct stake-
                  holders are involved and have been identified. If you forget to include a stakeholder,
                  they might cause your project to be delayed, become adverse to your project, and be
                  upset. Always be on the lookout for project stakeholders. In order to do this project
                  management process, you'll need:

                       1. Project charter
                       2. Procurement documents
                       3. Enterprise environmental factors
                       4. Organizational process assets

                      The only output of stakeholder identification is the stakeholder register. This is the
                  documentation of all the identified stakeholders, their contact information, and proj-
                  ect interests.

                               NOTE Stakeholder management is so important in project management that
                               the PMBOK Guide, 5th edition has allotted a whole chapter to this project
                               management knowledge area. In this book, it's Chapter 13.You have to identify
                               your stakeholders before you can manage them.

                  Planning the Project
                  Projects fail at the beginning and not the end. A project needs effective planning, or it
                  will be doomed. The whole point of the planning process group is to develop the proj-
                  ect management plan. The good news is that the entire project plan doesn't have to
                  happen in one session; in fact, planning is an iterative process, and the project man-
                  ager and the project team return to the planning phase as needed to allow the project
                  to move forward.
                       Ask any project manager if changes ever happen in their projects, and they'll give
                  you a sad yes (unless they lie). Changes, often the nemesis of a project manager, require
                  the project manager and the project team to revisit these planning processes to con-
                  sider the impact of the changes on the entire project. This may include, unfortunately,
                  revisiting the initiating processes and making changes to the project charter, although
                  this is a drastic and infrequent event.
                       One approach to project management that has gained fans in the past few years is
                  rolling wave planning. Rolling wave planning, seen in Figure 3-5, entails iterations of




03-ch03.indd 83                                                                                                                 7/12/2013 3:58:57 AM

                         planning throughout the project life cycle. Changes and conditions within the project
                         require the project manager and the project team to revisit the planning processes and
                         then to move on to the project. Rolling wave planning can also be experienced in larger
                         projects, where a project team plans in detail for the immediate work and leaves the
                         future work less planned. As the project approaches each phase, detailed planning takes
                         place, creating iterations, or waves, of planning.
                             The project manager and the project team should create an environment where
                         stakeholders can participate and contribute to the project planning processes. A project
                         manager wants to use the skills and knowledge of the stakeholders to help define the
                         project scope and the product scope, as well as to ensure that the project work will de-
                         liver upon the stakeholders' expectations.
                             A frequent question from students of my project management classes centers on
                         project management planning. I'm asked, "If planning is so important and iterative,
                         how does a project manager know when the planning process group should end?" Of
                         course, planning cannot, thankfully, continue forever. There must be project boundar-
                         ies and considerations of the enterprise environmental factors that dictate the amount
                         of time a project team invests in the initial planning and the project work. As a project
                         moves into execution and, by default, monitoring and controlling, the project team can
                         revisit the planning processes as needed to allow the project to continue. For example,
                         if new risks are identified within the project, then additional planning is required to
                         evaluate and respond to the risks.

                                       EXAM TIP The planning process group has 24 processes. This section
                                       contains a brief overview of each of these processes and their inputs and
                                       outputs. I recommend that you become familiar with these to the point that
                                       you'd recognize the type of work associated with each process, but don't
                                       invest too much time memorizing the inputs and outputs of each process.

                  Developing the Project Management Plan




                                                                                                                                             PART I
                  The project management plan is not one plan, but a collection of subsidiary plans that
                  dictate how the project will operate within that knowledge area. It also defines how the
                  project will operate within planning, executing, monitoring and controlling, and clos-
                  ing process groups. To create the project management plan, you'll need:

                       * Project charter    You need a charter before you can have a project.
                       * Enterprise environmental factors These are the rules, processes, and
                         procedures the project manager has to abide by.
                       * Organizational process assets These are the templates, guidelines, software,
                         and historical information that can help the project manager manage the
                         project.
                       * Project management processes outputs The outputs of the other processes
                         will contribute to the project management plan.

                  Planning Scope Management
                  The project management process of planning scope management is the actual creation
                  of the project's scope management plan. This plan, a subsidiary plan of the overall
                  project management plan, defines how the project manager and the project team will
                  go about creating the project, controlling the project, and then validating the scope.
                  Most likely, this plan will be a template from organizational process assets that's adapt-
                  ed to the current project, but this doesn't mean the project manager and team can
                  shortcut this process. Each project is different, so there must be adequate time allotted
                  for the project management plan and its creation. You'll need four inputs to do this
                  process:

                       * Project management plan
                       * Project charter
                       * Enterprise environmental factors
                       * Organizational process assets

                      This process creates the scope management plan and the requirement management
                  plan. These two plans work together to direct how the scope is created, controlled and val-
                  idated--and how the requirements of the project are also identified, controlled, and might
                  be allowed to be changed.

                  Collecting Requirements
                  Projects are based on the requirements elicited from the project stakeholders. The proj-
                  ect requirements will serve as an input to the project scope statement. The project scope
                  is the work that must be done in order to create the product, service, or result the proj-
                  ect aims to deliver. The project manager, the project team, and the stakeholders work

                         together to collect the project requirements. To collect the project requirements, you'll
                         need five inputs:

                              * Scope management plan
                              * Requirement management plan
                              * Stakeholder management plan
                              * A project charter
                              * Stakeholder register (a directory of who the stakeholders are, their contact
                                information, and general opinions, concerns, and perceived threats about
                                the project)

                             The stakeholder register is a directory of all the identified stakeholders. The collect
                         requirements process creates the requirements documentation--a direct result of the
                         requirements elicitation that the project manager, the project team, and the business
                         analyst work to create. This process also creates the requirements documentation and
                         the requirements traceability matrix. These two work together to protect the require-
                         ments from change, to ensure that approved changes are reflected throughout the proj-
                         ect artifacts, and to track the requirements from identification to fulfillment during
                         project execution.

                         Defining the Project Scope Statement
                         Now that the project has a project scope management plan, the project manager, proj-
                         ect team, and the key stakeholders can go about defining the actual project scope. The
                         project scope statement serves as a basis for all future project decisions. As part of defin-
                         ing the project scope, these inputs are needed:

                              * Scope management plan
                              * Project charter
                              * Requirements documents
                              * Organizational process assets

                             This process group has just two outputs:

                              * Project scope statement (all the work required to satisfy the project
                                requirements and objectives)
                              * Project documents updates (based on stakeholder elicitation, the business
                                case, and solutions for the identified problem or opportunity that may need
                                to be updated to reflect any refinements)

                               often call this the ITTO of project management. I've included a nifty PDF
                               document called Process ITTO Worksheet. It lists all of the processes by
                               knowledge area and the inputs, tools and techniques, and outputs of each
                               process. Enjoy!

                  Creating the Work Breakdown Structure (WBS)
                  The WBS is created in the planning process group. This process takes the project scope
                  and breaks it down into smaller, more manageable components. In Chapter 5, we'll dis-
                  cuss the WBS, its purpose, and its creation. To create a WBS, you'll need the following:

                       * Scope management plan
                       * Project scope statement
                       * Documented project requirements
                       * Enterprise environmental factors
                       * Organizational process assets

                      As a result of creating the WBS, the project manager will get some extras, wanted
                  or not:

                       * Project document updates
                       * Scope baseline (comprises the scope statement, the WBS, and the WBS
                         dictionary)

                               EXAM TIP The scope baseline is so important for your exam that I'm
                               mentioning it again. The scope baseline comprises the project scope statement,
                               the WBS, and the WBS dictionary. It is a cornerstone to project management.
                               If you're stumped on a question and one of the choices is the scope baseline,
                               go ahead and choose that. It may not always be the best choice, but I'd wager
                               that it predominantly will be.

                  Plan Schedule Management
                  The project management process of plan schedule management is the creation of the
                  schedule management plan. This plan, part of the project management plan, defines
                  how the project's schedule is developed, managed, executed, and controlled. Because
                  stakeholders will be so interested in how long the project will take to complete, it's best
                  to take a forward stance on creating and defining the project's schedule. This plan aims
                  to create and analyze a schedule that's feasible for the project team, vendors, and to set
                  stakeholder expectations. To create the schedule management plan, the only output of
                  this process, you'll need four inputs:

                       * Project management plan
                       * Project charter

                              * Organizational process assets

                         Defining the Project Activities
                         Once the WBS has been created, the project manager and project team can examine the
                         deliverables and then determine the actual work to create the things the WBS promises.
                         This process is activity definition. To complete this process, you'll need:

                              * Schedule management plan
                              * Scope baseline
                              * Organizational process assets
                              * Enterprise environmental factors

                            As a result of defining the project activities, the project team will receive these
                         outputs:

                              * Activity list This lists the activities the project team will need to complete to
                                create the deliverables defined in the WBS.
                              * Activity attributes These describe the nature of the activities, needed human
                                resources, materials, risk, and other conditions that may affect the activities.
                              * Milestone list This shows significant points of progress, and you can only
                                reach milestones by completing the activities in the activity list.

                         Sequencing the Project Activities
                         It's a logical progression from defining the project deliverables and the activities needed
                         to create them to putting those activities in a particular order. To sequence the project
                         activities, the project team will need:

                              * Schedule management plan
                              * Activity attributes
                              * Activity list
                              * Milestone list
                              * Project scope statement
                              * Organizational process assets (If you've done work like this before, you likely
                                won't need to reinvent the activity list and sequencing.)
                              * Enterprise environmental factors

                             As with the majority of the processes in planning, the output of the processes often
                         includes other project elements that may be needed for later purposes in project plan-
                         ning. Activity sequencing is no different; the outputs of this process are

                  Estimating Activity Resources
                  The project manager needs to know what resources will be required for each of the
                  project activities. To complete this process, you'll need the following inputs:

                      * Schedule management plan
                       * Activity attributes
                       * Activity lists
                       * Resource calendars (when resources are available; remember, resources are
                         people but also facilities, equipment, and materials)
                       * Risk register
                       * Activity cost estimates
                       * Enterprise environmental factors

                      Once the project manager has completed estimating the resources, he or she will
                  receive several outputs as a result of this process:

                      * Activity resource requirements
                       * Resource breakdown structure
                       * Project document updates

                  Estimating the Activity Durations
                  Once the project manager knows what activities are required and in what order the
                  activities should happen, it's time to estimate how long each activity will take to com-
                  plete. To create the activity duration estimates, the project manager will need:

                      * Schedule management plan
                       * Activity attributes
                       * Activity list
                       * Activity resource requirements
                       * Resource calendars
                       * Project scope statement
                       * Risk register
                       * Resource breakdown structure
                       * Enterprise environmental factors

                              * Organizational process assets

                             While this process primarily creates the duration of each of the project's activities,
                         the project manager may also have activity attribute updates. Outputs include:

                              * Activity duration estimates
                              * Project document updates

                         Developing the Project Schedule
                         The project schedule is more than just the sum of how long each event will take. The
                         project schedule considers the availability of the project resources, the risks, the attri-
                         butes of the project activities, and more. Chapter 6 will focus on this process, but for
                         now, here are the inputs required to create the project schedule:

                              * Schedule management plan
                              * Activity list
                              * Activity attributes
                              * Project schedule network diagrams
                              * Activity resource requirements
                              * Resource calendars
                              * Activity duration estimates (how long the activities take, so you can schedule
                                the appropriate resources for the duration of the activity)
                              * Project scope statement
                              * Risk register
                              * Project staff assignments
                              * Resource breakdown structure
                              * Enterprise environmental factors
                              * Organizational process assets

                            Based on these inputs to the schedule development, the project team will have six
                         outputs:

                              * Schedule baseline (your anticipated preview of how the project schedule will
                                develop)
                              * Project schedule (the calendar that defines when the project will take place,
                                including the working hours, access to the job site, and any other time
                                constraints put on the project)
                              * Schedule data (includes the milestones, activities, activity attributes,
                                assumptions, and constraints)
                              * Project calendars

                                                                                                                                             PART I
                       * Project document updates

                  Plan Cost Estimating
                  This project management process defines the policies and procedures for the project
                  manager and the project team to plan, manage, execute, and control the project costs
                  within the project. This plan will likely be greatly influenced by existing enterprise en-
                  vironmental factors within the organization. For example, your company probably al-
                  ready has strict cost management guidelines, such as methods for estimating project
                  costs, spending the project budget, and tracking costs within the project. To complete
                  this planning process, you'll need these project elements:

                       * Project management plan
                       * Project charter
                       * Enterprise environmental factors
                       * Organizational process assets

                      As you may have guessed, the only output of this project management process is the
                  cost management plan.

                  Cost Estimating
                  Projects cost money, and every stakeholder with a checkbook wants to know how much
                  the project will cost. This process focuses on estimating the costs for the project. The
                  following serve as inputs to this process:

                       * Cost management plan
                       * Human resource plan (also includes the staffing management plan to describe
                         when resources will be brought onto and released from the project)
                       * Scope baseline
                       * Project schedule
                       * Risk register (database of the project risks and their characteristics, including
                         when the risk events may happen and what their financial impact may be)
                       * Enterprise environmental factors
                       * Organizational process assets

                      The preceding inputs will help the project manager create the following outputs of
                  cost estimating:

                       * Activity cost estimates (how much the work will cost)
                       * Basis of the activity cost estimates (information on how you estimated the
                         project costs, including any assumptions made during the estimating process)
                       * Project document updates

                         Determining the Project Budget
                         Once the project manager has created the cost estimate, he or she will aggregate the
                         individual activities and their attributes, such as labor and materials, to create a cost
                         baseline for the project. This process requires several inputs:

                              * Cost management plan
                              * Scope baseline
                              * Activity cost estimates
                              * Basis of estimates
                              * Project schedule
                              * Resource calendars
                              * Risk register
                              * Agreements and contracts (if applicable)
                              * Organizational process assets

                             The outputs of cost budgeting are

                              * Cost performance baseline (anticipated expenses for the project mapped to
                                the deliverables of the project)
                              * Project funding requirements (when the funds will be needed for purchases in
                                the project)
                              * Project document updates

                         Planning for Quality
                         The project manager, the project team, and the key stakeholders will work together to
                         determine how the project will achieve the expected levels of quality within the project.
                         Chapter 8 will discuss quality in detail, but for now, there are several inputs to this
                         quality planning:

                              * Project management plan
                              * Stakeholder register
                              * Risk register
                              * Requirement documents
                              * Enterprise environmental factors
                              * Organizational process assets

                             As a result of planning for the quality, the project management team will create the
                         following outputs:

                              * Quality management plan (describes how the organization's quality policies
                                will be implemented)

                       * Process improvement plan (describes how the processes within the project
                         can be improved)




                                                                                                                                            PART I
                       * Quality metrics (the defined values that you'll measure to prove quality)
                       * Quality checklists (ideal for repetitive actions to ensure each action is
                         performed the same way each time)
                       * Project document updates

                  Planning for Human Resources
                  Of course, the project will need people to do the work--that's the project team! Chap-
                  ter 9 discusses human resource planning in detail. This process specifically focuses on
                  creating the human resources plan and defining the project roles, reporting relation-
                  ships, and responsibilities of the project team members. Here are the required inputs
                  for human resources planning:

                      * The project management plan
                       * Activity resource requirements
                       * Enterprise environmental factors
                       * Organizational process assets

                     Once all the planning is completed, the project manager will have one little output:

                      * Human resource plan

                              EXAM TIP Remember that the autonomy of the project manager must also
                              be considered when planning for human resources. The organizational
                              structure will indicate what level of autonomy the project manager has.
                              Functional structures concede very little power to the project manager, while
                              granting most of the authority to the functional managers. The matrix
                              structures describe the power of the project manager in relation to the
                              functional manager: weak, balanced, or strong. Project managers have the most
                              authority in a projectized environment.

                  Planning for Project Communications
                  It's been said that 90 percent of a project manager's time is spent communicating. With
                  that factoid, it's no wonder that the project manager will want to plan to communicate
                  effectively. Here are the required inputs to get this process started:

                      * Project management plan
                       * Stakeholder register
                       * Enterprise environmental factors
                       * Organizational process assets

                             There are two outputs of this process:

                              * Communications management plan
                              * Project document updates

                             Communication is always something to discuss. (I will in Chapter 10.)

                         Planning for Project Risks
                         The project manager, the project team, and the key stakeholders will plan how to man-
                         age risk and the associated risk management activities. We'll cover this process in Chap-
                         ter 11, but here are the inputs for this process for now:

                              * Project management plan
                              * Project charter
                              * Stakeholder register
                              * Enterprise environmental factors
                              * Organizational process assets

                             This process also has but one output:

                              * Risk management plan

                         Identifying the Project Risks
                         Once the risk management plan has been created, the project management team can go
                         about the process of identifying all the good and naughty risks within the project. To
                         get this fun started, they'll need these inputs:

                              * Risk management plan (defines how risks will be identified, analyzed,
                                responded to, and monitored throughout the project)
                              * Cost management plan
                              * Schedule management plan
                              * Quality management plan
                              * Human resource management plan
                              * Scope baseline
                              * Activity cost estimates
                              * Activity duration estimates
                              * Stakeholder register
                              * Project documents
                              * Procurement documents

                                                                                                                                  95
                       * Enterprise environmental factors




                                                                                                                                              PART I
                       * Organizational process assets

                     This process will create the central repository of project risks:

                       * Risk register
                      Chapter 11 explains the risk identification process and the risk register in greater
                  detail.

                  Completing Qualitative Risk Analysis
                  Qualitative risk analysis is completed in the planning process group and "qualifies" the
                  identified risks for additional study and analysis. Here are the inputs for this process:

                       * Risk management plan
                       * Scope baseline
                       * Risk register
                       * Enterprise environmental factors
                       * Organizational process assets

                     The only outputs of this process are

                       * Project documents updates
                      In particular, the identified risks' qualitative attributes should be updated in the risk
                  register.

                  Completing Quantitative Risk Analysis
                  This process aims to quantify the risk exposure for the risks in the project. This process
                  is covered in more detail in Chapter 11. Here are the inputs for this process:

                       * Risk management plan
                       * Project cost management plan
                       * Project schedule management plan
                       * Risk register
                       * Enterprise environmental factors
                       * Organizational process assets

                     Like qualitative analysis, quantitative analysis has but one output:

                       * Project documents update

                         Planning the Risk Responses
                         Okay, the project manager, the project team, and all the key stakeholders have had
                         some serious fun identifying and performing analysis on the project risks. Now it's time
                         to get down to the business of planning the responses to the identified risks. There are
                         only two inputs to the risk response planning process:

                              * Risk management plan
                              * Risk register

                             This process may take some time, and will create two outputs:

                              * Project management plan updates
                              * Project documents updates

                         Planning Procurement Management
                         When a project manager needs to purchase something for the project, there are usually
                         rules and procedures he or she must follow within the organization. The plan procure-
                         ment management process defines the allowed approach and identifies potential sell-
                         ers for the project manager. This process has nine inputs:

                              * Project management plan
                              * Requirement documentation
                              * Risk register
                              * Activity resource requirements
                              * Project schedule
                              * Activity cost estimates
                              * Stakeholder register
                              * Enterprise environmental factors
                              * Organizational process assets

                             All of these inputs allow the project manager and the project team to consider and
                         evaluate what needs to be purchased, determine what risks may need to be considered,
                         and then to decide how the purchasing will commence. Chapter 12 centers on procure-
                         ment, but here are the outputs of this process:

                              * Procurement management plan
                              * Procurement statement of work
                              * Procurement documents (things like the Request for Quote, Request for
                                Proposal, Invitation for Bid)
                              * Source selection criteria (factors that determine which vendor gets the
                                contract; consider things like price, experience, availability, and warranties)

                         more to the decision than just crunching the numbers to see what's the best
                         deal, such as availability of resources, opportunity to learn a new skill, or the
                         headache of dealing with a vendor.)
                       * Change requests
                       * Project documents updates

                  Planning for Stakeholder Management
                  This project management process plans and identifies appropriate methods to manage,
                  maintain, and engage stakeholders in the project. The project manager wants to balance
                  the involvement, influence, and expectations of the project stakeholders without delay-
                  ing the project execution, but also assuring quality and meeting the stakeholders' re-
                  quirement in the project deliverable. This project management process has four inputs:

                      * Project management plan
                       * Stakeholder register
                       * Enterprise environmental factors
                       * Organizational process assets

                     There are two outputs of this planning process:

                      * Stakeholder management plan
                       * Project documents update

                  Executing Processes
                  The executing processes allow the project work to be performed. They include the exe-
                  cution of the project plan, the execution of vendor management, and the management
                  of the project implementation. The project manager works closely with the project
                  team in this process group to ensure that the work is being completed and that the work
                  results are of quality. The project manager also works with vendors to ensure that their
                  procured work is complete, of quality, and meets the obligations of the contracts.
                      Throughout the project, variances may happen. A variance is simply the difference
                  between what was planned and what was experienced. For example, there are cost vari-
                  ances, schedule variances, and even scope variances. When variances happen within a
                  project, the project manager and the project team retreat to the planning process group,
                  analyze the variance, and determine the best method to respond. The response may, in
                  turn, cause the project management plan to be changed, which could, in turn, affect the
                  activities of the execution process group.
                      This process group is about getting the project work done. You can plan as much as
                  you want, but it's the doing that matters. This process group consumes more of the
                  project budget than any other group because the project team is doing the work, using

                         the materials, and relying on the vendors to deliver upon their contracts. This process
                         group has eight processes.

                         Directing and Managing Project Work
                         This is the heart of the project: getting the work done. This process guides, directs, and
                         leads the project team to complete their assignments according to the project manage-
                         ment plan. The project team's performance is measured, and that information will
                         serve as input to performance reviews later in the project (Team members be warned!).
                         Here are the inputs for managing and executing the project plan:

                              * Project management plan
                              * Approved change requests
                              * Enterprise environmental factors
                              * Organizational process assets

                             The outputs of project execution are

                              * Deliverables
                              * Work performance data (how the project activities are performing in
                                comparison to what was planned)
                              * Change requests
                              * Project management plan updates
                              * Project documents updates

                         Performing Quality Assurance
                         Quality assurance (QA) is a management process that all projects adhere to within an
                         organization. QA will be discussed in more detail in Chapter 8. Here are the inputs to
                         performing quality assurance:

                              * Quality management plan
                              * Process improvement plan
                              * Quality metrics
                              * Quality control measurements (different specifications based on the
                                application area)
                              * Project documents

                             All of these QA input processes will help the project management team create the
                         following outputs:

                              * Change requests
                              * Project management plan updates
                              * Project documents updates
                              * Organizational process assets updates

                  Acquiring the Project Team




                                                                                                                                            PART I
                  The project team doesn't join the project until the execution process group. This is a
                  great example of how the planning process group is an iterative process. The project
                  manager is in planning and then shifts to execution to acquire the project team. Now
                  the project team and the project manager return to planning to create the project man-
                  agement plan. To complete the team acquisition, the following inputs are needed:

                      * Human resource plan
                       * Enterprise environmental factors (the rules in your organization on how the
                         project manager is allowed to acquire the project team)
                       * Organizational process assets

                     Using these inputs, the project manager creates the following outputs:

                      * Project staff assignments (your team--handpicked, assigned to the project, or
                        procured for the project duration)
                       * Resource calendars
                       * Project management plan updates

                  Developing the Project Team
                  Developing the project team is an execution process that seeks to determine and, if
                  necessary, improve, the skill sets of the project team members. This process, which I'll
                  talk about in Chapter 9, also focuses on improving the interaction, communication,
                  and trust of the project team members. You'll need the following inputs to facilitate
                  project team development:

                      * Human resource plan
                       * Project staff assignments (training can be part of team development)
                       * Resource calendars (to schedule the team development activities)

                     This process creates just two little, but important, outputs:

                      * Team performance assessments
                       * Enterprise environmental factors updates

                     Team performance assessments will help the project manager make decisions on
                  how to better manage and lead the project team members--and to perform future team
                  development exercises.

                              EXAM TIP Team development is more than lunch. The PMI likes team
                              development exercises, so think of whitewater rafting trips and team
                              excursions away from the office with the entire project team. However, not all
                              team development exercises involve off-site activities. They can be
                              accomplished in the context of the project work as well.

                         Managing the Project Team
                         As a project manager, you'll have to manage the project team. This means you'll need
                         to track your team's performance, provide feedback, resolve issues within the project
                         and team, and make changes so that the team can work better. You'll need six inputs to
                         complete this process:

                              * Human resource management plan
                              * Project staff assignments
                              * Team performance assessments (project manager usually performs some type
                                of performance review of each project team member)
                              * Issue log
                              * Work performance reports (may vary from organization to organization; project
                                manager reports how the project team as a whole performed their project duties)
                              * Organizational process assets

                             This process creates five outputs:

                              * Change requests
                              * Project management plan updates
                              * Project documents updates
                              * Enterprise environmental factors updates
                              * Organizational process assets updates

                         Manage Communications
                         Based on the project's communication management plan the project manager and
                         the project team will work together to communicate the most appropriate message,
                         to the correct stakeholders, at the correct time. This is the execution of who needs to
                         know what--and when. The project manager has to disperse information to keep the
                         project stakeholders informed of the project's health, status, and pending actions.
                         This project management process requires four inputs:

                              * Communications management plan
                              * Work performance reports
                              * Enterprise environmental factors
                              * Organizational process assets

                             As a result of managing project communications, there are four outputs:

                              * Project communications
                              * Project documents updates

                                                                                                                                101
                        * Project management plan updates




                                                                                                                                              PART I
                        * Organizational process assets updates

                   Conducting Project Procurements
                   Remember all that fun earlier with procurement? Now the project manager is waiting
                   for those pesky vendors to respond to the procurement documents. To complete this
                   executing process, the project manager will need the following inputs:

                       * Procurement management plan
                        * Procurement documents
                        * Source selection criteria
                        * Seller proposals
                        * Project documents
                        * Make-or-buy decisions
                        * Procurement statement of work
                        * Organizational process assets

                      As a result of this process, the project manager will receive six outputs:

                       * Selected sellers
                        * Agreements
                        * Resource calendars
                        * Change requests
                        * Project management plan updates
                        * Project documents updates

                   Managing Stakeholder Engagement
                   The project manager must work closely with the project stakeholders to keep them in-
                   terested and involved in the project. This project management process aims to help the
                   project team meet the stakeholders' expectations while also keeping expectations in
                   check. You don't want stakeholders hovering over every project activity, but you also
                   don't want them to disappear and ignore their responsibilities to stay involved with
                   certain project decisions. This project management process has four inputs:

                       * Stakeholder management plan
                        * Communications management plan
                        * Change log
                        * Organizational process assets

                             The outcomes of this process are:

                              * Issue log
                              * Change requests
                              * Project management plan updates
                              * Project documents updates
                              * Organizational process assets updates

                         Examining the Monitoring and Controlling Process
                         Groups
                         Wouldn't the project management life be even greater if all of the projects went off
                         without a hitch? If only the project team, the project work, the stakeholders, and the
                         vendors would cooperate. Oh, but we know that projects have to be constantly moni-
                         tored like a three-year-old in a china shop.
                             This process group focuses on monitoring the project work for variances, changes,
                         and discrepancies so that corrective action can be used to ensure that the project con-
                         tinues to move toward its successful completion. This means lots of measuring, inspect-
                         ing, and communicating with the project team to ensure that the project plan is
                         followed, variances to the plan are reported, and responses can be expedited.
                             This process group also is concerned with changes that may attack the Iron Triangle
                         of Project Management: time, cost, and scope. As changes are allowed into the project,
                         or as changes sneak into a project through scope creep, they must be examined for their
                         overall effect on the project's execution and, ultimately, on the project deliverable.
                         Chapters 5, 6, and 7 will cover scope, time, and cost control, but project managers also
                         have to be concerned with quality control. It doesn't do much good if a project is com-
                         pleted on time and on budget, but the deliverable is full of errors and of poor quality.
                         Chapter 8 will examine quality control in detail. Let's take a quick look at each of the
                         11 processes within this group.

                                       EXAM TIP While there are 11 processes within the monitoring and
                                       controlling process group, it doesn't mean that the project manager needs
                                       to use all 11 processes for every project.

                         Monitoring and Controlling the Project Work
                         What'd you expect to be doing in the monitor and control process group? This process is
                         the heart of the process group and includes the entire collection of project characteristics,
                         such as time, cost, and quality statistics. Based on the collected statistics, the project man-
                         ager can measure the project success, identify trends, make forecasts, create project re-
                         ports, and take actions to improve the project. Here are the inputs for this process:

                              * Project management plan
                              * Schedule forecasts

                                                                                                                                103
                        * Cost forecasts




                                                                                                                                              PART I
                        * Validated changes
                        * Work performance information
                        * Enterprise environmental factors
                        * Organizational process assets.

                      Monitoring and controlling the project work will give the project team four outputs:

                        * Change requests
                        * Work performance reports
                        * Project management plan updates
                        * Project documents updates

                   Performing Integrated Change Control
                   Integrated change control is a process that examines how a change affects all parts of a
                   project. Consider a change to the project scope on a project you've worked on. The
                   change likely affected the project cost, the project schedule, and the expectations of the
                   project quality. The change may also have affected other regions of your project: risk
                   management, communications, human resources, and even procurement. Integrated
                   change control manages the approved changes within a project, how and when the
                   changes may occur, and determines if a change to the project may have already oc-
                   curred. This process, as fun as it is, happens from project initiation through project
                   closing. There are many inputs for this process:

                        * Project management plan
                        * Work performance reports
                        * Requested changes (should be documented and passed through the change
                          control system)
                        * Enterprise environmental factors
                        * Organizational process assets

                       These inputs and this process will help the project manager and the project team
                   create the following outputs:

                        * Approved change requests
                        * Change log
                        * Project management plan updates
                        * Project documents updates

                         Validating the Project Scope
                         If you were to hire an architectural firm to build your next mansion, you'd periodically
                         visit the house under construction to ensure that the workers and the architects were
                         building according to the plans you provided them. At the end of the project, you'd
                         walk through the home and create a "punch list" of all the things that needed to be
                         changed or repaired according to your agreement. The architectural firm would work
                         with you to ensure that you're happy with the deliverable you asked for and the deliver-
                         able they have created for you. This is scope validation: the formal acceptance by inspec-
                         tion of the project deliverables. Here are the inputs the project manager needs to facili-
                         tate this process with the project customer:

                              * Project management plan
                              * Requirements documentation
                              * Requirements traceability matrix (a table of requirements that records when
                                each requirement was identified, when the requirement should be created,
                                and when the requirement was actually delivered)
                              * Accepted deliverables
                              * Work performance data

                                       NOTE It is not the requirements that are created or delivered, it is the
                                       deliverable product, service, or result that meets the requirements.


                             The customer would inspect and then, hopefully, formally accept the project work
                         or provide feedback on what needs to be corrected or changed. Here are the outputs of
                         scope validation:

                              * Accepted deliverables
                              * Change requests
                              * Work performance information
                              * Project documents updates

                         Controlling the Project Scope
                         Once the project scope statement has been created, it is paramount to guard the scope
                         from unauthorized changes and to follow a scope change control system within the
                         project to ensure that any approved changes reflect the changes through cost, time,
                         scope, quality, and the other knowledge areas within the project. Here are the inputs to
                         perform this process:

                              * Project management plan (You will need the project scope management plan.)
                              * Requirements documentation

                                                                                                                                105
                        * Requirements traceability matrix (If changes enter the project, you'll need to
                          update this matrix to show the new requirements.)




                                                                                                                                              PART I
                        * Work performance data
                        * Organizational process assets

                      The outputs of this massive and not-so-enjoyable process are

                        * Work performance information
                        * Change requests
                        * Project management plan updates
                        * Project documents updates
                        * Organizational process asset updates

                   Controlling the Project Schedule
                   This process isn't a mystery. It's simply keeping the project on schedule so it finishes on
                   time as planned. When variances happen within the project, the project manager and
                   the project team have to plan for how to respond to these schedule variances. I'll dis-
                   cuss scheduling and schedule control in Chapter 6. For now, here are the inputs for this
                   process:

                        * Project management plan
                        * Project schedule
                        * Work performance data
                        * Project calendars
                        * Schedule data
                        * Organizational process assets

                      This process creates several outputs:

                        * Work performance information
                        * Schedule forecasts
                        * Change requests
                        * Project management plan updates
                        * Organizational process asset updates
                        * Project documents updates

                   Controlling the Project Cost
                   Have you ever noticed that it's usually easier to get more time than money for your
                   projects? Management dreads hearing that a project will cost more due to errors and

                         variances. This process aims to prevent cost overruns and to control the expenses with-
                         in a project. There are many inputs for this process:

                              * Project management plan
                              * Project funding requirements
                              * Work performance data
                              * Organizational process assets

                            Chapter 7 is all about managing project costs, including creating cost estimates and
                         budgets. Here are the outputs of cost control:

                              * Work performance information
                              * Cost forecasts (a prediction based on the current project performance of
                                where the project's budget is going to end up)
                              * Change requests
                              * Project management plan updates
                              * Project documents updates
                              * Organizational process assets updates

                         Performing Quality Control
                         Quality control (QC), which is covered in Chapter 8, is all about keeping the mistakes
                         out of the project deliverables--and ultimately away from the customers--before the
                         project is declared finished. QC is considered an inspection-driven process, because
                         that's the primary activity involved with it. Here are the inputs to perform this process:

                              * Project management plan
                              * Quality metrics
                              * Quality checklists
                              * Work performance data
                              * Approved change requests
                              * Deliverables
                              * Project documents
                              * Organizational process assets

                             QC creates many outputs that can help the project manager and the project team
                         improve the project performance and ensure that the project work is completed cor-
                         rectly for the customer. Here are the outputs of QC:

                              * Quality control measurements
                              * Validated changes (specifically, validated defect repairs)
                              * Validated deliverables

                        * Change requests
                        * Project management plan updates
                        * Project documents updates
                        * Organizational process assets updates

                   Controlling Project Communications
                   Management, your project team, key stakeholders, and the project customer will want
                   the project manager to keep them abreast of the project. This process centers on the
                   project manager understanding what's happening throughout the entire project, being
                   able to retrieve the information as it's needed, and distributing the information to the
                   correct stakeholders as it's needed. There are four inputs to controlling the project
                   communications:

                        * Project management plan
                        * Project communications
                        * Issue log
                        * Work performance data
                        * Organizational process assets

                      As the project manager controls the project communications, there will be four
                   outputs:

                        * Work performance information
                        * Change requests
                        * Project management plan updates
                        * Project documents updates
                        * Organizational process assets updates


                   Controlling Project Risks
                   A risk is an uncertain event or condition that can affect the project's outcome. Project
                   managers often think of risks as negative events, but that's not always the case. Many risks,
                   such as using a new material, a new vendor, or a new approach to the project work, aren't
                   negative, but have positive outcomes. Chapter 11 will discuss both positive and negative
                   risks in detail. There are four inputs to the risk monitoring and controlling process:

                        * Project management plan (specifically, the risk management plan)
                        * Risk register
                        * Work performance data
                        * Work performance reports

              108
                            Risk monitoring and control happens throughout the project's life cycle, not just
                         once. As this process is completed, there will be five outputs:

                              * Work performance information
                              * Change requests
                              * Project management plan updates
                              * Project documents updates
                              * Organizational process assets updates

                         Controlling Procurement
                         If a project manager has to complete the procurement management process, she will
                         also need to administer the project contracts. This process, which Chapter 12 explores,
                         ensures that the relationship between the buyer and the seller remains intact, reviews
                         how the seller is performing according to the terms of the contract, and works with the
                         seller to ensure they continue to abide by the agreed contractual terms. This process has
                         six inputs:

                              * Project management plan
                              * Procurement documents
                              * Agreements
                              * Approved change requests
                              * Work performance reports
                              * Work performance data

                             Controlling the project procurement creates five outputs:

                              * Work performance information
                              * Change requests. (The contract change control system oversees how changes
                                can enter the contracted work. In addition, the terms of the contract may
                                dictate the costs and allowance for change.)
                              * Project management plan updates
                              * Project documents updates
                              * Organizational process assets updates

                         Closing the Project
                         In project management, few things are more rewarding than closing a project. It's ex-
                         tremely satisfying, and sometimes sad, to officially close a project and move along to
                         other challenges. This final project management process group has but two processes,

                                                                                        Chapter 3: Examining the Project Processes

                                                                                                                                109
                   but it's no less important than the other process groups within a project. The goals of
                   closing a project are to officially confirm that all of the needed processes have been




                                                                                                                                              PART I
                   completed, that the deliverables have been transferred to the user or organization, and
                   that the project is done.
                       Project closure also is concerned with the success of the project, and these processes
                   can be used when a project may be canceled before reaching the desired deliverables. If
                   a project has multiple phases, the processes within this group can be used for each
                   phase and at the end of the project.

                   Closing the Project or Phase
                   This is the project goal: Close the project and get back to your life. You'll also use these
                   processes to close out a phase. There are just three inputs to project and phase closure:

                        * Project management plan (should direct the project manager on what internal
                          processes are required to close the project or phase in the organization)
                        * Accepted deliverables (deliverables that have successfully completed scope
                          validation)
                        * Organizational process assets

                      When the project manager closes a project, two outputs are created and completed:

                        * Final product, service, or result transition (the things your project has created,
                          including the project documents and the deliverables the stakeholders have
                          expected)
                        * Organizational process assets updates

                   Closing Procurements
                   If a project manager has worked with vendors on a project, then there are processes that
                   must be completed prior to project closure to ensure that all of the terms of the contract
                   have been met. This allows the project manager to confirm that the seller has met its
                   obligations and that the project manager's organization has also met the obligations of
                   the contract before the project is closed. Here are the inputs to this process:

                        * Project management plan (Specifically, you'll need the procurement
                          management plan.)
                        * Procurement documentation (This means you'll need the contract
                          documentation and any details about the contract closure procedure.)

                      As a result of performing these activities, there are two outputs of this process:

                        * Closed procurements
                        * Organizational process assets updates

                         Examining How the Processes Interact
                         The five project management process groups are not unlike the Rubik's Cube toy: What
                         you do in one area affects all the other areas. In project management, the interactions
                         between the processes are somewhat chronological. However, the processes are often
                         iterative and transient, and allow the project management team to shift from process
                         group to process group. The process groups allow for plenty of overlap throughout the
                         project. For example, the extent of the monitoring and controlling processes is directly
                         affected by the planning process group.
                             You've seen throughout this chapter that the output of one process is often an input
                         to another process. The planning process group is the best example of this axiom; proj-
                         ect plans are created and then executed for each knowledge area. As a project moves
                         through its life cycle, the activities of project management--that is, the 47 individual
                         processes--interact, overlap, and share commonalities that allow the project to move
                         forward. Note that in a multiphase project, these processes can be applied to each indi-
                         vidual phase and to the project as a whole.
                             All of these processes are not needed on every single project--only the processes
                         that are relevant to the specific project are needed. For example, a low-priority, simple
                         move-add-change (MAC) project within an organization likely won't need to complete
                         all 47 processes in order for the project to be completed successfully. However, a four-
                         year project to build a skyscraper will likely use all 47 processes.
                             Constraints within a project are often seen as process inputs. Consider any project
                         you've worked on where management has enforced a project deadline. The deadline is
                         a constraint that may not allow the project team to determine the best completion
                         through normal project planning, but rather by working backward from the deadline.
                         Constraints that serve as inputs to processes can cause additional risks on schedule and
                         quality, can increase project costs, and may even require the project scope to be reduced
                         to hit the project's target preset end date. No fun for anyone!


                         Chapter Summary
                         Don't you feel great now that you've seen all of the project management processes, the
                         process groups where they live, and how all these processes interact with one another?
                         Your PMI examination is all about project management, and project management is, of
                         course, all about the processes needed to complete the project. Projects move through
                         a project management life cycle of initiating, planning, executing, monitoring and con-
                         trolling, and, ultimately, closing. Table 3-1 is a quick summary of each project manage-
                         ment process group and the processes you'll find in each group. I'll cover all of these in
                         detail through the remainder of this book:

                             The project management processes span the entire project, which means that not
                         only do the processes live inside of the process groups we've covered here, but also the
                         activities of the processes can be lumped into one of the ten knowledge areas of project
                         management. Part II of this book deals with the project management knowledge areas.
                             Processes interact based on the situations within the project. Not all of these pro-
                         cesses will interact on every project, and not every process is needed on every single
                         project. Your CAPM or PMP examination will test you, however, on all of these pro-
                         cesses, since it's possible for a project to use all 47 project management processes.

                         Key Terms
                         Assumption A belief that may or may not be true within a project. Weather is an ex-
                         ample of an assumption in construction projects.
                         Change request A documented request to add to or remove from the project scope. A
                         change request may be initiated to change an organizational process asset, such as a
                         template or a form.

                   Constraint A condition, rule, or procedure that restricts a project manager's options.
                   A project deadline is an example of a constraint.
                   Corrective action A corrective action brings project work back into alignment with
                   the project plan. A corrective action may also address a process that is producing errors.
                   Cost baseline The aggregation of the project deliverables and their associated costs.
                   The difference between the cost estimates and the actual cost of the project identifies
                   the cost variance.
                   Defect repair   The activity to repair a defect within the project.

                         performing poorly on both costs and schedule. The customer has become very
                         aggravated with the project problems and has decided to cancel the project.

                         December 30. This date is an input to your planning process group and is
                         considered what?

                   Questions and Answers
                      1. Yolanda is the project manager of the Data Migration Project for her
                         organization. As the project manager Yolanda should identify which project
                         management processes are most appropriate for this type of project. What is a
                         project process?
                         A. The creation of a product
                         B. The progressive elaboration resulting in a product
                         C. A series of actions that bring about a product, result, or service
                         D. A series of actions that allow the project to move from concept to
                            deliverable
                         C. A process, the focus of this chapter, is a set of interrelated activities that
                         brings about a product, result, or service. A is incorrect because it does not
                         fully describe a process, but describes more of a project. B is incorrect because
                         progressive elaboration is not a description of a process, but rather a
                         description of incremental refinements of a definition of a product, service, or
                         result. D is also incorrect because this statement describes project phases.
                      2. There are five project management process groups that allow projects to move
                         from start to completion. Which one of the following is NOT one of the
                         project management process groups?

                                 C. Communicating is a process, but it is not a process group. A, B, and D are
                                 all incorrect choices because they are project management process groups.
                              3. Of the following, which is the logical order of the project management
                                 processes?
                                  A. Initiating, planning, monitoring and controlling, executing, closing
                                  B. Initiating, planning, executing, monitoring and controlling, closing

                                  D. Planning, initiating, executing, closing, monitoring and closing
                                 B. Projects logically move through initiating, planning, executing, monitoring
                                 and controlling, and closing. A, C, and D are all incorrect because they are
                                 not in the logical order of the project management process groups.
                              4. You are the project manager of the GRT Construction Project. Your project
                                 team announces how they are happy to be done with project planning. You
                                 inform the team, however, that you and they will likely be returning to project
                                 planning throughout the project. This ongoing process of project planning is
                                 also known as _________________.

                                  D. Phase gates
                                 B. Rolling wave planning is the progressive detailing of the project
                                 management plan. A is not a valid project management term. C is not an
                                 appropriate answer. D, phase gates, describes the end of a project phase.
                              5. You are the project manager for the AQA Project. You would like to include
                                 several of the customers in the project planning sessions. Your project leader
                                 would like to know why the stakeholders should be involved since your
                                 project team will be determining the best method to reach the project
                                 objectives. You should include the stakeholders because _____________.
                                  A. It generates goodwill between the project team and the stakeholders.
                                  B. It allows the stakeholders to see the project manager as the authority of the
                                     project.
                                  C. It allows the project team to meet the stakeholders and express their
                                     concerns regarding project constraints.

                                                                                                                          121
                      D. It allows the project team to leverage the skills and knowledge of the
                         stakeholders to develop the project plan.




                                                                                                                                        PART I
                     D. Stakeholders should be involved in the planning processes because they
                     have specific skills and knowledge that the project team can use to develop
                     the project plan. A may be true, but it is not the best answer for this question.
                     B is not valid because it is not the reason for involving the stakeholders. In
                     addition, the project manager may not be seen as the project authority in
                     every project (consider public projects and functional organizations). C is
                     incorrect because this is not the purpose of involving the stakeholders.
                   6. You are the project manager of a new mobile application project for a client.
                      You have requested that several of the stakeholders participate in the initiation
                      of the project. Why is this important?
                      A. It improves the probability of shared ownership.
                      B. It allows for scope constraints.
                      C. It prevents scope creep.
                      D. It allows for effective communications.
                     A. Stakeholders should participate in project initiation because it improves
                     shared ownership of the project, deliverable acceptance, and stakeholder
                     satisfaction. B, C, and D are all false statements about the involvement of
                     stakeholders in the initiation processes.
                   7. You are coaching several new project managers in your organization about the
                      project management life cycle and the purpose of each group. There is some
                      confusion, however, about the actual purpose of the project management
                      planning process group. What is the primary purpose of the planning process
                      group?
                      A. To initiate the project work
                      B. To determine the project cost
                      C. To determine the Iron Triangle of Project Management
                      D. To develop the project management plan
                     D. The purpose of planning is to develop the project management plan. A is
                     incorrect. This is the purpose of the initiating process group. B and C are
                     incorrect because these may occur during planning, but these are not the
                     primary purpose of the planning process group.
                   8. Beth is the project customer for a home construction project. The project is
                      likely to be awarded to your company's design firm, but there are still some
                      questions regarding the proposal your company has offered to Beth. Robert,
                      your manager, wants you to be the project manager on this project even
                      though it technically hasn't been awarded to your company. When is a project
                      manager typically selected?

                                 C. The project manager is selected during the initiation process group. A, B,
                                 and D are all false because these answers do not define when the project
                                 manager is selected.
                              9. Gary is teaching a group of project managers about the PMP and the PMBOK
                                 Guide. Gary wants to clearly communicate what project management is
                                 according to the PMBOK Guide. Which one of the following statements best
                                 describes what project management is?
                                  A. Project management is the application of knowledge, skills, tools, and
                                     techniques to project team members to meet project requirements.
                                  B. Project management is the application of knowledge, skills, tools, and
                                     techniques to project activities to meet project requirements.
                                  C. Project management is the collection of the project management processes
                                     used on every project.
                                  D. Project management is the application of the project management
                                     processes that are used on every project.
                                 B. Project management is the application of knowledge, skills, tools, and
                                 techniques to project activities to meet project requirements. A, C, and D are
                                 not valid definitions of what project management is. A is incorrect because
                                 the tools and techniques are not applied to the project team members. C is
                                 incorrect because not every project management process is used on every
                                 project. And D, while similar to C, is incorrect because not every process is
                                 applied on every project.
                             10. In order for a project to be successful, there must be four conditions. Which
                                 one of the following is not a condition required for project success?
                                  A. The project team must select the appropriate processes to meet the project
                                     objectives.
                                  B. The project team must select applicable knowledge areas in order to meet
                                     the project objectives.
                                  C. The project team must comply with requirements to meet stakeholder
                                     needs, wants, and expectations.
                                  D. The project team must balance the competing demands of scope, time,
                                     cost, quality, resources, and risk to create a quality product.
                                 B. The project team does not select which knowledge areas are needed for the
                                 project to be successful, so this statement is false. Thus, it is not a condition

                       PMBOK describe the ten knowledge areas that are applicable for every project.
                       A, C, and D are correct statements for a successful project. The fourth
                       condition of a successful project is that a defined approach to adapt the
                       product specifications and plans to meet the project requirements is used
                       within the project.
                   11. When a project manager and a project team choose the processes that they
                       deem applicable to their project, this is called what?
                       A. Tailoring
                       B. Faulty project management
                       C. Functional project management
                       D. Rolling wave planning
                       A. The project team tailors the project processes to their individual project. B
                       is incorrect because this is good project management, not faulty project
                       management. C describes an organizational structure, not tailoring. D is
                       incorrect because rolling wave planning defines the iterations of project
                       planning.
                   12. Ron is the project manager of a new project and he's eager to meet the project
                       team to get the project planned and the work moving. However, he's confused
                       as to when he will actually acquire the team. In which process group will the
                       project team be acquired?
                       A. Initiating
                       B. Planning
                       C. Executing
                       D. Monitoring and controlling
                       C. The project team is acquired in the executing process group. A, B, and D
                       are all incorrect because the team is not acquired during these groups. This is
                       a tricky question for some people. Remember, the project management life
                       cycle isn't a series of phases or step-by-step directions. You'll move from one
                       process group to another as needed in the project.
                   13. You are the project manager of a new project. You have worked with
                       management to identify several initial assumptions and constraints for your
                       project. Where will these items be documented?
                       A. Project management plan
                       B. Project scope statement
                       C. Project charter
                       D. Risk management plan

              124
                                 C. The initial constraints and assumptions are documented in the project
                                 charter. A, B, and D are all incorrect because the initial constraints and
                                 assumptions are documented in the project charter, not in the project
                                 management plan, the project scope statement, or the risk management plan.
                             14. Ben is the project manager for his company. A customer has requested a new
                                 website and asked that Ben serve as the project manager since he's done great
                                 work in the past for her company. Based on this information, when does a
                                 project become officially authorized?
                                  A. When the project charter is written
                                  B. When the project is funded
                                  C. When the project team is assembled
                                  D. When the project charter is approved
                                 D. The project is not authorized until the charter is approved. A is incorrect
                                 because a charter can be written by the project management team and still
                                 not be approved. B is incorrect because a project is chartered, typically and
                                 technically, before being funded. Recall that the contract, or agreement, is
                                 needed as one of the possible inputs to the project charter. C is incorrect
                                 because team acquisition happens during the execution process group--well
                                 after project initiation, which is where the charter comes from.
                             15. You are the project manager of a new project to construct a children's
                                 playground in your community. The project is being funded by a private
                                 donor, but they expect you to manage the project with the fullest attention.
                                 When does the vast majority of a project's budget get expended?
                                  A. During the planning process group activities
                                  B. During the execution process group activities
                                  C. During the initiation process group activities
                                  D. During the procurement process group activities
                                 B. When the project team completes the project work, the project's budget is
                                 expended. A, C, and D are all incorrect because the vast majority of the
                                 project's budget is not consumed during these process groups.
                             16. You have identified a negative risk within your project and would like to
                                 implement a work-around to the risk. A work-around is an example of what?
                                  A. A corrective action
                                  B. A defect repair
                                  C. Preventive action
                                  D. Poor project management
                                 A. A work-around is an example of a corrective action. A, corrective action, is
                                 an action to bring future project performance in alignment with the project

                       plan. B, defect repair, is the repair of flawed work. C is incorrect because a
                       preventive action attempts to reduce the probability of a risk from coming

                       into play. D is not a valid answer.
                   17. You are working on a new high-profile project. Management has asked that
                       you pause the project at the end of each project phase to communicate with
                       them about the work and the project progress, and provide cost and schedule
                       forecasts. Which process group can provide feedback between project phases?
                       A. Planning
                       B. Executing
                       C. Monitoring and controlling
                       D. Closing
                       C. The monitoring and controlling process group provides feedback between
                       project phases. A, B, and D are all incorrect because these process groups do
                       not provide feedback between project phases.
                   18. You are the project manager of an IT upgrade project for a health care client.
                       The client demands perfection in the project's product because of the lives
                       your project's product will affect. Which process aims to eliminate causes of
                       unsatisfactory performance?
                       A. Scope definition
                       B. Scope validation
                       C. Quality control
                       D. Cost control
                       C. Quality control aims to eliminate causes of unsatisfactory performance.
                       This process is part of the monitoring and controlling process group. A, scope
                       definition, is the process of defining what the scope and its requirements for
                       acceptance are. B, scope validation, is the inspection-drive process the project
                       manager and the project customer (or a third party) will do together to
                       inspect the project deliverables for acceptability. D, cost control, is concerned
                       with controlling project costs.
                   19. Mick is the project manager of the CHA Design Project. The project has been
                       performing poorly on both costs and schedule. The customer has become very
                       aggravated with the project problems and has decided to cancel the project.
                       Which process must happen next?
                       A. Scope control
                       B. Procurement management
                       C. Contract closure
                       D. No additional process is needed because the project has been canceled.

              126
                                 C. When a project is canceled, the closing processes must still happen. In this
                                 example, the only closing process mentioned was contract closure. A, B, and
                                 D are all invalid because these processes do not happen if a project is closed
                                 or canceled.
                             20. Management has determined that your project must be completed by
                                 December 30. This date is an input to your planning process group and is
                                 considered what?
                                  A. A constraint
                                  B. An enterprise environmental factor

                                 A. A preset project deadline is an example of a project constraint. B is
                                 incorrect because enterprise environmental factors are not constraints. C,
                                 organizational process assets, are not constraints but resources for the project
                                 management team. D is incorrect because assumptions are things believed to
                                 be true but not proven to be true.

                     In this chapter, you will
                        * Learn what project integration management does for the project manager
                        * Develop the project charter
                        * Create the project management plan
                        * Manage the project work
                        * Monitor and control the project work
                        * Understand how integrated change control works
                        * Close a project or phase




                   What the heck is project integration management? This is the heart of project management
                   and is made up of the day-to-day processes the project manager relies upon to ensure
                   that all parts of the project work together. Project integration management is about the
                   project manager making the best decisions for work, resources, project issues, and all
                   the logistics of the project so it is completed as planned. What you do in one area of the
                   project directly affects all the other areas of the project.

                       Project integration management is also about making trade-offs between compet-
                   ing objectives and alternatives. I'm certain you, as a project manager, have worked with
                   stakeholders who want something that would cancel out a characteristic another stake-
                   holder wants: Bob says he wants the house painted green, and Nancy wants it painted
                   red. Or your client wants your organization to design a reliable, fast network operating
                   system for thousands of users as long as it doesn't cost more than a few thousand dol-
                   lars. Competing objectives require negotiations, balance, and lots and lots of aspirin.

                         Developing the Project Charter
                         All projects officially start with a project charter--a formal document that authorizes
                         the project to exist in the organization and gives the project manager authority over the
                         project resources. So what's so great about the charter? It's the document that gives you,
                         the project manager, the authority to use resources to do the project work--and author-
                         ity over resources like equipment and facilities. It's a powerful document and needs to
                         be signed by someone with power in the organization. The project manager is assigned
                         to the project as early as possible, and ideally while the charter is still being developed.
                         The project manager needs to be assigned, without a doubt, before the project moves
                         into the project planning process group.
                             In many organizations, the project manager is the person writing the charter, and
                         that's fine--really!--but the charter cannot be signed by the project manager. While the
                         project may be backed by the project customer, the project champion, or even the orga-
                         nization's project management office, the charter is officially backed by a project initia-
                         tor, typically called the project sponsor, at a level within the organization where this
                         person can allocate funding and resources for the project. In other words, the project
                         manager can't sign the charter because he's not "powerful" enough within the organiza-
                         tion to assign resources and funds to his own project.

                                       EXAM TIP The project charter authorizes the project, names the project
                                       manager, and also defines the project manager's level of authority.

                             Charters are created by an enterprise, a government agency, a program manager, or
                         a project steering committee (sometimes called the portfolio organization). Charters
                         are written so that a project can answer or satisfy one of the following:

                              * Market demand
                              * Business need
                              * Customer request
                              * Technological advance
                              * Legal requirement
                              * Ecological impacts
                              * Social need

                             Your organization might call these opportunities, problems, or business require-
                         ments. Once you're a project manager, you'll just call 'em your favorite project. (Your
                         favorite project is always the one you're managing right now.) Why some projects with-

                                                                                                                                131
                   in an organization get selected and others do not can be due to finances, the project
                   owner, sponsor influence, legal requirements, or any number of reasons. The message
                   to take away is that regardless of why a project gets selected, you, the project manager,
                   must have a charter for the project to be officially authorized. Charters should always
                   include the following project information:

                        * Requirements for satisfaction of project stakeholder needs, wants, and
                          expectations




                                                                                                                                              PART II
                        * Business needs, a description of the project's product, or a mile-high view of
                          the project's purpose
                        * The reason why the project was chartered
                        * The project manager and his or her level of autonomy
                        * Summary milestone schedule
                        * Stakeholder influences
                        * Functional organizations and how they'll be involved with the project
                        * Project constraints and assumptions (environment, external, and
                          organizational)
                        * Business case for the project and the project return on investment
                        * Summary project budget
                        * High-level risks
                        * Project approval requirements
                        * Name and authority level of the project sponsor

                       Believe it or not, the project charter may be updated. For example, the summary proj-
                   ect budget may be based on a simple, rough order-of-magnitude estimate. As the project
                   moves deeper into planning, the estimates become clearer and more precise. The more
                   accurate estimate may cause the budget to change, requiring the project charter to be
                   modified to reflect the new information.

                   Preparing to Create the Project Charter
                   The project charter is often written by the project manager and then signed by the project
                   sponsor, so you'll need to know what goes into it, how it gets created, and then what you
                   can do with your charter--especially for the Certified Associate in Project Management
                   (CAPM) or Project Management Professional (PMP) examination. When preparing to
                   create the project charter, you'll need five things, described in the following sections.

                   Contract
                   Okay, I confess--you won't always need a contract, or an agreement, in order to cre-
                   ate a project charter, but it's an input in the Project Management Body of Knowledge
                   (PMBOK), so work with me a moment. If you're working in an organization that

                         performs projects for other entities, such as a consulting firm, architectural firm, or
                         even an event planning company, you'll need a contract to make the project official.
                         Chapter 12 explores contracting, but for now know that you may need a contract if
                         it's appropriate for your project.

                         Project Statement of Work (SOW)
                         This document defines all the products and services that the project will provide. For a
                         project completed internally, the SOW comes from the project sponsor and defines the
                         business need, products, and services the project will create. If the project is to be com-
                         pleted for another organization, the customer should provide the performing organiza-
                         tion with the SOW as part of their procurement package. For example, if your company
                         were to receive a Request for Proposal (RFP) to create a new warehouse, the customer
                         would include the SOW with the RFP so you could know what the proposal is to ad-
                         dress. Every SOW should include:

                              * Business need        Why the project needs to exist.
                              * Product scope description This document describes the product or service
                                the project will create. Consider the RFP to create the new warehouse: The
                                customer's RFP would detail the square footage, requirements of the
                                warehouse, and other details that would allow your company to respond
                                intelligently to their request. As you may have experienced, especially in the
                                world of information technology, the product description is usually broad,
                                vague, and dreamy in the early stages of a project. As the project moves
                                through the planning phases, the details of the product scope become clearer.
                              * Strategic plan The strategic plan defines how the project will mesh with
                                the organization's goals. This is a key input when an organization decides
                                whether to do a project. You won't find a car manufacturer hosting projects
                                to create chandeliers--it's just not within their strategic plan to undertake
                                such a project.

                         Business Case
                         The business case defines why the project is worthy of the organization's monies to be
                         invested into the project. It explains why the project is needed and what type of return
                         the organization can expect for its investment. A cost-benefit analysis is usually in-
                         cluded in the business case to support the project's purpose in the organization. The
                         business case may be written by the project manager, business analyst, or even by a
                         customer if the project is sponsored by someone external to your organization.
                              Business cases can evolve from feasibility studies because some of the information
                         may overlap. The business case will define the market demand for the project's cre-
                         ation, the organizational need, ecological impacts, legal requirements, a social need, or
                         the technological advance that the project will bring the organization. In some instanc-
                         es, the business case could be based on a customer's request for additional services or
                         on products that are opportunities for the organization to grow.

                   Enterprise Environmental Factors
                   The project charter also considers the organization where the project will take place
                   and its culture, standards, regulations, and environment. You'll see enterprise environ-
                   mental factors throughout the remainder of this book. Just so you've got these fun
                   things once and for all, here are the enterprise environmental factors you'll need to be
                   familiar with:




                                                                                                                                             PART II
                       * Organization's culture and structure
                        * Industry standards and regulations
                        * Organization's facilities and equipment (the general infrastructure of the
                          company)
                        * Human resources and their talents, skills, and availability
                        * Human resources administration
                        * Work authorization system
                        * Marketplace conditions
                        * Stakeholders' tolerance for risk (also known as the utility function)
                        * Commercial databases for the organization's industry (Think of cost-
                          estimating databases for a builder or manufacturer.)
                        * Project management information system (PMIS). Think of--yes, I'll say it--
                          Microsoft Project. Don't worry, you won't have to know any software vendors or
                          their goods for the PMI exam. All of your favorite, or least favorite, project
                          management software is just lumped into the generic term "project management
                          information system."

                   Organizational Process Assets
                   Anything that your organization has in its possession that can help your current project
                   succeed is part of the organizational process assets. This also means that the policies,
                   procedures, plans, and documentation of past projects are part of the organizational
                   process assets. The Project Management Institute (PMI) breaks down the organization-
                   al process assets into two big categories. Let's explore them in detail.

                       * Processes and procedures for project work:
                          * Standard processes and procedures for getting project work done. Consider
                            purchase requests, team member acquisitions, the quality programs your
                            projects subscribe to, checklists, and generally the way your company
                            requires your projects to operate.
                          * Guidelines on how your project team is to complete their work, proposal
                            evaluations, and how you measure your project for performance.
                          * Templates for project management.

                                   knowledge base
                                 * Process measurements
                                 * Project files

                                 * Issue and defect records of past projects and products
                                 * Configuration management for versioning, baselines, company standards,
                                   procedures, and prior project documents (for example, the versions of
                                   software, blueprints, and manuals)
                                 * Financial databases


                         Choosing a Project to Charter
                         Once the organization and the project manager are armed with these inputs, they're
                         ready to go about creating the project charter. Preparing to create the charter is often
                         trickier than actually writing it. However, before the project management team can ac-
                         tually create a charter, there needs to be a project. This means the organization, the
                         project steering committee, or the project portfolio management team needs to choose
                         a project to initiate.
                             Unless you work for an incredible organization and/or are extremely lucky, you've
                         probably discovered that not every good project ends up being authorized through a
                         charter. After all, most companies only have a limited amount of funds to invest in new
                         projects. There are two approaches an organization takes to choose new projects--and
                         no, "heads or tails" is not one of them.
                             The first method is by using a mathematical model to determine the likelihood of
                         success. These models include:

                              * Linear programming
                              * Nonlinear programming
                              * Dynamic programming

                      Sounds like fun, doesn't it? Don't worry. You do not need to know how to perform
                   any of the preceding math tricks for your CAPM or PMP examination. Just be topically
                   aware of these, and know that they are examples of geeky mathematical models.




                                                                                                                                                   PART II
                                  EXAM TIP Mathematical models are also known as "constrained
                                  optimization."

                      The second method, however, you will want to be a bit more familiar with. This
                   project selection uses a benefits-comparison model to determine project success. Let's
                   look at these in more detail in the following sections.

                   Murder Boards
                   Murder boards are committees full of folks that ask every conceivable negative question
                   about the proposed project. Their goals are to expose strengths and weakness of the
                   project--and to kill the project if it's deemed unworthy for the organization to commit
                   to. Not a pleasant decision-making process. You might also know murder boards by a
                   slightly friendlier name: project steering committees or project selection committees.

                   Scoring Models
                   Scoring models (sometimes called weighted scoring models) are models that use a com-
                   mon set of values for all of the projects up for selection. For example, values can be prof-
                   itability, complexity, customer demand, and so on. Each of these values has an assigned
                   weight. Values of high importance have a high weight, while values of lower importance
                   have a lower weight. The projects are measured against these values and assigned scores
                   by how well they match the predefined values. The projects with higher scores take prior-
                   ity over projects with lower scores. Figure 4-1 demonstrates the scoring model.

                         Benefit/Cost Ratios
                         Just like they sound, benefit/cost ratio (BCR) models examine the benefit-to-cost ratio.
                         A typical measure is the cost to complete the project and the cost of ongoing operations
                         of the project product compared against the expected benefits of the project. For ex-
                         ample, consider a project that will cost $575,000 to create a new product, market the
                         product, and provide ongoing support for the product for one year. The expected gross
                         return on the product, however, is $980,000 in year one. The benefit of completing the
                         project is greater than the cost to create the product.

                                       EXAM TIP BCR statements can be written as ratios. For example, a BCR of
                                       3:2 has three benefits to two costs--a good choice. A BCR of 1:3, however, is
                                       not a good choice. Pay special attention to which side of the ratio represents
                                       the cost. It should not exceed the benefit if you want it to be selected.

                         Payback Period
                         How long does it take the project to "pay back" the associated costs? For example, the
                         AXZ Project will cost the organization $500,000 to create over five years. The expected
                         cash inflow (income) on the project deliverable, however, is $40,000 per quarter. From
                         here, it's simple math: 500,000 divided by $40,000 is 12.5 quarters, or a little over three
                         years to recoup the expenses.
                             This selection method, while one of the simplest, is also the weakest. Why? The
                         cash inflows are not discounted against the time to begin creating the cash. This is the
                         time value of money. The $40,000 per quarter five years from now is worth less than
                         $40,000 in your pocket today. Remember when sodas were a nickel? It's the same
                         idea--the soda hasn't gotten better; the nickel is just worth less today than it was way
                         back then.

                         Considering the Discounted Cash Flow
                         Discounted cash-flow accounts for the time value of money. If you were to borrow
                         $100,000 for five years from your uncle, you'd be paying interest on the money, yes?
                         (If not, you've got a great uncle.) If the $100,000 were invested for five years and man-
                         aged to earn a whopping 6 percent interest per year, compounded annually, it'd be
                         worth $133,822.60 at the end of five years. This is the future value of the money in
                         today's terms.
                             The magic formula for future value is FV = PV(1 + I)n, where:

                              * FV is future value
                              * PV is present value
                              * I is the interest rate
                              * n is the number of periods (years, quarters, etc.)

                             Here's the formula with the $100,000 in action:

                              1. FV = 100,000(1 + .06)5

                                                                                        Chapter 4: Project Integration Management

                                                                                                                                137
                        2. FV = 100,000(1.338226)
                        3. FV = 133,822.60

                       The future value of the $100,000 five years from now is worth $133,822.60. So how
                   does that help? Now we've got to calculate the discounted cash-flow across all of the proj-
                   ects up for selection. The discounted cash-flow is really just the inverse of the preceding
                   formula. We're looking for the present value of future cash flows: PV = FV / (1 + I)n.




                                                                                                                                              PART II
                       In other words, if a project says it'll be earning the organization $160,000 in five
                   years, that's great, but what's $160,000 five years from now really worth today? This
                   puts the amount of the cash flow in perspective with what the projections are in today's
                   money. Let's plug it into the formula and find out (assuming the interest rate is still 6
                   percent):

                        1. PV = FV / (1 + I)n
                        2. PV = 160,000 / (1.338226)
                        3. PV = $119,561

                       So... $160,000 in five years is really only worth $119,561 today. If we had four dif-
                   ferent projects of varying time to completion, cost, and project cash inflows at comple-
                   tion, we'd calculate the present value and choose the project with the best present value
                   because it'll likely be the best investment for the organization.

                                EXAM TIP You should be able to look at the present value of two proposed
                                projects and make a decision as to which one should be green-lighted. The
                                project with the highest present value is the best choice if that's the only
                                factor you're presented with.

                   Calculating the Net Present Value
                   The net present value (NPV) is a somewhat complicated formula, but it allows you to
                   predict a project's value more precisely than the lump-sum approach found with the PV
                   formula. NPV evaluates the monies returned on a project for each period the project
                   lasts. In other words, a project may last five years, but there may be a return on invest-
                   ment (ROI) in each of the five years the project is in existence, not just at the end of the
                   project.
                       For example, a retail company may be upgrading the facilities at each of their stores
                   to make shopping and purchasing easier for their customers. The company has 1,000
                   stores. As each store makes the conversion to the new facility design, the project deliv-
                   erables will begin, hopefully, generating cash flow. (Uh, we specifically want cash in-
                   flow from the new stores, not cash outflow. That's some nerdy accounting humor.) The
                   project can begin earning money when the first store is completed with the conversion
                   to the new facilities. The faster the project can be completed, the sooner the organiza-
                   tion will see a complete ROI.

                             Here's how the NPV formula works:

                              1. Calculate the project's cash flow for time unit (typically quarters or years).
                              2. Calculate each time unit total into the present value.
                              3. Sum the present value of each time unit.
                              4. Subtract the investment for the project.
                              5. Take two aspirins.
                              6. Examine the NPV value. An NPV greater than zero is good, and the project
                                 should be approved. An NPV less than zero is bad, and the project should be
                                 rejected.

                            When comparing two projects, the one with the greater NPV is typically better, al-
                         though projects with high returns (PVs) early in the project are better than those with
                         low returns early in the project. Table 4-1 provides an example of an NPV calculation.

                                       EXAM TIP You likely will not have to calculate NPV for your CAPM or PMP
                                       exam. I've included the whole scenario here to provide an understanding of
                                       the formula. Basically, better than zero is good; less than zero means your
                                       project is losing money.

                         Considering the Internal Rate of Return
                         The last benefit measurement method is the internal rate of return (IRR). The IRR is a
                         complex formula to calculate when the present value of the cash inflow equals the
                         original investment. Don't get too lost in this formula--it's a tricky business, and you
                         won't need to know how to calculate the IRR for the exam. You will need to know,
                         however, that when comparing IRRs of multiple projects, projects with high IRRs are
                         better choices than projects with low IRRs. This makes sense. Would you like an invest-
                         ment with a high rate of return or a lower rate of return?
                             Organizations use the IRR to determine if the organization should invest capital
                         into the project. IRR is, technically, the yield on the funds invested into the project. You
                         really know that you have a good, efficient investment when the IRR beats other rates

                   of return for investing the capital in bonds, other projects, or even letting the cash stay
                   in the bank. Organizations usually have a minimum acceptable rate of return (MARR)
                   that the project needs to beat before it's even worth their time and cash to invest in the
                   project. You might also know MARR as the hurdle rate--you've got to clear the hurdle
                   before it's worth the risk of taking capital out of sure-thing investments and putting it
                   into the chancy world of projects.

                                EXAM TIP The formulas on the time value of money are important for
                                project selection and for the exam.You'll need to be familiar with the present
                                value, future value, and net present value formulas, what they do, and why
                                organizations use them to select projects.You should be topically familiar with
                                the internal rate of return concepts, but I doubt you'll have to calculate any IRR.

                   Knowing the Project Management Methodology
                   Before the project management team can dive in and create the project charter, they
                   also need to understand how their organization approaches project management in
                   general. When I teach my project management seminars, I find that some companies
                   have a formal, highly structured, rigid project management approach. Other companies
                   are, well, loosey-goosey. Their approach can vary from project manager to project man-
                   ager, and they don't mind.
                       Whatever methodology an organization has adopted, the project management
                   team must understand how this affects the level of detail they'll need to provide in their
                   project charter. The great thing about this point, in light of your exam, is that every
                   company in the world can use a different project management methodology, so it's
                   tough to ask questions about what's proper or not.

                   Creating the Charter--Finally
                   Now that the project management team is armed with all the inputs, has considered the
                   project selection methodology, and understands the project management methodology
                   in place in their organization, they're ready to create the project. There are just two tools
                   the project management team can use to create the charter:

                        * Expert judgment Experts within the organization or external experts such
                          as consultants, agencies, firms, or subject matter experts (SMEs) can help the
                          project management team create all the needed elements for the charter.
                        * Facilitation techniques You'll use facilitation techniques often in your role
                          as the project manager. These are approaches like brainstorming, problem
                          solving with stakeholders, conflict resolution, and group dynamics to reach a
                          consensus for the project charter.

                       The project charter, as a final reminder for your exam, is endorsed by an entity out-
                   side of the project boundaries. This person or entity has the power to authorize the
                   project and grant the project manager the power to assign resources to the project work.

                         The project charter should define the business needs and what the project aims to cre-
                         ate in order to solve those business needs. The project charter typically defines:

                              * Metrics for the key project objectives (like time, cost, and quality)
                              * High-level requirements for the project
                              * The high-level description of the project's purpose
                              * The high-level risk within the project
                              * The summary milestone schedule
                              * The summary budget
                              * Key stakeholders the project will include
                              * Stakeholders needed for approvals and sign-off on the project acceptance
                              * The project manager's name and level of authority
                              * The project sponsor or entity authorizing the project

                             Many organizations create a standardized project charter as part of their organiza-
                         tional process assets and then adapt the project charter to each project. Whatever ap-
                         proach you take in your project, from scratch or from template, the most important
                         thing is that the person who signs the project charter has the authority to back up the
                         project manager for conflict resolution and issues in case there's a challenge to the proj-
                         ect or the resources needed.


                         Developing the Project Management Plan
                         You wouldn't go about building a house, creating a new piece of software, or launching
                         any project without a project plan, right? The project management plan, however, is
                         more than how the work will be done, it's how the project will be done. That's right, the
                         project management plan defines how the project is executed, monitored and con-
                         trolled, and then closed. It's a plan on how to manage, coordinate, and integrate all the
                         different knowledge areas and processes within a project. It's multifaceted. Figure 4-2
                         shows the process necessary before the project management plan can be developed.
                         Think of all the things a project manager and the project team will decide within the
                         project plan that need to be documented:

                              * Which project management processes and their level of implementation are
                                appropriate for the project
                              * What tools and techniques will be used with which processes
                              * How the selected processes will be used to manage the project, including how
                                the processes will interact as the project moves through its phases
                              * How the project work will be completed
                              * How change control will happen

                         * When and how management will review the project performance


                   Creating the Project Management Plan
                   As the project completes project planning activities, the outputs will be assimilated into
                   a collection of subsidiary project plans. The collection of these subsidiary project plans
                   will address all of the previous points and help the project manager and the project
                   team know where the project is going and how they will get there. Let's take a moment
                   and look at each of the minimum project management subsidiary plans the project
                   management plan will include:

                         * Scope management plan This defines how the project scope will be
                           planned, managed, and controlled. This plan is covered in detail in Chapter 5.
                         * Requirements management plan This plan defines how the project
                           requirements will be defined, gathered, documented, and managed. This plan
                           is covered in detail in Chapter 5.
                         * Schedule management plan This defines how the project schedule will be
                           created and managed. The schedule management plan and its creation are
                           covered in Chapter 6.

                              * Cost management plan This plan details how the project costs will be
                                planned for, estimated, budgeted, and then monitored and controlled. Cost
                                management is described in Chapter 7.
                              * Quality management plan Quality is expected on every project. This plan
                                defines what quality means for the project, how the project will achieve
                                quality, and how the project will map to organizational procedures pertaining
                                to quality. Chapter 8 covers quality management in more detail.
                              * Process improvement plan Who wants an extra helping of waste in their
                                project? This plan aims to eliminate non-value-added activity, eliminate waste,
                                and determine how the project work, execution, and management can be
                                made better. This plan is covered in Chapter 8.
                              * Human resource plan This plan defines how project team members will be
                                brought onto the project team, managed, and released from the project team.
                                It also defines team training, safety issues, roles and responsibilities, and how
                                the project's reward and recognition system will operate. Chapter 9 defines the
                                human resource plan in detail.
                              * Communications management plan This plan defines who will get what
                                information, how they will receive it, and in what modality the communication
                                will take place. Chapter 10 explains communication in more detail.
                              * Risk management plan Risk is an uncertain event or condition that may
                                affect the project's outcome. The risk management plan defines how the
                                project will manage risk. Chapter 11 includes a conversation on this plan.
                              * Procurement management plan The procurement management plan,
                                defined in Chapter 12, controls how the project will be allowed to contract
                                goods and services.
                              * Stakeholder management plan The stakeholder management plan, defined
                                in Chapter 13, defines how stakeholders will be included, managed, and
                                prioritized for the project.

                             These subsidiary plans are directly related to the project management knowledge
                         areas. Each plan can be adapted from previous projects or templates within the com-
                         pany that the performing organization has created as part of its organizational process
                         assets. While the project management is, for the most part, a compilation of project
                         plans, additional plans and documents are included that you should know for your
                         CAPM or PMP certification:

                              * Change management plan This plan details the project procedures for
                                entertaining change requests, and how change requests are managed,
                                documented, approved, or declined. This plan is part of the control scope
                                process.
                              * Configuration management plan This plan is part of an input to the
                                control scope process. It defines how changes to the features and functions of
                                the project deliverable, the product scope, may enter the project.

                                                                                                                          143
                   * Staffing management plan This is a subsidiary plan of the human resource
                     management plan. It specifically addresses how the human resource
                     requirements will be met in the project. It can address internal staffing,
                     procurement of resources, or negotiations with other projects for shared
                     resources.
                   * Risk response plan This subsidiary plan defines the risk responses that are
                     to be used in the project for both positive and negative risks.




                                                                                                                                        PART II
                   * Milestone list This list details the project milestones and their attributes. It
                     is used for several areas of project planning, but also helps determine how
                     quickly the project may be achieving its objectives.
                   * Resource calendar Resources are people and things like equipment, rooms,
                     and other facilities. This calendar defines when the resources are available to
                     contribute to the project.
                   * Schedule baseline This is the planned start and finish of the project. The
                     comparison of what was planned and what was experienced is the schedule
                     variance.
                   * Cost baseline This is the aggregated costs of all of the work packages within
                     the work breakdown structure (WBS).
                   * Quality baseline This documents the quality objectives for the project,
                     including the metrics for stakeholder acceptance of the project deliverable.
                   * Scope baseline The scope baseline is a combination of three project
                     documents: the project scope statement, the work breakdown structure, and
                     the WBS dictionary. The creation of the project's deliverable will be measured
                     against the scope baseline to show any variances from what was expected and
                     what the project team has created.
                   * Risk register The risk register is a centralized database consisting of the
                     outcome of all the other risk management processes. Consider the outcome of
                     risk identification, qualitative analysis, and quantitative analysis.
                   * Issue log Issues are points of contention where some question of the
                     project's direction needs to be resolved. All identified issues are documented
                     in the issue log, along with an issue owner and a deadline to resolve the issue.
                     The outcome of the issue is also recorded.
                   * Assumption log An assumption is something that is believed to be true or
                     false, but it has not yet been proven to be true or false. Assumptions that
                     prove wrong can become risks for the project. All identified project
                     assumptions are recorded in the assumption log for testing and analysis, and
                     the outcomes are recorded.
                   * Change log All changes that enter into a project are recorded in the change
                     log. The characteristics of the change, such as the time, cost, risk, and scope
                     details, are also recorded.

                                       EXAM TIP You'll be seeing these documents throughout the remainder of
                                       this book. Basically, every knowledge area has one project management
                                       subsidiary plan, except for quality, which has two: the quality management plan
                                       and the process improvement plan.


                         Executing the Project Plan
                         So you've got a project plan--great! Now the work of executing the project plan begins.
                         The PMBOK process for this chunk of the project is to direct and manage the project
                         work. This is where the project manager manages the project and the project team does
                         the work. The project manager and the project team will go about completing the
                         promises made in the plan to deliver, document, measure, and complete the project
                         work. The project plan will communicate to the project team, the stakeholders, man-
                         agement, and even to the vendors what work happens next, how it begins, and how it
                         will be measured for quality and performance.

                                       NOTE You'll likely be using a project management information system, like
                                       Microsoft Project, Basecamp, or some other software to help you manage
                                       your project. For your exam you won't be tested on these products, but you'll
                                       need to know that a project management information system helps the
                                       project manager make decisions and track project progress.

                             The product of the project is created during these execution processes. The largest
                         percentage of the project budget will be spent now. The project manager and the project
                         team must work together to orchestrate the timing and integration of all the project's
                         moving parts. A flaw in one area of the execution can have ramifications in cost and
                         additional risk, and can cause additional flaws in other areas of the project.
                             As the project work is implemented, the project manager refers to the project plan
                         to ensure that the work is meeting the documented expectations, requirements, quality
                         demands, target dates, and more. The completion of the work is measured and then
                         compared against the cost, schedule, and scope baselines as documented in the project
                         plan. Should there be--gasp!--discrepancies between the project work and the base-
                         lines, prompt and accurate reactions are needed to adjust the slipping components of
                         the project. The execution of the project includes many activities:

                                                                                                                                             PART II
                        * Communicating with and managing the project stakeholders
                        * Gathering project data on cost, schedule, quality, and status to forecast where
                          the project will be in the future
                        * Collecting and creating the lessons learned documentation

                      Directing and managing the project work also requires the project management
                   team to respond to conditions within the project. Consider a new immediate risk that
                   demands a response. A new condition warrants that the project management team plan
                   and then directly confront the problem. Four activities coincide with executing the
                   project plan:

                       * Apply corrective actions to bring future project performance back into
                         alignment with the project plan.
                        * Apply preventive actions to avoid negative risks within the project.
                        * Apply defect repairs to fix flaws and problems identified through quality
                          control.
                        * Update the project management plan and execution as a result of change
                          requests within the project.


                   Monitoring and Controlling the Project Work
                   As soon as a project begins, the project management monitoring and controlling pro-
                   cesses also begin. These processes monitor all the other processes within the project to
                   ensure they are being done according to plan, according to the performing organiza-
                   tion's practices, and to ensure that a limited number of defects enters the project. The
                   monitoring and controlling process group has several key activities:

                       * Collecting project statistics
                        * Measuring project performance
                        * Distributing project information
                        * Analyzing project trends and measurements to improve the project
                        * Looking for new risks and managing known risks

                         Monitoring the Project
                         Monitoring and controlling the project is not a one-time or random event. It's impor-
                         tant for the project management team to continue to monitor the project and not to
                         assume that all's well simply because the project work is being completed. A constant
                         monitoring of the project confirms that the project work is being done properly and
                         that if the work is flawed, a response can be prepared. Monitoring and controlling is
                         also concerned with its results. For example, a defect repair review follows a defect re-
                         pair to ensure that the repair is accurate and that the project work may continue.
                             Monitoring and controlling the project work has eight activities:

                              * Comparing actual performance to what was promised in the project
                                management plan
                              * Determining if corrective and preventive actions should be applied to the
                                project
                              * Performing ongoing risk assessment, risk tracking, and analyzing the risk
                                responses and their effectiveness on the identified risks
                              * Maintaining a project information base on the project's product throughout
                                the project life cycle
                              * Providing information for status updates, progress measurement, and project
                                forecasting
                              * Forecasting cost and schedule information
                              * Monitoring the approved change requests as they are implemented into the
                                project and tracking the rejected change requests and their associated
                                documentation
                              * Reporting on the project to the program manager if the project is part of the
                                program


                                       NOTE Forecasting the project's performance on its cost and schedule is part
                                       of monitoring and controlling. In Chapter 7, we'll dive headfirst into earned
                                       value management and how it helps the project manager control the project
                                       and respond to cost and schedule variances and make forecasts about the
                                       likelihood of the project's success.

                         Managing Integrated Change Control
                         Project managers must protect the project scope from changes. Management, team
                         members, customers, and other stakeholders are going to want changes to the project
                         deliverables. Changes to the product often stem from the customer. Changes may also
                         stem from suggestions of the stakeholders--such as small, innocent changes that bloom
                         into additional time and costs. Finally, changes may come from the project team. When
                         it comes to integrated change control, the project manager must provide for:

                        * Identifying a change that is proposed or that has already occurred
                        * Influencing the stakeholders so that only approved changes are incorporated
                          into the project work
                        * Reviewing and, when needed and applicable, approving change requests
                        * Managing changes by regulating the flow of change requests
                        * Reflecting the approved changes in the project baselines: time, cost, scope, and




                                                                                                                                             PART II
                          quality
                        * Reviewing and approving corrective and preventive actions
                        * Considering the impact of a change request on the rest of the project, as well as
                          considering all of the knowledge areas and the impact of a change on each one
                        * Documenting the change request and the impact it may have on the project
                        * Communicating the change to the appropriate stakeholders
                        * Completing defect repair validation
                        * Continuing quality control


                               EXAM TIP Think of integrated change control as the domino effect. Any
                               proposed changes to the project can have serious impacts on other areas of
                               the project. Because of this, all of the project management knowledge areas
                               have to be evaluated with each project change.

                       When you're doing integrated change control, you might be working with the
                   change control board. This is a committee of executives, project stakeholders, and oth-
                   er experts who'll examine and evaluate the change and make a determination on how
                   the change should be managed. This management of the change includes approving,
                   rejecting, or postponing the change. Not all projects utilize a change control board, but
                   all projects should document the change control process and communicate how it'll
                   work in the project.

                   Reacting to Change
                   Every project needs a change control system to review, consider, track, and, if needed,
                   approve the change requests. Rejected change requests should also be tracked and doc-
                   umented. Most often, projects rely on a change control board (CCB) to evaluate the
                   worthiness of a proposed change before it is approved. Whatever approach a project
                   management team elects or is required to take when dealing with changes, the ap-
                   proach should be documented. The key stakeholders must all agree to abide by the
                   rules of the change control system before the project work begins. The project's change
                   management plan provides the governance for all changes in the project, the role of the
                   project manager and change requests, and how (and often when) the change control
                   board will review proposed changes.

                             When changes are approved, the project manager must then update the project
                         baselines, as changes will likely affect a combination of scope, cost, and time. The up-
                         dated baselines allow the project to continue with the new changes fleshed in and
                         provide for an accurate measurement of the project performance.
                             This is an important concept: update the project baselines. Consider a project to which
                         work has been added but for which the schedule baseline has not been updated. The
                         project end date will be sooner than is possible to meet, because the project baseline
                         does not reflect the additional work that should extend that date. In addition, a failure
                         to revise the project baseline could skew reporting, variances, future project decisions--
                         and even future projects.

                                       EXAM TIP Undocumented change requests should not be implemented into
                                       the project.

                             Consider a project manager who does not update the project baseline after a change.
                         The completion of the project goes into the archives and can serve as historical infor-
                         mation for future projects. The historical information is skewed because it does not
                         accurately account for the added work and the projected end date or budget. Note that
                         change requests do include any corrective or preventive actions, but these actions do
                         not justify changes to the project baselines. Basically, if you have an error in the project
                         and need corrective actions, you should also have a change request for that corrective
                         action, but the error doesn't justify a change to the cost and schedule baseline. Only
                         changes that are additions or reductions to the existing project scope can justify a
                         change to the performance baselines. In some cases, like with a really flawed time esti-
                         mate, the change control board may allow a rebaselining of the schedule, but usually
                         an error counts as a variance against the project performance.

                         Using the Project Management Information System
                         You already know that the PMIS is a software tool that helps the project management
                         team plan, execute, monitor and control, and then close the project. The PMIS, contrary
                         to what some managers want to believe, does not replace the project manager. Within
                         the PMIS are two important systems that you will need to know for your CAPM or PMP
                         exam and for the remainder of this book. Let's get these down now and be happy for
                         the next nine chapters.

                         The Configuration Management System
                         We all know that changes are likely to happen to the project scope. How these change
                         requests are submitted, reviewed, have their status tracked, and are approved are part of
                         the configuration management system. This system, established early in the project,
                         defines how stakeholders are allowed to submit change requests, the conditions for ap-
                         proving a change request, and how approved change requests are validated in the proj-
                         ect scope. Configuration management also is in charge of several activities:

                                                                                                                                                PART II
                   The Change Control System
                   You'll be hearing an awful lot about change control throughout the remainder of this
                   book. It's essential for a project to have an established change control system, or the
                   project will be riddled with change requests. The change control system (CCS) com-
                   municates the process for controlling changes to the project deliverables. This system
                   works with the configuration management system and seeks to control and document
                   proposals to the project's product. Figure 4-3 demonstrates an example of a change
                   control system.

                                NOTE I won't bash Microsoft Project--it's an excellent, excellent tool.
                                However, some managers believe that if you have Microsoft Project installed
                                on your PC, you should be able to manage a project without any flaws,
                                questions, or issues. Ha! That's like saying that just because you have Microsoft
                                Word installed, you should be able to write a novel. Project management is
                                more than a piece of software.

                         Configuration Identification
                         The configuration of the project's product or service must be accurately and completely
                         defined. This includes the labeling of the components, how changes are made to
                         the product, and the accountability of the changes. Specifically, accountability refers
                         to the ownership of the change, the cost of the change, the schedule impacts, and the
                         influence the product change has over the remainder of the product features and
                         components. For example, a change to add a basement to a new home construction
                         project would affect the project baselines, the configuration of the product, and, de-
                         pending on the project status when the change was approved, possibly other compo-
                         nents of the house.

                         Configuration Status Accounting
                         Configuration management also includes the documentation of the product informa-
                         tion so that the project management team can quickly and effectively manage the prod-
                         uct. This process means organization of the product materials, details, and prior docu-
                         mentation. For example, a new home construction project would have blueprints, per-
                         mits, field drawings, vendor and customer specifications, and more information that
                         needs to be cataloged, managed, and quickly accessed throughout the project.

                         Configuration Verification and Auditing
                         Configuration management is concerned with the performance and functional attri-
                         butes of the product. In the new home construction project, the role of configuration
                         management is to ensure that the new home is built according to the configuration
                         documentation. Variances between what was completed and what was planned would
                         have to be reviewed and responded to via defect repair or corrective actions.


                         Closing the Project or Phase
                         Every project manager that I know loves to close a project. There's something rewarding
                         about completing a project and then transferring the deliverable to the customer or
                         project user. I've also learned from participant feedback in my PMP Boot Camp semi-
                         nars that this topic is the category where they missed the most questions on their way
                         to their PMP or CAPM certification. I believe it's because folks have a tendency to study
                         in the order of the process groups: initiation, planning, executing, monitoring and con-
                         trolling, and then (finally) closing. I imagine they're winded by the time their studying
                         efforts get to closing. With that in mind, give yourself a stretch, another sip of coffee,
                         and really home in on this closing discussion. I want you to pass your exam!
                              The closing process group may be applied to the end of a project or to the end of
                         the project phase in a multiphased project. Closing the project or phase means that the
                         project manager confirms that all of the needed activities within the other process
                         groups have been completed and that the project deliverables have been handed over
                         to the customer. If a project is terminated for any reason, the project manager should
                         still close out the project to account for the work that has been performed on the proj-
                         ect and to learn why the project may have failed.

                                                                                                                                 151
                                NOTE Projects can be moving along swimmingly and still get terminated.
                                Consider an organization's cash flow, the project's priority, or that the project
                                deliverable may not be needed any longer. Just because a project was canceled
                                doesn't always mean the project was a failure.

                   Completing Closure




                                                                                                                                               PART II
                   This is the guts of the closing process group. First, the project manager documents ev-
                   eryone who is involved in the project closure: team members, vendors, management,
                   the sponsor, and often the project customer. Part of this documentation defines each
                   person's role and related responsibility to close out the project. Consider a large con-
                   struction project. Lots of people are involved in the formal closing proceedings, so
                   documentation explaining who'll be needed, what they'll be doing, and when they'll be
                   doing it makes great sense for the project manager.
                       The second part of closure collects all of the project records, the lessons learned,
                   and communications for the project archives. Yes, archives. All project information
                   should be archived--this becomes part of the organizational process assets. Project and
                   phase closure includes the examination and analysis of the project records and deter-
                   mines the success or failure of the project, as well as why the project succeeded or
                   failed. This information helps future project managers, or if it's a phase that's being
                   closed, allows the project manager to make corrective actions for the remainder of the
                   project.
                       Part of project closure is to analyze the success of the project. One of the most com-
                   mon approaches is regression analysis. It's a mathematical model to examine the rela-
                   tionship among project variables, like cost, time, labor, and other project metrics.
                   Regression analysis can use a scatter diagram to help visualize the correlation between
                   the dependent variable, like the project's budget, against the independent variables, like
                   errors in the project, changes to the project, and any delays stakeholders may have
                   caused to the project. This helps to identify trends, especially in phases, and helps pre-
                   pare for future projects and other phases yet to begin within the project.
                       The goal of project closure is to get formal acceptance of the project deliverables.
                   Formal acceptance means that the project customer or sponsor agrees that the deliverable
                   provided is in alignment with the project scope and that it is acceptable. A formal
                   documentation of project acceptance, such as a project certificate of closure or a project
                   closure sign-off, is needed to confirm that the project deliverable has been transferred
                   from the project manager to the recipient of the project.

                   Completing Contract Closure
                   Vendors like to get paid, but the project manager must confirm that everything the ven-
                   dor promised has been delivered according to the contract between the vendor and the
                   project manager's organization. Contract closure documents the completed contract
                   and its outputs. This information is also stored as part of the project archives.

                             Above any other conversation, e-mail, or promises, the details of the project con-
                         tract are paramount. The project manager consults the contract not only to confirm that
                         the vendor has lived up to its obligations, but also to confirm that the project manager's
                         organization has held up its part of the bargain. Sometimes, and they are not fun times,
                         the vendor didn't live up to the agreement and the contract was canceled. Contracts can
                         be canceled for any number of reasons: poor performance, schedule and/or cost over-
                         runs, quality issues, and more. Whatever the reason, the documentation surrounding
                         the cancellation of the contract is included as part of the contract closure, and this in-
                         formation is also included in the project archives for future reference.


                         Chapter Summary
                         Project integration management is an ongoing process the project manager completes
                         to ensure that the project moves from initiation to closure. It is the gears, guts, and
                         grind of project management--the day-in, day-out business of completing the project
                         work. Project integration management coordinates the activities, project resources, con-
                         straints, and assumptions of the project plans and massages them into a working mod-
                         el. Once the model exists, it's up to the project management team to monitor and
                         control the project from initiation to closure, and to ensure that everything goes accord-
                         ing to plan. And if it doesn't, to fix it.
                             Of course, project integration management isn't an automatic process. It requires
                         you, the project manager, to negotiate, finesse, and adapt to project circumstances. It
                         relies on general business skills (such as leadership), organizational skills, and com-
                         munication to get all the parts of the project working together. Project integration man-
                         agement has six events:

                              * Developing the project charter The project charter authorizes the project.
                                It names the project manager and allows the project to commence. Projects
                                are chartered for varying reasons: market demand, customer requests, to solve
                                a problem, or even to address a social need. While the charter authorizes
                                the project, it also defines the requirements for stakeholder satisfaction, the
                                project purpose, and the project assumptions and constraints.
                              * Developing the project management plan Project management plan
                                development is an iterative process that requires input from the project
                                manager, the project team, the project customers, and other key stakeholders.
                                It details how the project work will accomplish the project goals. The project
                                comprises 11 subsidiary plans and several other documents.
                              * Directing and managing the project work Once the project management
                                plan has been created, the project manager and the project team can
                                implement the plan. Directing and managing the project work creates the
                                project deliverables for the project or phase. Corrective actions, preventive
                                actions, and defect repair all happen through directing and managing the
                                project work

                                                                                                                               153
                        * Monitoring and controlling the project work This process starts with the
                          project's conception and finishes with the project completion. Its goal is to
                          make certain that the project stays on track and finishes according to the
                          project plan. Measurements for project performance, time, cost, and quality
                          are implemented. If there are variances, responses to these will happen
                          through preventive, corrective, or defect repair actions.
                        * Performing integrated change control Changes can kill a project. Change




                                                                                                                                             PART II
                          requests must be documented and sent through a formal change control
                          system to determine their worthiness for implementation. Integrated change
                          control manages changes across the entire project. Change requests are
                          evaluated and considered for impacts on risk, costs, schedule, and scope. Not
                          all change requests are approved--but all change requests must be
                          documented and reviewed.
                        * Closing the project or phase Projects and phases are closed. Administrative
                          closure confirms that all of the needed processes for each process group have
                          been completed. Administrative closure also gathers all project records for
                          archival purposes, including documentation of the project's success or failure.
                          Contracts, when used, must also be closed after inspection of the contract
                          deliverables. Contracts are always closed according to the agreed-upon terms.

                   Key Terms
                   Assumption log An assumption is something that is believed to be true or false, but
                   it has not yet been proven to be true or false. Assumptions that prove wrong can be-
                   come risks for the project. All identified project assumptions are recorded in the as-
                   sumption log for testing and analysis, and the outcomes are recorded.
                   Benefit/cost ratio (BCR) models This is an example of a benefits comparison model.
                   It examines the benefit-to-cost ratio.
                   Change control board (CCB) A committee that evaluates the worthiness of a pro-
                   posed change and either approves or rejects the proposed change.
                   Change control system (CCS) The change control system communicates the process
                   for controlling changes to the project deliverables. This system works with the configu-
                   ration management system and seeks to control and document proposals to change the
                   project's product.
                   Change log All changes that enter into a project are recorded in the change log. The
                   characteristics of the change, such as the time, cost, risk, and scope details, are also
                   recorded.
                   Change management plan This plan details the project procedures for entertaining
                   change requests: how change requests are managed, documented, approved, or declined.

                         Closure processes This final process group of the project management life cycle is
                         responsible for closing the project phase or project. This is where project documenta-
                         tion is archived and project contracts are also closed.
                         Communications management plan This plan defines who will get what informa-
                         tion, how they will receive it, and in what modality the communication will take
                         place.
                         Configuration identification This includes the labeling of the components, how
                         changes are made to the product, and the accountability of the changes.
                         Configuration management plan This plan is an input to the control scope process.
                         It defines how changes to the features and functions of the project deliverable, the
                         product scope, may enter the project.
                         Configuration management system This system defines how stakeholders are al-
                         lowed to submit change requests, the conditions for approving a change request, and
                         how approved change requests are validated in the project scope. Configuration man-
                         agement also documents the characteristics and functions of the project's products and
                         any changes to a product's characteristics.
                         Configuration status accounting The organization of the product materials, details,
                         and prior product documentation.
                         Configuration verification and auditing The scope verification and completeness
                         auditing of project or phase deliverables to ensure that they are in alignment with the
                         project plan.
                         Contract closure The formal verification of the contract completeness by the vendor
                         and the performing organization.
                         Cost baseline This is the aggregated costs of all of the work packages within the work
                         breakdown structure (WBS).
                         Cost management plan This plan details how the project costs will be planned for,
                         estimated, budgeted, and then monitored and controlled.
                         Enterprise environmental factors The culture, structure, standards, regulations, orga-
                         nizational logistics, and other organizational characteristics that influence how a proj-
                         ect operates.
                         Future value A benefit comparison model to determine a future value of money. The
                         formula to calculate future value is FV = PV(1 + I)n, where PV is present value, I is the
                         given interest rate, and n is the number of periods.
                         Human resource plan This plan defines how project team members will be brought
                         onto the project team, managed, and released from the project team. It also defines
                         team training, safety issues, roles and responsibilities, and how the project's reward and
                         recognition system will operate. Chapter 9 defines the human resource plan in detail.

                                                                                                                                155
                   Integrated change control A process to consider and control the impact of a pro-
                   posed change on the project's knowledge areas.
                   Issue log Issues are points of contention where some question of the project's direc-
                   tion needs to be resolved. All identified issues are documented in the issue log, along
                   with an issue owner and a deadline to resolve the issue. The outcome of the issue is also
                   recorded.
                   Mathematical model A project selection method to determine the likelihood of suc-




                                                                                                                                              PART II
                   cess. These models include linear programming, nonlinear programming, dynamic
                   programming, integer programming, and multiobjective programming.
                   Milestone Milestones are significant points or events in the project's progress that
                   represent accomplishment in the project. Projects usually create milestones as the re-
                   sult of completing phases within the project.
                   Milestone list This list details the project milestones and their attributes. It is used for
                   several areas of project planning, but also helps determine how quickly the project may
                   be achieving its objectives.
                   Murder boards These are committees that ask every conceivable negative question
                   about the proposed project. Their goals are to expose the project's strengths and weak-
                   nesses, and to kill the project if it's deemed unworthy for the organization to commit
                   to. Also known as project steering committees or project selection committees.
                   Net present value     Evaluates the monies returned on a project for each period the
                   project lasts.
                   Organizational process assets Anything that an organization has to help a current
                   project succeed. Policies, procedures, documentation of past projects, and plans are
                   part of the organizational process assets.
                   Payback period An estimate to predict how long it will take a project to pay back an
                   organization for the project's investment of capital.
                   Present value A benefit comparison model to determine the present value of a future
                   amount of money. The formula to calculate present value is PV = FV / (1 + I)n, where
                   FV is future value, I is the given interest rate, and n is the number of periods.
                   Process improvement plan This plan aims to eliminate non-value-added activity,
                   eliminate waste, and determine how the project work, execution, and management can
                   be made better.
                   Procurement management plan The procurement management plan controls how
                   the project will acquire goods and services.
                   Project charter This document authorizes the project. It defines the initial require-
                   ments of the project stakeholders. The project charter is endorsed by an entity outside
                   of the project boundaries.

                         Project management plan The documented approach of how a project will be
                         planned, executed, monitored and controlled, and then closed. This document is a col-
                         lection of subsidiary management plans and related documents.
                         Project scope management plan             Defines how the project scope will be planned,
                         managed, and controlled.
                         Project statement of work (SOW) This document defines all the products and ser-
                         vices the project will provide.
                         Quality baseline Documents the quality objectives for the project, including the met-
                         rics for stakeholder acceptance of the project deliverable.
                         Quality management plan This plan defines what quality means for the project, how
                         the project will achieve quality, and how the project will map to organizational proce-
                         dures pertaining to quality.
                         Regression analysis A mathematical model to examine the relationship among proj-
                         ect variables, like cost, time, labor, and other project metrics.
                         Risk management plan Risk is an uncertain event or condition that may affect the
                         project outcome. The risk management plan defines how the project will manage risk.
                         Risk register The risk register is a centralized database consisting of the outcome of
                         all the other risk management processes, such as the outcome of risk identification,
                         qualitative analysis, and quantitative analysis.
                         Risk response plan This subsidiary plan defines the risk responses that are to be used
                         in the project for both positive and negative risks.
                         Schedule baseline This is the planned start and finish of the project. The comparison
                         of what was planned and what was experienced is the schedule variance.
                         Schedule management plan            Defines how the project schedule will be created and
                         managed.
                         Scope baseline The scope baseline is a combination of three project documents: the
                         project scope statement, the work breakdown structure, and the WBS dictionary. The
                         creation of the project deliverable will be measured against the scope baseline to show
                         any variances from what was expected and what the project team has created.
                         Scoring models These models use a common set of values for all of the projects up
                         for selection. For example, values can be profitability, complexity, customer demand,
                         and so on.
                         Staffing management plan This is a component of the human resource management
                         plan. It specifically addresses how the human resource requirements will be met in the
                         project. It can address internal staffing, procurement of resources, or negotiations with
                         other projects for shared resources.

                   Questions
                      1. You are the project manager for a pharmaceutical company. You are currently
                         working on a project for a new drug your company is creating. A recent
                         change in a law governing drug testing will impact your project and change
                         your project scope. The first thing you should do as project manager is:
                         A. Create a documented change request.




                                                                                                                                           PART II
                         B. Proceed as planned since the project will be grandfathered beyond the
                            new change in the law.
                         C. Consult with the project stakeholders.
                        D. Stop all project work until the issue is resolved.

                         A. Create a documented change request.
                         B. Proceed as planned since the project will be grandfathered beyond the
                            new change in the law.
                         C. Consult with the project stakeholders.
                         D. Stop all project work until the issue is resolved.
                         A. Change requests should first be documented in the project's change control
                         system. B is incorrect because the new law will require changes to the project.
                         C is incorrect because it may be inappropriate to consult with the project
                         stakeholders, especially on a large project. D is incorrect because we do not
                         know the impact of the change, and it may not justify halting the project work.
                      2. You are the project manager for the HALO Project. You and your project team
                         are preparing the project plan. Of the following, which one is a project plan
                         development constraint you and your team must consider?
                         A. The budget as assigned by management

                                  B. Project plans from similar projects
                                  C. Project plans from similar projects that have failed
                                  D. Interviews with SMEs who have experience with the project work in your
                                     project plan
                                 A. A predetermined budget set by management is an example of a project
                                 constraint. B and C are examples of organizational process assets that the
                                 project manager will use as inputs to project management planning. D,
                                 interviews with subject matter experts, is an example of expert judgment, and
                                 is a tool and technique used in project management plan development.
                              3. You are the project manager of a new project to develop a new software
                                 product. Management has not required a formal project management plan in
                                 the past, but they'd like you to develop a project management plan to serve
                                 as a model or template for all other projects in the organization. The primary
                                 purpose of your project management plan is:
                                  A. To define the work to be completed to reach the project end date.
                                  B. To define the work needed in each phase of the project life cycle.
                                  C. To prevent any changes to the scope.
                                  D. To provide accurate communication for the project team, project sponsor,
                                     and stakeholders regarding how the project will be executed, controlled, and
                                     closed.
                                 D. The primary purpose of the project management plan is to define how the
                                 project will proceed. A and B are incorrect because these address only the
                                 project work. C is incorrect because this answer only addresses the project's
                                 change control system.
                              4. Of the following, which one is an input to project plan development?
                                  A. Assumptions
                                  B. Outputs from other project management processes
                                  C. Earned value management
                                  D. Business needs
                                 B. The outputs from other project management processes need to be
                                 identified as part of the planning process. The project management processes
                                 are the 47 processes described in Chapter 3 and throughout the remainder of
                                 this book. Because the development of the project management plan is an
                                 iterative activity, the outputs of the project management processes can affect
                                 your project management planning. A, C, and D are incorrect because these
                                 are not inputs to the project plan development processes. There are four
                                 inputs to developing your project management plan: the project charter,
                                 outputs from other processes, enterprise environmental factors, and
                                 organizational process assets.

                                                                                                                          163
                   5. Robert is the project manager of the HBQ Project. This project requires all
                      of the telephones in the organization to be removed and replaced with an
                      Internet phone. He's learned that the removal of some of the phones has
                      damaged the walls in the office building and they will need to be repaired.
                      This project has a deadline and little time for repairing errors that weren't
                      anticipated. Based on this information, which one of the following is the best
                      example of defect repair review?




                                                                                                                                        PART II
                      A. Adding labor to a project to reduce errors during the installation of
                         hardware
                      B. Retraining the project team on how to install a new material so that all
                         future work with the new materials is done correctly
                      C. Repairing an incorrectly installed door in a new home construction project
                     D. Inspecting work that has been corrected because it was done incorrectly
                        the first time
                     D. Defect repair review is a review of the defect repair. Even though the
                     project may be on a deadline, Robert's project team will still need to repair
                     the walls and confirm the repair is acceptable. A is an example of a preventive
                     action. B is an example of a corrective action. C is an example of defect repair.
                   6. You are the project manager of the NHG Project. You have had to terminate a
                      contract with a vendor. What is this an example of?
                      A. A special case of contract closure
                      B. Mitigation
                      C. A contract claim
                     D. Scope closure
                     A. Terminating a contract with a vendor is a special case of contract closure. B,
                     C, and D are not appropriate answers for this question because mitigation is a
                     risk response, a contract claim is a disagreement between the buyer and seller,
                     and scope closure describes the completion of the project scope activities.
                   7. The project plan provides a baseline for several things. Which one of the
                      following does the project plan NOT provide a baseline for?
                      A. Scope
                      B. Cost
                      C. Schedule
                     D. Control
                     D. The project management plan provides baselines for the schedule, cost,
                     and scope. Control is a project activity and part of the monitoring and
                     controlling process group. A, B, and C are all incorrect because scope, cost,
                     and schedule do have associated baselines. Recall that a baseline is what's




04-ch04.indd 163                                                                                                           7/10/2013 1:36:54 AM

                                 predicted and the actuals are the experiences of the project. The difference
                                 between the baseline and what actually happened reveals the variances of the
                                 project.
                              8. You are the project manager for your organization. When it comes to
                                 integrated change control, you must ensure that which one of the following is
                                 present?
                                  A. Supporting detail for the change
                                  B. Approval of the change from the project team
                                  C. Approval of the change from a subject matter expert
                                  D. Risk assessment for each proposed change
                                 A. Integrated change control requires detail for implementing the change.
                                 Without evidence of the need for the change, there is no reason to implement
                                 it. B is incorrect because the project team does not approve change requests. C
                                 is incorrect because a subject matter expert is not always needed for a
                                 requested change. D is incorrect because risk assessment for a proposed
                                 change is not always needed. The change could be rejected or approved for
                                 other reasons besides the potential of risk events.
                              9. Keisha is the project manager for her organization and she's working with
                                 her project team to develop the project management plan for a new project.
                                 The project team is confused about the change management plan and how it
                                 governs changes within the project. The project plan provides what in regard
                                 to project changes?
                                  A. A methodology to approve or decline changes
                                  B. A guide to all future project risk management decisions
                                  C. A vision of the project deliverables
                                  D. A fluid document that may be updated as needed based on the CCB
                                 A. The project management plan defines how changes will be monitored and
                                 controlled. B describes the risk management plan. C defines the project
                                 charter and project scope. D is an incorrect statement.
                             10. You are assisting the project manager for the DGF Project. This project is
                                 to design and implement a new application that will connect to a database
                                 server. Management has requested that you create a method to document
                                 technical direction on the project and any changes or enhancements
                                 to the technical attributes of the project deliverable. Which one of the
                                 following would satisfy management's request?
                                  A. The configuration management system
                                  B. Integrated change control
                                  C. Scope control
                                  D. The change management plan




04-ch04.indd 164                                                                                                                 7/10/2013 1:36:54 AM

                                                                                    Chapter 4: Project Integration Management

                                                                                                                            165
                       A. The configuration management system documents all functional physical
                       characteristics of the project's product. It also controls changes to the project's
                       product. B, C, and D are not correct answers.
                   11. You are a project manager of a project that is part of a program. There has
                       been some conflict among the project team about who assigns activities and
                       directs the project execution. In this scenario, who directs the performance of
                       the planned project activities?




                                                                                                                                          PART II
                       A. The project manager and the project management team
                       B. The project team
                       C. The project sponsor
                       D. The program manager
                       A. The project manager and the project management team direct the
                       performance of the project activities. In a program, the program manager
                       assigns the project manager authority over the project resources and
                       authorizes the project manager to direct the project work. B, C, and D, the
                       project team, sponsor, and the program manager, do not direct performance.
                   12. You have just informed your project team that each team member will be
                       contributing to the lessons learned documentation. Your team does not
                       understand this approach and wants to know what the documentation will be
                       used for. Which one of the following best describes the purpose of the lessons
                       learned documentation?
                       A. Offers proof of concept for management
                       B. Offers historical information for future projects
                       C. Offers evidence of project progression as reported by the project team
                       D. Offers input to team member evaluations at the project's conclusion
                       B. Lessons learned documentation serves as part of organizational process
                       assets for future projects. A, the proof of concept, is not a PMI theme. C,
                       project progress, is reported through status reports and performance
                       measurements. D is incorrect because team member evaluations are based on
                       performance, not lessons learned.
                   13. Fred is the project manager of a bridge construction project. His organization
                       and the city inspectors both have an interest in the success and overall
                       performance of the project and have asked Fred to identify the approach he'll
                       use to measure and report project performance. Which one of the following
                       measures project performance?
                       A. WBS
                       B. The project plan
                       C. The earned value technique
                       D. The work authorization system

                                 C. The earned value technique, commonly called earned value management
                                 (EVM), measures project performance on several factors, including cost and
                                 schedule. A, the WBS, is a breakdown of the project scope. B, the project plan,
                                 defines how the project will be controlled, executed, and closed. D, the work
                                 authorization, allows work to progress within a project.
                             14. Configuration management is a process for applying technical and
                                 administrative direction and surveillance of the project implementation.
                                 Which activity is not included in configuration management?
                                  A. Controlling changes to the project deliverables
                                  B. A method to communicate changes to stakeholders
                                  C. Automatic change request approvals
                                  D. Identification of the functional and physical attributes of the project
                                     deliverables
                                 C. Change requests should not be automatically approved. All documented
                                 change requests should flow through the change control system, be evaluated,
                                 and then a decision should be made. A, B, and D are all part of configuration
                                 management.
                             15. The project manager can help write the project charter, but is not the person
                                 signing the project charter. Regardless of who actually writes the charter there
                                 are several elements that should be included in the document. All of the
                                 following are addressed in the project charter, except for which one?
                                  A. Requirements to satisfy the project customer, project sponsor, and other
                                     stakeholders
                                  B. Assigned project management and level of authority
                                  C. Summary budget
                                  D. Risk responses
                                 D. Risk responses are not addressed in the project charter. High-level risks
                                 may be identified, but the responses to those risks are not included in the
                                 project charter. These responses will be documented in the project's risk
                                 response plan. B, the project manager, C, the summary budget, and A, the
                                 requirements to satisfy the project customer, are defined in the charter.
                             16. Terri's organization is moving through the process of selecting one of several
                                 projects. Her organization utilizes mathematical models to determine the
                                 projects that should be initiated. Which one of the following is an example of
                                 a mathematical model used to select projects for selection?
                                  A. Future value
                                  B. Linear programming
                                  C. Present value
                                  D. Benefits/cost ratio

                                                                                   Chapter 4: Project Integration Management

                                                                                                                           167
                       B. Linear programming is an example of a mathematical model that can be
                       used for project selection. Recall that mathematical models are also known as
                       constrained optimization. A, future value, C, present value, and D, the
                       benefit/cost ratio, are all examples of the benefits comparison model.
                   17. You and the project management team are creating a project statement of
                       work. As part of this activity, which one of the following should be referenced
                       in the project statement of work document?




                                                                                                                                         PART II
                       A. Risk responses
                       B. Organizational process assets
                       C. The initial work breakdown structure
                       D. A reference to the strategic plan
                       D. The project statement of work should reference or include the business
                       that justified the project, the product scope description that defines the
                       product the project will create, and the strategic plan for the organization. A,
                       risk responses, is not a valid answer because risk responses are not needed in
                       the project statement of work. Organizational process assets are not included
                       in the project statement of work, so B is incorrect, too. C, the initial work
                       breakdown structure, is also not part of the project scope statement.
                   18. The project management plan has several purposes and all projects should
                       have a plan. What is the purpose of the project management plan?
                       A. It defines the project manager and their level of authority on the project.
                       B. It authorizes the project manager to assign resources to the project work.
                       C. It defines how the project will be planned and executed.
                       D. It defines how the project will be executed, monitored and controlled, and
                          then closed.
                       D. The project management plan communicates how the project will be
                       executed, monitored and controlled, and then closed. A and B both describe
                       components of the project charter. C does not answer the question as
                       completely as D.
                   19. The project steering committee is considering which project they should
                       invest capital in. Mary's project promises to be worth $175,000 in four years.
                       The project steering committee is interested in Mary's project, but they would
                       like to know the present value of the return if the interest rate is 6 percent.
                       What is the present value of Mary's project?
                       A. $175,000
                       B. $139,000
                       C. $220,000
                       D. $43,750




04-ch04.indd 167                                                                                                            7/10/2013 1:36:54 AM

              168
                                 B. $139,000 is the present value of Mary's project. This is found through the
                                 following formula: PV = FV / (1 + I)n, which is future value divided by one
                                 plus the interest rate to the power of the periods the project will last. This
                                 question would read ($175,000)/(1.26) because the interest rate provided
                                 was 6 percent. A, C, and D are all incorrect calculations.
                             20. You are the project manager for your organization. A change has recently been
                                 approved by your organization's change control board. You need to update
                                 the scope baseline and what other document?
                                  A. The cost baseline
                                  B. The quality baseline
                                  C. The risk management plan
                                  D. The change log
                                 D. When a change enters the project, the change log must be updated to
                                 reflect the change. The question did not indicate that new costs or risks will
                                 be entering the project, so these choices, A and C, are incorrect. The quality
                                 baseline, B, is not a valid answer because quality is a reflection of the
                                 completion of the project scope.

                     In this chapter, you will
                        * Plan project scope management
                        * Collect project requirements
                        * Create the project scope statement

                        * Control the project scope




                   You're the project manager of a large, complex project. Everyone agrees that the project
                   must be completed within one year, the budget is tight, and there's little room for error.
                   One of your project team members, Tony, has taken it upon himself to incorporate "ex-
                   tras" into the project deliverable to make it snappier, better, and easier for the product
                   customer to use. While his project additions are clever, they aren't in the project scope.

                       Tony argues that his creative additions don't cost the project anything extra and the
                   customer will love what he's come up with. The trouble for you, the customer, and
                   Tony, is that the time he's spent changing the scope should have been spent doing the
                   things that are in the scope. In addition, the extras weren't managed and reviewed as
                   change requests, and will likely be a surprise to the project customer. Not to mention
                   the added risks, potential for defect, and the contempt shown for an established change
                   control system.

                        Managing the project scope, according to the PMBOK Guide, is the project manag-
                   er's job and ensures that all of the required work--and only the required work--is done
                   to complete the project successfully. Project scope management doesn't permit Tony's,
                   or anyone else's, additions. Scope management is agreeing on what's in the scope and
                   then defending that agreement.

                         Plan the Project Scope Management
                         One of the first things you'll have to achieve in your role as the project manager of a new
                         project is to define the project's scope management plan. Now, your organization may
                         rely on organizational process assets in the form of a template for all projects, but it's
                         possible that you'll be creating this scope management plan from scratch. In this section,
                         you'll learn both approaches that you can apply to your projects and your PMI exam.
                             This process is all about creating the scope management plan and the requirements
                         management plan. These are two subsidiary plans for the overall project management
                         plan that you'll assemble and never touch again. Kidding! Because these are planning
                         processes, chances are you'll be editing these plans as you move through planning over
                         and over. The point is that these two plans shape your approach to how you'll define and
                         control both the project's scope and the project's requirements.
                             In order to begin this process, you'll need the information already gathered and
                         included in the project charter. That's right--the project charter. You'll use the charter
                         because it's the launching point of the project and already maps out the high-level re-
                         quirements and vision for the project. The project charter sets the direction for the
                         project, while the scope management plan and the requirements management plan
                         define how the project will achieve those objectives.

                         Creating the Project Scope Management Plan
                         Once the project moves from the initiating processes into planning, one of the first plans
                         to be created is the project scope management plan. This plan defines the following:

                              * How the project scope will be defined
                              * How the detailed project scope statement will be created
                              * How the work breakdown structure will be created
                              * How scope validation will be performed at the end of each phase and at the
                                end of the project
                              * How the project scope will be controlled

                              The project scope management plan is based first on the details of the project char-
                         ter. Recall that the project charter authorizes the project within an organization and
                         defines the general project boundaries and goals. When the project management team
                         is ready to begin creating the project scope management plan, they'll actually rely on
                         four things as inputs to this project management process:

                              * Enterprise environmental factors
                              * Organizational process assets
                              * The project charter
                              * The project management plan

                                                                                            Chapter 5: Managing the Project Scope

                                                                                                                                171
                       The project management team can use expert judgment to help them analyze these
                   four inputs to create the best project scope management plan. Don't get too hyped over
                   expert judgment. You'll see this term throughout the PMBOK and this book. Expert judg-
                   ment is just an approach that uses people such as experts and consultants (assuming
                   they're truly experts--wink, wink) who have exceptional knowledge about the product
                   the project will be creating. For example, in the skyscraper project, expert judgment
                   could be world-renowned architects, city planners, union representatives, and more.




                                                                                                                                              PART II
                       The project management team can also use templates, forms, and standards as part
                   of the process to create the project scope management plan. If an organization is com-
                   pleting the same type of project over and over, there's no real benefit to starting from
                   scratch each time. Instead, they'll logically use previous projects' plans, forms, work
                   breakdown structures (WBSs), and more as part of the current planning. These are col-
                   lectively referred to as organizational process assets.
                       You now know that the project scope management plan will be used to define,
                   validate, manage, and control the project scope. There are four more juicy facts you
                   need to know about this hefty plan:

                        * The project scope management plan defines how the official project scope
                          statement will be defined based on the project charter.
                        * The project scope management plan defines how the work breakdown
                          structure will be created, controlled, and approved. We'll talk about the WBS
                          in more detail later in this chapter.
                        * The plan documents the process for scope validation. To clarify, scope
                          validation is the inspection of the project deliverables by the project customer.
                          The goal of scope validation is to validate that the deliverables are in
                          alignment with the project goals and then are formally accepted.
                        * The project scope management plan documents and defines how changes to
                          the project scope will be managed and controlled. This is linked to our
                          conversation in Chapter 4 on integrated change control. As a refresher,
                          integrated change control acknowledges that a change in one knowledge area
                          can affect any of the other knowledge areas.

                       The project scope management plan is a subsidiary of the project management
                   plan. This plan sets the tone for the remainder of the project. As you may have already
                   guessed, the larger the project, the more important this plan is. As a general rule, larger
                   projects require more detail.
                       The scope management plan can rely heavily on organizational process assets and
                   enterprise environmental factors. From organizational process assets, you can call on
                   the policies and procedures that you must follow as a project manager in your organiza-
                   tion. From the enterprise environmental factors, you'll allow the organization's culture,
                   organizational structure, project team administration rules, and the overall marketplace
                   conditions to influence your planning and development. The marketplace conditions
                   are especially important if you're a vendor completing a project for someone else. When

                         you're a vendor, the relationship is different than if you're a project manager complet-
                         ing a project right inside your organization.
                             The primary tool and technique for creating the scope management plan is plan-
                         ning--and this means meetings. Every project manager loves meetings and you'll have
                         lots of these in order to shape this plan. You'll call on the project sponsor, in some
                         cases the project team (assuming they've been selected), key stakeholders that can help
                         with the processes, and any other experts. "Any other experts" means that you might be
                         calling on the program manager if this project takes place within a program, other proj-
                         ect managers who can help with the drafting of the plan, and even consultants.

                         Creating the Requirements Management Plan
                         The second plan that comes out of this process is the requirements management plan.
                         While similar in nature, this plan explains how the project will collect, analyze, record,
                         and manage the requirements throughout the project. Like the scope management
                         plan, this plan doesn't list the actual requirements, but sets the rules for how the project
                         manager, team, and stakeholders will interact with the project's requirements. This plan
                         is also a subsidiary plan for the overall project management plan.
                              This plan can be based on a template, just like the scope management plan can be,
                         but you can tailor it to your project as needed. The elements of this plan include:

                              * The process for planning, tracking, and recording all of the project
                                requirements
                              * Configuration management activities for the product (changing the product,
                                specs for the product scope, and who can approve any changes to the product)
                              * The process for analyzing and prioritizing requirements
                              * Metrics for measuring the acceptability of the requirements
                              * How the requirements will be tracked through the project (usually through a
                                requirements tracing matrix)


                         Collecting the Project Requirements
                         It's great to have a project, but it's even greater to understand what the stakeholders want
                         the project to create. The collect requirements process aims to identify and document
                         what the stakeholders need from the project. The requirements you'll identify from the
                         project sponsor, customer, and other stakeholders need to be quantifiable, measurable,
                         and documented in order to confirm that the results of the project satisfy the needs of
                         the stakeholder. You don't want requirements that use subjective terms to describe the
                         project deliverables. What's "good" to you may not be "good" to someone else.
                              You'll rely on the project charter as one of the inputs to this process. Recall that the
                         project charter identifies the project and defines the business need of the project. This
                         should give you some direction for collecting the project requirements. The project

                                                                                             Chapter 5: Managing the Project Scope

                                                                                                                                 173
                   charter will also contain high-level requirements that can be refined for details regard-
                   ing the project stakeholder's expectations.
                       The other input for this process is the stakeholder register. The stakeholder register is
                   a directory of all the stakeholders, their contact information, and details about their re-
                   lationship with the project. You'll need this document to contact the stakeholders so you
                   can begin the process of collecting project requirements. When you're dealing with large
                   groups of stakeholders--for example, all of the users of a particular software your project




                                                                                                                                               PART II
                   centers on--a smaller part of the group can represent the larger group in the project.

                                EXAM COACH What are your requirements for your upcoming Project
                                Management Institute (PMI) examination? Have you made your own list of
                                requirements that you'll need to satisfy to achieve your Certified Associate in
                                Project Management (CAPM) or Project Management Professional (PMP)
                                status? You need to know what you must create in order to create it.

                   Working with Project Stakeholders
                   You'll have to work with the project stakeholders in order to identify the requirements
                   your project needs. This is where the stakeholder register comes in handy because you'll
                   need to contact the stakeholders to schedule times to elicit their project requirements.
                   One favorable approach is to categorize the types of users and stakeholders to streamline
                   your requirements collection process. By grouping stakeholders together, you can save
                   time and effort and keep the project moving along. There are many tools you can use to
                   collect requirements from the stakeholders, such as the following.

                   Interviews
                   Perhaps the most common requirements elicitation technique is the interview. The in-
                   terviewer must prepare questions to guide the interviewee to discussing the needs that
                   the project will satisfy. Usually interviews are performed one-on-one, though it's not
                   unusual for the project manager to interview several stakeholders at once. Open-ended
                   questions are best for essay-type answers, while closed-ended questions can nail down
                   the specifics of the requirements.

                   Focus Groups and Facilitated Workshops
                   A focus group is a collection of stakeholders that interacts with a trained moderator.
                   The moderator leads the group through a conversation, engages all of the participants,
                   and remains neutral about the topic at hand. Focus groups can build trust, create new
                   relationships, and help the group of stakeholders reach consensus on the project re-
                   quirements. A scribe or recorder documents the conversation for analysis after the focus
                   group is concluded.
                       A facilitated workshop is a meeting with all of the key stakeholders to define the
                   project requirements quickly and as a group. Facilitated workshops are interactive,
                   often have stakeholders from different functional areas of the project, and can ex-
                   pose conflicting objectives and disagreements. A good facilitator keeps the group

                         focused on the project requirements and can help resolve conflicts and disagree-
                         ments in requirements.

                                       NOTE You might know a focus group through a facilitated workshop called
                                       the Joint Application Design (JAD) session. These software development
                                       workshops allow the designers and the users to interact and discuss the
                                       software requirements.

                         Group Creativity Techniques
                         A group creativity technique is an approach to identify requirements quickly in hopes
                         of reaching a consensus. You're probably already familiar with brainstorming and mind
                         mapping, but this technique also includes several other approaches:

                              * Nominal group technique As with brainstorming, participants are
                                encouraged to generate as many ideas as possible, but the suggested ideas are
                                ranked by a voting process.
                              * Affinity diagrams When stakeholders create a large number of ideas, you can
                                use an affinity diagram to cluster similar ideas together for further analysis.
                              * Delphi Technique This approach uses rounds of anonymous surveys to
                                build consensus. Because the surveys are anonymous, participants are more
                                likely to be honest with their requirements, opinions, and statements. The
                                project manager organizes these comments and inputs, and then sends them
                                back to the participants for another round of anonymous input.
                              * Brainstorming This approach encourages participants to generate as many
                                ideas as possible about the project requirements. No idea is judged or
                                dismissed during the brainstorming session.
                              * Mind mapping This approach maps ideas to show the relationship among
                                the requirements and the differences between them. The map can be reviewed
                                to identify new solutions or to rank the identified requirements.

                         Making a Group Decision
                         Group decisions can help the project manager prioritize, classify, and even generate
                         requirements. The participants in the group determine the appropriate method for
                         reaching a group decision, and there are four approaches:

                              * Unanimity        Everyone must be in agreement.
                              * Majority      More than 50 percent of the group must be in agreement.
                              * Plurality The largest block of voters makes the decision, even if they don't
                                represent more than 50 percent of the group. (Consider three or four factions
                                of stakeholders for three or more different choices, none of which receives
                                more than 50 percent of the vote.)
                              * Dictatorship       Only one individual makes the decision for the group.

                                                                                                                               175
                   Questionnaires and Surveys
                   When you have hundreds, even thousands, of stakeholders to identify requirements
                   from, a survey is an ideal tool and technique to rely on. The project manager can lever-
                   age web tools to quickly disseminate the survey, track responses, and organize the par-
                   ticipants' responses.

                   Observations




                                                                                                                                             PART II
                   One of the best requirements gathering techniques is observation. The project manager
                   goes into the field and observes the work being done to determine what requirements
                   are appropriate for the project work. You might know this approach as shadowing. Pas-
                   sive observation, sometimes called invisible observation, requires the project manager
                   to observe the work without asking questions or interrupting the workflow. Active ob-
                   servation allows the project manager to talk and interact with the participant to fully
                   understand the work. In some instances, the project manager might actually work
                   alongside the participant to understand the work that the project requirements may
                   affect.

                   Prototypes
                   A prototype is a model of the finished deliverable that allows the stakeholder to see
                   how the final project deliverable may operate. In software development, a vertical pro-
                   totype approach details the interface, the functionality, and sometimes both. A horizon-
                   tal prototype shows a very broad view of the deliverable, with very little operability at
                   this point. Either prototype can be considered a throwaway prototype, or the model can
                   be developed in more detail by the project team.

                   Context Diagrams
                   Imagine a project to design a computer network. You'd have servers, workstations,
                   wireless access points, even the physical network. A context diagram would show how
                   data moves around on the network, how people would interact with the network,
                   what the network would provide, and how people will contribute information to and
                   from the devices on your network. A context diagram shows all of these components,
                   called actors, and how they will interact with the thing.

                   Document Analysis
                   Most projects have lots of documents that contribute to the project scope and require-
                   ments: plans, brochures, blueprints, organizational process assets, proposals, and more.
                   Document analysis requires the project manager and the project team study these doc-
                   uments for anything that should be included in the requirements and referenced from
                   the document. You'll keep all of the documentation that you reference as part of the
                   project's supporting detail. At the end of the project, these documents are included in
                   the project archives and become part of organizational process assets.

                         Examining the Outputs of Requirement Collection
                         So once you've gathered all of the project requirements, you'll need to do something
                         with them. The first place to start is the requirements documentation--a listing of all
                         of the project requirements and the supporting detail for the identified requirements.
                         Requirements need to be measurable and consistent and then presented to the key
                         stakeholders for their confirmation of what you've captured and what the stakeholders
                         were expecting to receive from you. Examples of requirement types are:

                              * Business requirements
                              * Stakeholder requirements
                              * Project objectives
                              * Solution requirements
                              * Quality requirements
                              * Operational transfer requirements
                              * Training and support of the requirements for production

                              Because requirements can be a long, long list, it's better to record them in a table
                         called a requirements traceability matrix. This table documents and numbers each re-
                         quirement, their status in the project, and shows how each requirement is linked to a
                         specific deliverable that the project will create or has created. You'll also, usually, give a
                         little narrative about the requirement in the matrix as a point of reference. For more
                         detail, you'll reference the actual requirements documentation. This matrix helps the
                         project manager and the project customer see the product of the project and compare
                         it against the requirements to confirm that all of the requirements have been met and
                         are in existence in the final deliverable for the customer.


                         Defining the Project Scope
                         Building a skyscraper has to be one of the largest projects a project manager could man-
                         age. Think of all the different facets of the project: the art and design of the building,
                         the structural requirements, the building codes, and the concern and interest of all the
                         stakeholders within the project. The skyscraper would require months, if not years, of
                         serious planning, tight change control, and incredible organization to complete. The
                         scope of the skyscraper would be massive, and any change within the scope could have
                         ramifications further down the blueprinted line.
                             Now imagine a project to build a barn. There would still be considerable planning,
                         and the stakeholders of the barn might be concerned with its planning and construc-
                         tion, but probably not to the same depth as with the skyscraper project. The priority
                         and impact of each project is important to the key stakeholders of each, but no doubt
                         the skyscraper has a much broader impact than a barn. My point? Larger projects re-
                         quire more detail when it comes to scope creation and planning. Lots more.
                             Let's define scope, er, scopes, before moving forward.

                                                                                                                                  177
                       Project scope and product scope are different entities. Project scope deals with the
                   required work to create the project deliverables. For instance, our projects to create a
                   new barn and the new skyscraper would focus only on the work required to com-
                   plete the projects, with the specific attributes, features, and characteristics called for
                   by the project plan. The scope of the project is specific to the work required to com-
                   plete the project objectives. The project scope focuses on what must be done to cre-
                   ate the deliverable.




                                                                                                                                                PART II
                       Product scope, on the other hand, refers to the attributes and characteristics of the
                   deliverables the project is creating. As in the preceding barn and skyscraper projects,
                   the product scope would define the features and attributes of the barn and skyscraper.
                   In this instance, the project to create a barn would not include creating a flower garden,
                   a wading pool, and the installation of a fence, just as the skyscraper project likely
                   wouldn't include a neighboring park. There would be specific requirements regarding
                   the features and characteristics of each project: the materials to be used, the dimensions
                   of the space, the function of each building, and all the related details that make a sky-
                   scraper a skyscraper and a barn a barn. The product scope is what the customer of the
                   project envisions.




                       The project scope and the product scope are bound to each other. The product
                   scope constitutes the characteristics and features of the product that the project creates.
                   The end result of the project is measured against the requirements for that product. The
                   project scope is the work required to deliver the product. Throughout the project execu-
                   tion, the work is measured against the project plan to validate that the project is on
                   track to fulfill the product scope. The product scope is measured against requirements,
                   while the project scope is measured against the project plan.

                                NOTE When it comes to project scope management, as is covered in the bulk
                                of this chapter, focus on the work required to complete the project according
                                to the project plan. The product scope, meanwhile, is specific to the deliverable of
                                the project. Just remember, the exam will focus on project scope management. If
                                you're stumped on any exam questions about project management processes,
                                consider a huge project scope, like the skyscraper project.

                         Defining the Project Scope
                         A project manager and the project team can't plan how to complete the project until
                         they know what it is and exactly what they are trying to complete. That's where the
                         project scope statement is needed. Before the project management team can get to
                         the good stuff of deciding how the project work will be done, they first must create the
                         project scope statement.
                              When a project is first initiated, the focus is on what the project will deliver: the
                         product scope. It's all dreamy and blue sky. Now that the project has moved into plan-
                         ning, things are tightened through the project scope statement. The project scope state-
                         ment is built on the foundations defined in the project's initiation: major deliverables,
                         constraints, and assumptions. In planning, more information about the exactness of
                         the project deliverables comes to light through planning, research, stakeholder analy-
                         sis, and product analysis. The wants and needs of the stakeholders are considered, and
                         eventually they evolve into the project requirements.
                              The project manager, the project team, and the key stakeholders need to work to-
                         gether to examine the project for additional constraints and assumptions so that the
                         project can be planned completely. The key stakeholders are needed because their in-
                         sight into the project's deliverables can help the project manager and the project team
                         define all that the project is to deliver. The key stakeholders help create the scope and
                         agree on what's out of the project scope. For example, a project to build a web site may
                         include the layout, design, and database functionality--all within scope--but the pho-
                         tography needed for the web site may be out of scope. The photography activity may be
                         in an entirely different project, so it's not relevant to the current scope definition.
                              Creating the project scope involves four inputs:

                              * The scope management plan
                              * The project charter
                              * Requirements documentation
                              * Organizational process assets

                             These four inputs help the project management team work together to define all of
                         the contents of the project scope. This isn't a quick or necessarily easy process, but it's
                         vital to prepare an accurate and complete project scope statement, otherwise the project
                         will be haunted by errors and omissions. You'll especially rely on the outputs of the
                         collect requirements process as a foundation for what goes into the project scope.

                                       EXAM TIP Projects fail in the beginning, not the end. Poor planning early in
                                       the project will lead to poor execution later in the project. A rushed scope
                                       definition will likely cause problems later on in the project. This is the
                                       stakeholders' opportunity to define all that they want in the scope. Changes
                                       to the scope are easy early in the project, but are much more difficult later in
                                       the project because of the work, time, and monies already invested.

                                                                                                                                179
                   Using Product Analysis
                   If you were the project manager for a company that wanted to create a new camera, you
                   might choose several of your competitors' cameras to study, experiment with, and im-
                   prove upon. You'd compare the features and functions of the other cameras in light of
                   the requirements and goals of your current project. Product analysis is the study of how
                   a thing was made and how it works.
                       This approach to creating the project scope statement is product analysis. Product




                                                                                                                                              PART II
                   analysis, however, is more than just analyzing a product. It focuses on how it works, the
                   function of the product, and what's the most profitable approach to creating the prod-
                   uct. There are six flavors of product analysis. Don't be consumed with memorizing
                   these approaches for your CAPM or PMP examination, just be topically aware of these
                   product analysis methods.

                   Product Breakdown
                   This approach breaks down a product much as the project management team breaks
                   down the project scope into a WBS. For example, a computer could be broken down
                   into the physical components, such as the hard drive, processor, memory, network card,
                   and so on. A product breakdown structure illustrates the hierarchical structure of the
                   product.

                   Systems Analysis
                   This approach studies and analyzes a system, its components, and the relationship of
                   the components within the system. For example, a manufacturing company's system
                   for placing an order from a customer through delivery may have several steps, from sale
                   to completion and interaction between departments on that journey. Systems analysis
                   would study the relationship between each component and how the process could be
                   improved or the time reduced, or how practically any variable within the system could
                   be documented for additional study.

                   System Engineering
                   This project scope statement creation process studies how a system should work, de-
                   signs and creates a system model, and then enacts the working system based on the
                   project goals and the customer's expectations. Systems engineering aims to balance
                   the time and cost of the project in relation to the project scope. A successfully designed
                   system can be profitable, productive, and create quality that is acceptable to the project
                   sponsor and the project customer.

                   Value Engineering
                   This approach to project scope statement creation attempts to find the correct level of
                   quality in relation to a reasonable budget for the project deliverable while still achiev-
                   ing an acceptable level of performance of the product. Basically, this approach wants
                   the biggest bang for the project's buck--as long as the bang and the buck create a deliv-
                   erable that performs as expected. Consider a home remodeling project: the homeown-
                   ers could choose silk drapes and gold doorknobs or wool drapes and brass doorknobs

                         and get the same function. Their demand for a quality, grade, and function is in relation
                         to how much capital they'd like to invest in their home project.

                         Value Analysis
                         Like value engineering, this approach examines the functions of the project's product in
                         relation to the cost of the features and functions. This is where, to some extent, the
                         grade of the product is in relationship to the cost of the product. Consider Microsoft
                         Word's features and cost in relation to the features and cost of your computer's Notepad
                         application. While the price range is broadly different, the functions associated with
                         Word are far more powerful than those of Notepad.

                         Functional Analysis
                         This is the study of the functions within a system, project, or--what's more likely in the
                         project scope statement--the product the project will be creating. Functional analysis
                         studies the goals of the product, how the product will be used, and the expectations the
                         customer has of the product once it leaves the project and moves into operations. Func-
                         tional analysis may also consider the cost of the product in operations, which is known
                         as life-cycle costing.

                         Using Alternatives Generation
                         Your customer wants you to install an e-mail system for their organization. They don't
                         care which solution you and your project team come up with, as long as it's reliable,
                         easy to manage, and provides a central calendaring system. If you're from the IT world,
                         I imagine you immediately thought of several different approaches to solving this proj-
                         ect for your customer. That's alternative identification at its root.
                              Alternatives generation is more than just differing products that can solve the cus-
                         tomer's problem. It also means examining what solution makes the most economical
                         sense for the project and for the customer's ongoing support of the product once it's
                         been created. In the e-mail system, the project manager, project team, and experts would
                         need to examine how the customer will use all of the different aspects of the e-mail
                         system, their long-term goals for the system, and what their budget for the project and
                         any ongoing maintenance of the system would be.
                              To do alternatives generation, the project management team will do research, brain-
                         storming, and lateral thinking. Their focus is to identify all of the feasible alternatives to
                         the project's deliverable or even to components within the project. Alternatives genera-
                         tion also broaches a quality topic: grade. Grade is the ranking of materials or services, such
                         as first class versus coach, or plywood versus oak. We'll see this again in Chapter 8.

                         Using Stakeholder Analysis
                         Stakeholder analysis is almost always involved when it comes to creating the project
                         scope statement. It's all about the customer's demands, wishes, and goals for the proj-
                         ect. The project management team interviews the stakeholders and categorizes, priori-
                         tizes, and documents what the customer wants and needs. This is fundamental to proj-

                                                                                                                                 181
                   ect management: You and the key stakeholders must be in agreement on what the
                   project will create, or the project scope statement cannot be created and approved.
                   Without an agreement on what the requirements for acceptance are, the project is mov-
                   ing toward inevitable failure.
                       Here's another gotcha with stakeholder analysis: If you can't quantify it, if you can't
                   measure it, you can't create it. For example, a "fast" office network isn't quantified.
                   "Customer satisfaction" isn't quantified. And "happy," "warm-fuzzy," and "good" aren't




                                                                                                                                               PART II
                   quantified. The project scope statement needs to define in exact terms the acceptable
                   ranges for all of the project deliverables. All project requirements must be quantifiable.
                   Here's a general rule: If you can measure it, you can quantify it.

                                EXAM TIP Failure to quantify the project objectives raises risks that the
                                project won't achieve the customer's expectations. After all, what's fast and
                                good to you may mean something entirely different to the project customer.

                   Examining the Project Scope Statement
                   The project scope statement identifies all of the project deliverables and defines the
                   work required to create the deliverables. This document creates a common lexicon and
                   understanding of what the project will deliver for all of the project stakeholders. The
                   project scope statement clearly states the project objectives and communicates the goals
                   of the project so that all of the project team members, the project sponsor, and the key
                   stakeholders are in agreement as to what the project will accomplish.
                       The project scope statement also guides the remainder of the project planning pro-
                   cesses. Should changes be proposed to the project, the project scope statement helps
                   determine if the proposed changes are within or outside the project's boundaries. A
                   well-written scope can ward off change requests, while a loose, poorly written scope is
                   often an invitation for change requests and additional work by the project team.
                       So what goes into a project scope statement? Glad you asked! There are a bunch of
                   things, which the following sections explain.

                   Product Scope Description
                   This is a narrative of what the project is creating as deliverables for the project customer.
                   Early in the project, the product scope may be somewhat vague, but as the project scope
                   is progressively elaborated, the product scope description may be updated to reflect its
                   evolution and clarifications.

                                EXAM TIP Progressive elaboration is a PMI term to describe an incremental
                                process of redefining and clarifying any facet of a project. For example, a house
                                project may start broad, as a three-bedroom, two-car garage home, and then,
                                through progressive elaboration, all of the details down to the kitchen sink
                                and doorknobs are defined.

                         Product Acceptance Criteria
                         The project scope statement components work with the project requirements, but focus
                         specifically on the product and on what the conditions and processes are for formal
                         acceptance of the product.

                         Project Deliverables
                         These are all the things that the project will create. Consider that the project deliver-
                         ables are more than just the product, but also ancillary deliverables, such as project re-
                         ports, communications, and lessons learned that the organization may use for future
                         projects. The documentation and experience within the current project become part of
                         the organizational process assets for future projects.

                         Project Exclusions
                         A project exclusion clearly states what is included with the project and what's excluded
                         from it. This helps to eliminate assumptions between the project management team
                         and the project customer. For example, a software programmer may create a new ap-
                         plication for a customer as part of the project, but the distribution of the software to the
                         customer's 10,000 computer workstations is defined as out of scope.

                         Project Constraints
                         A constraint is anything that limits the project team's options. Common constraints
                         include the cost, schedule, technical, and quality demands. The project objectives can
                         have qualifiers, such as "U.S. dollars," "less than $4 million," or "within 10 percent of
                         the stated budget." If your project is operating under a contract, the contractual obliga-
                         tions are constraints.

                         Project Assumptions
                         A project assumption is anything that is held to be true but not proven to be true.
                         Within the scope, the assumptions are defined, as is their impact on the project if an
                         assumption proves to be false. For example, in construction, there are assumptions that
                         the warmer seasons will be cooperative for outdoor work. No one can necessarily prove
                         this, but it's believed to be true based on history. However, should the weather not co-
                         operate, it could have huge impacts on the project.


                         Creating the Work Breakdown Structure
                         The WBS is all about the project deliverables. It's a breakdown of the project scope into
                         hierarchical deliverables. The WBS takes the project scope and breaks it down into small-
                         er, manageable chunks of deliverables. Each layer of the WBS breaks down the layer
                         above it into smaller deliverables, until it arrives at the smallest item in the WBS, the
                         work package.

                                NOTE The work in the WBS refers to the deliverables the project will
                                create, not the effort your project team will have to put forth to create the
                                deliverables.

                                                                                                                                                PART II
                   5-1, the construction deliverable has been broken down to a second level consisting of
                   the basement, first floor, and second floor. Each of these deliverables could be broken
                   down again to another level, and so on. The smallest item in the WBS is called a work
                   package, which can be an effective unit to estimate cost and time, and can be monitored
                   and controlled within the project.
                       So how far must the project scope be broken down? There's no right answer, other
                   than to the level of detail that's appropriate for the project priority, scope, and objectives.

                         A guideline for WBS breakdown is the 8/80 Rule. This rule recommends that the labor to
                         create a work package equate to no more than 80 hours and no fewer than 8 hours of
                         labor for the associated activities. Of course, that's just a guideline, not a regulation.
                         Some projects may call for work packages, such as a quality control result, that may take
                         far less than eight hours. For your CAPM or PMP exam, know that the smallest element
                         in the WBS is a work package and that it can be scheduled, estimated for costs, and then
                         monitored and controlled.

                                       EXAM TIP The WBS is primarily about things, not activities. The work
                                       package is just a label for the smallest deliverable within the WBS. The PMI has
                                       lightened their stance on allowing appropriate activities, such as testing, into
                                       the WBS. A work package can be scheduled, have its cost estimated, and be
                                       controlled.

                             Usually, the WBS is a visual mapping of the subdivision of the project deliverables,
                         though this approach isn't always the best technique to use. The WBS can also be cre-
                         ated by using the project phases, by subcontractors that will complete parts of the proj-
                         ect work, or even by the type of labor the WBS will require.

                         Using a WBS Template
                         If an organization were to do the same type of project work over and over, they likely
                         wouldn't start a WBS from scratch every time. Instead, they'd use a previous, similar
                         project as a template for the current one. This is ideal since most projects within an
                         organization have similar life cycles, deliverables, and milestones. A previous project's
                         WBS makes an ideal template for the current project, provided the projects are similar
                         enough. The project management team may still need to edit the template, but using
                         one is a huge timesaver in the long run.
                             Other organizations may use a template in the more traditional sense. Just as you
                         may have a template for a newsletter, a report, or a memo, an organization could create
                         a WBS template of prepopulated WBS deliverables. In Figure 5-1, I included the project
                         management deliverables as part of the WBS. Project management deliverables could
                         be a common component of every WBS an organization creates, so it'd be ideal to in-
                         clude these items in a standard WBS template for all project managers to use.

                         Breaking Down the Deliverables
                         Horrible joke warning: What's Beethoven doing now? Decomposing.
                             All right, so it's not the best joke in the world, but it's relevant. Like Beethoven, the
                         project management team will first compose and then decompose. In project manage-
                         ment, the project scope statement is first composed, and then the scope is broken down
                         (or decomposed) into the individual items that the project will create.
                             Some items in the WBS may not be available for decomposition because they're far
                         off in the future. In these instances, the project management team will break down
                         those items as more information regarding the deliverables becomes available. This is

                                                                                             Chapter 5: Managing the Project Scope

                                                                                                                                 185
                   an example of rolling wave planning. Some projects may elect to create their WBS based
                   on the phases within the project, rather than on the total deliverables of the project.
                   Either approach is fine, but the following activities are required to break down the proj-
                   ect scope into a WBS:

                        * Identify the project deliverables and related work.
                        * Form the WBS structure.




                                                                                                                                               PART II
                        * Decompose the upper-tier deliverables into lower-tier deliverables.
                        * Create and assign WBS identification codes to the WBS packages. (This is
                          called the code of accounts and is a numbering system to identify each
                          element within the WBS.)
                        * Confirm that the decomposition is appropriate for the type of project.


                   Creating the WBS Dictionary
                   Along with the WBS, a WBS dictionary defines all of the characteristics of each element
                   within the WBS. The primary documentation of the WBS dictionary is on the work pack-
                   age, the smallest item in the WBS, but upper-tier deliverables can also be documented.
                   Each work package in the WBS is cross-referenced in this companion document and
                   includes the following details where appropriate:

                        * Code of account identifier and charge number
                        * Work package description
                        * Statement of work
                        * Work package owner or responsible role
                        * Schedule milestones
                        * Contract information
                        * Quality requirements
                        * Technical references
                        * Associated activities and work packages
                        * Schedule
                        * Resources
                        * Cost


                                 EXAM TIP You'll see the scope baseline often in your PMP or CAPM
                                 endeavor. The scope baseline is the combination of the project scope, the work
                                 breakdown structure, and the WBS dictionary.

                         Validating the Project Scope
                         Imagine a project to create a full-color, slick catalog for an electronics manufacturer.
                         The project manager has completed the initiation processes, moved through planning,
                         and is now executing the project work. The only trouble is that the project manager and
                         the experts on the project team aren't sharing the work progress with the customer. The
                         work they are completing is not in alignment with the product description or the cus-
                         tomer requirements.
                              The project team has created a trendy 1950s-style catalog with funky green and or-
                         ange colors, lots of beehive hairdo models, horn-rimmed glasses, and tongue-in-cheek
                         jokes about "the future" of electronics. The manufacturer wants to demonstrate a pro-
                         fessional, accessible, current look for its publications. What do you think will happen
                         if the project manager presents the catalog with his spin rather than following the re-
                         quest of the customer?
                              Scope validation is the process of the project customer accepting the project deliver-
                         ables. It happens either at the end of each project phase or as major deliverables are
                         created. Scope validation ensures that the deliverables the project creates are in align-
                         ment with the project scope. It is concerned with the acceptance of the work. A related
                         activity, quality control (QC), is concerned with the correctness of the work. Scope vali-
                         dation and QC can happen in tandem because the quality of the work contributes to
                         scope validation. Poor quality will typically result in scope validation failure.

                         Preparing for Project Inspection
                         You could just rush into scope validation, but that'd be a waste of time and not a very
                         organized approach to confirming that the project deliverables are accurate. It's better
                         to collect some inputs to help you prepare for the project inspection. You'll need the
                         following:

                              * Project management plan The project management plan contains the scope
                                management plan, which you'll need because it defines how the scope can be
                                validated and by which stakeholders in the project.
                              * Requirements documentation This documentation of what the
                                stakeholders expected from the project defines all of the technical
                                requirements that must be present for the work to be accepted by the
                                stakeholders.
                              * Requirements traceability matrix This is a table that maps the requirements
                                throughout the project all the way to their completion.
                              * Verified deliverables These are deliverables that your project team has
                                completed that have passed your project's quality control process.
                              * Work performance data This information defines how well the deliverables
                                are in compliance and records those requirements that are not in compliance
                                with the project scope.

                                                                                                                                187
                       These five things will help you and the project stakeholders inspect the project work
                   to confirm that what you've created is what was promised to the customer.

                   Inspecting the Project Work
                   To complete scope validation, the deliverables must be inspected. Inspection may re-
                   quire measuring, examining, and testing the product to prove that it meets the custom-
                   er's requirements. Inspection usually requires the project manager and the customer to




                                                                                                                                              PART II
                   inspect the project deliverables for verification, which, in turn, results in acceptance.
                   Depending on the industry, inspections may also be known as:

                        * Reviews
                        * Product reviews
                        * Audits
                        * Walkthroughs
                        * Group decision-making techniques

                        Assuming the scope has been validated, the customer accepts the deliverable. This
                   is a formal process that requires signed documentation of the acceptance by the spon-
                   sor or customer. Scope validation can also happen at the end of each project phase or
                   when major deliverables within the project are achieved. In these instances, scope vali-
                   dation may be conditional, based on the work results. When the scope is not validated,
                   the project may undergo one of several actions. It may be canceled and deemed a fail-
                   ure, sent through corrective actions, or put on hold while a decision is made based on
                   the project or phase results.
                        Should a project get canceled before it has completed the scope, scope validation is
                   measured against the deliverables to the point of the project cancellation. In other
                   words, scope validation measures the completeness of the work up to the cancellation,
                   not the work that was to be completed after project termination.

                               EXAM TIP If a project scope has been completed, the project is complete.
                               Resist the urge to do additional work once the project scope has been fulfilled.
                               Also, be cautious of instances where the scope is fulfilled and the product
                               description is exact, but the customer is not happy with the product. Technically,
                               for the exam, the project is complete even if the customer is not happy.


                   Controlling the Project Scope
                   Scope control is about protecting the project scope from change and, when change
                   does happen, managing those changes. Ideally, all requested changes follow the scope
                   change control system, which means that change requests must be documented. Those
                   changes that sneak into the project scope are lumped into that project poison category
                   of scope creep. Scope creep is, of course, bad, bad news.

                             Corrective actions--those steps taken to move the project back into alignment with
                         the project scope--do require formal change requests, because the project manager
                         isn't changing the scope, but rather the work that's outside of the project scope. Correc-
                         tive actions are a part of scope control because you're nudging, and sometimes shoving,
                         work back into alignment with the project scope. The trouble with scope creep and cor-
                         rective actions is that the project team is doing or fixing work that should never have
                         entered the scope in the first place--and that means wasted time and dollars. That's one
                         sure way for a project to be late and over budget.

                                       NOTE Corrective actions will require a formal change request especially if
                                       they involve additional time or cost to complete.


                             Controlling the project scope is also concerned with "influencing the factors that
                         create project scope changes." That's the PMBOK way of saying that the project man-
                         ager must control the project team and the project stakeholders from doing anything,
                         absolutely anything, that's outside of the project scope. It also means that the project
                         management team should capture the customer's vision in planning before much of
                         the project work begins. For example, it's always easier to make changes on a blueprint
                         than in construction. Gathering all requirements and creating an accurate project scope
                         statement can ward off changes during execution.
                             You'll need five things as inputs to the control scope process:

                              * Project management plan Within the project management plan, you'll
                                reference the scope baseline, scope management plan, change management,
                                configuration management plan, and the requirements management plan for
                                scope control.
                              * Work performance data This is the status of the deliverables--the work
                                that's been started, finished, or has yet to begin.
                              * Requirements documentation You'll still need to identify the requirements
                                as approved by the stakeholders.
                              * Requirements traceability matrix This table identifies and tracks requirements
                                through the project and is needed to help identify which requirements have
                                been completed and how changes may affect any identified requirement.
                              * Organizational process assets Your organization may have scope
                                management policies, guidelines, and reporting methods that you must use as
                                part of scope control.


                         Using a Change Control System
                         While it's dreamy and ideal for requirements to be completely gathered before the work
                         begins, change requests to the project work are still likely. Every project demands a
                         change control system that defines and controls how changes to the project and to the

                                                                                           Chapter 5: Managing the Project Scope

                                                                                                                               189
                   product can be approved. The scope management plan defines the change control sys-
                   tem, its procedure, and how the change decisions can be made--often with a fee just to
                   entertain the change request. The change control system should be reviewed during the
                   project kickoff meeting so that all of the stakeholders are aware of the process. Change
                   control is part of the project management information system to help control changes
                   to the project scope. This helps automate the procedure, but doesn't necessarily make
                   approving or denying change requests any easier. The change control system also con-




                                                                                                                                             PART II
                   siders integrated change control. Integrated change control examines the proposed
                   change and how it affects all of the project's knowledge areas. For example:

                       * How does this change affect the project scope?
                        * What is the cost of the change?
                        * How does this change affect the project schedule?
                        * How does this change affect quality?
                        * What resources are needed or affected by the change?
                        * How does this change affect communications?
                        * What risks does this change present?
                        * Will procurement be affected by this change?

                      The change control system should do several things for the project management team:

                       * Document all change requests.
                        * Track each change request.
                        * Document approval levels required for a scope change.
                        * Provide the status of each change request.

                               NOTE Technically, there are four change control systems. While this chapter
                               includes information on the most common changes, in the project scope there
                               are also change control systems for cost, schedule, and contract. All four
                               change control systems invoke integrated change control when a change is
                               proposed.

                   Planning for Project Scope Changes
                   When a change is presented, part of considering the change involves additional plan-
                   ning. The project manager and the project team must reconvene to examine the change
                   and how it may affect the project work and the knowledge areas discussed earlier.
                   Changes are sometimes rejected, such as when a project team member takes the initia-
                   tive for a change and does not follow the change control procedures. In these instances,
                   the project management team must consider the change and examine the variance to
                   determine the response.

                             Consider a team member who moves the light fixtures in a kitchen construction
                         project by 2 feet. The team member believes the kitchen would be better lit with the
                         lights moved to their new position, but he didn't follow the change control process to
                         make the change. Now there is a variance in the scope--a difference between what the
                         specification documents called for and what the team member did. The project man-
                         agement team has to consider how to manage the variance. Should they redo the work
                         or accept the change the team member has made? If they redo the work, they may lose
                         time and money, but they'll be in scope. If they leave the change as is, then they're out
                         of scope.
                             Another consideration for all changes is the configuration management system.
                         Configuration management documents all of the features and functions of the project's
                         product. When a change is requested, the impact on the features and functions of the
                         product is documented with the change request before the change is allowed to move
                         through the integrated change control process. For example, a change to add French
                         doors to a home construction project would need all of the features and functions of
                         those French doors so that the true impact on the project's knowledge areas could be
                         examined fully. Failure to accurately document the change can lead to assumptions
                         proving false, new risks, schedule slippage, and financial costs within the project.

                                       EXAM TIP Undocumented change requests should not be considered at all.
                                       Change requests must be documented according to the project scope
                                       management plan. When there is a difference between what was planned and
                                       what was created, variance analysis is needed to determine what corrective
                                       actions should be implemented.

                         Approving a Change
                         It's a safe bet that changes to the project scope will happen during a project. Why do
                         change requests happen? And which ones are most likely to be approved? Most change
                         requests are a result of:

                              * Value-added changes These are changes that will reduce costs. (This is often
                                due to technological advances made since the time the project scope was
                                created.)
                              * External events       These could be such things as new laws or industry
                                requirements.
                              * Errors or omissions Ever hear this one: "Oops! We forgot to include this
                                feature in the product description and WBS!" Errors and omissions can happen
                                to both the project scope, which is the work to complete the project, and the
                                product scope, which is the features and functions of the deliverable, and they
                                typically constitute an overlooked feature or requirement.
                              * Risk response A risk has been identified, and changes to scope are needed
                                to mitigate the risk.

                       When change requests are approved, the effects of that change should be docu-
                   mented throughout the project. The Iron Triangle of Project Management is a good
                   example: If the project scope increases, then the project schedule and the project costs
                   will likely need to be changed to reflect these changes. Here are all of the project com-
                   ponents that will most likely need to be updated to reflect any approved changes to the
                   project:

                        * Requirements documentation




                                                                                                                                              PART II

                        * Work breakdown structure (WBS)
                        * WBS dictionary
                        * Scope baseline
                        * Additional requested changes
                        * Organizational process assets
                        * Risk register
                        * Project management plan

                       Change requests must always follow the change control system, or they are consid-
                   ered out of scope. As the project manager and the project team discover and report
                   changes that are out of scope, the project management team must deal with the changes
                   to remove them through corrective actions or incorporate them through the change
                   control process. Those changes that are incorporated into the project must still be docu-
                   mented and then reflected in the preceding project components. No changes sneak by!


                   Chapter Summary
                   Project scope management is the ability to complete all of the project's required work--
                   and only the required work. This means no extras, no favors, and no cutting corners.
                   The project scope is the focus of the project--the necessary work to complete the proj-
                   ect. Project scope management is a tool the project manager uses to determine what
                   work is in the project and what work is extraneous.
                       The project scope management plan will help the project management team deter-
                   mine how the project scope will be defined, how the WBS will be created, how the
                   scope will be controlled throughout the remainder of the project, and how the scope
                   will be verified by the project customer, both at the end of the project and at the end of
                   each project phase. The project scope management plan makes the project team con-
                   sider all of the knowledge areas and how they may be affected by changes to the project
                   scope.
                       To determine what the project scope actually is, plenty of scope planning is needed.
                   The project manager and the project team must have a clear vision of the project, the
                   business need for the project, the requirements, and the stakeholder expectations for

                         the project. The end result of the scope planning processes is the project scope state-
                         ment. The scope statement says, in no uncertain terms, what is within the project and
                         what is not. This is a more detailed project scope statement than what's created during
                         project initiation.
                             For your CAPM or PMP exam, focus on protecting the project scope. This includes
                         finding the real purpose of the project so that the scope is in alignment with the identi-
                         fied need. Once the scope has been created, the project team, stakeholders, the project
                         sponsor, and even the project manager should not change it, unless there is overwhelm-
                         ing evidence of why the scope needs to be changed. All changes should be documented
                         and must follow the change control system as defined in the project scope management
                         plan.

                         Key Terms
                         8/80 Rule A planning heuristic for creating the WBS. This rule states that the work
                         package in a WBS must take no more than 80 hours of labor to create and no fewer than
                         8 hours of labor to create.
                         Active observation The observer interacts with the worker to ask questions and un-
                         derstand each step of the work being completed. In some instances, the observer could
                         serve as an assistant in doing the work.
                         Affinity diagrams When stakeholders create a large number of ideas, you can use an
                         affinity diagram to cluster similar ideas together for further analysis.
                         Alternatives generation A scope definition process of finding alternative solutions
                         for the project customer while considering the customer's satisfaction, the cost of the
                         solution, and how the customer may use the product in operations.
                         Brainstorming This approach encourages participants to generate as many ideas as
                         possible about the project requirements. No idea is judged or dismissed during the
                         brainstorming session.
                         Change control system (CCS) Documented in the scope management plan, this sys-
                         tem defines how changes to the project scope are managed and controlled.
                         Change management plan This subsidiary plan defines how changes will be allowed
                         and managed within the project.
                         Code of accounts A numbering system for each item in the WBS. The PMBOK is a
                         good example of a code of accounts, as each chapter and its subheadings follow a logi-
                         cal numbering scheme. For example, PMBOK 5.3.3.2 identifies an exact paragraph in
                         the PMBOK.
                         Configuration management plan This subsidiary plan defines how changes to the
                         features and functions of the project deliverables will be monitored and controlled
                         within the project.

                                                                                                                                193
                   Context diagram These diagrams show the relationship between elements of an en-
                   vironment. For example, a context diagram would illustrate the networks, servers, work-
                   stations, and people that interact with the elements of the environment.
                   Delphi Technique This approach uses rounds of anonymous surveys to build con-
                   sensus. Because the surveys are anonymous, participants are more likely to be honest
                   with their requirements, opinions, and statements. The project manager organizes these
                   comments and inputs and then sends them back to the participant for another round




                                                                                                                                              PART II
                   of anonymous input.
                   Dictatorship    A decision method where only one individual makes the decision for
                   the group.
                   Focus groups A moderator-led requirements collection method to elicit requirements
                   from stakeholders.
                   Functional analysis This is the study of the functions within a system, project, or,
                   what's more likely in the project scope statement, the product the project will be creat-
                   ing. Functional analysis studies the goals of the product, how the product will be used,
                   and the expectations the customer has of the product once it leaves the project and
                   moves into operations. Functional analysis may also consider the cost of the product in
                   operations, which is known as life-cycle costing.
                   Funding limit Most projects have a determined budget in relation to the project
                   scope. There may be a qualifier on this budget, such as plus or minus 10 percent based
                   on the type of cost estimate created.
                   Initial project organization The project scope statement identifies the project team and
                   the key stakeholders. In some organizations, especially on larger projects, the team organi-
                   zation and structure are also documented.
                   Interviews A requirements collection method used to elicit requirements from stake-
                   holders in a one-on-one conversation.
                   Majority A group decision method where more than 50 percent of the group must be
                   in agreement.
                   Mind mapping This approach maps ideas to show the relationship among require-
                   ments and the differences between requirements. The map can be reviewed to identify
                   new solutions or to rank the identified requirements.
                   Nominal group technique As with brainstorming, participants are encouraged to gen-
                   erate as many ideas as possible, but the suggested ideas are ranked by a voting process.
                   Passive observation The observer records information about the work being com-
                   pleted without interrupting the process; sometimes called the invisible observer.
                   Plurality A group-decision method where the largest part of the group makes the
                   decision when it's less than 50 percent of the total. (Consider three or four factions
                   within the stakeholders.)

                         Product acceptance criteria This project scope statement component works with the
                         project requirements, but focuses specifically on the product and what the conditions
                         and processes are for formal acceptance of the product.
                         Product breakdown A scope definition technique that breaks down a product into a
                         hierarchical structure, much like a WBS breaks down a project scope.
                         Product scope description This is a narrative description of what the project is creat-
                         ing as a deliverable for the project customer.
                         Product scope Defines the product or service that will come about as a result of com-
                         pleting the project. It defines the features and functions that characterize the product.
                         Project assumptions A project assumption is a factor in the planning process that is
                         held to be true but not proven to be true.
                         Project boundaries A project boundary clearly states what is included with the proj-
                         ect and what's excluded from the project. This helps to eliminate assumptions between
                         the project management team and the project customer.
                         Project constraints A constraint is anything that limits the project manager's options.
                         Consider a predetermined budget, deadline, resources, or materials the project man-
                         ager must use within the project--these are all examples of project constraints.
                         Project objectives These are the measurable goals that determine a project's accept-
                         ability to the project customer and the overall success of the project. Objectives often
                         include the cost, schedule, technical requirements, and quality demands.
                         Project requirements These are the demands set by the customer, regulations, or the
                         performing organization that must exist for the project deliverables to be acceptable.
                         Requirements are often prioritized in a number of ways, from "must have" to "should
                         have" to "would like to have."
                         Project scope This defines all of the work, and only the required work, to complete
                         the project objectives.
                         Project scope management plan This project management subsidiary plan controls
                         how the scope will be defined, how the project scope statement will be created, how the
                         WBS will be created, how scope validation will proceed, and how the project scope will
                         be controlled throughout the project.
                         Prototype A model of the finished deliverable that allows the stakeholder to see how
                         the final project deliverable may operate.
                         Requirements documentation This documentation of what the stakeholders expect-
                         ed in the project defines all of the requirements that must be present for the work to be
                         accepted by the stakeholders.
                         Requirements management plan This subsidiary plan defines how changes to the
                         project requirements will be permitted, how requirements will be tracked, and how
                         changes to the requirements will be approved.

                   Requirements traceability matrix (RTM) This is a table that maps the requirements
                   throughout the project all the way to their completion.
                   Schedule milestones The project customer may have specific dates when phases of the
                   project should be completed. These milestones are often treated as project constraints.

                   project acceptance.
                   Stakeholder analysis A scope definition process where the project management
                   team interviews the stakeholders and categorizes, prioritizes, and documents what
                   the project customer wants and needs. The analysis is to determine, quantify, and
                   prioritize the interests of the stakeholders. Stakeholder analysis demands quantifica-
                   tion of stakeholder objectives; goals such as "good," "satisfaction," and "speedy"
                   aren't quantifiable.
                   Systems analysis A scope definition approach that studies and analyzes a system, its
                   components, and the relationship of the components within the system.
                   Systems engineering This project scope statement creation process studies how a
                   system should work, designs and creates a system model, and then enacts the working
                   system based on the project's goals and the customer's expectations. Systems engineer-
                   ing aims to balance the time and cost of the project in relation to the scope of the
                   project.
                   Unanimity     A group decision method where everyone must be in agreement.
                   Value analysis As with value engineering, this approach examines the functions of
                   the project's product in relation to the cost of the features and functions. This is where,
                   to some extent, the grade of the product is in relationship to the cost of the product.
                   Value engineering This approach to project scope statement creation attempts to find
                   the correct level of quality in relation to a reasonable budget for the project deliverable
                   while still achieving an acceptable level of performance of the product.
                   WBS dictionary A WBS companion document that defines all of the characteristics of
                   each element within the WBS.
                   WBS template A prepopulated WBS for repetitive projects. Previous projects' WBSs
                   are often used as templates for current similar projects.
                   Work breakdown structure (WBS)           A deliverables-oriented breakdown of the project

                                 process of creating the project scope statement and you need to gather the
                                 elements for this process. Which one of the following is not needed to define
                                 the project scope?

                                 team doesn't understand how far down the breakdown should occur. Marty
                                 should call the lowest-level item in a WBS what?
                                  A. A deliverable
                                  B. A work package
                                  C. An activity
                                  D. A leaf object
                              5. You are working with the project team to create the WBS. There are some
                                 elements in the WBS that can't be broken down yet. You and the team elect to
                                 break down these items later in the project as more details become available.
                                 This approach to creating the WBS is also known as what?

                    6. You are the project manager for your organization and you're creating the
                       WBS for a new project. In your WBS, you're numbering each level of the




                                                                                                                                         PART II
                       components following a project sequenced numbering order. Your WBS is
                       numbered in a hierarchical fashion for easy identification and reference. This
                       numbering scheme is called what?
                       A. Code of accounts
                       B. Chart of accounts
                       C. WBS template
                       D. WBS dictionary
                    7. You'll use the scope management plan to define the project scope statement.
                       You'll also use this plan to build the scope baseline. Which two items are parts
                       of the scope baseline for the project?
                       A. The project scope management plan and project charter

                       D. Time and cost baselines
                    8. Throughout the project, you have milestones scheduled at the end of each
                       phase. Tied to these milestones you have a project management requirement
                       of scope validation. Scope validation leads to what?
                       A. Defect repair
                       B. Formal acceptance of the complete project scope
                       C. Rework
                       D. Inspection
                    9. You've just reached the end of your project and management has asked you
                       and several key stakeholders to begin the scope validation process. What is a
                       tool and technique used during scope validation?

                             11. As the project manager, you are averse to change once the scope statement has
                                 been approved. You do not want changes to enter the project because these
                                 changes can have a wide impact on the project as a whole. Which system
                                 defines how the project scope and the product scope can be changed?
                                  A. The project scope change control system
                                  B. The project integrated management system
                                  C. The project management information system
                                  D. Change control
                             12. A scope change has been approved in Marcy's project. All of the following
                                 must be updated to reflect the change except for which one?
                                  A. The project scope statement
                                  B. The WBS
                                  C. The WBS dictionary
                                  D. Defect repair review
                             13. A project team member has, on his own initiative, added extra vents to
                                 an attic to increase air circulation. The project plan did not call for these
                                 extra vents, but the team member decided they were needed based on the
                                 geographical location of the house. The project team's experts concur with this
                                 decision. This is an example of:
                                  A. Cost control
                                  B. Ineffective change control
                                  C. Self-led teams
                                  D. Value-added change
                             14. It's important for you, the project manager, to understand what each of the
                                 project management processes create. One of the key processes you'll do is
                                 scope control throughout your project. Which of the following is an output
                                 of scope control?
                                  A. Work-around
                                  B. Change request for a corrective action

                       a computer-aided program and web-based tools, which your project does
                       not offer. You have implemented a change request to update your project
                       accordingly. This is an example of which of the following?
                       A. A change due to an error and omission in the initiation phase
                       B. A change due to an external event




                                                                                                                                         PART II

                       A. The project sponsor
                       B. The contractual agreement
                       C. Vendor(s)
                       D. The cause of the change request
                   17. A project team member has asked you what a scope statement is. Which of the
                       following is a characteristic of a project scope statement?
                       A. Defines the scope baseline for the project
                       B. Defines the requirements for each project within the organization
                       C. Defines the roles and responsibilities of each project team member
                       D. Defines the project deliverables and the work needed to create those
                          deliverables
                   18. One of the stakeholders of the project you are managing asks why
                       you consider the project scope statement so important in your project
                       management methodology. You answer her question with which of the
                       following?

                       B. Project managers must document any changes before approving or
                          declining them.
                       C. The project scope helps the project manager determine if a change is
                          within or outside of scope.
                       D. The project plan and earned value management (EVM) work together to
                          assess the risk involved with proposed changes.
                   19. You are the project manager for a large construction project. The architect
                       has provided your project team with blueprints detailing the exact layout of
                       the building your team will be creating. He insists that the team follow the
                       blueprints as he's designed them. The blueprints are an example of which one

                         Questions and Answers
                              1. Henry is the project manager for his organization, and management has
                                 asked him to create a project management plan to define the scope statement.
                                 Which project management plan guides the creation of the detailed project
                                 scope statement?
                                  A. The charter
                                  B. The project management plan
                                  C. The project scope plan
                                  D. The project scope management plan
                                 D. The project scope management plan defines the creation of the detailed
                                 project scope statement. A, the charter, does include the preliminary project
                                 scope statement, but not the detailed one the project scope management plan
                                 defines. B, the project management plan, is a parent of the project scope
                                 management plan. C is not a valid plan, so this answer is incorrect.
                              2. You are the project manager of the GYH Project. This project will create a
                                 walking bridge across the Tennessee River. You've been asked to start the
                                 process of creating the project scope statement and you need to gather the
                                 elements for this process. Which one of the following is not needed to define
                                 the project scope?
                                  A. A project charter
                                  B. Organizational process assets

                                 C. At this point, you won't need, or likely have, the risk management plan to
                                 define the project scope. A, B, and D are incorrect statements because you'll

                                                                                                                         201
                     need the project charter, organizational process assets, and the requirements
                     documentation to define the project scope.
                   3. You are the project manager of the BHY Project. Your project customer has
                      demanded that the project be completed by December 1. December 1 is an
                      example of which one of the following?
                      A. A constraint




                                                                                                                                       PART II
                      B. An assumption
                      C. A project boundary
                     D. Product acceptance criteria
                     A. This is an example of a project constraint. B is incorrect because this is a
                     requirement, not an assumption. C is incorrect because project boundaries
                     define things that are within and outside of the project scope. D is incorrect
                     because product acceptance criteria are an example of functions and features
                     the product must have to be acceptable to the customer.
                   4. Marty is the project manager of the Highway 41 Bridge Project and he's
                      working with his project team members to create the WBS. Marty shows the
                      team how to break down the project scope into the WBS components, but the
                      team doesn't understand how far down the breakdown should occur. Marty
                      should call the lowest-level item in a WBS what?
                      A. A deliverable
                      B. A work package
                      C. An activity
                     D. A leaf object
                     B. The smallest item in the WBS is called the work package. A, deliverables,
                     may be true to a degree, but B is a more precise answer. C is incorrect because
                     activities are found in the activity list. D is an invalid WBS term.
                   5. You are working with the project team to create the WBS. There are some
                      elements in the WBS that can't be broken down yet. You and the team elect to
                      break down these items later in the project as more details become available.
                      This approach to creating the WBS is also known as what?
                      A. Decomposition
                      B. The 8/80 Rule
                      C. Parkinson's Law
                     D. Rolling wave planning
                     D. This is a clear example of rolling wave planning. A is incorrect because
                     decomposition describes the breakdown process of the project scope. B is
                     incorrect because the 8/80 Rule defines the guideline for the amount of labor
                     that should be related to each work package in the WBS. C, Parkinson's Law,




05-ch05.indd 201                                                                                                          7/10/2013 1:42:50 AM

                                 is not relevant to this question. Parkinson's Law states that work will expand
                                 to fulfill the amount of time allotted to it.
                              6. You are the project manager for your organization and you're creating the
                                 WBS for a new project. In your WBS, you're numbering each level of the
                                 components following a project sequenced numbering order. Your WBS is
                                 numbered in a hierarchical fashion for easy identification and reference. This
                                 numbering scheme is called what?
                                  A. Code of accounts
                                  B. Chart of accounts
                                  C. WBS template
                                  D. WBS dictionary
                                 A. The WBS numbering scheme is called the code of accounts. B, chart of
                                 accounts, is a project management accounting system. C, a WBS template, can
                                 be a prepopulated WBS or a WBS from a previous project used to define the
                                 current project's WBS. D is incorrect because the WBS dictionary defines the
                                 attributes of each WBS element.
                              7. You'll use the scope management plan to define the project scope statement.
                                 You'll also use this plan to build the scope baseline. Which two items are parts
                                 of the scope baseline for the project?
                                  A. The project scope management plan and project charter
                                  B. The project scope management plan and the WBS
                                  C. The WBS and WBS dictionary
                                  D. Time and cost baselines
                                 C. The WBS and WBS dictionary are two of the three components of the
                                 scope baseline. The approved detailed project scope statement is the third
                                 portion of the scope baseline. A, B, and D are all incorrect because they do
                                 not accurately define the scope baseline.
                              8. Throughout the project, you have milestones scheduled at the end of each
                                 phase. Tied to these milestones you have a project management requirement
                                 of scope validation. Scope validation leads to what?
                                  A. Defect repair
                                  B. Formal acceptance of the complete project scope
                                  C. Rework
                                  D. Inspection
                                 B. Scope validation leads to one thing: formal acceptance of the complete
                                 project scope. A, C, and D are incorrect because defect repair, rework, and
                                 inspection are not outputs of scope validation.

                                                                                       Chapter 5: Managing the Project Scope

                                                                                                                           203
                    9. You've just reached the end of your project and management has asked you
                       and several key stakeholders to begin the scope validation process. What is a
                       tool and technique used during scope validation?
                       A. Inspection
                       B. Quality control
                       C. Stakeholder analysis




                                                                                                                                         PART II
                       D. Defect repair review
                       A. Inspection is a tool and technique used during scope validation. You might
                       also use group-decision making techniques as part of the validate scope
                       process. B, quality control, is tempting, but this is not a correct choice for
                       scope validation. C and D are incorrect as well because these two choices are
                       not used during the scope validation process.
                   10. David, one of your project team members, has been making changes to his
                       work, which, as a result, changes the project scope. David's changes are also
                       known as what?
                       A. Gold plating
                       B. Scope control defect
                       C. Scope creep
                       D. Improvised scope composition
                       C. Undocumented changes are examples of scope creep. A, gold plating, is
                       when the project team adds changes to consume the project budget. B and D,
                       scope control defect and improvised scope composition, are not valid change
                       management terms.
                   11. As the project manager, you are averse to change once the scope statement has
                       been approved. You do not want changes to enter the project because these
                       changes can have a wide impact on the project as a whole. Which system
                       defines how the project scope and the product scope can be changed?
                       A. The project scope change control system
                       B. The project integrated management system
                       C. The project management information system
                       D. Change control
                       A. The only system that defines how project and product scope can be
                       changed is the project scope change control system. B, the project integrated
                       management system, is not a valid term. C, the project management
                       information system, is the parent system of the project scope change control
                       system. D, change control, is a process, not a system.
                   12. A scope change has been approved in Marcy's project. All of the following
                       must be updated to reflect the change except for which one?

              CAPM/PMP Project Management Certification All-in-One Exam Guide
              204
                                  A. The project scope statement
                                  B. The WBS
                                  C. The WBS dictionary
                                  D. Defect repair review
                                 D. Defect repair and its review do not require a change request, so this choice
                                 is correct. A, B, and C, the project scope statement, the WBS, and the WBS
                                 dictionary, do require updates when change requests are approved.
                             13. A project team member has, on his own initiative, added extra vents to
                                 an attic to increase air circulation. The project plan did not call for these
                                 extra vents, but the team member decided they were needed based on the
                                 geographical location of the house. The project team's experts concur with this
                                 decision. This is an example of:
                                  A. Cost control
                                  B. Ineffective change control
                                  C. Self-led teams
                                  D. Value-added change
                                 B. Even though the change is agreed upon, this is an example of ineffective
                                 change control. The team member should follow the change control process
                                 as defined in the project scope management plan. A, C, and D are incorrect
                                 choices.
                             14. It's important for you, the project manager, to understand what each of the
                                 project management processes create. One of the key processes you'll do is
                                 scope control throughout your project. Which of the following is an output
                                 of scope control?
                                  A. Work-around
                                  B. Change request for a corrective action
                                  C. Transference
                                  D. Risk assessment
                                 B. Change requests for corrective actions are an output of scope control. This
                                 is because the project team may be doing work outside of the project scope.
                                 Corrective action would stop the extraneous work and bring the project team
                                 member's actions back into the work within the project scope. A, C, and D
                                 are not outputs of scope control.
                             15. You are the project manager for the JHG Project. Your project is to create
                                 a new product for your industry. You have recently learned that your
                                 competitor is also working on a similar project, but their offering will include
                                 a computer-aided program and web-based tools, which your project does

                                                                                                                           205
                       not offer. You have implemented a change request to update your project
                       accordingly. This is an example of which of the following?
                       A. A change due to an error and omission in the initiation phase
                       B. A change due to an external event
                       C. A change due to an error or omission in the planning phase
                       D. A change due to a legal issue




                                                                                                                                         PART II
                       B. This is a change due to an external event--the event being the product your
                       competitor has in their project. This is not an example of an error or
                       omission in the initiation phase, so A is incorrect. C is incorrect because this
                       is not an error or omission in the planning phase, but a response to a
                       competitor. D is incorrect because this is not a legal issue.
                   16. You are the project manager of a large project. Your project sponsor and
                       management have approved you to outsource portions of the project plan.
                       What must be considered if a change request affects the procured work?
                       A. The project sponsor
                       B. The contractual agreement
                       C. Vendor(s)
                       D. The cause of the change request
                       B. If a change to the project scope affects the procured work, the project
                       manager must consider the contract. This is because the change may affect the
                       existing contract the project manager and the vendor have entered into. While
                       A, the project sponsor, and C, the vendor, are likely to be involved with the
                       change, the contractual agreements override all other internal systems. D, the
                       cause of the change request, is not as relevant as the contract.
                   17. A project team member has asked you what a scope statement is. Which of the
                       following is a characteristic of a project scope statement?
                       A. Defines the scope baseline for the project
                       B. Defines the requirements for each project within the organization
                       C. Defines the roles and responsibilities of each project team member
                       D. Defines the project deliverables and the work needed to create those
                          deliverables
                       D. The project scope statement defines the project deliverables and the
                       associated work to create those deliverables. A is incorrect because the project
                       scope statement, the WBS, and the WBS dictionary are considered to be the
                       project scope baseline. B is incorrect. The project scope statement does define
                       the requirements for every project, but it is project-specific. C is incorrect
                       because the project scope statement does not define the roles and
                       responsibilities of the project.

                             18. One of the stakeholders of the project you are managing asks why
                                 you consider the project scope statement so important in your project
                                 management methodology. You answer her question with which of the
                                 following?
                                  A. It is mandatory to consult the plan before authorizing any change.
                                  B. Project managers must document any changes before approving or
                                     declining them.
                                  C. The project scope helps the project manager determine if a change is
                                     within or outside of scope.
                                  D. The project plan and earned value management (EVM) work together to
                                     assess the risk involved with proposed changes.
                                 C. The project scope statement can help the project management team
                                 determine if a proposed change is within or outside of the project
                                 boundaries. A, B, and D are correct statements, but they do not answer the
                                 question in regard to the importance of the project scope statement.
                             19. You are the project manager for a large construction project. The architect
                                 has provided your project team with blueprints detailing the exact layout of
                                 the building your team will be creating. He insists that the team follow the
                                 blueprints as he's designed them. The blueprints are an example of which one
                                 of the following?
                                  A. Project specifications
                                  B. Approval requirements
                                  C. Project constraints
                                  D. Initially defined risks
                                 A. Blueprints are an example of the project specifications. B is incorrect
                                 because this is not an example of approval requirements. C is incorrect
                                 because this is not an example of a constraint. D is also incorrect because the
                                 blueprints are not examples of initially defined risks.
                             20. Complete this sentence: Project scope management is primarily concerned
                                 with defining and controlling ________________________.
                                  A. What is and is not included in the project
                                  B. What is and is not included in the product
                                  C. Changes to the project scope
                                  D. Changes to the configuration management system
                                 A. Project scope management is primarily concerned with defining and
                                 controlling what is and is not included in the project. B, C, and D are all
                                 incorrect statements.

                     In this chapter, you will
                        * Plan schedule management
                        * Define the project activities
                        * Sequence the project activities
                        * Estimate the resources for the defined activities
                        * Estimate how long the activities will take to complete
                        * Develop the project schedule
                        * Control the project schedule




                   Time has a funny way of sneaking up on you--and then easing on by. As a project man-
                   ager, you've got stakeholders, project team members, and management all worried
                   about your project deliverables, how the project is moving forward, and when, oh
                   when, the project will be done. You've also got vacations, sick days, demands from
                   other project managers, and delays from vendors to deal with.

                       Management frets over how much a project will cost. Project customers fret over
                   the deliverables the project will create. Everyone, as it turns out, frets over how long the
                   project will take. Of course I'm talking about the Triple Constraints of Project Manage-
                   ment: cost, scope, and time. If any one of these constraints is out of balance with the
                   other two, the project is unlikely to succeed. Time, as it happens, is often the toughest
                   of the three constraints to manage, because interruptions come from all sides of the
                   project.
                       Your Project Management Institute (PMI) exam and this chapter will focus on seven
                   key project management processes in project time management. The processes within
                   project time management, like much of project management, are interdependent on
                   one another and on other processes in the project management life cycle.
                       Let's get into project time management right now!

                         Planning Schedule Management
                         The project management planning processes are iterative, as you know, and will hap-
                         pen over and over throughout the project. You and the project team--and even some
                         key stakeholders--will work together to define the project's schedule management
                         plan. This will happen early in the project's planning processes, but chances are good
                         you'll need to return to schedule management planning to adjust, replan, or focus on
                         the schedule you've created for the project.
                             Planning schedule management is not the creation of the actual project schedule.
                         That'd be too easy. Instead, the schedule management plan defines how the project's
                         policies and procedures for managing the project schedule will take place. You'll define
                         the procedures for doing the other six processes within the knowledge area of time
                         management:

                              * Define the project activities
                              * Sequence the project activities
                              * Estimate activity resources
                              * Estimate activity durations
                              * Develop the project schedule
                              * Control the schedule

                             In order to do this planning process, you'll gather your project team, your key stake-
                         holders, and subject matter experts like people from management and consultants to
                         help you plan what it is you're about to schedule. You'll need the project management
                         plan, the project charter, enterprise environmental factors, and organizational process
                         assets. I like to highlight organizational process assets in my PMP Boot Camp because
                         this is like a PMI code word for templates from past projects.

                         Creating the Schedule Management Plan
                         The actual process of creating the schedule management plan involves you, the project
                         team, and other experts meeting to discuss and agree upon the policies and procedures
                         the schedule management processes should have. You'll rely on organizational process
                         assets for much of the discussion: historical information, past project information, and
                         existing organizational processes.
                              This event of creating the schedule management plan may also include the identifi-
                         cation and approval of the tools and techniques for scheduling and controlling the
                         project work. For example, an organization may not allow more than a certain number
                         of hours per employee on the project. Or the organization could prevent certain activi-
                         ties from being done in tandem because of the associated risks. Every organization and
                         their approach will be different, so you'll need to know if your company has any restric-
                         tions, scheduling rules, or policies on overtime, labor utilization, or coordination of
                         resources. These will all affect the actual schedule of the project and should be docu-
                         mented in the project's schedule management plan.

                                                                                                                               209
                       During the creation of the schedule management plan, you'll also identify any soft-
                   ware you'll utilize for scheduling the project work, tracking project performance, task
                   completion, workflow management, and reporting. This is the project management
                   information system that will assist you in the project management duties.

                   Examining the Schedule Management Plan
                   The schedule management plan could be adapted from a previous project or, if you




                                                                                                                                             PART II
                   need to, you could design the plan from scratch. For your CAPM and the PMP examina-
                   tion, you should be familiar with the information documented in the plan:

                       * Project schedule model development This is the approved scheduling
                         methodology and project management information system that will help you
                         develop the project schedule.
                        * Project schedule model maintenance This component of the plan is what
                          you'll use when you update the project progress.
                        * Level of accuracy Define the confidence need in the project duration
                          estimating (such as +/-48 hours or 10 percent), any rounding of hours (for
                          example, you could say the smallest task assignment is one work day), and
                          how confident you are to meet the project's deadline if one exists.
                        * Units of measure Your schedule management plan can define the schedule
                          in hours, days, weeks, or even percentage of employee schedule.
                        * Organizational procedure links The schedule management plan is part of
                          the overall project management plan and is a project deliverable that will
                          become part of historical information. The schedule management plan
                          should be linked to the approved organizational policies and preferences.
                        * Control thresholds Depending on the confidence in the activity duration
                          estimates, a level of tolerance for the project schedule should be identified,
                          such as +/-10 percent. This is considered the threshold or tolerance for error.
                          Any value outside of the 10 percent will be a cause for a corrective action in
                          the project.
                        * Rules of performance measurement The schedule management plan
                          should define how the project will be measured for performance. The most
                          common approach is a suite of formulas called earned value management.
                          (I'll discuss these in detail in Chapter 7 on cost management.)
                        * Reporting formats Based on project performance, the project manager will
                          need to report the schedule status to management, key stakeholders, and
                          project customers.
                        * Process descriptions The schedule management plan will define the
                          schedule management activities and the associated activities the project
                          manager and project team are expected to complete.

                         Defining the Project Activities
                         When a project is first initiated, project managers often focus immediately on the labor
                         and activities that will be required to complete the project work. But that focus ignores
                         the scope. In Chapter 5, I discussed the project scope and the work breakdown structure
                         (WBS) as prerequisites to defining the project activities. For your PMI examination,
                         here's the sequence of events that the project manager should have in place before get-
                         ting to the work the project team will complete:

                              * Project scope statement
                              * Work breakdown structure (WBS)
                              * WBS dictionary
                              * Work packages
                              * Schedule activities

                              The work package, the smallest item in the WBS, is broken down into schedule ac-
                         tivities, which include the labor to create the things defined in the WBS. The WBS, of
                         course, reflects the project scope statement. While the preceding list is the logical se-
                         quence of how the project management team will work together to create the activity
                         list, there are actually just four inputs to activity definition:

                              * Enterprise environmental factors
                              * Organizational process assets
                              * Scope baseline
                              * Schedule management plan

                             These inputs and the order of precedence mentioned earlier will help the project
                         manager define the activities to actually create the components of the project scope.
                         We're still in the planning process group, so this process is iterative. Any changes to the
                         project scope will likely cause the project manager to revisit these processes throughout
                         the project.

                         Making the Activity List
                         You and your project team are armed with the inputs I've listed previously and are ready
                         to start defining the activities in order to create the project schedule.
                             Sounds like fun, huh? This process and its complexity will be in proportion to the
                         size of the project scope. In other words, larger projects require more detail and more
                         planning time, while smaller projects, like changing all the keyboards in your company,
                         won't be all that complicated or too time-consuming to plan. My advice to you--the
                         Certified Associate in Project Management (CAPM) or Project Management Profession-
                         al (PMP) candidate--on your exam is to think of the largest project you can imagine,
                         such as creating a skyscraper, and then you'll see the reason to use all or most of these
                         project processes.

                                                                                                                                211
                      Let's take a look at the methods used to define the project activities, which the fol-
                   lowing sections explain in detail.

                   Decomposing the Work Packages
                   Yep, more decomposition. You know that the project scope is decomposed into deliv-
                   erables, and then those deliverables continue to be decomposed into work packages.
                   Work packages, of course, are the smallest item in the WBS. Now that you and your




                                                                                                                                              PART II
                   project team are focused on defining the project activities, you'll be breaking down the
                   work packages into the labor needed to create each work package.
                       Some project managers follow a sequential pattern for this process. First, they de-
                   compose the project scope into first-tier deliverables, then they decompose those proj-
                   ect deliverables into second-tier deliverables, and so on, until they've created the work
                   packages. Armed with the work packages, they'll decompose those into the schedule
                   activities we're discussing here. Other project managers will decompose the project
                   scope, then the work packages, and then create the schedule activities in one swoop.
                       Either approach, in fact, is just fine--even with our pals at the PMI. Complete de-
                   composition of the project scope down to the schedule activities is needed--how you
                   get there doesn't matter. It only matters that all of the work packages are decomposed
                   and that the project management team follows the internal policies and procedures (if
                   they exist) to create the schedule activities.

                                EXAM TIP Use a logical approach to defining the activities: project scope
                                statement, WBS, work packages, and then schedule activities.


                   Relying on Templates
                   Who wants to start a project from scratch when you've got an older, similar project just
                   waiting to be manipulated? That older, similar project is a template. Sometimes in the
                   project management world, we think of a template as an empty shell with pre-populated
                   fields and deliverables--and that's fine. A template can also be an older, similar project
                   that can be used and updated for the current project.
                       A project manager can use a standard activity list if the project work is similar to
                   past projects. There's no real advantage to starting from scratch. Templates can include
                   not only the activity list, but also the resource skills, estimated hours of effort, risks,
                   deliverables, and any relevant project work information.

                                EXAM TIP Think of templates as past project files that can be manipulated
                                and used for the current project.


                   Using Rolling Wave Planning
                   Have you ever done "the wave" at a football game? You can see the wave moving toward
                   you from across the stadium, then you're in it, and then it surges past. "Rolling wave"
                   in project management planning is iterations of planning the work and then doing the

                         project work. Progressive elaboration, which you use to create the WBS and the WBS
                         dictionary, is an example of rolling wave planning.
                              Rolling wave planning considers the big picture of what the project scope will cre-
                         ate, but focuses on the short-term activities to move the project along. Figure 6-1 shows
                         how a project to create a piece of software considers all of the project requirements for
                         the deliverable, but focuses on the immediate activities necessary to complete a portion
                         of the deliverable. Once that work is done, the project management team convenes
                         and plans how to create the next portion of the project. The team plans, does the work, and
                         then reconvenes for more planning.

                                       EXAM TIP Rolling wave planning focuses on the immediate while
                                       considering the big picture of the project. (Which is easier to plan and
                                       accomplish: what you must do this week or what you must do during a week a
                                       year from now?)

                         Using Expert Judgment
                         Let's face facts. As a project manager, you aren't always the person who knows the most
                         about the work that the project centers on. Using expert judgment is working smart, not
                         hard. The project manager relies on the project team, subject matter experts, and con-
                         sultants to help determine the work that needs to be completed to create the project
                         scope. You'll see expert judgment throughout this book and the Project Management

                                                                                                                               213
                   Body of Knowledge (PMBOK). It's simply leveraging other people's brainpower so that
                   the project manager can make the best decisions with regard to the project.

                   Creating Planning Components
                   A third element of the scope baseline is the work breakdown structure. The WBS uses a
                   component that has hooks into project time performance: a control account. A control
                   account is a marker within the WBS that tracks the performance of the work packages




                                                                                                                                             PART II
                   associated with the control account. For example, a home construction project could
                   create a control account for the basement, first floor, and second floor. The work pack-
                   ages associated with each floor of the house are tracked by the corresponding control
                   account. Now you can see an overall performance of the project, or just see how each
                   control account is performing.
                       Of course, there's no predetermined rule about how you use control accounts, ex-
                   cept that a work package can be associated only with one control account at a time. In
                   the home construction project, you could create control accounts for framing, electri-
                   cal, plumbing, even landscaping, and track the performance by these categories. The
                   performance information you'll most likely use is earned value management--some-
                   thing we'll get into in detail later in Chapter 7. For now, know that control accounts
                   allow you to track performance for separate chunks of the WBS by using earned value
                   management to track performance in time and cost.
                       Sometimes enough information just isn't available in the WBS to determine what
                   activities are needed in the activity list. Let's go back to the new home construction
                   project. Your customer in this instance knows the dimensions of the kitchen, but doesn't
                   know what type of appliances, cabinets, or even tile they want to put into their deluxe
                   kitchen. This isn't a problem at the beginning of the project because your construction
                   team can get to work building the home, but eventually the homeowners must make a
                   decision on the materials and components they'll want in their schmancy kitchen.
                       The kitchen may have a budget, but how the budget will be consumed isn't yet
                   known, because the homeowners haven't decided where in the kitchen they'll spend
                   their monies. The effort to create the deliverables in the kitchen may also fluctuate
                   based on the type of materials and deliverables the homeowners elect to include in
                   their kitchen.
                       What you can use in these instances is a planning package. A planning package is a
                   signal that decisions need to be made by a given date or instance. In our home con-
                   struction project example, a control account could capture the kitchen, while a plan-
                   ning package could represent the decision for the cabinets. Another planning package
                   could capture the appliances, and the third could capture the decision for the kitchen
                   flooring. We know these three things are needed in the kitchen (cabinets, appliances,
                   and floor), but we don't know exactly what schedule activities are needed, because not
                   enough information is yet known.

                   Examining the Activity List
                   The primary output of decomposing the work is the activity list, which is a collection of

                         extension of the WBS and will serve as a fundamental tool in creating the project sched-
                         ule. The activity list is needed to ensure that all the deliverables of the WBS are ac-
                         counted for and that the necessary work is mapped to each work package.
                              The activity list also ensures that there is no extra work included in the project. Extra
                         work costs time and money--and defeats the project scope. The WBS comprises all of
                         the components the project will create, while the activity list is made up of all the work
                         required to create the components within the WBS. In addition, the work on the activ-
                         ity list includes attributes of each identified activity. This ensures three things:

                              * That the team members are in agreement on what each activity accomplishes
                              * That the work supports and creates the WBS deliverables
                              * That the work is within the project scope


                         Documenting the Activity Attributes
                         Every activity in the activity list has attributes that must be documented. The docu-
                         mentation of the activities' characteristics will help with additional planning, risk
                         identification, resource needs, and more. Of course the activities and depth of the at-
                         tributes will vary by project discipline. For your PMI exam, here are some attributes
                         you should consider:

                              * Activity identifier
                              * Activity codes
                              * Activity description
                              * Predecessor and successor activities
                              * Logical relationships
                              * Leads and lags
                              * Resource requirements
                              * Imposed dates
                              * Constraints and assumptions
                              * Responsibility of the project team member(s) completing the work
                              * Location of the work
                              * Type and amount of effort needed to complete the work

                            These activity attributes are especially useful for generating reports. With this infor-
                         mation, you could quickly filter the activities to identify the work where a particular
                         vendor is involved. Or you could filter the events based on location, risk, and project
                         team member. You could use the activity attributes in nearly endless ways to help you
                         communicate information to management to stakeholders, and to your project team.

                                                                                                                                 215
                               EXAM TIP Level of effort (LOE) and apportioned effort (AE) can be part
                               of the activity description. LOE activities are the project maintenance type
                               activities that have to be done over and over: budgeting, reporting,
                               communicating. These activities almost always go to the project manager.
                               AE activities are activities that can't be easily broken down into individual,
                               traceable events. For example, quality assurance is part of every project
                               activity, but isn't just one activity in the project.




                                                                                                                                               PART II
                   Updating the Work Breakdown Structure
                   When creating the activity list, the project team and the project manager may discover
                   discrepancies or inadequacies in the existing WBS. Updates to the WBS allow the proj-
                   ect manager to ensure that all the needed project deliverables are included in the WBS
                   and then to map the discovered deliverables to the identified work in the activity list.
                       In addition, the elements within the WBS may not be defined fully or correctly.
                   During the decomposition of the work, elements of the WBS may need to be updated
                   to reflect the proper description of the WBS elements. The descriptions should be com-
                   plete and full and leave no room for ambiguity or misinterpretation. Finally, updates to
                   the WBS may also include cost estimates to the discovered deliverables.

                               EXAM TIP Updates to the WBS are called refinements. As the project moves
                               toward completion, refinements ensure that all of the deliverables are accounted
                               for within the WBS. They may also call for, indirectly, updates to the activity list.


                   Sequencing the Project Activities
                   Now that the activity list has been created, the activities must be arranged in a logical
                   sequence. This process calls on the project manager and the project team to identify the
                   logical relationships between activities, as well as the preferred relationship between
                   those activities. This can be accomplished in a few different ways:

                        * Computer-driven Many different scheduling and project management software
                          packages are available. These programs can help the project manager and the
                          project team determine which actions need to happen in what order and with
                          what level of discretion.
                        * Manual process In smaller projects, and on larger projects in the early
                          phases, manual sequencing may be preferred. An advantage of manual
                          sequencing is that it's easier to move around dependencies and activities than
                          it is in some programs.
                        * Blended approach A combination of manual and computer-driven
                          scheduling methods is fine. It's important to determine the correctness of the
                          activity sequence, however. Sometimes a blended approach can be more
                          complex than relying on just one or the other.

                         Considering the Inputs to Activity Sequencing
                         Figure 6-2 shows the complete process of activity sequencing. There are many ap-
                         proaches to completing activity sequencing. Perhaps the best approach, however, is
                         activity sequencing that involves the entire project team and is not just a solo activity.
                             The project manager must rely on the project team and the inputs to activity
                         sequencing:

                              * Schedule management plan This plan is needed because it will direct how
                                the activity sequence is to occur.
                               * Activity list As just mentioned, this is the list of actions needed to complete
                                 the project deliverables.
                               * Activity attributes Each scheduled activity has attributes that need to be
                                 documented. For example, the successor and predecessor of each activity, the
                                 lead and lag information, and the person responsible for completing the
                                 activity should all be documented. This information is important when it
                                 comes to schedule development and project control.
                               * Project scope statement The scope statement is needed, since it may
                                 influence the sequence of events. For example, in construction, technology, or
                                 community planning (among other project types), the scope statement may
                                 include requirements, constraints, and assumptions that will logically affect
                                 the planning of activity sequencing.
                               * Milestone list Milestones must be considered and evaluated when
                                 sequencing events to ensure that all of the work needed to reach the
                                 milestones is included.
                               * Organizational process assets If you've done this type of work in the past,
                                 you can rely on historical information to help you sequence the current work.

                         schedule.

                   Creating Network Diagrams
                   Network diagrams visualize the project work. A network diagram shows the relation-
                   ship of the work activities and how they will progress from start to completion. Net-
                   work diagrams can be extremely complex or easy to create and configure. Most network




                                                                                                                                               PART II
                   diagrams in today's project management environment use an approach called "activity-
                   on-node" to illustrate the activities and the relationships among those activities.

                               EXAM TIP Older network diagramming methods used "activity-on-arrows"
                               to represent the activities and their relationships. Don't be tempted to choose
                               activity-on-arrows, because this diagramming method is long gone from the
                               PMBOK.

                   Using the Precedence Diagramming Method
                   The precedence diagramming method (PDM) is the most common method of arrang-
                   ing the project work visually. The PDM puts the activities in boxes or circles, called
                   nodes, and connects the boxes with arrows. The arrows represent the relationships and
                   the dependencies of the work packages. The following illustration shows a simple net-
                   work diagram using PDM:

                                                                                   D

                                                                      F       H
                                                       E


                                                                      G



                               EXAM TIP PDM is the most common approach to network diagramming
                               since it's used by most project management information systems. It can also
                               be done manually, however.

                       Relationships between activities in a PDM constitute one of four different types
                   (as shown in Figure 6-3):

                       * Finish-to-start (FS) This relationship means that Task A must be completed
                         before Task B can begin. This is the most common relationship. For example,
                         the foundation must be set before the framing can begin.

                         Task relationships
                         can vary, but finish-
                         to-start is the most
                         common.




                               * Start-to-start (SS) This relationship means that Task A must start before
                                 Task B can start. This relationship allows both activities to happen in tandem.
                                 For example, a crew of painters is painting a house. Task A is to scrape the
                                 flecking paint off the house, and Task B is to prime the house. The workers
                                 scraping the house must start before the other workers can begin priming the
                                 house. All of the scraping doesn't have to be completed before the priming
                                 can start, just some of it.
                               * Finish-to-finish (FF) This relationship means that Task A must be completed
                                 before Task B is completed. Ideally, the two tasks should finish at exactly the
                                 same time, but this is not always the case. For example, two teams of electricians
                                 may be working together to install new telephone cables throughout a building
                                 by Monday morning. Team A is pulling the cable to each office. Team B,
                                 meanwhile, is connecting the cables to wall jacks and connecting the
                                 telephones. Team A must pull the cable to the office so that Team B can
                                 complete their activity. The activities need to be completed at nearly the same
                                 time, by Monday morning, so that the new phones are functional.
                               * Start-to-finish (SF) This relationship is unusual and is rarely used. It
                                 requires that Task A start so that Task B may finish. Such relationships may be
                                 encountered in construction and manufacturing. It is also known as just-in-
                                 time (JIT) scheduling. An example is a construction of a shoe store. The end of
                                 the construction is soon, but an exact date is not known. The owner of the
                                 shoe store doesn't want to order the shoe inventory until the construction is

                                                                                                  Chapter 6: Managing Project Time

                                                                                                                                 219
                          nearly complete. The start of the construction tasks dictates when the
                          inventory of the shoes is ordered.


                               EXAM TIP I like to use the just-in-time scheduling as a practical way to
                               describe a start-to-finish relationship. In my examples, it's really some soft logic
                               by the scheduler, as lead time for the ordering of the shoes could account for




                                                                                                                                               PART II
                               the construction of the project. Having said that, I still like to use something
                               physical that most people can visualize and relate to. Now I'll get geeky--well,
                               geekier. A true example of a start-to-finish relationship involves chemical
                               reactions, where a chemical reaction cannot finish before another reaction
                               starts. In this chemical environment, it is hard logic--the reaction must happen
                               in a particular order to get the desired effect.

                   Utilizing Network Templates
                   Just as a project manager can rely on WBS templates, network templates may be avail-
                   able to streamline the planning process or to conform to a predetermined standard.
                   Network templates can represent an entire project, if appropriate, although portions of
                   a network template, such as the required project management activities, are common.
                       The portions of a network template are also known as subnets or fragnets. Subnets
                   are often associated with repetitive actions within a network diagram. For example,
                   each floor in a high-rise apartment building may undergo the same or similar actions
                   during construction. Rather than complete the network diagram for each floor, a subnet
                   can be implemented.

                   Determining the Activity Dependencies
                   The progression of the project is built on the sequence of activities. In other words,
                   predecessor activities must be complete before successor activities can begin. The fol-
                   lowing are the dependencies you should know for your CAPM or PMP exam:

                       * Mandatory dependencies These dependencies are the natural order of
                         activities. For example, you can't begin building your house until your
                         foundation is in place. These relationships are called hard logic.
                        * Discretionary dependencies These dependencies are the preferred order of
                          activities. Project managers should use these relationships at their discretion,
                          and document the logic behind the decision. Discretionary dependencies
                          allow activities to happen in a preferred order because of best practices,
                          conditions unique to the project work, or because of external events. For
                          example, a painting project typically allows the primer and the paint to be
                          applied within hours of each other. Due to the expected high humidity during
                          the project, however, all of the building will be completely primed before the
                          paint can be applied. These relationships are also known as soft logic, preferred
                          logic, or preferential logic.

                              * External dependencies As the name implies, these are dependencies outside
                                of the project's control. Examples include the delivery of equipment from a
                                vendor, the deliverable of another project, or the decision of a committee,
                                lawsuit, or expected new law.
                              * Internal dependencies Some relationships are internal to the project or the
                                organization. For example, the project team must create the software as part of
                                the project's deliverable before the software can be tested for quality control.

                         Considering Leads and Lags
                         Leads and lags are values added to activities to slightly alter the relationship between
                         two or more activities. For example, a finish-to-start relationship may exist between ap-
                         plying primer to a warehouse and applying the paint. The project manager in this sce-
                         nario has decided to add one day of lead time to the activity of painting the warehouse.
                         Now the painting can begin one day before the priming is scheduled to end. Lead time
                         is considered a negative value, because time is subtracted from the downstream activity
                         to bring it closer to the start of the project.
                             Lag time is waiting time. Imagine a project to install wood floors in an office build-
                         ing. Currently, there is a finish-to-start relationship between staining the floors and
                         adding a layer of shellac to seal them. The project manager has elected, because of the
                         humidity in the building, to add two days of lag time to the downstream activity of
                         sealing the floors. Now the shellac cannot be applied immediately after the stain, but
                         must wait two additional days. Lag time is considered a positive value, since time is
                         added to the project schedule.
                             The following illustration shows the difference be-
                         tween lead and lag times. Leads and lags must be con-
                         sidered in the project schedule, since an abundance of
                         lag time can increase the project's duration. An abun-
                         dance of lead time, while decreasing duration, may
                         increase risks.

                                       EXAM TIP Lead time is always "accelerated time" and is negative time
                                       because the work is moving closer to the project start date. Lag time is always
                                       waiting time and is considered positive time because the project manager is
                                       adding time to the project schedule.

                                                                                                                                221
                   Estimating the Project Resources
                   Resources include materials, equipment, and people. After the project manager and the
                   project team have worked together to determine the sequence of the activities, they now
                   have to determine which resources are needed for each activity, as well as how much of
                   each resource. As you can guess, resource estimating goes hand in hand with cost estimat-
                   ing (which we'll discuss in Chapter 7). After all, if you need a metric ton of pea gravel,




                                                                                                                                              PART II
                   that's a resource estimate, but someone's got to pay for that metric ton of pea gravel.
                       To estimate the demand for the project resources, you'll need several inputs:

                        * Schedule management plan
                        * Activity list
                        * The attributes of each activity
                        * The availability of the resources you'll need, in the form of two calendars:
                          * Resource calendars let you know when individual resources are available.
                            This calendar tells you when Bob has scheduled a vacation, when a piece of
                            equipment that your project needs is already scheduled for use, and even
                            when facilities like meeting rooms are available.
                          * Project calendars communicate when the project work may take place. For
                            example, your project may allow work to happen between 6 A.M. and 6 P.M.,
                            Monday through Friday. Your project calendar will also identify any holidays
                            when the project work won't happen.
                        * Risk register
                        * Activity cost estimates
                        * Enterprise environmental factors
                        * Organizational process assets


                   Using Expert Judgment
                   The project manager and the project team have worked together to create the WBS, the
                   activity list, and the sequence of activities, so it makes sense that they'll continue to
                   work together to create the resource estimates. And they do. According to the PMBOK,
                   the project management team may work with experts to help make the best decisions.
                   This is using the old standby, "expert judgment," when the project manager relies on
                   someone more knowledgeable to help make the best decision.

                   Identifying Alternatives
                   As the project management team determines what resources are needed, there will be
                   plenty of opportunities to determine which solution is the best solution for the project.
                   Whenever more than one solution is presented, this is called Alternative analysis. Alter-
                   native analysis comes in many different flavors:

              222
                              * Resources       For example, employees or consultants, junior or senior engineers
                              * Tools and equipment           Such as power tools or hand-held tools, newer versus
                                older machinery
                              * Types of materials        For example, oak versus plywood
                              * Make-or-buy decisions           For instance, build your own software or buy a
                                solution from a vendor


                                       EXAM TIP Alternative analysis is used throughout the PMBOK, so you'll
                                       likely see this term on the PMP exam. Whenever you have two feasible choices
                                       for a component in your project, you're working with alternative analysis.

                         Relying on Published Estimating Data
                         If you are a project manager in construction, the cost of the labor you use, the materials
                         you routinely work with, and seasonal factors you consider for each project typically
                         vary, depending on what part of the country, or even the world, your project is operat-
                         ing within. Many companies provide estimating data on the resources your project can
                         purchase based on the geographical locales the project takes place in, supply and de-
                         mand, and the season of your purchases. Published estimating data helps the project
                         management team determine an exact cost of the resources the project will utilize.

                         Using Bottom-Up Estimating
                         Every time I mention bottom-up estimating in one of my seminars, someone snickers
                         and pantomimes drinking a shot of booze. Ha-ha.
                             Bottom-up estimating is the most accurate time-and-cost estimating approach a
                         project manager can use. This estimating approach starts at "the bottom" of the project
                         and considers every activity, its predecessor and successor activities, and the exact
                         amount of resources needed to complete each activity. Bottom-up estimating accounts
                         for all of the resources needed to complete all of the project work. While it is the most
                         accurate estimating approach, it is also the most time-consuming.

                                       EXAM TIP You'll see bottom-up estimating again in Chapter 7, which
                                       examines cost estimating. To complete bottom-up estimating, especially for
                                       costs, a WBS must be present. Bottom-up estimating for costs is also known
                                       as creating the definitive estimate.

                         Examining the Activity Resource Estimates
                         So what do you get when the project manager, the project team, and all your experts
                         complete the activity resource process? You get the requirements for all the project re-
                         sources. Not a trick question! The process allows the project manager, the project team,

                                                                                                 Chapter 6: Managing Project Time

                                                                                                                                223
                   management, and your key stakeholders to see the needed resources to complete each
                   work package in the WBS. Specifically, at the end of this process you'll have:

                        * Resource requirements for each activity You'll know what resources are
                          needed, the assumption your project management team used to create the
                          requirements, and the basis for each estimate.
                        * Updates to the project documents You may have errors and omissions,




                                                                                                                                              PART II
                          change requests, and discoveries about and around the activities that you're
                          estimating. If the activities or their attributes change, you'll have to update
                          your original activity list to reflect these changes. Updates to the calendar are
                          based on the creation of the activity resource requirements. If change requests
                          enter the project, the resource availability and demand may shift, which could
                          affect the resource calendar.
                        * Resource breakdown structure This is a hierarchical breakdown of the
                          project resources by category and resource type. For example, you could have a
                          category of equipment, a category of human resources, and a category of
                          materials. Within each category, you could identify the types of equipment
                          your project will use, the types of human resources, and the types of materials.


                   Estimating Activity Durations
                   How many times have you heard management ask, "Now how long will all of this take?"
                   Countless times, right? And maybe right after that: "How much will all of this cost?"
                   We'll talk about cost estimates in Chapter 7. For now, let's talk about time.
                        The answer to the question "How long will it take?" depends on the accuracy of the
                   estimates, the consistency of the work, and other variables within the project. The best
                   a project manager can do is to create honest estimates based on the information pro-
                   vided. Until the schedule is finalized, no one will know the duration of the project.
                        First, you identify the activities, sequence the activities, define the resources, and
                   then estimate durations. These processes are needed to complete the project schedule
                   and the project duration estimate. These four processes are iterated as more informa-
                   tion becomes available. If the proposed schedule is acceptable, the project can move
                   forward. If the proposed schedule takes too long, the scheduler can use a few strategies
                   to compress the project. We'll discuss the art of scheduling in a few moments.
                        Activity duration estimates, like the activity list and the WBS, don't come from the
                   project manager--they come from the people completing the work. The estimates may
                   also undergo progressive elaboration. In this section, we'll examine the approach to
                   completing activity duration estimates, the basis of these estimates, and allow for activ-
                   ity list updates.

                   Considering the Activity Duration Estimate Inputs
                   The importance of accurate estimates is paramount. The activity duration estimates will be
                   used to create the project schedule and to predict when the project should end. Inaccurate

                         estimates could cost the performing organization thousands of dollars in fines, missed
                         opportunities, lost customers, or worse. To create accurate estimates, the project manager
                         and the project team will rely on several inputs:

                              * Schedule management plan You'll need this as an input because it guides
                                the process of estimating the activity durations.
                              * Activity lists You know this, right? Activity lists are the work elements
                                necessary to create the deliverables.
                              * Activity attributes Effort is the amount of labor applied to a task. Duration,
                                on the other hand, is how long the task is expected to take with the given
                                amount of labor. For example, a task to unload a freight truck may take eight
                                hours with two people assigned to the task. If the effort is increased by adding
                                more labor to the task (in this instance, more people), then the duration of
                                the task is decreased. Some activities, however, have a fixed duration and are
                                not affected by the amount of labor assigned to the task. For example,
                                installing a piece of software on a computer will take the same amount of
                                time if one computer administrator is completing the work or if two computer
                                administrators are doing it.
                              * Activity resource requirements Activity resource requirements define the
                                resources (human or otherwise) needed to complete a particular activity. For
                                example, a project to build a home will require lots of different resources:
                                plumbers, electricians, architects, framers, and landscapers. The project
                                manager would not, however, assign all of the different resources to every
                                task, but only to the tasks that the resource was qualified to complete.
                                Remember that resources also include equipment and materials, so those are
                                identified as part of the activity resource requirements as well.
                              * Resource calendars The project manager will need to know when resources
                                are, or are not, available for utilization on the project.
                              * The project scope statement Identification of the project constraints and
                                assumptions is needed, since they may influence the estimates. The project
                                scope statement provides this information.
                              * Risk register The risk register can help the project manager and the project
                                team identify key activities and their associated risks. This information may
                                influence the constraints and task relationships in the project. Should risks
                                come true, there may also be consideration of the timing of risk responses.
                                (I'll talk more about risk management in Chapter 11.)
                              * Resource breakdown structure The resource breakdown structure visualizes
                                the categories of resources and their characteristics. Remember that resources
                                may not be just people, but could also represent facilities, equipment, and
                                materials.
                              * Organizational process assets Okay, the big one here is historical
                                information. Historical information is always an excellent source of data on




06-ch06.indd 224                                                                                                                 7/10/2013 1:46:58 AM

                           activity duration estimates. It can come from several sources, such as the
                           following:

                           * Historical information can come from project files on other projects within
                             the organization.
                           * Commercial duration-estimating databases can offer information on how
                             long industry-specific activities should take. These databases should take




                                                                                                                                              PART II
                             into consideration the materials, the experience of the resources, and define
                             the assumptions the predicted work duration is based upon.
                           * Project team members may recollect information regarding the expected
                             duration of activities. While these inputs are valuable, they are generally
                             less valuable than documented sources, such as other project files or the
                             commercial databases.
                        * Enterprise environmental factors Your organization may require the project
                          manager to use duration-estimating datasets, productivity metrics based on
                          your industry, or other commercially available information.

                        You'll need to consider the resource capabilities of your project team. Consider a
                   task in an architectural firm. Reason says that a senior architect assigned to the task will
                   complete it faster than a junior architect will. Material resources can also influence ac-
                   tivity time. Consider predrilled cabinets versus cabinets that require the carpenter to
                   drill each cabinet as it's installed. The predrilled cabinets allow the job to be completed
                   faster.
                        The project manager should also reference the project management plan. Specifi-
                   cally, the project manager and the project team must evaluate the risk register. We'll
                   discuss risk in detail in Chapter 11. Risks, good or bad, can influence the estimated
                   duration of activities. The risks of each activity should be identified, analyzed, and then
                   predicted as to their probability and impact. If risk mitigation tasks are added to the
                   schedule, the mitigation activities will need their duration estimated and then se-
                   quenced into the schedule in the proper order.

                   Using Analogous Estimating
                   Analogous estimating relies on historical information to predict current activity dura-
                   tions. Analogous estimating is also known as top-down estimating and is a form of
                   expert judgment. To use analogous estimating, activities from the historical project that
                   are similar in nature are used to predict similar activities in the current project.
                       A project manager must consider if the work has been done before and, if so, what
                   help the historical information provides. The project manager must consider the re-
                   sources, project team members, and equipment that completed the activities in the
                   previous project compared with the resources available for the current project. Ideally,
                   the activities should be more than similar; they should be identical. And the resources
                   that completed the work in the past should be the same resources used in completing
                   the current work. When the only source of activity duration estimates is the project




06-ch06.indd 225                                                                                                                 7/10/2013 1:46:58 AM

              226
                         team members, instead of expert judgment and historical information, your estimates
                         will be uncertain and inherently risky.

                                       EXAM TIP Analogous estimating uses historical information and is more
                                       reliable than predictions from the project team members.

                         Applying Parametric Estimates
                         Quantitatively based durations use mathematical formulas to predict how long an ac-
                         tivity will take based on the "quantities" of work to be completed. For example, a com-
                         mercial printer needs to print 100,000 brochures. The workers include two press opera-
                         tors and two bindery experts to fold and package the brochures. Notice how the dura-
                         tion is how long the activity will take to complete, while the effort is the total number
                         of hours (labor) invested because of the resources involved. The decomposed work,
                         with quantitative factors, is shown in Table 6-1.

                                       EXAM TIP Duration is how long an activity takes, while effort is the billable
                                       time for the labor to complete the activity. Consider an activity that is
                                       scheduled to last 40 hours. The project manager must consider the cost of the
                                       time of the person assigned to complete the project work. For example, a
                                       senior engineer may be able to complete the activity in 40 consecutive work
                                       hours, but the cost of this employee's time may be more than the value of the
                                       activity. A part-time employee may be able to complete the task in two
                                       segments of 20 hours, at a substantially lower rate.

                         Creating a Three-Point Estimate
                         How confident can a project manager be when it comes to estimating? If the project
                         work has been done before in past projects, then the level of confidence in the duration
                         estimate is probably high. But if the work has never been done before, there are lots of
                         unknowns--and with them comes risk. To mitigate the risk, the project manager can
                         use a three-point estimate. A three-point estimate requires that each activity have three
                         estimates: optimistic, most likely, and pessimistic estimates. This is also known as sim-
                         ple averaging. Based on these three estimates, an average can be created to predict how
                         long the activity should take (see Figure 6-4).

                                   EXAM TIP If this sounds familiar to the Program Evaluation and Review
                                   Technique (PERT), you're correct. The formula for PERT is similar to the three-
                                   point estimate. PERT is (Optimistic + (4 x Most Likely) + Pessimistic)/6. The
                                   denominator is six in PERT because you're using six factors. This is also known
                                   as weighted averaging.

                   Factoring in Reserve Time
                   Parkinson's Law states: "Work expands so as to fill the time available for its comple-
                   tion." This little nugget of wisdom is oh-so-true. Consider a project team member who
                   knows an activity should last 24 hours. The team member decides, in his own wisdom,
                   to say that the activity will last 32 hours. These extra 8 hours, he figures, will allow
                   plenty of time for the work to be completed should any unforeseen incidents pop up.
                   The trouble is, however, that the task will magically expand to require the complete 32
                   hours. Why does this happen? Consider the following:

                         * Hidden time Hidden time, the time factored in by the project team member,
                           is secret. No one, especially the project manager, knows why the extra time has
                           been factored into the activity. The team member can then "enjoy" the extra
                           time to complete the task at his leisure.
                         * Procrastination Most people put off starting a task until the last possible
                           minute. The trouble with bloated, hidden time is that people may wait
                           through the additional time they've secretly factored into the activity.

                                 Unfortunately, if something does go awry in completing the activity, the work
                                 result is later than predicted.
                              * Demands Project team members may be assigned to multiple projects with
                                multiple demands. The requirement to move from project to project can shift
                                focus, result in a loss of concentration, and require additional ramp-up time
                                as workers shift from activity to activity. The demand for multitasking allows
                                project team members to take advantage of hidden time.
                              * On schedule Activities are typically completed on schedule or later, but
                                rarely early. Workers who have bloated the activity duration estimates may
                                finish their task ahead of when they promised, but they have a tendency to
                                hold onto those results until the activity's due date. This is because workers
                                aren't usually rewarded for completing work early. In addition, workers don't
                                want to reveal the inaccuracies in their time estimates. Workers may believe
                                future estimates may be based on actual work durations rather than estimates,
                                so they'll "sandbag" the results to protect themselves--and finish "on
                                schedule."

                             So what's a project manager to do? First off, the project manager should strive to
                         incorporate historical information and expert judgment on which to predicate accurate
                         estimates. Second, the project manager should stress a genuine need for accurate dura-
                         tion estimates. Finally, the project manager can incorporate a reserve time.
                             A reserve time is a percentage of the project duration or a preset number of work
                         periods, and is usually added to the end of the project schedule or just in front of reach-
                         ing project milestones. Reserve time may also be added to individual activity durations
                         based on risk or uncertainty in the activity duration. When activities are completed late,
                         the additional time for the activity is subtracted from the reserve time. As the project
                         moves forward, the reserve time can be reduced or eliminated as the project manager
                         sees fit. Reserve time decisions should be documented.

                         Evaluating the Estimates
                         Estimating activities provides two outputs:

                              * Activity duration estimates Activity duration estimates reflect how long
                                each activity will take to complete. Duration estimates should include an
                                acknowledgment of the range of variance. For example, an activity whose
                                duration is expected to be one week may have a range of variance of one week
                                plus or minus three days. This means that the work can take up to eight days
                                or as few as two days, assuming a five-day week.
                              * Project documents updates Any assumptions made during the activity
                                estimating process should be identified. In addition, any historical
                                information, subject matter experts, or commercial estimating databases that
                                were used should also be documented for future reference. During the
                                estimating process, there may be discoveries of missing activities within the

                                                                                                                                229

                           reflected in the activity list for the project


                   Developing the Project Schedule
                   The project manager, the project team, and possibly even the key stakeholders, will
                   examine the inputs previously described and apply the techniques discussed in this sec-




                                                                                                                                              PART II
                   tion to create a feasible schedule for the project. The point of the project schedule is to
                   complete the project scope in the shortest possible time without incurring exceptional
                   costs, risks, or a loss of quality.
                       Creating the project schedule is part of the planning process group. It is calendar-
                   based and relies on both the project network diagram and the accuracy of time esti-
                   mates. When the project manager creates the project schedule, she'll also reference the
                   risk register. The identified risks and their associated responses can affect the sequence
                   of the project work and when the project work can take place. In addition, if a risk
                   comes to fruition, the risk event may affect the scheduling of the resources and the
                   project completion date.

                   Applying Mathematical Analysis
                   Mathematical analysis is the process of factoring theoretical early and late start dates
                   and theoretical early and late finish dates for each activity within the project network
                   diagram (PND). The early and late dates are not the expected schedule, but rather a
                   potential schedule based on the project constraints, the likelihood of success, the avail-
                   ability of resources, and other constraints.
                        The most common approach to calculating when a project may finish is by using
                   the critical path method. It uses a "forward" and "backward" pass to reveal which ac-
                   tivities are considered critical. Activities on the critical path may not be delayed; other-
                   wise, the project end date will be delayed. The critical path is the path with the longest
                   duration to completion. Activities not on the critical path have some float (also called
                   slack) that allows some amount of delay without delaying the project end date.

                                EXAM TIP The critical path is used to determine which activities have no
                                float.You can also use the critical path to determine the earliest date for when
                                the project may be completed. There can be more than one critical path in a
                                project, and it's possible for the critical path to change.

                   Calculating Float in a PND
                   Float, or slack, is the amount of time an activity can be delayed without postponing the
                   project's completion. Technically, there are three different types of float:

                        * Free float This is the total time a single activity can be delayed without
                          affecting the early start of any successor activities.

                              * Total float This is the total time an activity can be delayed without affecting
                                project completion.
                              * Project float This is the total time the project can be delayed without
                                passing the customer-expected completion date.


                                       EXAM COACH There are a couple of different approaches to calculating
                                       float. I'm sharing the approach that I learned and that I think is the best
                                       approach.You may have learned a different method that you prefer.You won't
                                       hurt my feelings if you use your method to get the same result as my method.
                                       What's most important is that you understand the concepts of forward and
                                       backward passes, and that you can find the critical path and float in a simple
                                       network diagram.

                             Most project management software will automatically calculate float. On the CAPM
                         or PMP exam, however, candidates will be expected to calculate float manually. Don't
                         worry--it's not too tough. The following describes the process.
                             Examine the PND and find the critical path. The critical path is typically the path
                         with the longest duration and will always have zero float. The critical path is techni-
                         cally found once you complete the forward and backward passes. Start with the forward
                         pass. After the backward pass, you can identify the critical and near-critical paths, as
                         well as the float.

                              1. The early start (ES) and early finish (EF) dates are calculated first by
                                 completing the forward pass. The ES of the first task is one. The EF for the
                                 first task is its ES, plus the task duration, minus one. Don't let the "minus one
                                 value" throw you. If Task A is scheduled to last three days, it would only take
                                 three days to complete the work, right? The ES is one, the duration is three,
                                 and the EF is three, because the activity would finish within three days, not
                                 four days. The following illustration shows the start of the forward pass:

                                                                                             Chapter 6: Managing Project Time

                                                                                                                            231
                   2. The ES of the next task(s) will be the EF for the previous activity, plus one. In
                      other words, if Task A finishes on day 3, Task B and Task C can begin on day 4.
                   3. The EF for the next task(s) equals its ES plus the task duration, minus one.
                      Sound familiar?
                   4. Now each task moves forward with the forward pass. Use caution when there
                      are multiple predecessor activities; the EF with the largest value is carried
                      forward. The following illustration shows the completed forward pass:




                                                                                                                                          PART II
                   5. After the forward pass is completed, the backward pass starts at the end of the
                      PND. The backward pass is concerned with the late finish (LF) and the late
                      start (LS) of each activity. The LF for the last activity in the PND equals its EF
                      value. The LS is calculated by subtracting the duration of the activity from
                      its LF and then adding one. The one is added to accommodate the full day's
                      work; it's just the opposite of subtracting the one day in the forward pass.
                      Here's a tip: The last activity is on the critical path, so its LS will equal its ES.
                   6. The next predecessor activity's LF equals the LS of the successor activity, minus
                      one. In other words, if Task F has an LS of 11, Task D and Task E will have an
                      LF of 10. The following illustration shows the process of the backward pass:




06-ch06.indd 231                                                                                                             7/10/2013 1:46:59 AM

              232
                              7. The LS is again calculated by subtracting the task's duration from the task's LF
                                 and then adding one. The following shows the completed backward pass:




                              8. To officially calculate float, the ES is subtracted from the LS, or the EF is
                                 subtracted from the LF. Recall the total float is the amount of time a task can
                                 be delayed without affecting the project completion date. The next illustration
                                 shows the completed PND with the float exposed.

                   Encountering Scheduling on the CAPM or PMP Exam
                   Out here in the real world, where you and I work every day, we likely aren't calculating
                   float manually. On your PMI exam, however, you'll need to be able to calculate float.
                   Why? You're proving that you understand the theory and application of managing
                   project time. On your regular gig, you'll use your project management software to do
                   this magic for you. You'll encounter float, scheduling, and critical path activities on
                   the exam. You should count these questions as "gimmes" if you remember a few im-




                                                                                                                                             PART II
                   portant rules:

                        * Always draw out the network diagram presented on your scratch paper. It may
                          be used in several questions.
                         * Know how to calculate float. (The complete process was shown earlier in the
                           "Calculating Float in a PND" section.)
                         * You may encounter questions that ask on what day of the week a project will
                           end if no weekends or holidays are worked. No problem. Add up the critical
                           path, divide by 5 (Monday through Friday), and then figure out which day of
                           the week the activity will end on.
                         * You may see something like Figure 6-5 when it comes to scheduling. When
                           three numbers are presented, think three-point estimate. Optimistic is the
                           smallest number and pessimistic is the largest, so most likely, it's somewhere
                           between the two. When a number is positioned directly over the tasks, it is the
                           task duration. When a number is positioned to the upper-right of a task, this
                           represents the EF date.

                   Applying Schedule Compression
                   Schedule compression is also a mathematical approach to scheduling. The trick with
                   schedule compression, as its name implies, is calculating ways the project can get done
                   sooner than expected. Consider a construction project. The project may be slated to last


                   Figure 6-5
                   Scheduling follows
                   many rules to
                   arrive at a project
                   completion date.

                         eight months, but due to the expected cold and nasty weather typical of month 7, the
                         project manager needs to rearrange activities, where possible, to end the project as soon
                         as possible.
                             In some instances, the relationship between activities cannot be changed due to
                         hard logic or external dependencies. The relationships are fixed and must remain as
                         scheduled. Now consider the same construction company that is promised a bonus if
                         they can complete the work by the end of month 7. Now there's incentive to complete
                         the work, but there's also the fixed relationship between activities.
                             To apply duration compression, the performing organization can rely on two dif-
                         ferent methods. These methods can be used independently or together, and are ap-
                         plied to activities or to the entire project based on need, risk, and cost. The methods
                         are as follows:

                              * Crashing This approach adds more resources to activities on the critical
                                path to complete the project earlier. In the crashing process, costs grow as
                                the labor is added. Crashing doesn't always work. Consider activities that
                                have a fixed duration and won't finish faster with additional resources. The
                                project manager must also consider the expenses in relation to the gains of
                                completing on time. For example, a construction company may have been
                                promised a bonus to complete the work by a preset date, but the cost incurred
                                to hit the targeted date may be more than the bonus.
                              * Fast tracking This method changes the relationship of activities. With fast
                                tracking, activities that would normally be done in sequence are allowed to be
                                done in parallel or with some overlap. Fast tracking can be accomplished by
                                changing the relation of activities from FS (finish-to-start) to SS (start-to-start)
                                or by adding lead time to downstream activities. For example, a construction
                                company could change the relationship between painting the rooms and
                                installing the carpet by adding lead time to the carpet installation task. Before
                                the change, all of the rooms had to be painted before the carpet installers
                                could begin. With the added lead time, the carpet can be installed hours after
                                a room is painted. However, fast tracking can increase risk and may cause
                                rework in the project. Can't you just imagine those workers getting fresh paint
                                on the new carpet?


                                       EXAM TIP It's easy to remember the difference between these two actions.
                                       Crashing and cost both begin with C--we're adding resources, and too many
                                       people will "crash" into each other. Fast tracking is about speeding things up.
                                       However, haste can be risky.

                         Using a Project Simulation
                         Project simulations allow a project manager to examine the feasibility of the project sched-
                         ule under different conditions, variables, and events. For example, the project manager can




06-ch06.indd 234                                                                                                                 7/10/2013 1:46:59 AM

                                                                                                   Chapter 6: Managing Project Time

                                                                                                                                  235
                   see what would happen to a project if activities were delayed, vendors missed shipment
                   dates, or external events affected the project.
                       Simulations are often completed by use of the Monte Carlo analysis. The Monte Carlo
                   analysis, named after the world-famous gambling district of Monaco, predicts how sce-
                   narios may work out, given any number of variables. The process doesn't actually churn
                   out a specific answer, but a range of possible answers. When Monte Carlo is applied to a
                   schedule, it can examine, for example, the optimistic completion date, the pessimistic




                                                                                                                                                PART II
                   completion date, and the most likely completion date for each activity in the project.
                       As you can imagine in a typical network diagram, there are likely thousands, if not
                   millions, of combinations of tasks that complete early, late, or as expected. Monte Car-
                   lo analysis shuffles these combinations, usually through computer software, and offers
                   a range of possible end dates coupled with an expected probability for achieving each
                   end date.
                       In other words, Monte Carlo analysis is an odds-maker. The project manager choos-
                   es, or is at least influenced by, the end date with the highest odds of completion in ratio
                   to the demands for completion by an expected time. The project manager can then
                   predict with some certainty that the project has an 85 percent chance of completion by
                   a specific date.

                                EXAM TIP Monte Carlo analysis can be applied to more than just scheduling.
                                It can also be applied to cost, project variables, and, most often, to risk analysis.

                       Simulations also provide time to factor in "what-if" questions, worst-case scenarios,
                   and potential disasters. The end result of simulations is to create responses to the fea-
                   sible situations. Then, should the situations come into play, the project team is ready
                   with a planned response.

                   Using Resource-Leveling Heuristics
                   First off, a heuristic is a fancy way of saying "rule of thumb." A resource-leveling heuris-
                   tic is a method to flatten the schedule when resources are overallocated. Resource level-
                   ing can be applied using different methods to accomplish different goals. One of the
                   most common methods is to ensure that workers are not overextended on activities.
                        Resource leveling usually limits the total amount of labor a resource can contribute
                   in a given period. For example, you may have a constraint that says your project team
                   members can only work 25 hours per week on your project. If you've created a schedule
                   that requires your project team members to work 40 hours per week on your project,
                   then each team member is now overallocated on your project by 15 hours. So now you
                   have to lop off 15 hours per week per resource, which increases the total duration of
                   your project. There won't be more hours of labor, but it'll take longer on the calendar
                   to do the same amount of work.
                        Another method for resource leveling is to take resources off of noncritical path ac-
                   tivities and apply them to critical path activities to ensure that the project end date is met.

                         noncritical path with the expected duration of the critical path. When you're doing re-
                         source leveling on noncritical path activities, it's also known as resource smoothing.
                             Finally, some resources may be scarce to the project. Consider a highly skilled tech-
                         nician or consultant who is only available on a particular date to contribute to the
                         project. These resources are scheduled from the project end date, rather than from
                         the start date. This is known as reverse resource-allocation scheduling.

                         Using the Critical Chain Method
                         The critical chain method (CCM) aims to eliminate Parkinson's Law by eliminating
                         bottlenecks that hold up project progression. In the critical chain method, deadlines
                         associated with individual tasks are removed, and the only date that matters is the
                         promised due date of the project deliverable. CCM works to modify the project sched-
                         ule based on the availability of project resources rather than the pure sequence of
                         events, as in the critical path method.
                             CCM first requires the discovery of the critical path, but then applies available re-
                         sources to determine the true resource-limited schedule. Based on the availability of
                         resources to complete the project work, the critical path is often different than what it
                         would have been using the pure critical path method.
                             CCM scheduling evaluates each activity's latest possible start and finish dates. This
                         allows project managers to manage the buffer activity duration--that is, the activities
                         that are not on the critical path, but whose completion contributes to the start of criti-
                         cal path activities. In other words, the focus is on completing each activity in order to
                         complete the entire project by the promised end date.
                             The path in the network diagram that is resource-constrained is considered the crit-
                         ical chain. To accommodate the resource constraints, you can add buffers of time, called
                         feeder buffers, between noncritical chain activities before they connect to the critical
                         chain. In other words, you can pause work that's not on the critical chain so things
                         don't get crunched for the resources on the critical chain. You can also add a buffer of
                         time at the end of the project just as you would in using management reserve time.

                         Using Project Management Software
                         When it comes to project management software, take your pick: The market is full of it.
                         Project management applications are tools, not replacements, for the project manage-
                         ment processes. Many of the software tools today automate the processes of scheduling,
                         activity sequencing, work authorization, and other activities. The performing organiza-
                         tion must weigh the cost of the PMIS (project management information system) against
                         the benefits the project managers will actually see.

                         Relying on a Project Coding Structure
                         The coding structure identifies the work packages within the WBS and is then applied
                         to the PND. This allows the project manager, the project team, experts, and even key

                   stakeholders, to extract areas of the project to examine and evaluate. For example, a
                   project to create a catalog for a parts distributor may follow multiple paths to comple-
                   tion. Each path to completion has its own "family" of numbers that relate to each activ-
                   ity on the path, as outlined in Table 6-2.


                   Considering the Outputs of Schedule




                                                                                                                                              PART II
                   Development
                   After all the challenges of examining, sequencing, and calculating the project activities,
                   a working schedule is created. Schedule development, like most project management
                   planning processes, moves through progressive elaboration. As the project moves for-
                   ward, discoveries, risk events, or other conditions may require the project schedule to
                   be adjusted. In this section, we'll discuss the project schedule and how it is managed.

                   Examining the Project Schedule
                   The project schedule includes, at a minimum, a date when the project begins and a date
                   when the project is expected to end. The project schedule is considered "proposed"
                   until the resources needed to complete the project work are ascertained. In addition to

                         the schedule, the project manager should include all of the supporting details. Project
                         schedules can be presented in many different formats, such as:

                              * Project network diagram (PND) This illustrates the flow of work, the
                                relationships among activities, the critical path, and the expected project
                                end date. PNDs, when used as the project schedule, should have dates
                                associated with each project activity to show when the activity is expected
                                to start and end.
                              * Bar charts These show the start and end dates for the project and the activity
                                duration against a calendar. They are easy to read. Scheduling bar charts are
                                also called Gantt charts.
                              * Milestone charts These plot the high-level deliverables and external
                                interfaces, such as a customer walkthrough, against a calendar. Milestone
                                charts are similar to a Gantt chart, but with less detail regarding individual
                                activities. The following is an example of a milestone chart:

                                                                                                                               239
                   Utilizing the Schedule Management Plan
                   The schedule management plan is a subsidiary plan of the overall project plan. It is
                   used to control changes to the schedule. A formal schedule management plan has pro-
                   cedures that control how changes to the project plan can be proposed, accounted for,
                   and then implemented. An informal schedule management plan may consider changes
                   on an instance-by-instance basis.




                                                                                                                                             PART II
                   Updating the Resource Requirements
                   Due to resource leveling, additional resources may need to be added to the project. For
                   example, a proposed leveling may extend the project beyond an acceptable completion
                   date. To reach the project end date, the project manager elects to add additional re-
                   sources to the critical path activities. The resources the project manager adds should be
                   documented, the associated costs accounted for, and everything approved.


                   Controlling the Project Schedule
                   Schedule control is part of integrated change management, as discussed in Chapter 4.
                   Throughout a typical project, events may require updates to the project schedule. Sched-
                   ule control is concerned with three processes:

                        * The project manager works with the factors that can cause changes in the
                          schedule in an effort to confirm that the changes are agreed upon. Factors can
                          include project team members, stakeholders, management, customers, and
                          project conditions.
                        * The project manager examines the work results and conditions to determine
                          whether the schedule has changed.
                        * The project manager manages the actual change in the schedule.


                   Managing the Inputs to Schedule Control
                   Schedule control, the process of managing changes to the project schedule, is based on
                   several inputs:

                        * Project management plan
                        * Project schedule
                        * Work performance data
                        * Project calendars
                        * Schedule data
                        * Organizational process assets

                         Applying a Schedule Control System
                         A schedule control system is a formal approach to managing changes to the project
                         schedule. It considers the conditions, reasons, requests, costs, and risks of making
                         changes. It includes methods of tracking changes, approval levels based on thresholds,
                         and the documentation of approved or declined changes. The schedule control system
                         process is part of integrated change management.

                         Measuring Project Performance
                         Poor performance may result in schedule changes. Consider a project team that is com-
                         pleting its work on time, but all of the work results are unacceptable. The project team
                         may be rushing through their assignments to meet their deadline. To compensate for
                         this, the project may be changed to allow for additional quality inspections and more
                         time for activity completion. Project performance is often based on earned value man-
                         agement, which we'll discuss in Chapter 7.

                         Examining the Schedule Variance
                         The project manager must actively monitor the variances between when activities
                         are scheduled to end and when they actually end. An accumulation of differences be-
                         tween scheduled and actual dates may result in a schedule variance.
                             The project manager must also pay attention to the completion of activities on paths
                         with float, not just the critical path. Consider a project that has eight different paths to
                         completion. The project manager should first identify the critical path, but should also
                         identify the float on each path. The paths should be arranged and monitored in a hier-
                         archy from the path with smallest float to the path with the largest float. As activities are
                         completed, the float of each path should be monitored to identify any paths that may be
                         slipping from the scheduled end dates.

                         Updating the Project Schedule
                         So what happens when a schedule change occurs? The project manager must ensure
                         that the project schedule is updated to reflect the change, document the change, and
                         follow the guidelines within the schedule management plan. Any formal processes,
                         such as notifying stakeholders or management, should be followed.
                             Revisions are a special type of project schedule change that cause the project start
                         date and, more likely, the project end date to be changed. They typically stem from
                         project scope changes. Because of the additional work the new scope requires, addi-
                         tional time is needed to complete the project.
                             Schedule delays, for whatever reason, may be so drastic that the entire project has
                         to be rebaselined--that is, all of the historical information up to the point of the rebase-
                         line is eliminated. Rebaselining is a worst-case scenario and should only be used when
                         adjusting for drastic, long delays. Schedule revision is the preferred, and most com-
                         mon, approach to changing the project end date.

                   Applying Corrective Action
                   Corrective action is any method applied to bring the project schedule back into align-
                   ment with the original dates and goals for the project end date. Corrective actions are




                                                                                                                                              PART II
                   efforts to ensure that future performance meets the expected performance levels. It in-
                   cludes the following:

                        * Ensuring that the work packages are complete as scheduled. Completing a
                          work package early isn't always a good thing.
                        * Extraordinary measures to ensure that work packages complete with as little
                          delay as possible.
                        * Root-cause analysis of schedule variances.
                        * Implementing measures to recover from schedule delays.


                   Chapter Summary
                   All projects take time--time to plan the project, do the work, control the work, and
                   confirm that the work has been done according to plan. Of course, there are all those
                   other things that eat into a project's schedule: change request reviews, corrective and
                   preventive actions, defect repair, defect repair review, and scope verification. When a
                   project manager first looks at planning the project work, she and her project team will
                   consider all of the activities that will need to be completed based on the project WBS.
                       Once all the project work has been identified and the activity list has been gener-
                   ated, it's time to put the activities into the order necessary to reach the project comple-
                   tion. This means the activity attributes are considered. Those activities that must happen
                   in a particular order are using hard logic, while those activities that don't have to hap-
                   pen sequentially can use soft logic. The sequencing of the project activities happens
                   with the project management team.
                       Putting the activities in the order in which they'll happen leads to the creation of a
                   project network diagram. It's pretty. The PND most likely will be using the precedence
                   diagramming method--that's where you can clearly identify the predecessors and suc-
                   cessors within the project. The relationships between the activities signal the conditions
                   that must be true to allow the work to progress.
                       Once the work has been organized and visualized, it's time to staff it. This is project
                   resource estimating, which also contributes to the cost of the project. Resource utiliza-
                   tion considers not only the people that your project will need, but also the materials
                   and equipment. This activity considers the quantity of resources the project demands and
                   when the resources are available. This is a tricky business in large projects, so rolling
                   wave planning may be incorporated into the project.

                              Of course, management and the project stakeholders will want to know how long
                         the project work will take to complete. Now that the network diagram has been cre-
                         ated and the resources have been identified, the project management team can more
                         accurately estimate the project duration. The project manager can use the identified
                         labor, which is commonly done, or the project manager can rely on analogous esti-
                         mating, which isn't as accurate as bottom-up estimating. In some instances, the proj-
                         ect manager can also use parametric estimating to predict the project duration.
                              As the project manager examines the network diagram, he'll want to find opportu-
                         nities to shift resources and determine where delays will affect the project end date. Of
                         course, I'm talking about the critical path--the path with no float and whose activities
                         cannot, better not, be delayed, or the project end date will go beyond what's been
                         scheduled. Activities not on the critical path have float and can often be delayed if
                         needed. You'll have a few questions on float, and I encourage you to watch the videos
                         to nail down the float process.
                              A project manager must control the project schedule. Sometimes this means com-
                         pressing the project schedule. Recall that crashing adds resources to the project work,
                         but crashing adds cost. The project manager can only crash the project work if the ac-
                         tivities are effort-driven. Activities that are of fixed duration, such as printing a million
                         booklets on a particular printing press, won't get done faster just because the project
                         manager adds labor to the activities. The printing press can only print so many booklets
                         per hour. Other activities can benefit from fast tracking; this approach allows phases to
                         overlap, but increases the project risk.

                         Key Terms
                         Activity list The primary output of breaking down the WBS work packages.
                         Alternative analysis The identification of more than one solution. Consider roles,
                         materials, tools, and approaches to the project work.
                         Analogous estimating A somewhat unreliable estimating approach that relies on his-
                         torical information to predict what current activity durations should be. Analogous
                         estimating is more reliable, however, than team member recollections. Analogous esti-
                         mating is also known as top-down estimating and is a form of expert judgment.
                         Bottom-up estimating The most accurate time-and-cost estimating approach a proj-
                         ect manager can use. This estimating approach starts at "the bottom" of the project and
                         considers every activity, its predecessor and successor activities, and the exact amount
                         of resources needed to complete each activity.
                         Control account A WBS entry that considers the time, cost, and scope measurements
                         for that deliverable within the WBS. The estimated performance is compared against
                         the actual performance to measure overall performance for the deliverables within that
                         control account. The specifics of a control account are documented in a control account
                         plan.

                   Control threshold A predetermined range of acceptable variances, such as +/-10 per-
                   cent off schedule. Should the variance exceed the threshold, then project control pro-
                   cesses and corrected actions will be enacted.
                   Crashing A schedule compression approach that adds more resources to activities on
                   the critical path to complete the project earlier. When crashing a project, costs are add-
                   ed because the associated labor and sometimes resources (such as faster equipment)
                   cause costs to increase.

                   Critical chain method A network analysis approach where the deadlines associated
                   with individual tasks are removed and the only date that matters is the promised due
                   date of the project deliverable. CCM works to modify the project schedule based on
                   the availability of project resources rather than on the pure sequence of events, as in the
                   critical path method.
                   Critical path The path in the project network diagram that cannot be delayed, other-
                   wise the project completion date will be late. There can be more than one critical path.
                   Activities in the critical path have no float.
                   Discretionary dependencies These dependencies are the preferred order of activities.
                   Project managers should use these relationships at their discretion and should docu-
                   ment the logic behind the decision. Discretionary dependencies allow activities to hap-
                   pen in a preferred order because of best practices, conditions unique to the project
                   work, or external events. Also known as preferential or soft logic.
                   Early finish The earliest a project activity can finish. Used in the forward pass proce-
                   dure to discover the critical path and the project float.
                   Early start The earliest a project activity can begin. Used in the forward pass proce-
                   dure to discover the critical path and the project float.
                   External dependencies As the name implies, these are dependencies outside of the
                   project's control. Examples include the delivery of equipment from a vendor, the deliver-
                   able of another project, or the decision of a committee, lawsuit, or expected new law.
                   Fast tracking A schedule compression method that changes the relationship of ac-
                   tivities. With fast tracking, activities that would normally be done in sequence are al-
                   lowed to be done in parallel or with some overlap. Fast tracking can be accomplished
                   by changing the relation of activities from FS to SS or even FF or by adding lead time to
                   downstream activities. However, fast tracking does add risk to the project.
                   Finish-to-finish An activity relationship type that requires the current activity to be
                   finished before its successor can finish.
                   Finish-to-start An activity relationship type that requires the current activity to be
                   finished before its successor can start.
                   Fragnet A representation of a project network diagram that is often used for out-
                   sourced portions of a project, repetitive work within a project, or a subproject. Also
                   called a subnet.

                         Free float This is the total time a single activity can be delayed without affecting the
                         early start of its immediately following successor activities.
                         Hard logic Logic that describes activities that must happen in a particular order. For
                         example, the dirt must be excavated before the foundation can be built. The foundation
                         must be in place before the framing can begin. Also known as a mandatory dependency.
                         Internal dependencies Internal relationships to the project or the organization. For
                         example, the project team must create the software as part of the project's deliverable
                         before the software can be tested for quality control.
                         Lag time Positive time that moves two or more activities further apart.
                         Late finish The latest a project activity can finish. Used in the backward pass proce-
                         dure to discover the critical path and the project float.
                         Late start The latest a project activity can begin. Used in the backward pass procedure
                         to discover the critical path and the project float.
                         Lead time Negative time that allows two or more activities to overlap where ordinar-
                         ily these activities would be sequential.
                         Management reserve A percentage of the project duration to combat Parkinson's
                         Law. When project activities become late, their lateness is subtracted from the manage-
                         ment reserve.
                         Mandatory dependencies These dependencies are the natural order of activities. For
                         example, you can't begin building your house until your foundation is in place. These
                         relationships are called hard logic.
                         Monte Carlo analysis A project simulation approach named after the world-famous
                         gambling district in Monaco. This predicts how scenarios may work out, given any
                         number of variables. The process doesn't actually churn out a specific answer, but a
                         range of possible answers. When Monte Carlo analysis is applied to a schedule, it can
                         examine, for example, the optimistic completion date, the pessimistic completion date,
                         and the most likely completion date for each activity in the project and then predict a
                         mean for the project schedule.
                         Parametric estimate A quantitatively based duration estimate that uses mathematical
                         formulas to predict how long an activity will take based on the quantities of work to be
                         completed.
                         Parkinson's Law A theory that states: "Work expands so as to fill the time available
                         for its completion." It is considered with time estimating, because bloated or padded
                         activity estimates will fill the amount of time allotted to the activity.
                         Planning package A WBS entry located below a control account and above the work
                         packages. A planning package signifies that there is more planning that needs to be
                         completed for this specific deliverable.

                   Precedence diagramming method A network diagram that shows activities in nodes
                   and the relationship between each activity. Predecessors come before the current activ-
                   ity, and successors come after the current activity.
                   Project calendars Calendars that identify when the project work will occur.
                   Project float This is the total time the project can be delayed without passing the
                   customer-expected completion date.

                   Project network diagram A diagram that visualizes the flow of the project activities
                   and their relationships to other project activities.
                   Refinement An update to the work breakdown structure.
                   Resource breakdown structure (RBS) This is a hierarchical breakdown of the project
                   resources by category and resource type. For example, you could have a category of
                   equipment, a category of human resources, and a category of materials. Within each
                   category, you could identify the types of equipment your project will use, the types of
                   human resources, and the types of materials.
                   Resource calendars Calendars that identify when project resources are available for
                   the project work.
                   Resource-leveling heuristic A method to flatten the schedule when resources are
                   overallocated. Resource leveling can be applied using different methods to accomplish
                   different goals. One of the most common methods is to ensure that workers are not
                   overextended on activities.
                   Rolling wave planning The imminent work is planned in detail, while the work in
                   the future is planned at a high level. This is a form of progressive elaboration.
                   Schedule management plan A subsidiary plan in the project management plan. It
                   defines how the project schedule will be created, estimated, controlled, and managed.
                   Soft logic The activities don't necessarily have to happen in a specific order. For ex-
                   ample, you could install the light fixtures first, then the carpet, and then paint the
                   room. The project manager could use soft logic to change the order of the activities if
                   so desired.
                   Start-to-finish An activity relationship that requires an activity to start so that its suc-
                   cessor can finish. This is the most unusual of all the activity relationship types.
                   Start-to-start An activity relationship type that requires the current activity to start
                   before its successor can start.
                   Subnet A representation of a project network diagram that is often used for out-
                   sourced portions of projects, repetitive work within a project, or a subproject. Also
                   called a fragnet.
                   Template A previous project that can be adapted for the current project and forms
                   that are pre-populated with organizational-specific information.

                         Three-point estimate An estimating technique for each activity that requires optimis-
                         tic, most likely, and pessimistic estimates to be created. Based on these three estimates,
                         an average can be created to predict how long the activity should take.
                         Total float This is the total time an activity can be delayed without delaying project
                         completion.
                         Work package       The smallest item in the work breakdown structure.

                       D. Bottom-up estimating
                   14. You are using a three-point estimate for your project. Howard reports that his
                       optimistic estimate is 16 hours, his most likely estimate is 24 hours, and the
                       pessimistic estimate is 65 hours. What is the estimated duration for Howard's
                       activity?
                       A. You won't know until Howard actually does the work.
                       B. 105 hours.
                       C. 24 hours.
                       D. 35 hours.
                   15. The framing activity cannot begin until the concrete has cured for 36 hours.
                       The time between the concrete activity and the framing activity is best
                       described as which one of the following?
                       A. Hard logic

                   16. You are the project manager of the Data Warehouse Project. You've just
                       recently created the project network diagram and you now want to identify
                       the critical path. Which one of the following best describes the critical path?
                       A. It is always one path with no float.
                       B. It determines the earliest the project can finish.
                       C. It has the most activities.
                       D. It has the most important project activities.
                   17. Management has asked that you create the schedule management plan to
                       identify the different processes and procedures your project will require.
                       During the creation of the plan, you need to identify schedule control and its
                       components. Schedule control is part of which project management process?

                             18. Terry is the project manager of the network update project and the project
                                 stakeholders have requested that four new servers be added to the project.
                                 This addition will cause changes in the project costs and schedule. Which
                                 system can manage changes to the project schedule?
                                  A. Change control system
                                  B. Schedule change control system

                             19. Which schedule development tool does not consider the availability of the
                                 project resources, only when the work may take place in the project?
                                  A. The critical path method
                                  B. The critical chain method

                             20. You are working with your project team to respond to some delays in
                                 the project schedule. You have elected to crash the project schedule and
                                 management wants to know what effect this will have on the project as a
                                 whole. What happens when a project manager elects to crash a project?
                                  A. The project will end early.
                                  B. The project will end on time.

                         Questions and Answers
                              1. You are the project manager of the HGF Project. You would like to use a
                                 portion of the activity list from the HGB Project, which is similar to your
                                 current project. The portion of the activity list from the HGB Project is best
                                 described as which one of the following?
                                  A. Rolling wave planning
                                  B. Analogous estimating
                                  C. A template
                                  D. Expert judgment




06-ch06.indd 250                                                                                                                 7/10/2013 1:47:01 AM

                                                                                           Chapter 6: Managing Project Time

                                                                                                                          251
                     C. This is an example of using the previous project as a template. A, rolling
                     wave planning, is incorrect because rolling wave planning describes the
                     detailed planning of the imminent project work, and the high-level planning
                     of work is further away in the project schedule. B is incorrect. Analogous
                     estimating describes the method of using a similar project to create the current
                     project's time and/or cost estimate. D is incorrect because expert judgment is
                     using an expert to provide needed information for the current project.




                                                                                                                                        PART II
                   2. You are the project manager of a large project for your organization. Much
                      of the project will center on new software which you'll be installing on 4500
                      laptops in stages. Because of the likelihood of change, you've recommended
                      a rolling wave planning approach. Which one of the following is the best
                      example of rolling wave planning?
                      A. Using expert judgment for the current project
                      B. Using a portion of the activity list from a previous project
                      C. Breaking down the project scope
                      D. Planning the immediate portions of the project in detail and the future
                         project portions at a higher level
                     D. Rolling wave planning is the planning of the immediate portions of the
                     project in detail and the future work at a higher level. A is incorrect because
                     expert judgment is using an expert to help the project manager make
                     informed decisions within the project. B describes using a template for the
                     current project. C is the process of creating the WBS by breaking down the
                     project scope.
                   3. You are working with your project team to break down the project work into
                      activities. Which component in the WBS must be broken down to get to the
                      schedule activities?
                      A. Project scope
                      B. Work packages
                      C. Planning packages
                      D. Product scope
                     B. The work packages are broken down into schedule activities. A, the project
                     scope, is incorrect because this is the root of the WBS. C, planning packages, is
                     incorrect because the planning packages represent portions of the WBS where
                     known work content does not have schedule activities. D is incorrect because
                     the product scope describes the thing or service the project will create.
                   4. You and the project team have created the work breakdown structure based
                      on the project scope and requirements. Your next step is to create the project's
                      activity list. Which one of the following will NOT be included in the activity
                      list created with the project management team?

                                  A. Activities that are not part of the project scope
                                  B. Quality control activities
                                  C. Activities to create the work packages
                                  D. Physical terms, such as linear feet of pipe to be installed
                                 A. The activity list must not include any activities that are not part of the
                                 project scope. B, C, and D are all incorrect because these activities and terms
                                 are included in the activity list.
                              5. Mary has created an activity list with her project team. She has included activity
                                 attributes for each of the activities in her project activity list. Of the following,
                                 which one is not an example of an activity attribute that Mary likely included?
                                  A. Scope verification processes
                                  B. Predecessor activities
                                  C. Leads and lags
                                  D. Geographic area where the work must take place
                                 A. Scope verification leads to acceptance decisions with the project customer,
                                 but it is not part of the activity attributes. B, C, and D are all part of the
                                 activity attributes that Mary may include.
                              6. Your project team agrees that the server operating system must first be
                                 installed before the application can be installed. This best describes which
                                 one of the following?
                                  A. Hard logic
                                  B. Soft logic
                                  C. Start-to-start relationship
                                  D. Finish-to-finish relationship
                                 A. The operating system must be installed before the application, so this is an
                                 example of hard logic. B is incorrect because soft logic describes a scenario in
                                 which the activities can happen in any order. C and D are incorrect because these
                                 activities cannot start at the same time nor may they finish at the same time.
                              7. You are working with your project team to schedule activities for your
                                 construction project. You have scheduled the painting activity to be completed
                                 before the carpet installation activity may begin. The relationship between the
                                 painting activity and carpet installation activity can best be described as which
                                 one of the following?
                                  A. Lag
                                  B. Lead
                                  C. Finish-to-start
                                  D. Start-to-finish

                     C. The painting activity must finish first, and then the carpet installation
                     activity can begin. A, lag, is incorrect because this describes the waiting time
                     between project activities. B, lead, is also incorrect because this describes a
                     schedule compression technique to move project activities closer together. D,
                     start-to-finish, is a relationship between activities, typically used in just-in-
                     time scheduling, but that is not what is described in this example.
                   8. You are the project manager




                                                                                                                                         PART II

                      following illustration represents
                      your project. Based on the
                      following illustration. How
                      long will the project last?
                      A. 15 days
                      B. 12 days
                      C. 14 days
                      D. 41 days
                     A. The project will last 15 days. The path ACFG is the critical path that will
                     take 15 days to complete. B and C are both representative of paths that are less
                     than the critical path, so these answers are incorrect. D, 41 days, is the sum of
                     the number of days of labor if you added the duration of each project activity
                     in the project. The total of 41 days, however, is not an accurate calculation of
                     the total number of days to complete the project based on the critical path.
                   9. Beth is the project manager of her company and she's asked you to help her
                      with project schedule network analysis. Examine the illustration to the right. If
                      Activity B is delayed by two days,
                      how late will the project be?
                      A. The project will not be late
                         because Activity B may use
                         float.
                      B. The project will be late by
                         one day.
                      C. The project will be late by
                         two days.
                      D. The project will be late by
                         four days.
                     B. If activity B is delayed by two days, the total duration of the project changes
                     to 16 total days--one more day than the critical path will allow. A, C, and D
                     are all incorrect calculations for this project. For more information, see the
                     PMBOK, Section 6.5.2.2.

                             10. Ronald is the project manager for his company. He has created a project
                                 network diagram for the activities in the activity list and he's trying now to
                                 begin the process of float determination. He's asked for your help. Examine
                                 the following illustration. Which path is the critical path?
                                  A. ABFGJL
                                  B. ACFGJL
                                  C. ADEHJL
                                  D. ADIKL




                                 C. ADEHJL is the critical path because this one takes the longest to complete.
                                 A, B, and D are examples of paths that have float, so they are not on the
                                 critical path.
                             11. Consider a project that is to begin work on a Monday and a project team that
                                 will not work any weekends. The critical path of the project is 17 days. On
                                 what day of the week will the project be completed?
                                  A. Monday
                                  B. Tuesday
                                  C. Wednesday
                                  D. Thursday
                                 B. The project will complete on a Tuesday. This can be quickly determined by
                                 counting each set of Monday through Friday as five days. Three weeks allows
                                 the project to end on day 17, a Tuesday. A, C, and D are incorrect.
                             12. Mike, a project manager in your company, is falling behind on the project
                                 schedule. He has elected to crash the project. What is crashing?
                                  A. Adding lag time between all project activities
                                  B. Adding lead time between all project activities
                                  C. Adding additional project resources to the project work
                                  D. Removing all unneeded project deliverables
                                 C. Crashing is when a project manager elects to add resources to the project
                                 work in an attempt to compress the project schedule. Crashing adds costs to
                                 the project. A would cause the project duration to increase. B, adding lead
                                 time, is an example of fast tracking. D is not a valid choice.

                   13. You are the project manager of the PJG Project for your company. This project
                       is similar to a project you completed a few months ago and you'd like to
                       reference the older project for information. Which estimating technique uses
                       a similar project to predict how long the current project will take to complete?
                       A. Analogous estimating
                       B. Parametric estimating




                                                                                                                                          PART II
                       C. Organizational process assets
                       D. Bottom-up estimating
                       A. Analogous estimating uses an analogy between similar projects to determine
                       the current project's duration. B, parametric estimating, uses a parameter--such
                       as 10 hours per unit installed--to predict the project duration. C is not a valid
                       answer. D, bottom-up estimating, accounts for every work package in the WBS
                       and the total amount of time for each deliverable. It is the most reliable time-
                       estimating technique, but also takes the longest to create.
                   14. You are using a three-point estimate for your project. Howard reports that his
                       optimistic estimate is 16 hours, his most likely estimate is 24 hours, and the
                       pessimistic estimate is 65 hours. What is the estimated duration for Howard's
                       activity?
                       A. You won't know until Howard actually does the work.
                       B. 105 hours.
                       C. 24 hours.
                       D. 35 hours.
                       D. A three-point estimate takes the sum of the optimistic, pessimistic, and
                       most likely estimates and divides it by three. A is not a reflection of the
                       estimated duration. B and C do not reflect the result of a three-point estimate.
                   15. The framing activity cannot begin until the concrete has cured for 36 hours.
                       The time between the concrete activity and the framing activity is best
                       described as which one of the following?
                       A. Hard logic
                       B. Lag time
                       C. Lead time
                       D. Finish-to-start relationship
                       B. The framing activity cannot begin immediately after the concrete activity;
                       there is waiting time, which is commonly known as lag time. A, hard logic,
                       describes the order in which activities must happen; it does not describe the
                       time between activities. C, lead time, would actually allow activities to
                       overlap. D, finish-to-start, does describe the relationship between the concrete
                       and the framing activities, but it does not answer the question.

                             16. You are the project manager of the Data Warehouse Project. You've just
                                 recently created the project network diagram and you now want to identify
                                 the critical path. Which one of the following best describes the critical path?
                                  A. It is always one path with no float.
                                  B. It determines the earliest the project can finish.
                                  C. It has the most activities.
                                  D. It has the most important project activities.
                                 B. The critical path reveals the earliest that a project may finish. A is incorrect
                                 because the project may have more than one critical path. C is incorrect
                                 because the critical path may have fewer activities than other paths in the
                                 project, but may still take longer to complete. D is also incorrect because the
                                 critical path does not reflect the importance of the path's activities, just their
                                 duration.
                             17. Management has asked that you create the schedule management plan to
                                 identify the different processes and procedures your project will require.
                                 During the creation of the plan, you need to identify schedule control and its
                                 components. Schedule control is part of which project management process?
                                  A. Change control
                                  B. Cost control
                                  C. WBS refinements
                                  D. Integrated change control
                                 D. Schedule control is part of the integrated change control process. A, B, and
                                 C are incorrect because neither completely answers the question.
                             18. Terry is the project manager of the network update project and the project
                                 stakeholders have requested that four new servers be added to the project.
                                 This addition will cause changes in the project costs and schedule. Which
                                 system can manage changes to the project schedule?
                                  A. Change control system
                                  B. Schedule change control system
                                  C. Integrated change control
                                  D. Change control board
                                 B. The only system that deals directly with schedule is B, the schedule change
                                 control system. A is not a valid choice. C, integrated change control, actually
                                 describes a project process. D is a group that determines scope changes and
                                 their effect on the project constraints.
                             19. Which schedule development tool does not consider the availability of the
                                 project resources, only when the work may take place in the project?

                       D. Arrow on the node method
                       A. The critical path method only considers when the work may take place and
                       not the availability of the resources. B, the critical chain method, does




                                                                                                                                         PART II
                       consider when the resources are available. C and D are not valid choices for
                       this question.
                   20. You are working with your project team to respond to some delays in
                       the project schedule. You have elected to crash the project schedule and
                       management wants to know what effect this will have on the project as a
                       whole. What happens when a project manager elects to crash a project?
                       A. The project will end early.
                       B. The project will end on time.
                       C. The project costs will increase.
                       D. The project team morale will decrease.
                       C. Crashing adds cost to the project because it adds labor, and labor costs
                       money. A and B are incorrect because crashing a project does not necessarily
                       ensure that the project will end early or on time. D is also incorrect because
                       there's no evidence that the team morale will decrease if the project manager
                       elects to crash the project.

                     In this chapter, you will
                        * Plan for project cost management
                        * Estimate the project costs
                        * Administer the project budget
                        * Manage project cost control
                        * Work with earned value management




                   Money. Cash. Greenbacks. Dead presidents. It's all the same thing when you get down
                   to it: Projects require finances to get from start to completion, and it's often the project
                   manager's job to estimate, control, and account for the finances a project demands.
                   Projects consume the project budget during execution, when all of those project man-
                   agement plans we've discussed are put into action, and the project budget is monitored
                   and controlled during, well, the monitoring and controlling processes.

                        What's that you say? You don't have any control over the monies your project re-
                   quires? Management gives you a predetermined budget, and it's up to you to make it all
                   work out? Yikes! While this book centers on your Certified Associate in Project Manage-
                   ment (CAPM) and Project Management Professional (PMP) examinations, that's al-
                   ways one of the scariest things I hear. Or is it? If management's decision is based on
                   previous projects, business analysts' research, or should-cost estimates from experts,
                   then it's not so scary. I'll give you this much: A predetermined project budget is always
                   a constraint, and it's rarely fun for the project manager.
                        And what about those projects that don't have any monies assigned to the project
                   work? You know... the projects where the project scope is completed just by the proj-
                   ect team's work, and there really aren't any materials or items to purchase. That's okay--
                   there are still costs associated with the project, because someone, somewhere, is paying
                   for the project team's time. Salaries can also be considered a project cost. After all, time
                   is money.

                             Finally--and here's the big whammy--it doesn't really matter where your project
                         monies come from, whether you actually control them, and the processes your organi-
                         zation uses to spend them. Your Project Management Institute (PMI) exam makes you
                         understand all of the appropriate processes and procedures of how projects are esti-
                         mated, budgeted, and then financially controlled. And that's what we'll discuss in this
                         chapter.
                             You know by now, I'm assuming, that there are 47 project management processes.
                         Guess how many of them center on cost? Four: planning cost management, cost esti-
                         mating, cost budgeting, and cost controlling. Isn't that reassuring? Your PMI exam will,
                         no doubt, have questions on costs, but so much of the content of this chapter refers to
                         your enterprise environmental factors. (Remember that term? It's how your company
                         does business.) Your cost management plan defines and outlines your organization's
                         and project's procedures for cost management and control. I'll not pass the buck any-
                         more. Let's go through this chapter like a wad of cash at an all-night flea market.


                         Planning for Project Cost Management
                         You need a plan just for project costs. You need a plan that will help you define what
                         policies you and the project team have to adhere to in regard to costs, a plan that docu-
                         ments how you get to spend project money, and a plan for how cost management will
                         happen throughout your entire project. Well, you're in luck! This plan, a subsidiary
                         plan of the project management plan, is the project cost management plan.
                             Like most of these subsidiary plans, you can use a template from past projects, your
                         project management office, or your program manager to build the plan that's specific
                         to your project. Or, if you really have to, you can create a project cost management plan
                         from scratch. It's not much fun, but I'll show you how to do it. You'll also need to know
                         the business of preparing this cost management plan for your PMI examination--you'll
                         certainly have some questions about what's included in the plan and how you and the
                         project team work together to build the plan and execute it throughout the project.

                         Preparing the Project Cost Management Plan
                         In order to prepare to complete the process of cost management planning, you'll need
                         four inputs:

                              * Project management plan
                              * Project charter
                              * Enterprise environmental factors
                              * Organizational process assets

                             Now don't let the idea of the project management plan scare you. Remember that
                         planning is an iterative activity. You'll have some elements of the project management
                         plan already completed when you start this cost management planning--and some
                         parts of the project management plan won't be completed yet. As more and more infor-

                                                                                                                                261
                   mation becomes available, you can return to this cost management plan and adjust it
                   as necessary. For example, you may not know the specific rules about how your com-
                   pany can purchase materials. You might need to go speak with your project sponsor, the
                   purchasing department, or your program manager to confirm these rules and then you
                   could return to the cost management plan and update the information accordingly.
                       You'll also need the project management plan and its scope baseline to help the
                   cost management planning. Recall that the scope baseline is the WBS, the WBS diction-




                                                                                                                                              PART II
                   ary, and the project scope statement. The WBS will help you determine what resources
                   you need to purchase, how estimating the expenses relate to the project's deliverables,
                   and the time accountability for nonexempt project team members such as contractors.

                               NOTE You'll reference the project charter for just one reason: the summary
                               budget. Remember, the project charter includes a summary budget for the
                               project so you'll use that amount as a foundation for project cost
                               management.

                       The actual creation of the cost management plan relies heavily on meetings. Noth-
                   ing like some meetings about the project budget, right? You'll need meetings specifi-
                   cally with your key stakeholders and subject matter experts. These people can help
                   guide and direct you about the organization's environment, tell you about similar proj-
                   ects they've worked on or sponsored, and help with the enterprise environmental fac-
                   tors and organizational processes you'll have to adhere to in cost management.
                       These meetings will likely include some analytical techniques to analyze the antici-
                   pated cost of the project, the return on investment, and how the project should be
                   funded. Self-funding means the organization pays for the project expenses from their
                   cash flow. Funding with equity means the organization balances the project expenses
                   with equity they have in their assets. Funding with debt means the company pays for
                   the project through a line of credit or bank loan. There are pros and cons to each ap-
                   proach, and an analysis of the true cost of the project, the cost of the funding, and the
                   risk associated with the project is examined as part of the decision.

                               NOTE The time value of money was covered in Chapter 4. Present value,
                               future value, net present value, and the internal rate of return are all applicable
                               here, too.

                   Examining the Project Cost Management Plan
                   Once you've created the cost management plan, you have a clear direction on how you'll
                   estimate, budget, and manage the project costs. This plan defines, much like the schedule
                   management plan, the level of accuracy defined for the project and the units of measure-
                   ment. For example, you might round financial figures to the nearest $100 or keep track of
                   costs to the exact penny. Your unit of measurement isn't just dollars, yen, or euros, but
                   also things like a workday, hours, or even weeks for labor. Keep in mind, some organiza-
                   tions do not include the cost of labor in the project, while other companies do.

                              If you're using control accounts in your WBS, you'll reference those control ac-
                         counts in your cost management plan. Recall that a control account is like a "mini-
                         budget" for a chunk of the WBS. For example, a house project may have a control
                         account for the basement, the first floor, the second floor. Or you could get more spe-
                         cific and have a control account for the kitchen in the house project. Whatever ap-
                         proach you're using, you'd reference that information in the cost management plan--the
                         PMBOK Guide calls this an organizational procedure link.
                              Just as you defined control thresholds for your schedule, you'll do the same for your
                         project costs. Control thresholds, as a reminder, are the limits of variance before a cor-
                         rective action is needed in the project. For example, a project may have a control thresh-
                         old of 10 percent off budget before a predefined action is taken. Or the control threshold
                         could be any cost variance greater than $5,000 requires project management action.
                         The action could be a corrective action, but also may include an exceptions report or
                         variance report to management.


                         Determining the Project Costs
                         One of the first questions a project manager is likely to be asked when a project is
                         launched is, "How much will this cost to finish?" That question can only be answered
                         through progressive elaboration. To answer the question, the project manager, or the
                         project estimator as the case may be, first needs to examine the costs of the resources
                         needed to complete each activity in the project. Resources, of course, are people, but
                         also things: equipment, material, training, even pizza if the project demands it.
                             On top of the cost of the resources, there's also all the variances that must be con-
                         sidered: project risks, fluctuations in the cost of materials, the appropriate human re-
                         sources for each activity, and oddball elements like shipping, insurance, inflation, and
                         monies for testing and evaluations.
                             Estimates, as Figure 7-1 depicts, usually come in one of three flavors through a se-
                         ries of refinements. As more details are acquired as the project progresses, the estimates
                         are refined. Industry guidelines and organizational policies may define how the esti-
                         mates are refined.

                              * Rough order of magnitude (ROM) This estimate is rough and is used
                                during the initiating processes and in top-down estimates. The range of
                                variance for the estimate can be from -25 percent to +75 percent.
                              * Budget estimate This estimate is also somewhat broad and is used early in
                                the planning processes and also in top-down estimates. The range of variance
                                for the estimate can be from -10 percent to +25 percent.

                         Figure 7-1
                         There are three
                         generally accepted
                         types of cost
                         estimates.

                        * Definitive estimate This estimate type is one of the most accurate. It's used late
                          in the planning processes and is associated with bottom-up estimating. You need
                          the work breakdown structure (WBS) in order to create the definitive estimate.
                          The range of variance for the estimate can be from -5 percent to +10 percent.


                                EXAM TIP The range of variance percentages are pretty typical of these
                                estimate types, but there's no steadfast rule that the estimates must follow




                                                                                                                                              PART II
                                these ranges.Your organization may use entirely different ranges of variance
                                for each estimate type.

                      While project managers typically think of project estimates as some unit of measure
                   such as dollars, euros, or yen, it's possible and often feasible to estimate project costs
                   based on labor. Consider the number of hours the project team must work on creating
                   a new piece of software. You could even estimate based on the number of full-time
                   employees assigned to the project for a given duration.

                                EXAM TIP If your organization doesn't use a cost estimator, the project
                                manager and the project team work together to estimate the project costs.

                   Estimating the Project Costs
                   Assuming that the project manager and the project team are working together to create
                   the cost estimates, there are many inputs to the cost-estimating process. For your PMI
                   exam, it would behoove you to be familiar with these inputs because these are often the
                   supporting details for the cost estimate the project management team creates. Let's have
                   a look, shall we?

                   Referencing the Cost Management Plan
                   You've created the cost management plan, so might as well use it. The plan is used as an
                   input for cost estimating because it defines the level of detail needed in the cost esti-
                   mates you're creating. You'll follow the cost management plan's requirements for cost
                   estimating, rounding, and adherence to enterprise environmental factors.

                   Including the Human Resource Plan
                   If your organization includes an accounting of the cost of labor, you'll obviously need
                   this project management subsidiary plan. The human resource plan, which is covered
                   in Chapter 9, defines the cost of labor, contracted labor rates, and the budget allotted
                   for rewards and recognition for the project. You'll need this information to predict what
                   the costs of the project will be.

                   Using the Project Scope Baseline
                   You'll need the project scope baseline often enough. First, the project scope statement is
                   an input to the cost-estimating process. What a surprise! The project scope statement




07-ch07.indd 263                                                                                                                 7/12/2013 4:48:04 AM

                         is needed because it defines the business case for the project, the project justifications,
                         and the project requirements--all things that'll cost cash to achieve. The project scope
                         statement can help the project manager and the stakeholders negotiate the funding for
                         the project based on what's already been agreed upon. In other words, the size of the
                         budget has to be in proportion to the demands of the project scope statement.
                             While the project scope statement defines constraints, it also defines assumptions.
                         In Chapter 11, which discusses risk management, we'll discuss how assumptions can
                         become risks. Basically, if the assumptions in the project scope statement prove false,
                         the project manager needs to assess what the financial impact may be.
                             Consider all of the elements in the project scope statement that can contribute to
                         the project cost estimate:

                              * Contractual agreements
                              * Insurance
                              * Safety and health issues
                              * Environment expenses
                              * Security concerns
                              * Cost of intellectual rights
                              * Licenses and permits

                             Last, and perhaps one of the more important elements in the project scope state-
                         ment, is the requirements for acceptance. The cost estimate must reflect the monies
                         needed to attain the project customer's expectations. If the monies are not available to
                         create all of the elements within the project scope, then either the project scope must
                         be trimmed to match the monies that are available, or more cash needs to be dumped
                         into the project.
                             Next, you'll need the second part of the scope baseline: the work breakdown struc-
                         ture (WBS). The WBS is needed to create a cost estimate, especially the definitive esti-
                         mate, because it clearly defines all of the deliverables the project will create. Each of the
                         work packages in the WBS will cost something in the way of materials, time, or often
                         both. You'll see the WBS as a common theme in this chapter, because the monies you
                         spend on a project are for the things you've promised in the WBS.
                             Finally, you'll need the WBS's pal, the WBS dictionary, because it includes all of the
                         details and the associated work for each deliverable in the WBS. As a general rule, when-
                         ever you have the WBS involved, the WBS dictionary tags along.

                         Examining the Project Schedule
                         The availability of resources, when the resources are to do the work, when capital ex-
                         penses are to happen, and so on are needed for cost estimating. The schedule manage-
                         ment plan can also consider contracts with collective bargaining agreements (unions)
                         and their timelines, the seasonal cost of labor and materials, and any other timings that
                         may affect the overall cost estimate. The project schedule can help you determine not
                         only when resources are needed, but when you'll have to pay for those resources.

                                                                                                                                 265
                   Referencing the Risk Register
                   A risk is an uncertain event that may cost the project time, money, or both. The risk
                   register is a central repository of the project risks and the associated status of each risk
                   event. Some risks the project team can buy their way out of, while other risks will cost
                   the project if they come true. We'll discuss risks in detail in Chapter 11, but for now,
                   know that the risk register is needed because the cost of the risk exposure helps the
                   project management team create an accurate cost estimate.




                                                                                                                                               PART II
                                EXAM TIP Risks may not always cost monies directly, but could affect the
                                project schedule. Keep in mind, however, that this could in turn cause a rise in
                                project costs because of vendor commitment, penalties for lateness, and
                                added expenses for extra labor.

                   Relying on Enterprise Environmental Factors
                   Every time I have to say or write "enterprise environmental factors," I cringe. It's just a
                   fancypants way of saying how your organization runs its shop. Within any organiza-
                   tion, "factors" affect the cost-estimating process. Surprise, surprise, there are two for
                   your exam:

                        * Marketplace conditions When you have to buy materials and other
                          resources, the marketplace dictates the price, what's available, and from whom
                          you will purchase them. We'll talk all about procurement in Chapter 12, but
                          for now, there are three conditions that can affect the price of anything your
                          project needs to purchase:
                           * Sole source When there's only one vendor that can provide what your
                             project needs to purchase. Examples include a specific consultant, a
                             specialized service, or a unique type of material.
                           * Single source When there are many vendors that can provide what your
                             project needs to purchase, but you prefer to work with a specific vendor.
                             They are your favorite.
                           * Oligopoly This is a market condition in which the market is so tight that
                             the actions of one vendor affect the actions of all the others. Can you think
                             of any? How about the airline industry, the oil industry, or even training
                             centers and consultants?
                        * Commercial databases One of my first consulting gigs was for a large
                          commercial printer. We used a database--based on the type of materials the
                          job was to be printed on, the number of inks and varnish we wanted to use,
                          and the printing press we'd use--to predict how much the job would cost.
                          That's a commercial database. Another accessible example is any price list
                          your vendors may provide so that you can estimate the costs accurately.

                                       EXAM TIP Here's a goofy way to remember all the market conditions for
                                       your PMI exam. For a sole source, think of James Brown, the Godfather of
                                       Soul. There's only one James Brown, just as there's only one vendor. For a
                                       single source, think of all the single people in the world and how you only
                                       want to date your sweetie instead of all the others. With a single source, you
                                       consider all the different available vendors, but you have your favorite. And for
                                       oligopoly? It sounds like "oil" which we know is a classic example of an
                                       oligopoly market. Hey, I warned you these were goofy!

                         Using Organizational Process Assets
                         Here's another term that makes my teeth hurt: organizational process assets. These are
                         just things your organization has learned, created, or purchased that can help the proj-
                         ect management team manage a project better. When it comes to cost estimating, an
                         organization can use many assets:

                              * Cost-estimating policies An organization can, and often will, create a policy
                                on how the project manager or the cost estimator is to create the project cost
                                estimate. It's just their rule. Got any of those where you work?
                              * Cost-estimating templates In case you've not picked up on this yet, the PMI
                                and the Project Management Body of Knowledge (PMBOK) love templates.
                                Templates in project management don't usually mean a shell in the way that
                                Microsoft Word thinks of templates. We're talking about using past similar
                                projects to serve as a template for the current project.
                              * Historical information Beyond the specific costs of previous projects,
                                historical information is just about anything that came before this project that
                                can help the project manager and the project team create an accurate cost
                                estimate.
                              * Project files Project archives and files from past projects can help with the
                                cost-estimating process. Specifically, the project manager is after the
                                performance of past similar projects in areas of cost control, the cost of risks,
                                and quality issues that could affect costs.
                              * Project team knowledge Your project team usually consists of the experts
                                closest to the project work and can be a valuable input to the project cost-
                                estimating process. Be forewarned--for the real world and your PMI exam,
                                project team recollections are great, but aren't the most reliable input. In
                                other words, Marty's war stories about how Project XYZ was $14 billion over
                                budget don't compare with historical information that says Project XYZ was
                                $14 over budget.
                              * Lessons learned It's always good to rely on lessons learned as an input
                                during planning. After all, it's better to learn from someone else's mistakes.

                                EXAM TIP Sometimes an organization has two projects, or opportunities, and
                                they can only choose one of the projects to complete. For example, Project A is
                                worth $75,000, and Project B is worth $250,000. The organization will likely
                                choose Project B because it is worth more, and let Project A go because it is
                                worth considerably less. Opportunity cost is a term to describe the total amount
                                of the project that was let go in lieu of the project that was selected. In this
                                instance, the opportunity cost is $75,000: the worth of Project A.

                   Creating the Cost Estimate
                   All of the cost inputs are needed so that the project cost estimator, likely the project
                   management team, can create a reliable cost estimate. The estimates you'll want to
                   know for the CAPM and PMP exam, and for your career, reflect the accuracy of the in-
                   formation the estimate is based upon. The more accurate the information, the better
                   the cost estimate will be. Basically, all cost estimates move through progressive elabora-
                   tion: as more details become available, the more accurate the cost estimate is likely to
                   be. Let's examine the most common approaches to determining how much a project is
                   likely to cost.

                   Using Analogous Estimating
                   Analogous estimating relies on historical information to predict the cost of the current
                   project. It is also known as top-down estimating and is the least reliable of all the cost-
                   estimating approaches. The process of analogous estimating uses the actual cost of a
                   historical project as a basis for the current project. The cost of the historical project is
                   applied to the cost of the current project, taking into account the scope and size of the
                   current project, as well as other known variables.
                       Analogous estimating is considered a form of expert judgment. This estimating ap-
                   proach takes less time to complete than other estimating models, but is also less accu-
                   rate. This top-down approach is good for fast estimates to get a general idea of what the
                   project may cost. The trouble, or risk, with using an analogous estimate, however, is
                   that the historical information that estimate is based upon must be accurate. For ex-
                   ample, if I were to create a cost estimate for Project NBG based on a similar project
                   Nancy did two years ago, I'd be assuming that Nancy kept accurate records and that her
                   historical information is accurate. If it isn't, then my project costs are not going to be
                   accurate, and I'm going to be really mad at Nancy.

                   Determining the Cost of Resources
                   One of the project management plans needed for cost estimating is the human resource
                   management plan, which defines all of the attributes of the project staff, including the
                   personnel rates. Armed with this plan and a determination of what resources are need-
                   ed to complete the project, the project manager can extrapolate what the cost of the
                   human resource element of the project will likely be.
                       Resources include more than just the people doing the project work. The cost es-
                   timate must also reflect all of the equipment and materials that will be utilized to

                         complete the work. In addition, the project manager must identify the quantity of the
                         needed resources and when the resources are needed for the project. The identification
                         of the resources, the needed quantity, and the schedule of the resources are directly
                         linked to the expected cost of the project work.
                             There are four variations on project expenses to consider:

                              * Direct costs These costs are attributed directly to the project work and
                                cannot be shared among projects (airfare, hotels, long-distance phone charges,
                                and so on).
                              * Indirect costs These costs are representative of more than one project
                                (utilities for the performing organization, access to a training room, project
                                management software license, and so on).
                              * Variable costs These costs vary depending on the conditions applied in
                                the project (the number of meeting participants, the supply and demand
                                of materials, and so on).
                              * Fixed costs These costs remain constant throughout the life cycle of the
                                project (the cost of a piece of rented equipment for the project, the cost of a
                                consultant brought onto the project, and so on).

                             And yes, you can mix and match these terms. For example, you could have a vari-
                         able cost based on shipping expenses that is also a direct cost for your project. Don't get
                         too hung up on these cost types--just be topically familiar with them for your PMI
                         exam.

                         Using Bottom-Up Estimating
                         Bottom-up estimating starts from zero, accounts for each component of the WBS, and
                         arrives at a sum for the project. It is completed with the project team and can be one of
                         the most time-consuming methods used to predict project costs. While this method is
                         more expensive because of the time invested to create the estimate, it is also one of the
                         most accurate. A fringe benefit of completing a bottom-up estimate is that the project
                         team may buy into the project work since they see the value of each cost within the
                         project.

                         Using Parametric Estimating
                             "That'll be $465 per metric ton."
                             "You can buy our software for $765 per license."
                             "How about $125 per network drop?"
                             These are all examples of parameters that can be integrated into a parametric esti-
                         mate. Parametric estimating uses a mathematical model based on known parameters to
                         predict the cost of a project. The parameters in the model can vary based on the type of
                         work being completed and can be measured by cost per cubic yard, cost per unit, and
                         so on. A complex parameter can be cost per unit, with adjustment factors based on the
                         conditions of the project. The adjustment factors may have several modifying factors,
                         depending on additional conditions.

                                                                                                                                     269
                      There are two types of parametric estimating:

                       * Regression analysis This is a statistical approach that predicts future
                         values based on historical values. Regression analysis creates quantitative
                         predictions based on variables within one value to predict variables in
                         another. This form of estimating relies solely on pure statistical math to
                         reveal relationships between variables and to predict future values.




                                                                                                                                                   PART II
                        * Learning curve This approach is simple: The cost per unit decreases the
                          more units workers complete, because workers learn as they complete the
                          required work (see Figure 7-2). The more an individual completes an activity,
                          the easier it is to complete. The estimate is considered parametric, since the
                          formula is based on repetitive activities, such as wiring telephone jacks,
                          painting hotel rooms, or other activities that are completed over and over
                          within a project.

                                EXAM TIP Don't worry too much about regression analysis for the exam.
                                The learning curve is the topic you're more likely to have questions on.



                   Using Good Old Project Management Software
                   Who's creating estimates with their abacus? Most organizations rely on software to help
                   the project management team create an accurate cost estimate. While the CAPM and
                   PMP examinations are vendor neutral, a general knowledge of how computer software

                         can assist the project manager is needed. Several different computer programs are avail-
                         able that can streamline project work estimates and increase their accuracy. These tools
                         can include project management software, spreadsheet programs, and simulations.

                         Examining the Vendor Bids
                         Sometimes it's just more cost-effective (and easier) to hire someone else to do the work.
                         Other times, the project manager has no choice, because the needed skill set doesn't
                         exist within the organization. In either condition, the vendors' bids need to be analyzed
                         to determine which vendor should be selected based on their ability to satisfy the proj-
                         ect scope, the expected quality, and the cost of their services. We'll talk all about pro-
                         curement in Chapter 12.

                         Implementing Three-Point Estimating
                         A three-point estimate uses three factors to predict a cost: pessimistic, optimistic, and
                         most likely. A three-point estimate can use a simple average of the three factors or it can
                         use a weighted factor for the most likely factor. For example, a project manager predicts
                         the pessimistic cost to be $5,600, the most likely cost to be $4,800, and the optimistic
                         cost to be $3,500. With the simple average, you'd just add up the three amounts and
                         divide by three for a value of $4,633.
                             With the weighted average, you'll consider all of the same costs, but the most likely
                         amount is multiplied by four, and then you'll divide the sum of the three values by six.
                         Here's what this looks like with the same costs ($5,600 + (4 x 4,800) + 3,500)/6 =
                         $4,716. So in this instance the weight average leans more toward the most likely amount
                         than does the simple average.

                         Creating a Reserve Analysis
                         Do you think it'll snow next December in Michigan? I do, too. But do we know on what
                         exact date? That's a quick and easy example of a known unknown. You know that some-
                         thing is likely to occur, but you just don't know when or to what degree. Projects are full
                         of known unknowns, and the most common unknown deals with costs. Based on ex-
                         perience, the nature of the work, or fear, you suspect that some activities in your project
                         will cost more than expected--that's a known unknown.
                              Rather than combating known unknowns by padding costs with extra monies, the
                         PMBOK suggests that we create "contingency allowances" to account for these overruns
                         in costs. The contingency allowances are used at the project manager's discretion to
                         counteract cost overruns for scheduled activities. In Chapter 6, we discussed the con-
                         cept of management reserve for time overruns. This is a related concept when it comes
                         to the cost reserve for projects. This reserve is sometimes called a contingency reserve and
                         is traditionally set aside for cost overruns due to risks that have affected the project cost
                         baseline. Contingency reserves can be managed in a number of ways. The most com-
                         mon is to set aside an allotment of funds for the identified risks within the project.
                         Another approach is to create a slush fund for the entire project for identified risks and
                         known unknowns. The final approach is an allotment of funds for categories of com-
                         ponents based on the WBS and the project schedule.

                                                                                                                                271
                   Considering the Cost of Quality
                   The cost of quality, which we'll discuss in Chapter 8, defines the monies the project must
                   spend to reach the expected level of quality within a project. For example, if your proj-
                   ect will use a new material that no one on the project team has ever worked with, the
                   project team will likely need training so they can use it. The training, as you can guess,
                   costs something. That's an example of the cost of quality.
                       On the other side of the coin (cost pun intended, thank you), there's the cost of




                                                                                                                                              PART II
                   poor quality, sometimes called the cost of nonconformance to quality. These are the costs
                   your project will pay if you don't adhere to quality the first time. In our example with
                   the project team and the new materials, a failure to train the team on the new materials
                   will mean that the team will likely not install the materials properly, take longer to use
                   the materials, and may even waste materials. All of these negative conditions cost the
                   project in time, money, team frustration, and even loss of sales.

                   Examining the Cost Estimate
                   Once all of the inputs have been evaluated and the estimate creation process is com-
                   pleted, you get the cost estimate. The estimate is the likely cost of the project--it's not
                   a guarantee, so there is usually a modifier--sometimes called an acceptable range of
                   variance. That's the plus/minus qualifier on the estimate--for example, $450,000 +
                   $25,000 to -$13,000, based on whatever conditions are attached to the estimate. The
                   cost estimate should, at the minimum, include the likely costs for all of the following:

                        * Labor
                        * Materials
                        * Equipment
                        * Services
                        * Facilities
                        * Information technology
                        * Special categories, such as inflation and contingency reserve

                        It's possible for a project to have other cost categories, such as consultants, out-
                   sourced solutions, and so on, but the preceding list is the most common. Consider this
                   list when studying to pass your exam.
                        Along with the cost estimate, the project management team includes the basis of
                   the estimate. These are all the supporting details of how the estimate was created and
                   why the confidence in the estimate exists at the level it does. Supporting details typi-
                   cally include all of the following:

                        * Description of the work to be completed in consideration of the cost estimate
                        * Explanation of how the estimate was created
                        * What assumptions were used during the estimate creation

                              * The constraints that the project management team had to consider when
                                creating the cost estimate

                              A project's cost estimate may lead to some unpleasant news in the shape of change
                         requests. I say "unpleasant," because changes are rarely enjoyable. Changes can affect
                         the scope in two primary ways when it comes to cost:
                              We don't have enough funds to match the cost estimate, so we'll need to trim the
                         scope.
                              We have more than enough funds to match the cost estimate, so let's add some stuff
                         into the scope.
                              All change requests must be documented and fed through the integrated change
                         control system, as discussed in Chapter 4. What the project manager wants to be leery
                         of is gold plating. Gold plating is when the project manager, the project sponsor, or even
                         a stakeholder adds in project extras to consume the entire project budget. It's essen-
                         tially adding unneeded features to the product in order to use up all the funds allocated
                         to the project. While this often happens in the final stages of a project, it can begin right
                         here during the project cost estimating. Gold plating delivers more than what's needed
                         and can create new risks and work, and can contribute to a decline in team morale.
                              If changes are approved, then integrated change control is enacted, the project scope
                         is updated, the WBS and WBS dictionary are updated, and so on, through all of the
                         project management plans as needed. The cost management plan needs to be updated
                         as well to reflect the costs of the changes and their impact on the project cost estimate.


                         Budgeting the Project
                         Now that the project estimate has been created, it's time to create the official cost bud-
                         get. Cost budgeting is really cost aggregation, which means the project manager will be
                         assigning specific dollar amounts for each of the scheduled activities or, more likely, for
                         each of the work packages in the WBS. The aggregation of the work package cost equates
                         to the summary budget for the entire project. This process creates the cost baseline, as
                         Figure 7-3 shows.
                             Cost budgeting and cost estimates may go hand in hand, but estimating is com-
                         pleted before a budget is created--or assigned. Cost budgeting applies the cost esti-
                         mates over time. This results in a time-phased estimate for cost, which allows an
                         organization to predict cash flow, to project return on investment, and to perform fore-
                         casting. The difference between cost estimates and cost budgeting is that cost estimates
                         show costs by category, whereas a cost budget shows costs across time.

                         Creating the Project Budget
                         Good news! Many of the tools and techniques used to create the project cost estimates
                         are also used to create the project budget. The following is a quick listing of the tools
                         you can expect to see on the CAPM and PMP exams:

                                                                                                                                   273
                       * Cost aggregation Costs are parallel to each WBS work package. The costs
                         of each work package are aggregated to their corresponding control accounts.
                         Each control account is then aggregated to the sum of the project costs.
                        * Reserve analysis Cost reserves are for unknown unknowns within a project.
                          The contingency reserve is not part of the project cost baseline, but is included
                          as part of the project budget.
                        * Historical relationships This is kind of a weird term. Historical relationships




                                                                                                                                                 PART II
                          in cost estimating describe the history of costs in a given industry. For example,
                          construction uses a cost per square foot, while software development can
                          charge a fee per hour depending on the type of resource being used. This
                          approach uses a parametric model to extrapolate what costs will be for a
                          project (for example, cost per hour and cost per unit). It can include variables
                          and the additional percentage of fee points based on conditions.
                        * Funding limit reconciliation Organizations only have so much cash to allot
                          to projects--and no, you can't have all the monies right now. Funding limit
                          reconciliation is an organization's approach to managing cash flow against the
                          project deliverables based on a schedule, milestone accomplishment, or data
                          constraints. This helps an organization plan when monies will be devoted to a
                          project rather than using all of the funds available at the start of a project. In
                          other words, the monies for a project budget will become available based on
                          dates and/or deliverables. If the project doesn't hit predetermined dates and
                          products that were set as milestones, the likelihood of additional funding
                          becomes questionable.

                         Examining the Project Budget
                         As with most parts of the PMBOK, you don't get just one output after completing a
                         process, you get several. Creating the project budget is no different because there are
                         three outputs to know for the PMI examination: cost baseline, project funding require-
                         ments, and project documents. The following sections look at these in detail.

                         Working with the Cost Baseline
                         The cost baseline, shown in Figure 7-3, is actually a time-lapse exposure of when the
                         project monies are to be spent in relation to cumulative values of the work completed
                         in the project. Most baselines are shown as an S-curve, where the project begins in the
                         left and works its way to the upper-right corner. When the project begins, it's not worth
                         much and usually not much has been spent. As the project moves toward completion,
                         the monies for labor, materials, and other resources are consumed in relation to the
                         work. In other words, the monies spent on the project over time will equate to the work
                         the project is completing.
                              Some projects, especially projects that are of high priority or are large, may have
                         multiple cost baselines to track cost of labor, cost of materials, even the cost of internal
                         resources compared with external resources. This is all fine and dandy, as long as the
                         values in each of the baselines are maintained and consistent. It wouldn't do a project
                         manager much good if the cost baseline for materials was updated regularly and the
                         cost baseline for labor was politely ignored.

                                       EXAM TIP Monies that have already been spent on a project are considered
                                       sunk into the project. These funds are called sunk costs--they're gone.

                         Determining the Project Funding Requirements
                         Projects demand a budget, but when the monies in the project are made available de-
                         pends on the organization, the size of the project, and just plain old common sense.
                         For example, if you were building a skyscraper that costs $850 million, you wouldn't
                         need all of the funds on the first day of the project, but you would forecast when those
                         monies would be needed. That's cash-flow forecasting.
                             The funding of the project, based on the cost baseline and the expected project
                         schedule, may happen incrementally or may be based on conditions within the project.
                         Typically, the funding requirements have been incorporated into the cost baseline. The
                         release of funds is treated like a step function, which is what it is. Each step of the proj-
                         ect funding allows the project to move on to the next milestone, deliverable, or what-
                         ever step of the project the project manager and the stakeholders have agreed to.
                             The project funding requirements also account for the management contingency
                         reserve amounts. This is a pool of funds for cost overruns. Typically, the management
                         contingency reserve is allotted to the project in each step, though some organizations
                         may elect to only disburse contingency funds on an as-needed basis--that's just part of
                         organizational process assets.

                                                                                                                                   275
                       To be crystal clear, the cost baseline is what the project should cost in an ideal, perfect
                   world. The management contingency reserve is the "filler" between the cost baseline and the
                   maximum funding. In most cases, the management contingency reserve bridges the gap
                   between the project cost baseline and the maximum funding to complete the project.
                   Figure 7-4 demonstrates the management contingency reserve at project completion.

                   The Usual Suspects




                                                                                                                                                 PART II
                   There are three more outputs of the cost-budgeting process. The outputs are:

                        * Cost baseline The cost baseline is the budget of the project--usually in ratio
                          to when the funds are needed and how far along the project has progressed.
                          In other words, in larger projects you don't get all of the project budgeting at
                          the start, but rather the monies are spent throughout the project. This is where
                          you might see an S-curve of how much the project is predicted to spend in
                          relation to the progress the project is to make. Ideally, you'll run out of money
                          right when the project reaches its conclusion.
                        * Project funding requirements Part of the project's budget is a prediction of
                          when you'll need the money: capital expenses, monthly labor burn rates,
                          contractual obligations, and project liabilities. You will need to consider the
                          total budget requirements as part of the funding requirements. This includes
                          the cost baseline and any management reserves for risk events.
                        * Project document updates You may need to update the risk register, cost
                          estimates, and delete project schedule.

                         Controlling Project Costs
                         Once a project has been funded, it's up to the project manager and the project team to
                         work effectively and efficiently to control costs. This means doing the work right the
                         first time. It also means, and this is tricky, avoiding scope creep and undocumented
                         changes, as well as getting rid of any non-value-added activities. Basically, if the project
                         team is adding components or features that aren't called for in the project, they're wast-
                         ing time and money.
                              Cost control focuses on controlling the ability of costs to change and on how the
                         project management team may allow or prevent cost changes from happening. When a
                         change does occur, the project manager must document the change and the reason why
                         it occurred and, if necessary, create a variance report. Cost control is concerned with
                         understanding why the cost variances, both good and bad, have occurred. The "why"
                         behind the variances allows the project manager to make appropriate decisions on fu-
                         ture project actions.

                                       EXAM TIP      Variance reports are sometimes called exception reports.


                             Ignoring the project cost variances may cause the project to suffer from budget
                         shortages, additional risks, or scheduling problems. When cost variances happen, they
                         must be examined, recorded, and investigated. Cost control allows the project manager
                         to confront the problem, find a solution, and then act accordingly. Specifically, cost
                         control focuses on:

                              * Controlling causes of change to ensure that the changes are actually needed
                              * Controlling and documenting changes to the cost baseline as they happen
                              * Controlling changes in the project and their influence on cost
                              * Performing cost monitoring to recognize and understand cost variances
                              * Recording appropriate cost changes in the cost baseline
                              * Preventing unauthorized changes to the cost baseline
                              * Communicating the cost changes to the proper stakeholders
                              * Working to bring and maintain costs within an acceptable range

                         Managing the Project Costs
                         Controlling the project costs is more than a philosophy--it's the project manager working
                         with the project team, the stakeholders, and often management to ensure that costs don't
                         creep into the project, and then managing the cost increases as they happen. To implement
                         cost control, the project manager must rely on several documents and processes:

                              * Cost baseline You know this one already. The cost baseline is the expected cost
                                the project will incur and when those expenses will happen. This time-phased

                                                                                                Chapter 7: Managing Project Costs

                                                                                                                               277
                          budget reflects the amount that will be spent throughout the project. Recall that
                          the cost baseline is a tool used to measure project performance.
                        * Project funding requirements The funds for a project are not allotted all at
                          once, but stair-stepped in alignment with project deliverables. Thus, as the
                          project moves toward completion, additional funding is allotted. This allows
                          for cash-flow forecasting. In other words, an organization doesn't have to have
                          the project's entire budget allotted at the start of the project. It can predict,




                                                                                                                                             PART II
                          based on expected income and predicted expenses, that the budget will be
                          available in incremental steps.
                        * Performance reports These reports focus on project cost performance,
                          project scope, and planned performance versus actual performance. The
                          reports may vary according to stakeholder needs. We'll discuss performance
                          reporting in detail in Chapter 10 and everyone's favorite, earned value
                          management, in just one moment.
                        * Change requests When a change to the project scope is requested, an
                          analysis of the associated costs to complete the proposed change is required.
                          In some instances, such as when removing a portion of the project deliverable,
                          a change request may reduce the project cost. (I know, that's wishful thinking.
                          But in the PMI's world, it's possible.)
                        * Cost management plan The cost management plan dictates how cost
                          variances will be managed. A variance is a difference between what was
                          expected and what was experienced. In some instances, the management
                          contingency reserve allowance can "cover" the cost overruns. In other
                          instances, depending on the reason why the overrun occurred, the funding
                          may have to come from the project customer. Consider a customer who
                          wanted the walls painted green, and after the work was completed, changed
                          his mind and wanted the walls orange. This cost overrun is due only to a
                          change request and not to a defect.

                   Creating a Cost Change Control System
                   Way, way back in Chapter 5, I discussed the scope change control system. Whenever
                   some joker wants to add something to the project scope, or even take something out of
                   our project scope, the scope change control system is engaged. Similarly, the cost change
                   control system examines any changes associated with scope changes, the costs of mate-
                   rials, and the cost of any other resources you can imagine.
                       When a cost change enters the system, there is appropriate paperwork, a tracking sys-
                   tem, and procedures the project manager must follow to obtain approval on the pro-
                   posed change. Figure 7-5 demonstrates a typical work flow for cost change approval. If a
                   change gets approved, the cost baseline is updated to reflect the approved changes. If a
                   request gets denied, the denial must be documented for future potential reference. You
                   don't want a stakeholder wondering at the end of the project why his or her change wasn't
                   incorporated into the project scope without having some documentation as to why.

                                       EXAM TIP There are four specific change control systems in project
                                       management: the scope change control system, the schedule change control
                                       system, the cost change control system, and the contract change control
                                       system.


                         Using Earned Value Management
                         When I teach a PMP Boot Camp, attendees snap to attention when it comes to earned
                         value management and their exam. This topic is foreign to many folks, and they under-
                         standably want an in-depth explanation of this suite of mysterious formulas. Maybe
                         you find yourself in that same position, so here's some good news: It's not that big a
                         deal. Relax--you can memorize these formulas, answer the exam questions correctly,
                         and worry about tougher exam topics. I'll show you how.
                             First, earned value management (EVM) is the process of measuring the performance
                         of project work against what was planned to identify variances, opportunities to im-
                         prove the project, or just to check the project's health. EVM can help predict future vari-
                         ances and the final costs at completion. It is a system of mathematical formulas that
                         compares work performed against work planned, and measures the actual cost of the
                         work your project has performed. EVM is an important part of cost control since it al-
                         lows a project manager to predict future variances from the expenses to date within the
                         project.

                                                                                                                                 279
                   Learning the Fundamentals
                   EVM, in regard to cost management, is concerned with the relationships among three
                   formulas that reflect project performance. Figure 7-6 demonstrates the connection be-
                   tween the following EVM values:

                       * Planned value (PV) Planned value is the work scheduled and the budget
                         authorized to accomplish that work. For example, if a project has a budget of




                                                                                                                                               PART II
                         $500,000 and month 6 represents 50 percent of the project work, the PV for
                         that month is $250,000.
                        * Earned value (EV) Earned value is the physical work completed to date and
                          the authorized budget for that work. For example, if your project has a budget
                          of $500,000 and the work completed to date represents 45 percent of the entire
                          project work, its earned value is $225,000. You can find EV by multiplying the
                          percent complete times the project budget at completion (BAC).
                        * Actual cost (AC) Actual cost is the actual amount of monies the project has
                          required to date. In your project, your BAC, for example, is $500,000, and
                          your earned value is $225,000. As it turns out, your project team had some
                          waste, and you spent $232,000 in actual monies to reach the 45-percent-
                          complete milestone. Your actual cost is $232,000.

                       That's the fundamentals of earned value management. All of our remaining formu-
                   las center on these simple formulas. Just remember that earned value is always the
                   percent of work complete times the given budget at completion. On your PMI exam,
                   you'll always be provided with the actual costs, which are the monies that have already
                   been spent on the project. You'll have to do some math to find the planned value,
                   which is the value your project should have by a given time. The formula for planned
                   value is the percentage of project completion based on how complete the project should




                   Figure 7-6   Earned value management shows project performance.

                         be at a given time. For example, let's say you're supposed to be 80 percent complete by
                         December 15. If your budget is $100,000, in this instance your planned value is
                         $80,000.

                         Finding the Project Variances
                         Out in the real world, I'm sure your projects are never late and never over budget (ha-
                         ha--pretty funny, right?). For your exam you'll need to be able to find the cost and
                         schedule variances for your project. I'll stay with the same $500,000 budget I've been
                         working with in the previous examples and as demonstrated in Figure 7-7. Finding the
                         variances helps the project manager and management determine a project's health, set
                         goals for project improvement, and benchmark projects against each other based on
                         the identified variances.

                         Finding the Cost Variance
                         Let's say your project has a BAC of $500,000 and you're 40 percent complete. You have
                         spent, however, $234,000 in real monies. To find the cost variance, we'll find the earned
                         value, which is 40 percent of the $500,000 budget. As Figure 7-7 shows, this is $200,000.
                         In this example, you spent $234,000 in actual costs. The formula for finding the cost vari-
                         ance is earned value minus actual costs. In this instance, the cost variance is -$34,000.
                             This means you've spent $34,000 dollars more than what the work you've done is
                         worth. Of course, the $34,000 is in relation to the size of the project. On this project,
                         that's a sizeable flaw, but on a billion-dollar project, $34,000 may not mean too much.
                         On either project, a $34,000 cost variance would likely spur a cost variance report
                         (sometimes called an exceptions report).

                         Finding the Schedule Variance
                         Can you guess how the schedule variance works? It's basically the same as cost variance,
                         only this time, we're concerned with planned value instead of actual costs. Let's say your
                         project with the $500,000 budget is supposed to be 45 percent complete by today, but
                         we know that you're only 40 percent complete. We've already found the earned value as

                   Figure 7-8   Schedule variance is the difference of earned value and planned value.


                       Recall that planned value, where you're supposed to be and what you're supposed
                   to be worth, is planned completion times the BAC. In this example, it's 45 percent of
                   the $500,000 BAC, which is $225,000. Uh-oh! You're behind schedule. The schedule
                   variance formula, as Figure 7-8 demonstrates, is earned value minus the planned value.
                   In this example, the schedule variance is $25,000.

                   Finding the Indexes
                   In mathematical terms, an index is an expression showing a ratio--and that's what
                   we're doing with these indexes. Basically, an index in earned value management shows
                   the health of the project's time and cost. The index, or ratio, is measured against one: the
                   closer to one the index is, the better the project is performing. As a rule, you definitely
                   don't want to be less than one because that's a poorly performing project. And, believe
                   it or not, you don't want to be too far from one in your index, as this shows estimates
                   that were bloated or way, way too pessimistic. Really.

                   Finding the Cost Performance Index
                   The cost performance index (CPI) measures the project based on its financial perfor-
                   mance. It's an easy formula: earned value divided by actual costs, as Figure 7-9 demon-
                   strates. Your project, in this example, has a budget of $500,000 and you're 40 percent




                   Figure 7-9   The CPI is found by dividing earned value by the actual costs.

                         complete with the project work. This is an earned value of how much? Yep. It's 40 per-
                         cent of the $500,000, for an earned value of $200,000.
                             Your actual costs for this project to date (the cumulative costs) total $234,000. Your
                         PMI exam will always tell you your actual costs for each exam question. Let's finish the
                         formula. To find the CPI, we divide the earned value by the actual costs, or $200,000
                         divided by $234,000. The CPI for this project is .85, which means that we're 85 percent
                         on track financially, not too healthy for any project, regardless of its budget.
                             Another fun way to look at the .85 value is that you're actually losing 15 cents on
                         every dollar you spend on the project. Yikes! That means for every dollar you spend for
                         labor, you actually only get 85 cents worth. Not a good deal for the project manager. As
                         stated earlier, the closer to 1 the number is, the better the project is performing.

                         Finding the Schedule Performance Index
                         The schedule performance index (SPI) measures the project schedule's overall health. The
                         formula, as Figure 7-10 demonstrates, is earned value divided by planned value. In
                         other words, you're trying to determine how closely your project work is being com-
                         pleted in relation to the project schedule you created. Let's try this formula.
                             Your project with the $500,000 budget is 40 percent complete, for an earned value
                         of $200,000, but you're supposed to be 45 percent complete by today. That's a planned
                         value of $225,000. The SPI for this project at this time is determined by dividing the
                         earned value of $200,000 by the planned value of $225,000, for an SPI of .88. This tells
                         me that this project is 88 percent on schedule, or, if you're a pessimist, the project is 12
                         percent off track.

                         Predicting the Project's Future
                         Notice in the preceding paragraph I said, "at this time." That's because the project will,
                         hopefully, continue to make progress, and the planned value and earned value num-
                         bers will change. Naturally, as the project moves toward completion, the earned value
                         amounts will increase, and so will the planned value numbers. Typically, these indexes,
                         both schedule and costs, are measured at milestones, and they allow the project man-
                         agement team to do some prognosticating as to where the project will likely end up by
                         its completion. That's right--we can do some forecasting.

                                 EXAM TIP The forecasting formulas are swift and easy to calculate, but
                                 they're not really all that accurate. After all, you never really know how much a
                                 project will cost until you've completed all of the project work.

                   Finding the Estimate to Complete
                   So your project is in a pickle, and management wants to know how much more this
                   project is going to cost. They're after the estimate to complete (ETC) equation. There are




                                                                                                                                                 PART II
                   three flavors of this formula, based on conditions within your project.

                   ETC Based on a New Estimate Sometimes you just have to accept the fact that
                   all of the estimates up to this point are flawed, and you need a new estimate. Imagine
                   a project where the project manager and the project team estimate that the work will
                   cost $150,000 in labor, but once they get into the project, they realize it'll actually cost
                   $275,000 in labor because the work is much harder than they anticipated. That's a rea-
                   son for the ETC on a new estimate.

                   ETC Based on Atypical Variances This formula, shown in Figure 7-11, is used
                   when the project has experienced some wacky fluctuation in costs, and the project
                   manager doesn't believe the anomalies will continue within the project. For example,
                   the cost of wood was estimated at $18 per sheet. Due to a hurricane in another part of the
                   country, however, the cost of wood has changed to $25 per sheet. This fluctuation in the
                   cost of materials has changed, but the project manager doesn't believe the cost change
                   will affect the cost to deliver the other work packages in the WBS. Here's the formula for
                   atypical variances: ETC = BAC - EV.
                       Let's say that this project has a BAC of $500,000 and is 40 percent complete. The
                   earned value is $200,000, so our ETC formula would be ETC = $500,000 - $200,000,
                   for an ETC of $300,000. Obviously, this formula is shallow and won't be the best fore-
                   casting formula for every scenario. If the cost of the materials has changed drastically, a
                   whole new estimate would be more appropriate.

                   ETC Based on Typical Variances Sometimes in a project, a variance appears
                   and the project management team realizes that this is going to continue through the
                   rest of the project. Figure 7-12 demonstrates the formula: ETC = (BAC - EV)/CPI. For




                   Figure 7-11   The estimate to complete can consider atypical variances.

                         Figure 7-12   ETC may consider expected variances within a project.


                         example, consider a project to install 10,000 light fixtures throughout a university cam-
                         pus. You and the project team have estimated it'll take 12,000 hours of labor to install
                         all of the lights, and your cost estimate is $54 per hour, which equates to $648,000 to
                         complete all of the installations.
                             As the project team begins work on the install, however, the time to install the light
                         fixtures actually takes slightly longer than anticipated for each fixture. You realize that
                         your duration estimate is flawed and the project team will likely take 16,000 hours of
                         labor to install all of the lights.
                             The ETC in this formula requires that the project manager know the earned value
                         and the cost performance index. Let's say that this project is 20 percent complete, so the
                         EV is roughly $129,000. As the work is taking longer to complete, the actual cost to reach
                         the 20 percent mark turns out to be $172,000. The CPI is found by dividing the earned
                         value, $129,000, by the actual costs of $172,000. The CPI for this project is .75.
                             Now let's try the ETC formula: (BAC - EV)/CPI, or ($648,000 - $129,000)/.75,
                         which equates to $692,000. That's $692,000 more that this project will need in its bud-
                         get to complete the remainder of the project work. Yikes!

                         Finding the Estimate at Completion
                         One of the most fundamental forecasting formulas is the estimate at completion (EAC).
                         This formula accounts for all those pennies you're losing on every dollar if your CPI is
                         less than one. It's an opportunity for the project manager to say, "Hey! Based on our
                         current project's health, this is where we're likely to end up at the end of the project. I'd
                         better work on my resume." Let's take a look at these formulas.

                         EAC Using a New Estimate Just as with the estimate to complete formulas,
                         sometimes it's best just to create a whole new estimate. This approach with the EAC is
                         pretty straightforward--it's the actual costs plus the estimate to complete. Let's say your
                         project has a budget of $500,000, and you've already spent $187,000 of it. For what-
                         ever reason, you've determined that your estimate is no longer valid, and your ETC for
                         the remainder of the project is actually going to be $420,000--that's how much you're
                         going to need to finish the project work. The EAC, in this instance, is the actual costs of
                         $187,000 plus your ETC of $420,000, or $607,000.

                   Figure 7-13   The EAC can also account for anomalies in project expenses.


                   EAC with Atypical Variances Sometimes anomalies within a project can skew
                   the project estimate at completion. The formula for this scenario, as Figure 7-13 dem-
                   onstrates, is the actual costs plus the budget at completion minus the earned value. Let's
                   try it. Your project has a BAC of $500,000, and the earned value is $100,000. However,
                   you've spent $127,000 in actual costs. The EAC would be $127,000 + $500,000 -
                   $100,000, or $527,000. That's your new estimate at completion for this project.

                   EAC Using the CPI If a project has a CPI of .97, you could say the project is losing
                   three pennies on every dollar. Those three pennies are going to add up over time. This
                   approach is most often used when the project manager realizes that the cost variances
                   are likely going to continue through the remainder of the project. This formula, as Fig-
                   ure 7-14 demonstrates, is EAC = AC + ((BAC - EV)/CPI). Don't you just love nested
                   formulas? Let's try this one out.
                       Your project has a BAC of $500,000, and your earned value is $150,000. Your ac-
                   tual costs for this project are $162,000. Your CPI is calculated as .93. The EAC would be
                   $162,000 + (($500,000 - $150,000)/.93), or $538,344. Wasn't that fun?

                                       EXAM TIP There won't be as many questions on these EVM formulas as you
                                       might hope, but knowing these formulas can help you nail down the few
                                       questions you'll likely have.

                         Calculating the To-Complete Performance Index
                         Imagine a formula that would tell you if the project can meet the budget at completion
                         based on current conditions. Or imagine a formula that can predict if the project can
                         even achieve your new estimate at completion. Forget your imagination and just use the
                         To-Complete Performance Index (TCPI). This formula can forecast the likelihood of a
                         project to achieve its goals based on what's happening in the project right now. There are
                         two different flavors for the TCPI, depending on what you want to accomplish:

                              * If you want to see if your project can meet the budget at completion, you'll use
                                this formula: TCPI = (BAC - EV)/(BAC - AC).
                              * If you want to see if your project can meet the newly created estimate at
                                completion, you'll use this version of the formula: TCPI = (BAC - EV)/
                                (EAC - AC).

                             Anything greater than 1 in either formula means that you'll have to be more effi-
                         cient than you planned in order to achieve the BAC or the EAC, depending on which
                         formula you've used. Basically, the greater the number is than 1, the less likely it is that
                         you'll be able to meet your BAC or the EAC, depending on which formula you've used.
                         The lower the number is than 1, the more likely you are to reach your BAC or EAC
                         (again, depending on which formula you've used).

                         Finding Big Variances
                         Two variances relate to the entire project, and they're both easy to learn. The first vari-
                         ance you don't really know until the project is 100 percent complete. This is the project
                         variance, and it's simply BAC - AC. If your project had a budget of $500,000 and you
                         spent $734,000 to get it all done, then the project variance is $500,000 - $734,000,
                         which equates, of course, to -$234,000.
                             The second variance is part of our forecasting model, and it predicts the likely proj-
                         ect variance. It's called the variance at completion (VAC), and the formula is VAC = BAC
                         - EAC. Let's say your project has a BAC of $500,000 and your EAC is predicted to be
                         $538,344. The VAC is $500,000 - $538,344, for a predicted variance of -$38,344. Of
                         course, this formula assumes that the rest of the project will run smoothly. In reality,
                         where you and I hang out, the project VAC could swing in either direction based on the
                         project's overall performance.

                         The Five EVM Formula Rules
                         For EVM formulas, the following five rules should be remembered:

                              1. Always start with EV.
                              2. Variance means subtraction.

                        3. Index means division.
                        4. Less than 1 is bad in an index, and greater than 1 is good. Except for TCPI,
                           which is the reverse.
                        5. Negative is bad in a variance.

                         Chapter Summary
                         Projects require resources and time, both of which cost money. Projects are estimated,
                         or predicted, according to how much the project work will likely cost to complete.
                         There are multiple flavors and approaches to project estimating. Project managers can
                         use analogous estimating, parametric estimating, or, the most reliable, bottom-up esti-
                         mating. Whatever estimating approach the project manager elects to use, the basis of
                         the estimate should be documented in case the estimate should ever be called into
                         question.
                             When a project manager creates the project estimate, he should also factor in a
                         contingency reserve for project risks and cost overruns. Based on the enterprise envi-
                         ronmental factors of an organization, and often the project priority, the process to
                         create and receive the contingency reserve may fluctuate. The contingency reserve is
                         not an allowance to be spent at the project manager's discretion but more of a safety
                         net should the project go awry. Variances covered by the contingency reserve can't be
                         swept under the rug, but must be accounted for and hopefully learned from.
                             Cost budgeting is the aggregation of the costs to create the work packages in the
                         WBS. Sometimes, cost budgeting refers to the cost aggregation as the "roll-up" of the
                         costs associated with each work package. Cost budgeting effectively applies the cost
                         estimates over time. Most project managers don't receive the entire project funding in
                         one swoop, but rather in step functions over the life of the project.
                             Once the project moves from planning into execution, it also moves into monitor-
                         ing and control. The project manager and the project team work together to control the
                         project costs and monitor the performance of the project work. The most accessible
                         method to monitor the project cost is through earned value management. Earned value
                         management demonstrates the performance of the project and allows the project man-
                         ager to forecast where the project is likely to end up financially.

                         Key Terms
                         Actual cost (AC)     The actual amount of monies the project has spent to date.
                         Analogous estimating An approach that relies on historical information to predict
                         the cost of the current project. It is also known as top-down estimating and is the least
                         reliable of all the cost-estimating approaches.
                         Bottom-up estimating An estimating approach that starts from zero, accounts for
                         each component of the WBS, and arrives at a sum for the project. It is completed with
                         the project team and can be one of the most time-consuming and most reliable meth-
                         ods to predict project costs.
                         Budget estimate This estimate is also somewhat broad and is used early in the plan-
                         ning processes and also in top-down estimates. The range of variance for the estimate
                         can be from -10 percent to +25 percent.
                         Commercial database A cost-estimating approach that uses a database, typically
                         software-driven, to create the cost estimate for a project.

                   Contingency reserve A contingency allowance to account for overruns in costs. Con-
                   tingency allowances are used at the project manager's discretion and with manage-
                   ment's approval to counteract cost overruns for scheduled activities and risk events.
                   Cost aggregation Costs are parallel to each WBS work package. The costs of each
                   work package are aggregated to their corresponding control accounts. Each control ac-
                   count then is aggregated to the sum of the project costs.
                   Cost baseline A time-lapse exposure of when the project monies are to be spent in

                   relation to cumulative values of the work completed in the project.
                   Cost budgeting The cost aggregation achieved by assigning specific dollar amounts
                   for each of the scheduled activities or, more likely, for each of the work packages in the
                   WBS. Cost budgeting applies the cost estimates over time.
                   Cost change control system A system that examines any changes associated with
                   scope changes, the cost of materials, and the cost of any other resources, and the associ-
                   ated impact on the overall project cost.
                   Cost management plan The cost management plan dictates how cost variances will
                   be managed.
                   Cost of poor quality The monies spent to recover from not adhering to the expected
                   level of quality. Examples may include rework, defect repair, loss of life or limb because
                   safety precautions were not taken, loss of sales, and loss of customers. This is also
                   known as the cost of nonconformance to quality.
                   Cost of quality The monies spent to attain the expected level of quality within a proj-
                   ect. Examples include training, testing, and safety precautions.
                   Cost performance index (CPI) Measures the project based on its financial perfor-
                   mance. The formula is CPI = EV/AC.
                   Cost variance (CV) The difference of the earned value amount and the cumulative
                   actual costs of the project. The formula is CV = EV - AC.
                   Definitive estimate This estimate type is one of the most accurate. It's used late in the
                   planning processes and is associated with bottom-up estimating. You need the WBS in
                   order to create the definitive estimate. The range of variance for the estimate can be
                   from -5 percent to +10 percent.
                   Direct costs Costs are attributed directly to the project work and cannot be shared
                   among projects (for example, airfare, hotels, long-distance phone charges, and so on).
                   Earned value (EV) Earned value is the physical work completed to date and the au-
                   thorized budget for that work. It is the percentage of the BAC that represents the actual
                   work completed in the project.
                   Estimate at completion (EAC) These forecasting formulas predict the likely com-
                   pleted costs of the project based on current scenarios within the project.

                         Estimate to complete (ETC) An earned value management formula that predicts how
                         much funding the project will require to be completed. Three variations of this for-
                         mula are based on conditions the project may be experiencing.
                         Fixed costs Costs that remain constant throughout the life of the project (the cost of
                         a piece of rented equipment for the project, the cost of a consultant brought on to the
                         project, and so on).
                         Funding limit reconciliation An organization's approach to managing cash flow
                         against the project deliverables based on a schedule, milestone accomplishment, or
                         data constraints.
                         Indirect costs Costs that are representative of more than one project (for example,
                         utilities for the performing organization, access to a training room, project manage-
                         ment software license, and so on).
                         Known unknown An event that will likely happen within the project, but when it
                         will happen and to what degree is unknown. These events, such as delays, are usually
                         risk-related.
                         Learning curve An approach that assumes the cost per unit decreases the more units
                         workers complete, because workers learn as they complete the required work.
                         Oligopoly A market condition where the market is so tight that the actions of one
                         vendor affect the actions of all the others.
                         Opportunity cost The total cost of the opportunity that is refused to realize an op-
                         posing opportunity.
                         Parametric estimating An approach using a parametric model to extrapolate what
                         costs will be needed for a project (for example, cost per hour and cost per unit). It can
                         include variables and points based on conditions.
                         Planned value (PV) Planned value is the work scheduled and the budget authorized
                         to accomplish that work. It is the percentage of the BAC that reflects where the project
                         should be at this point in time.
                         Project variance The final variance, which is discovered only at the project's comple-
                         tion. The formula is VAR = BAC - AC.
                         Regression analysis This is a statistical approach to predicting what future values
                         may be, based on historical values. Regression analysis creates quantitative predictions
                         based on variables within one value to predict variables in another. This form of esti-
                         mating relies solely on pure statistical math to reveal relationships between variables
                         and to predict future values.
                         Reserve analysis Cost reserves are for unknown unknowns within a project. The man-
                         agement reserve is not part of the project cost baseline, but is included as part of the
                         project budget.

                                                                                                                               291
                   Rough order of magnitude This rough estimate is used during the initiating pro-
                   cesses and in top-down estimates. The range of variance for the estimate can be from
                   -25 percent to +75 percent.
                   Schedule performance index (SPI) Measures the project based on its schedule per-
                   formance. The formula is SPI = EV/PV.
                   Schedule variance (SV) The difference between the earned value and the planned
                   value. The formulas is SV = EV - PV.

                   Single source Many vendors can provide what your project needs to purchase, but
                   you prefer to work with a specific vendor.
                   Sole source Only one vendor can provide what your project needs to purchase. Ex-
                   amples include a specific consultant, specialized service, or unique type of material.
                   Sunk costs   Monies that have already been invested in a project.
                   To-Complete Performance Index A formula to forecast the likelihood of a project to
                   achieve its goals based on what's happening in the project right now. There are two
                   different flavors for the TCPI, depending on what you want to accomplish. If you want
                   to see if your project can meet the budget at completion, you'll use this formula: TCPI
                   = (BAC - EV)/(BAC - AC). If you want to see if your project can meet the newly cre-
                   ated estimate at completion, you'll use this version of the formula: TCPI = (BAC - EV)/
                   (EAC - AC).
                   Variable costs Costs that change based on the conditions applied in the project (the
                   number of meeting participants, the supply of and demand for materials, and so on).
                   Variance   The difference between what was expected and what was experienced.
                   Variance at completion (VAC) A forecasting formula that predicts how much of a
                   variance the project will likely have based on current conditions within the project. The
                   formula is VAC = BAC - EAC.

                       customer service reps are invited to attend the training session. Attendance
                       is optional. You have calculated the costs of the training facility, but the
                       workbook expense depends on how many students register for the class. For
                       every 5,000 workbooks created, the cost is reduced by a percentage of the
                       original printing cost. The workbook expense is an example of which one of

                                 company. Management has asked that you create a cost estimate of the project
                                 so they can determine the project funding. You gather the inputs for the cost
                                 estimate and begin the process of cost estimating. Of the following cost-
                                 estimating inputs, which one is the least reliable?

                   16. Linda is the project manager of a construction project. The budget for her
                       project is $275,000. The project team made a mistake early in the project that
                       cost $34,000 in added materials. Linda does not believe the mistakes will
                       likely happen again because the team is 30 percent complete with the project
                       and things are once again going smoothly. Her sponsor wants to know how
                       much more funding Linda will likely need on the project. What should Linda
                       tell the sponsor?

                         Questions and Answers
                              1. You are using a previous similar project to predict the costs of the current
                                 project. Which of the following best describes analogous estimating?
                                  A. Regression analysis
                                  B. Bottom-up estimating
                                  C. Organizational process assets
                                  D. Enterprise environmental factors
                                 C. Analogous estimating is based on historical information, which is part of
                                 organizational process assets. A, regression analysis, is incorrect because this
                                 choice describes the study of a project moving backward so that it may
                                 ultimately move forward. B is incorrect because this is the most reliable cost-
                                 estimating technique and is based on the current project's WBS. D, enterprise
                                 environmental factors, is a term that describes the internal policies and
                                 procedures a project manager must follow within the project.
                              2. You are the project manager for a new technology implementation project.
                                 Management has requested that your estimates be as exact as possible. Which
                                 one of the following methods of estimating will provide the most accurate
                                 estimate?
                                  A. Top-down estimating
                                  B. Top-down budgeting
                                  C. Bottom-up estimating
                                  D. Parametric estimating
                                 C. Bottom-up estimating takes the longest to complete of all the estimating
                                 approaches, but it is also the most reliable approach. A, top-down estimating,
                                 is also known as analogous estimating, and it is not reliable. B, top-down
                                 budgeting, is not a valid term for this question. D, parametric estimating, is
                                 an approach that predicts the project costs based on a parameter, such as cost
                                 per hour, cost per unit, or cost per usage.
                              3. Amy is the project manager for her company and she's working with the
                                 project team to determine the effect of a proposed change on the project's
                                 budget. When Amy looks at the change, she tells the team that the change will
                                 pass through project's cost change control system. What does the cost change
                                 control system do?

                         scope.
                     D. This is not a valid change control system.
                     A. The cost change control system defines how changes to the cost baseline
                     may be approved. B, C, and D are all invalid choices.

                   4. You have just started a project for a manufacturer. Project team members
                      report they are 30 percent complete with the project. You have spent $25,000
                      of the project's $250,000 budget. What is the earned value for this project?
                      A. 10 percent
                      B. $75,000
                      C. $25,000
                     D. Not enough information to know
                     B. Earned value is found by multiplying the percentage of the project that is
                     completed by the project's budget at completion. In this instance, it's $75,000.
                     A, C, and D are all incorrect.
                   5. You and your project team are about to enter a meeting to determine project
                      costs. You have elected to use bottom-up estimating and will base your
                      estimate on the WBS. Which one of the following is not an attribute of
                      bottom-up estimating?
                      A. People doing the work create the estimates.
                      B. It creates a more accurate estimate.
                      C. It's more expensive to do than other methods.
                     D. It's less expensive to do than other methods.
                     D. Bottom-up estimating is typically more expensive to do than other
                     estimating approaches, because of the time required to create this type of
                     estimate. A, B, and C are all accurate attributes of a bottom-up estimate.
                   6. You are the project manager for a consulting company. Your company has
                      two possible projects to manage, but they can only choose one. Project WQQ
                      is worth $217,000, while Project LB is worth $229,000. Management elects
                      to choose Project LB. The opportunity cost of this choice is which one of the
                      following?
                      A. $12,000
                      B. $217,000
                      C. $229,000
                     D. Zero, because project LB is worth more than Project WQQ

                                 B. The opportunity cost is the amount of the project that the organization
                                 cannot do. A is incorrect because the $12,000 represents the difference
                                 between the two projects. C, $229,000, is incorrect because this is the amount
                                 of the LB project. D is incorrect because this is not an accurate statement.
                              7. You are the project manager for the CSR Training Project, and 21,000
                                 customer service reps are invited to attend the training session. Attendance
                                 is optional. You have calculated the costs of the training facility, but the
                                 workbook expense depends on how many students register for the class. For
                                 every 5,000 workbooks created, the cost is reduced by a percentage of the
                                 original printing cost. The workbook expense is an example of which one of
                                 the following?
                                  A. Fixed costs
                                  B. Parametric costs
                                  C. Variable costs
                                  D. Indirect costs
                                 C. This is an example of a variable cost, since the cost of the training will
                                 fluctuate based on the number of participants that choose to come to the project
                                 session. A is incorrect because fixed costs do not vary. B is incorrect because
                                 parametric costs can be identified as cost per unit. D is incorrect because indirect
                                 costs are a way to describe costs that may be shared between projects.
                              8. You are the project manager of a construction project scheduled to last 24
                                 months. You have elected to rent a piece of equipment for the project's
                                 duration, even though you will need the equipment only periodically
                                 throughout the project. The costs of the equipment rental per month are
                                 $890. This is an example of which of the following?
                                  A. Fixed costs
                                  B. Parametric costs
                                  C. Variable costs
                                  D. Indirect costs
                                 A. This is an example of a fixed cost. The cost of the equipment will remain
                                 uniform, or fixed, throughout the duration of the project. B is incorrect because
                                 parametric costs can be identified as cost per unit. C is incorrect because the
                                 cost of the equipment does not fluctuate. D is incorrect because indirect costs
                                 are a way to describe costs that may be shared between projects.
                              9. You are the project manager of the BHG Project. Your BAC is $600,000. You
                                 have spent $270,000 of your budget. You are now 40 percent done with the
                                 project, though your plan called for you to be 45 percent done with the work
                                 by this time. What is your CPI?

                                                                                                                           299
                       A. 100
                       B. 89
                       C. .89
                       D. .79
                       C. The CPI is found by dividing the earned value by the actual costs. A
                       is incorrect because the project is not performing at 100 percent. B is




                                                                                                                                         PART II
                       incorrect because "89" is not the same value as C. D is an incorrect
                       calculation of the CPI.
                   10. Management has requested that you complete a definitive cost estimate
                       for your current project. Which one of the following must exist in order to
                       complete this estimate?
                       A. Project scope statement
                       B. Work breakdown structure
                       C. Project team
                       D. Expert judgment
                       B. The WBS is needed in order to create a definitive cost estimate. This is the
                       most accurate estimate type, but it also takes the longest to complete. A, C,
                       and D are all incorrect because these items are not required to complete a
                       definitive estimate.
                   11. You need to procure a highly specialized chemical for a research project.
                       There is only one vendor available that provides the materials you need. This
                       scenario is an example of what market condition?
                       A. Constraint
                       B. Single source
                       C. Sole source
                       D. Oligopoly
                       C. Sole source is the best choice because it describes the marketplace
                       condition in which only one vendor can provide the goods or services your
                       project requires. A, constraint, is not a valid market condition. B, single
                       source, describes the marketplace condition in which there are multiple
                       vendors that can provide the goods or services your project demands, but you
                       prefer to work with just one in particular. D, an oligopoly, is a market
                       condition in which the actions of one vendor affect the actions of the other
                       vendors.
                   12. You are the project manager of the Network Upgrade Project for your
                       company. Management has asked that you create a cost estimate of the project
                       so they can determine the project funding. You gather the inputs for the cost




07-ch07.indd 299                                                                                                            7/12/2013 4:48:08 AM

                                 estimate and begin the process of cost estimating. Of the following cost-
                                 estimating inputs, which one is the least reliable?
                                  A. Team member recollections
                                  B. Historical information
                                  C. Project files
                                  D. Cost-estimating templates
                                 A. Team member recollections are the least reliable input to cost estimating.
                                 B, C, and D are all valid inputs to the cost-estimating process.
                             13. You can purchase pea gravel for your project at $437 per metric ton. You need
                                 four tons of the pea gravel, so you predict your costs will be $1,748. This is an
                                 example of which cost-estimating approach?
                                  A. Parametric
                                  B. Analogous
                                  C. Bottom-up
                                  D. Top-down
                                 A. The cost of the pea gravel is a parametric estimate. B, analogous, is incorrect
                                 because no other project cost estimate is being referenced. C, bottom-up, is
                                 not described in this instance because the WBS and each work package is not
                                 being estimated for cost. D, top-down estimating, is another name for A,
                                 analogous estimating, so this choice is invalid.
                             14. Which one of the following is an example of resource cost rates that a project
                                 manager could use to predict the cost of the project?
                                  A. Analogous estimating
                                  B. Bottom-up estimating
                                  C. Commercial database
                                  D. Procurement bid analysis
                                 C. Commercial databases often provide resource cost rates for project
                                 estimating, so this is the correct answer for this question. A, B, and D do not
                                 include resource cost rates, so these are all incorrect.
                             15. You have created a cost estimate for a new project that you'll be managing
                                 in your organization. All of the following should be included in your cost
                                 estimate except for which one?
                                  A. Description of the schedule activity's project scope of work
                                  B. Assumptions made
                                  C. Constraints
                                  D. Team members the project will utilize

                                                                                                                           301
                       D. The team members that the project manager will utilize are not included
                       in the cost estimate. The project manager will include the project scope of
                       work, the assumptions made, and the constraints considered when creating a
                       cost estimate, so A, B, and C are incorrect.
                   16. Linda is the project manager of a construction project. The budget for her
                       project is $275,000. The project team made a mistake early in the project that
                       cost $34,000 in added materials. Linda does not believe the mistakes will




                                                                                                                                         PART II
                       likely happen again because the team is 30 percent complete with the project
                       and things are once again going smoothly. Her sponsor wants to know how
                       much more funding Linda will likely need on the project. What should Linda
                       tell the sponsor?
                       A. $192,500
                       B. $241,000
                       C. $309,000
                       D. $275,000
                       A. The formula for this instance, because the conditions experienced were
                       atypical, is ETC = BAC - EV. The formula for Linda's project would be ETC =
                       $275,000 - $82,500. B, C, and D are all incorrect calculations of the estimate-
                       to-complete formula.
                   17. A project had a budget of $750,000 and was completed on time. The project
                       expenses, however, were 15 percent more than what the project called for.
                       What is the earned value of this project?
                       A. Impossible to know--not enough information
                       B. $112,500
                       C. $637,500
                       D. $750,000
                       D. The earned value is simply the percent complete times the BAC. In this
                       instance, the project's budget was $750,000, and since the project is 100
                       percent complete, the answer is D. A, B, and C are all incorrect.
                   18. A project had a budget of $750,000 and was completed on time. The project
                       expenses, however, were 15 percent more than what the project called for.
                       What is the variance at the completion for this project?
                       A. Impossible to know--not enough information
                       B. $112,500
                       C. $637,500
                       D. $750,000
                       B. The formula for this problem is variance at completion minus the actual
                       costs for the project. A, C, and D are all incorrect.

                             19. Marty is the project manager of a software development project. He has
                                 reviewed the project's costs and progress and he realizes that he has a cost
                                 variance of $44,000. He needs to complete what type of report?
                                  A. Status report
                                  B. Exceptions report
                                  C. Forecast report
                                  D. Lessons learned
                                 B. Because Marty has a variance, he needs to complete a variance report. A
                                 variance report is also known as an exceptions report, so B is the best answer.
                                 A, a status report, is used to communicate the status of the project, not the
                                 variances. C is not a valid report type. D, lessons learned, is an ongoing
                                 project document, not a report type.
                             20. You are a construction manager for a construction project. The project will
                                 be using a new material that the project team has never worked with before.
                                 You allot $10,000 to train the project team on the new materials so that the
                                 project will operate smoothly. The $10,000 for training is known as what?
                                  A. Cost of quality
                                  B. Cost of poor quality
                                  C. Sunk costs
                                  D. Contingency allowance
                                 A. Training for the project team is known as the cost of quality. B, the cost of
                                 poor quality, is incorrect because this would be the costs the project would
                                 incur if it did not attain the expected level of quality. Sunk costs describe the
                                 monies that have been spent on a project already, so C is incorrect. D,
                                 contingency allowance, is an amount of funds allotted to cover cost overruns
                                 in a project.

                     Managing Project Quality

                                                                                                                                   8

                   What good does it do if a project launches, the project execution consumes the monies
                   and time, but the project deliverable is of unacceptable quality? Imagine a project to
                   build a new house, and at the project completion, the house is tilting to one side, the
                   windows all have cracks and holes in them, and the roof has obvious gaps for the rain
                   and birds. This is not, I'm sure, what the homeowners had in mind.

                       Fortunately, in project management--in good project management--mechanisms
                   are in place to plan and implement quality throughout the project, and not just as an
                   afterthought. Project quality management is all about the project manager, the project
                   team, and the performing organization working together to ensure that the project per-
                   forms as the project plan calls for, so that the project deliverable aligns with the project
                   scope statement. Quality in a project is really all about getting the project done and
                   creating a deliverable that satisfies the project requirements and that can actually be
                   used by the project customer.
                       According to the American Society for Quality (ASQ), "Quality is the degree to
                   which a set of inherent characteristics fulfill requirements." Well, isn't that interesting?
                   Let's go back in time. A project is launched and a project charter is issued to the project
                   manager. Then the project manager and the project team create what document? The
                   project scope statement. The project scope statement defines all of the requirements for
                   the project, including what's in and what's out of scope. Quality is, therefore, satisfying
                   everything that the project scope statement requires.
                       In the project scope statement, we define what the project will create, its require-
                   ments for acceptance, and the metrics to measure project success. In project quality
                   management, we plan quality into the project, inspect the project and deliverables for
                   the existence of quality, and then move toward the scope validation process, which
                   confirms that we've created what our customer expected. Quality is about delivering on
                   promises.

                             No discussion on quality is complete without a nod to our pal W. Edwards Deming.
                         You likely won't need to know much about Deming for the exam, other than his famed
                         plan-do-check-act (PDCA) cycle. (I highly recommend Mary B. Walton's book The Dem-
                         ing Management Method [Perigee Books, 1988] for the complete story of Deming--
                         maybe after you pass your PMI examination.) For your PMP and CAPM exams, know
                         that Deming's philosophy on quality management considers of paramount importance
                         customer satisfaction, prevention over inspection, a call for management responsibility,
                         and a desire to do the work correctly the first time.

                             This chapter is core to the PMI's idea of project integration management. If quality
                         suffers, then all of the knowledge areas are affected by the absence of quality. You can
                         also see the effect on integration management if any of the other knowledge areas suf-
                         fers in performance. Quality is directly affected by all of the other areas of project man-
                         agement, and they likewise are affected if quality is missing. It's a busy, two-way street.


                         Planning for Quality
                         Quality planning is the process of first determining which quality standards are rele-
                         vant to your project and then finding the best methods of adhering to those quality
                         standards. This is a great example of project integration management, which was re-
                         ferred to earlier. Quality planning is core to the planning process group because each
                         knowledge area has relevant standards that affect quality, and quality planning is inte-
                         grated into each planning process.
                             In other words, if a project manager rushes through planning for each of the knowl-
                         edge areas, then quality is likely to suffer. When change requests are proposed, the im-
                         pact of each change request on each of the knowledge areas is considered. You already
                         know that a change request could have a financial impact, a schedule impact, and
                         more. Quality management asks: What impact does quality have on this proposed
                         change, and what impact does this change have on the overall quality of the project?
                             Throughout the project planning, the focus is on completing the project by satisfy-
                         ing the project requirements. Quality is fleshed into all of the project planning. The
                         foundation of quality planning states that quality is planned into the project, not in-
                         spected in. In other words, planning how to achieve the expected level of quality and
                         then executing the project plan is easier, more cost-effective, and less stressful for every-
                         one involved than catching and fixing mistakes as the project moves toward comple-
                         tion. Like my dad used to say, "Do it right the first time."
                             There are six inputs to planning for quality in a project:

                              * Project management plan The project management plan needs the scope,
                                cost, and schedule baselines as part of the quality management planning.
                                The project scope baseline defines all of the project requirements and the

                                                                                                Chapter 8: Managing Project Quality

                                                                                                                                 305
                           expectations of the project customer. By satisfying the requirements in the
                           scope baseline, nothing less and nothing more, quality can be achieved. The
                           goal of project quality management is to satisfy the acceptance criteria for the
                           project as defined in the project scope baseline. The cost baseline is needed
                           to help balance the expected quality with the monies you spend. Finally, the
                           schedule baseline is needed to determine how the schedule may affect the
                           quality processes. Time can directly affect quality. If the project schedule starts




                                                                                                                                               PART II
                           to slip, the project team may feel rushed, and rushed people often make more
                           mistakes. More mistakes will increase the project cost and further delay the
                           project. As Ben Franklin said, "Haste makes waste."
                        * Stakeholder register You'll need to know which stakeholders have a specific
                          interest in the quality objectives of the project and how to contact them. Some
                          stakeholders may have concerns about specific deliverables, so you'll want to
                          communicate with those folks when quality issues arise.
                        * Risk register The risk register contains all of the identified risks and
                          information on how potential risks may affect the overall quality of the
                          project.
                        * Requirements documentation The requirements of the project are needed
                          because these reflect the expectations of the project stakeholders. The project's
                          work is to create all of the requirements and fulfill the product scope.
                        * Enterprise environmental factors You know that enterprise environmental
                          factors are the policies and procedures your organization must adhere to. In
                          particular, the enterprise environmental factors I'm discussing here are those
                          mandates that affect the application area your project is dealing with. In other
                          words, a construction project has different codes and regulations to follow
                          than a project to bake a million cookies does.
                        * Organizational process assets These are the methods of operation your
                          organization follows and the guidelines that are specific to your organization.
                          Historical information, lessons learned, and guidelines within your
                          organization are there for the project managers to rely on. Within the
                          organization, a quality policy may have been issued by senior management
                          for all projects to adhere to--this is part of organizational process assets. And
                          what if a quality policy doesn't exist? It's up to the project management team
                          to create one for their project.


                   Using Quality Planning Tools
                   The project manager and the project team can use several tools to plan for quality in the
                   project. The goal of all these tools is to plan quality into the project rather than attempt
                   to inspect quality into the project. (To repeat, do the work right the first time.) Let's take
                   a look at these tools and how the project manager and the project team can use them
                   to their benefit.

                         Using a Cost-Benefit Analysis
                         Ever go shopping and compare prices? For example, you might consider the cost of two
                         cars in relation to features both cars provide. Or you might consider hiring a more ex-
                         perienced worker because he or she has some competencies that make the extra dollars
                         worth the costs. Part of planning for quality is moving through this process of cost-
                         benefit analysis.
                             Using a cost-benefit analysis is more than just considering how much to spend for
                         features and materials used in the project deliverable, although that is part of the pro-
                         cess. Cost-benefit analysis also considers the cost of completing the project work and
                         the best approach to achieving quality in the project in relation to the monies to com-
                         plete the work. For example, you could always use senior engineers to complete even
                         the most menial tasks, but that wouldn't be a good use of their time or of the monies
                         to pay for the senior engineers' time. Figure 8-1 is an example of using a cost-benefit
                         analysis.
                             Cost-benefit analysis is simply the study of the quality received in proportion to the
                         cost to reach those quality expectations. The project management team must under-
                         stand how much money is appropriate to spend to satisfy the project customer. If the
                         project spends too much to reach a level of quality that is far beyond what the cus-
                         tomer expects or wants, then that's waste. The same is true if the project team produces
                         less than the level of quality the customer expects and rework is needed.




                         Figure 8-1   Quality should meet, not exceed, the customer's expectations.

                                probably to pass, right? Don't aim for a 100 percent--aim for a passing grade.

                                                                                                                                              PART II
                   Benchmarking is simply comparing two similar things to measure which one performs
                   best. For example, you could benchmark the same activities on two different comput-
                   ers, test-drive several different cars, or even benchmark an organization before and after
                   a project. Benchmarking, in regard to quality planning, examines project practices
                   against other projects to measure performance, and then selects the best practices for
                   performance in the current project.

                   Using Design of Experiments
                   The design-of-experiments approach relies on statistical what-if scenarios to determine
                   what variables within a project will result in the best outcome. This type of approach is
                   most often used on the product of the project rather than on the project itself. For ex-
                   ample, a project team creating a new bicycle may experiment with the width of the tires,
                   the weight of the frame, and the position of the handlebars in relation to the bike seat
                   to determine the most comfortable ride at an acceptable cost to the consumer.
                       Although design of experiments is most often associated with product design, it can
                   be applied to project management activities. For example, a project manager may eval-
                   uate the activities within a project and determine the time and cost of activities, de-
                   pending on which employees are assigned to complete the work. A more experienced
                   worker may cost the project more money on an hourly basis, but this individual is ex-
                   pected to complete the work in a third of the time that a less experienced worker would.
                   This is design of experiments: experimenting with different variables to find the best
                   solution at the best cost.
                       Design of experiments is also used as a method to identify which variables within a
                   project or product are causing failures or unacceptable results. The goal of design of
                   experiments is to isolate the root cause of an effect and to adjust that cause to eliminate
                   the unacceptable results.

                   Considering the Cost of Quality
                   The cost of quality (COQ) considers how much must be spent to achieve the expected
                   level of quality within the project. There are two types of costs directly tied to quality:

                        * Cost of conformance to quality This is the cost associated with the monies
                          spent to attain the expected level of quality. For example, training, safety issues,
                          and purchasing the right equipment and materials all contribute to the expected
                          levels of quality. This is sometimes called the cost of conformance to quality.
                        * Cost of nonconformance to quality This is the cost associated with not
                          satisfying the quality expectations. For example, if the project manager does

                                 not train the project team, or if the correct materials are not used in the
                                 project implementation, quality will suffer, and additional costs will be
                                 incurred to do the work over. Cost of poor quality can also result in rejected
                                 deliverables, loss of sales and customers, and, if safety concerns are not met,
                                 loss of life or limb. The cost of nonconformance to quality is also known as
                                 the cost of poor quality or the cost of failure.

                                       EXAM TIP There are actually eight tools and techniques you can use to
                                       plan quality: cost-benefit analysis, cost of quality, seven basic quality tools,
                                       benchmarking, design of experiments, statistical sampling, additional quality
                                       tools, and meetings. You'll use some of these same tools over and over, and
                                       I'm going to cover all of the tools in this chapter. In particular, the seven basic
                                       quality tools are used in planning and in quality control.

                         Using Other Quality Planning Tools
                         The project manager can use lots of other tools and approaches to plan for quality
                         within the project. I recommend that you be aware of these tools, but don't invest too
                         much time learning their ins and outs:

                              * Brainstorming
                              * Affinity diagrams
                              * Force field analysis
                              * Nominal group techniques
                              * Matrix diagrams
                              * Flowcharts
                              * Prioritization matrices

                         Creating the Quality Management Plan
                         The end result of the quality planning phase is to find a method to implement the
                         quality policy. Because planning is iterative, the quality planning sessions often re-
                         quire several revisits to the quality planning processes. Longer projects may have
                         scheduled quality planning sessions to compare the performance of the project in re-
                         lation to the quality that was planned.
                             One of the major outputs of quality planning is the quality management plan. This
                         document describes how the project manager and the project team will fulfill the qual-
                         ity policy. In an ISO 9000 environment, the quality management plan is referred to as
                         the "project quality system." The quality management plan addresses the following
                         three things about the project and the project work:

                              * Quality control Work results are monitored to see if they meet relevant
                                quality standards. If the results do not meet the quality standards, the project

                                                                                                                                 309
                           manager applies root cause analysis to determine the cause of the poor
                           performance and then eliminates the cause. Quality control is inspection-
                           oriented.
                        * Quality assurance The overall performance is evaluated to ensure that the
                          project meets the relevant quality standards. Quality assurance maps to an
                          organization's quality policy and is typically a managerial process. Quality
                          assurance is generally considered the work of applying the quality plan.




                                                                                                                                               PART II
                        * Quality improvement The project performance is measured and evaluated,
                          and corrective actions are applied to improve the product and the project. The
                          improvements can be large or small, depending on the condition and the
                          quality philosophy of the performing organization.

                   Establishing Quality Metrics
                   You need some quality metrics. If you don't measure, then your project cannot im-
                   prove. Specifically, I'm talking about the quantifiable terms and values to measure a
                   process, activity, or work result. An example of quality metrics is an expected value for
                   the required torque to tighten a bolt on a piece of equipment. By testing and measur-
                   ing the torque, the operational definition would prove or disprove the quality of the
                   product. Other examples can include hours of labor to complete a work package, re-
                   quired safety measures, cost per unit, and so on.
                        Operational definitions are clear, concise measurements. Designating that 95 per-
                   cent of all customer service calls should be answered by a live person within 30 seconds
                   is a metric. A statement that all calls should be answered in a timely manner is not.

                   Applying Checklists
                   Checklists are simple approaches to ensure that work is completed according to the
                   quality policy. It's usually a list of activities that workers will check off as each task is
                   completed. Checklists can be quick instructions of what needs to be done to clean a
                   piece of equipment or questions that remind the employee to complete a task: "Did
                   you turn off the printer before opening the cover?"

                   Creating the Process Improvement Plan
                   One of the goals of quality project management is continuous process improvement.
                   The process improvement plan looks to improve the project, not just the end result of
                   the project. Its aim is to identify and eliminate waste and non-value-added activity.
                   Specifically, this plan aims to accomplish the following:

                        * Increase customer value by eliminating waste within the project.
                        * Establish process boundaries.
                        * Determine process configuration through a flowchart for evaluation and
                          analysis in order to improve the project as a whole.

                              * Process metrics within the project.
                              * Establish targets for performance improvement.

                         Updating the Baseline and the Project Management Plan
                         Just as there is a baseline for costs, schedule, and scope, there is also a baseline for quality.
                         The quality baseline records and compares the quality objectives for the project. It's the
                         measurement of the project performance and the quality of the project objectives. The
                         variances show the project management team where the project should be improving.
                             The project management plan includes two plans that are outputs of quality plan-
                         ning: the quality management plan and the process improvement plan. Based on the
                         outputs of quality management planning, the project plan can be updated to reflect
                         how the expected level of quality will be achieved. As usual, changes to the project
                         scope that change the project plan will also need to be examined for their impact on
                         quality or on the processes of the project. In addition, the project team's work to com-
                         plete the changes may affect the quality of the deliverable.


                         Performing Quality Assurance
                         Quality assurance (QA) is the sum of the creation and implementation of the plans by
                         the project manager, the project team, and management to ensure that the project
                         meets the demands of quality. QA is not something that is done only at the end of the
                         project, but is done before and during the project as well. Quality management is
                         prevention-driven; you want to do the work correctly the first time.
                             In some organizations, the quality assurance department or another entity will
                         complete the QA activities. QA is interested in preventing defects and assuring that
                         quality control fixes any product problems.
                             There are many different approaches to QA, depending on the quality system the
                         organization or project team has adapted. QA is, to some extent, a parent for continu-
                         ous process improvement. Continuous process improvement aims to remove waste
                         and non-value-added activities, so it works hand in hand with quality assurance.

                         Preparing for Quality Assurance
                         The project manager and the project team will need several inputs to prepare for QA:

                              * The quality management plan This plan defines how the project team will
                                implement and fulfill the quality policy of the performing organization. You'll
                                also reference the process improvement plan.
                              * Process improvement plan The activities you and your project team will
                                perform in quality assurance should mesh and align with the goals of the
                                process improvement plan.
                              * Quality metrics Quality control tests will provide these measurements. The
                                values must be quantifiable so that results can be measured, compared, and

                                                                                              Chapter 8: Managing Project Quality

                                                                                                                               311
                           analyzed. In other words, "pretty close to on track" is not adequate; "95
                           percent pass rate" is more acceptable.
                        * Results of quality control The measurements taken by the project manager
                          and the project team to inspect the project deliverables' quality are fed back
                          into the QA process.
                        * Project documents The project documentation may influence the quality
                          assurance approaches for the project and should be reviewed to see what




                                                                                                                                             PART II
                          requirements the project should adhere to.

                   Applying Quality Assurance
                   The QA department, management, or, in some instances, even the project manager can
                   complete the requirements for QA. QA can be accomplished using the following tools
                   (many of the same tools used during quality planning):

                        * Affinity diagram This diagram takes the breakdown of ideas, solutions, and
                          project components and groups them together with likeminded ideas. For
                          example, an IT solution might group all of the thoughts about hardware, then
                          software, then the network, and so on.
                        * Process decision program chart (PDPC) This chart helps the project team
                          define all of the steps to get from the current state to a desired goal. It
                          facilitates a conversation about what must be completed to reach the goal.
                        * Interrelationship diagraphs These are used for complex solutions where
                          the causes and effects of problems and benefits are intertwined with one
                          another. For example, in a construction project the plumbing, framing, and
                          foundation are all related and decisions and benefits in one area can cause
                          decisions and benefits (or problems) in another area of the project.
                        * Tree diagram Tree diagrams show hierarchies and the decomposition of a
                          solution, an organization, or a project team. The WBS and an org chart are
                          examples of tree diagrams.
                        * Prioritization matrices This is a table to rank and score project decisions
                          and alternatives to determine the best solution for the project.
                        * Activity network diagrams These are diagrams, such as the project network
                          diagram, to show the flow of the project work.
                        * Matrix diagrams A data analysis table that shows the strength between
                          variables and relationships in the matrix.

                   Completing a Quality Audit
                   Quality audits are about learning. The idea of a quality audit is to identify the lessons
                   learned on the current project to determine how to make things better for this project--
                   as well as for other projects within the organization. The idea is that Susan the project

                         manager can learn from the implementations of Bob the project manager and vice
                         versa.
                             Quality audits are formal reviews of what's been completed within a project, what
                         worked, and what didn't work. The end result of the audit is improved performance for
                         the current project, other projects, or the entire organization.
                             Quality audits can be scheduled at key intervals within a project or--surprise!--
                         they can come without warning. The audit process can vary, depending on who is com-
                         pleting the audit: internal auditors or hired, third-party experts.

                         Analyzing the Project Processes
                         Process improvement is executed to examine the project-specific processes to see if they
                         are improving. Process analysis is the examination of the project processes to see what's
                         working, what isn't working, and to make recommendations of what should be im-
                         proved. This is an opportunity for the project manager to streamline processes, remove
                         non-value-added activities, and purge waste from the project.
                             If the process analysis leads to changes in the approach in the project, the change
                         should be documented and communicated. You'll also want to measure the perfor-
                         mance after the change has been implemented to see how the change has affected the
                         project.

                         Improving the Project
                         The goal of QA is project improvement. It's not only the quality of the project's deliver-
                         ables, but also the quality of the process to complete the project work. This is process
                         analysis, and it follows the guidelines of the process improvement plan. Process analysis
                         is completed through any or all of the following measures:

                              * An examination of problems or constraints
                              * An analysis of the project for non-value-added activities
                              * Root cause analysis
                              * The creation of preventive actions for identified problems

                             Quality improvement requires action to improve the project's effectiveness. The ac-
                         tions to improve the effectiveness may have to be routed through the change control
                         system, which means change requests, analysis of the costs and risks, and involvement
                         from the change control board (CCB). There are four outputs of quality assurance in a
                         project:

                              * Change requests
                              * Project management plan updates
                              * Project document updates
                              * Organizational process assets updates

                                                                                                                                 313
                   Performing Quality Control
                   This is the section of the project where the project manager and the project team have
                   control and influence. Quality assurance (QA), for the most part, is specific to your
                   organization, and the project manager doesn't have much control over the QA process-
                   es--he just has to do them. Quality control (QC), on the other hand, is specific to the
                   project manager, so the project manager has lots of activities.




                                                                                                                                               PART II
                                EXAM TIP Pay close attention to the quality control mechanisms--there are
                                things the project manager has control over in every project.

                        Quality control requires the project manager, or another qualified party, to monitor
                   and measure project results to determine whether they are up to the quality standards.
                   If the results are unsatisfactory, root cause analysis follows the quality control processes.
                   Root cause analysis lets the project manager determine the cause and apply corrective
                   actions. On the whole, QC occurs throughout the life of a project, not just at its end.
                        QC is not only concerned with the product the project is creating, but also with the
                   project management processes. QC measures performance, scheduling, and cost vari-
                   ances. The experience of the project should be of quality--not just the product the
                   project creates. Consider a project manager who demands that the project team work
                   extreme hours to meet an unrealistic deadline. Team morale suffers, and likely so does
                   the project work the team is completing.
                        The project team should do the following to ensure competency in quality control:

                        * Conduct statistical quality control measures, such as sampling and
                          probability.
                        * Inspect the product to avoid errors.
                        * Perform attribute sampling to measure conformance to quality on a per-unit
                          basis.
                        * Conduct variable sampling to measure the degree of conformance.
                        * Study special causes to determine anomalies.
                        * Research random causes to determine expected variances of quality.
                        * Check the tolerance range to determine if the results are within or outside an
                          acceptable level of quality.
                        * Observe control limits to determine if the results are in or out of quality
                          control.

                   Preparing for Quality Control
                   Quality control relies on several inputs, such as the following:

                        * The project management plan The project management plan contains
                          the quality management plan as a subsidiary plan. This defines how QC will




08-ch08.indd 313                                                                                                                  7/10/2013 1:50:32 AM

              314
                                 be applied to the project, the expectations of QC, and the organization's
                                 approach for performing quality control.
                              * Quality metrics The operational definitions that define the metrics for the
                                project are needed so that QC can measure and react to the results of project
                                performance.
                              * Quality checklists If the project is using checklists to ensure that project
                                work is completed, copies of the checklists will be needed as part of quality
                                control. The checklists can then serve as indicators of completed work, as well
                                as of expected results.
                              * Work performance data The results of the project work are needed to
                                compare with the quality standards. The expected results of the product and
                                the project can be measured from the project plan. In other words, the project
                                must meet the expected quality metrics, or corrective action needs to be done.
                              * Approved change requests Approved change requests affect how the project
                                work is scheduled and performed, which may affect the project's overall
                                quality. Quality control verifies that approved change requests are
                                implemented properly.
                              * Deliverables You need something to inspect. Deliverables are the results of
                                the project work, and these are things that will be inspected to confirm that
                                they're great and full of quality as the customer (and you, the project
                                manager) expect.
                              * Project documents Project documents will help you determine what the
                                specific levels of quality are to be as you measure the project deliverables. You
                                may reference things like any contractual agreements, corrective actions
                                results, and outputs of previous quality control measurements.
                              * Organizational process assets This shouldn't be a surprise, because I'd bet
                                dollars to donuts your organization has quality standards that you must
                                adhere to.

                         Relying on the Seven Basic Quality Tools
                         There are seven basic quality tools as referenced by the PMBOK Guide, 5th edition, that
                         you should be familiar with for your PMI examination. You can use these tools in
                         quality planning, quality assurance, and, most likely, here in quality control. Here
                         they are:

                              * Cause-and-effect diagrams These are also known as fishbone diagrams and
                                Ishikawa diagrams and they help determine causal factors for an effect you'd
                                like to solve.
                              * Flowcharts A flowchart shows the sequence of events with possible
                                branching and loopbacks to reach an end result of a process or a series of
                                processes.

                        * Checksheets These are used to tally up problems, effects, conditions, or
                          other aspects about a project's product during quality control inspection. The
                          results of checksheets help project managers quickly ascertain problems
                          within the project.
                        * Pareto diagrams These charts show the categorization of problems from
                          largest to smallest.
                        * Histograms A histogram is a bar chart and can be used for frequency of




                                                                                                                                             PART II
                          problems, ranking of services, or any other distribution of data.
                        * Control charts These show trends over time and help a project manager
                          determine the stability of a process, improvement, or other analysis of the
                          project work. These are ideal for repeatable processes as in manufacturing.
                        * Scatter diagrams These charts measure the relationship between a
                          dependent project variable and an independent project variable. The closer
                          the variables trend, the more likely there is a connection.

                   Inspecting Results
                   Although quality is planned, not inspected, into a project, inspections are needed to
                   prove conformance to the requirements. An inspection can be done on the project as a
                   whole, on a portion of the project work, on the project deliverable, or even on an indi-
                   vidual activity. Inspections are also known as:

                       * Reviews
                        * Product reviews
                        * Audits
                        * Walkthroughs

                   Creating a Flowchart
                   Technically, a flowchart is any diagram illustrating how components within a system
                   are related. An organizational flowchart shows the bottom crew of operations up to the
                   "little squirt" on top. A heating, ventilation, and air conditioning (HVAC) blueprint
                   shows how the air flows through a building from the furnace to each room. Flowcharts
                   show the relation between components, as well as help the project team determine
                   where quality issues may be present and plan accordingly.
                        You'll need to be concerned with two types of flowcharts for these exams:

                       * Cause-and-effect diagrams These diagrams show the relation between
                         the variables within a process and how those relations may contribute to
                         inadequate quality. They can help organize both the process and team
                         opinions, as well as generate discussion on finding a solution to ensure
                         quality. Figure 8-2 is an example of a cause-and-effect diagram. (As stated in

                         Figure 8-2
                         Cause-and-effect
                         diagrams show the
                         relation of variables
                         to a problem.




                                  the previous section, these diagrams are also known as Ishikawa diagrams and
                                  fishbone diagrams.)

                                        EXAM TIP A cause-and-effect diagram is also called an Ishikawa diagram--
                                        same thing, just a fancier name.

                               * System or process flowcharts These flowcharts illustrate the flow of a
                                 process through a system, such as a project change request through the change
                                 control system or work authorization through a quality control process. A
                                 process flowchart does not have to be limited to the project management
                                 activities. It could instead demonstrate how a manufacturer creates, packages,
                                 and ships the product to the customer (as seen in Figure 8-3).

                         Creating a Control Chart
                         Ever feel like your project is out of control? A control chart can prove it.




                         Figure 8-3     Flowcharts demonstrate how processes within a system are related.

                   Figure 8-4     Control charts demonstrate the results of inspections.


                       Control charts illustrate the performance of a project over time. They map the re-
                   sults of inspections against a chart, as seen in Figure 8-4. Control charts are typically
                   used in projects or operations where there are repetitive activities--such as manufactur-
                   ing, a series of tests, or help desks.
                       The outer limits of a control chart are set by the customer requirements. Within the
                   customer requirements are the upper control limits (UCLs) and the lower control limits
                   (LCLs). The UCL is typically set at +3 or +6 sigma, while the LCL is set at -3 or -6 sigma.
                   Sigma results show the degree of correctness. Table 8-1 outlines the four sigma values
                   representing normal distribution. You'll need to know these for the PMP exam.
                       So what happened to sigma four and five? Nothing. They're still there. It's just that
                   the difference between three sigma at 99.73 and six sigma at 99.99 is so small that
                   statisticians just jump to six sigma. The mean in a control chart represents the ex-
                   pected result, while the sigma values represent the expected spread of results based on
                   the inspection. A true six sigma allows only two defects per million opportunities,
                   and the percentage to represent that value is 99.99985 percent. For the exam, you can
                   go with the 99.99 percent.
                       For example, if a manufacturer creates 1,000 units per hour and expects 50 units
                   each hour to be defective, the mean would be 950 units. If the control limits were set at
                   +/- three sigma, the results of testing would actually expect as many as 953 correct units
                   and as few as 947 correct units.

                             Over time, the results of testing are plotted in the control chart. Whenever a result
                         of testing is plotted beyond the upper or lower control values, it is considered to be "out
                         of control." When a value is out of control, there is a reason why--it's called an assign-
                         able cause. Something caused the results to change for better or for worse, and the result
                         must be investigated to understand the why behind the occurrence.
                             Another assignable cause is the Rule of Seven. The Rule of Seven states that when-
                         ever seven consecutive results are all on one side of the mean, this is an assignable
                         cause. Thus, there's been some change that caused the results to shift to one side of the
                         expected mean. Again, the cause must be investigated to determine why the change
                         happened.
                             While control charts are easily associated with recurring activities, like manufactur-
                         ing, they can also be applied to project management. Consider the number of expected
                         change requests, delays within a project, and other recurring activities. A control chart
                         can plot out these activities to measure performance, show positive and negative re-
                         sults, and track corrective actions.

                         Creating Pareto Diagrams
                         A Pareto diagram is somewhat related to Pareto's Law: 80 percent of the problems come
                         from 20 percent of the issues. This is also known as the 80/20 Rule. A Pareto diagram
                         illustrates the problems by assigned cause, from largest to smallest, as Figure 8-5 shows.
                         The project team should first work on the larger problems and then move on to the
                         smaller problems.

                         Creating a Histogram
                         A histogram is a bar chart showing the frequency of variables within a project. For ex-
                         ample, a histogram could show which states have the most customers. Within project
                         management, a common histogram is a resource histogram that shows the frequency
                         of resources used on project work.

                         Figure 8-5
                         A Pareto diagram
                         is a histogram that
                         ranks the issues from
                         largest to smallest.

                   Creating a Run Chart
                   A run chart, as Figure 8-6 shows, is a line graph that shows the results of inspection in
                   the order in which they've occurred. The goals of a run chart are first to demonstrate the
                   results of a process over time and then to use trend analysis to predict when certain
                   trends may reemerge. Based on this information, an organization can work to prevent
                   the negative trend or work to capitalize on an identified opportunity.




                                                                                                                                                               PART II
                   Creating a Scatter Diagram
                   A scatter diagram tracks the relationship between two variables. The two variables are
                   considered related the closer they track against a diagonal line. For example, a project
                   manager could track the performance of two team members, the time and cost, or even
                   changes between functional managers and the project's schedule.

                   Completing a Statistical Sampling
                   Statistical sampling is the process of choosing a percentage of results at random. For
                   example, a project creating a medical device may have 20 percent of all units randomly
                   selected to check quality. This process must be completed on a consistent basis through-
                   out the project, rather than on a sporadic schedule.
                       Statistical sampling can reduce the costs of quality control, but mixed results can
                   follow if an adequate testing plan and schedule are not followed. The science of statisti-
                   cal sampling (and its requirements to be effective) is an involved process. There are
                   many books, seminars, and professionals devoted to the process. For the CAPM and
                   PMP exams, know that statistical sampling uses a percentage of the results to test for
                   quality. This process can reduce quality control cost.

                         Revisiting Flowcharting
                         Flowcharting uses charts to illustrate how the different parts of a system operate. This is
                         valuable in QC, because the process can be evaluated and tested to determine where in
                         the process quality begins to break down. Corrective actions can then be applied to the
                         system to ensure that quality continues as planned--and as expected.

                         Applying Trend Analysis
                         Trend analysis is the science of taking past results to predict future performance. Sports
                         announcers use trend analysis all the time: "The Cubs have never won in St. Louis on a
                         Tuesday night in the month of July when the temperature at the top of the third inning
                         was above 80 degrees."
                             The results of trend analysis allow the project manager to apply corrective action
                         to intervene and prevent unacceptable outcomes. Trend analysis on a project requires
                         adequate records to predict results and set current expectations. It can monitor the
                         following:

                              * Technical performance Trend analysis can ask, "How many errors have been
                                experienced up to this point in the project schedule, and how many additional
                                errors were encountered?"
                              * Cost and schedule performance Trend analysis can ask, "How many
                                activities were completed incorrectly, came in late, or had significant cost
                                variances?"

                         Examining Quality Control Results
                         Quality control should, first and foremost, result in quality improvement. The project
                         manager and project team, based on the results of the tools and techniques to imple-
                         ment quality control, apply corrective actions to prevent unacceptable quality and to
                         improve the overall quality of the project management processes.
                            The corrective actions and the defect repairs the project manager and the project
                         team want to incorporate into the project may require change requests and manage-
                         ment approval. The value and importance of the change should be evident so that the
                         improvement to quality is approved and folded into the project. In addition to quality
                         improvement, there are other results of quality control:

                              * Quality control measurements Based on the project's quality management
                                plan, quality control measurements need to be documented and kept as part
                                of the project's documentation.
                              * Validated changes If you've identified an error in the project work, then the
                                project team has to take corrective action and fix the error. Then someone has
                                to come back and validate that the defect has been fixed to an acceptable
                                level. If not, then it's more rework.

                                                                                                                                321
                        * Validated deliverables The goal of quality control is to keep mistakes out of
                          customers' hands. If you've inspected the deliverables and they're acceptable
                          by the quality metrics, then they should be acceptable for the project
                          customer. Validated deliverables are an output of quality control and an input
                          to scope validation.
                        * Work performance information The information created by the project's
                          controlling processes is one of the outputs of quality control. This includes




                                                                                                                                              PART II
                          schedule control, scope control, cost control, and quality control. The
                          integrated relationship of the project causes the control of other knowledge
                          areas to affect the quality of the project's deliverables.
                        * Change requests Should the quality in the project be less than what was
                          planned for, there may be change requests for corrective actions, preventive
                          actions, or defect repair.
                        * Project management plan updates Based on the experiences of quality
                          control, the project management plan could be updated. You should
                          primarily be concerned with the possibility that the quality management plan
                          and process improvement plan will require an update in the project.
                        * Project document updates Updates to the quality standards, contracts,
                          training plans, and other process documentation could be an output of
                          quality control.
                        * Organizational process assets updates If the project is using checklists to
                          confirm the completion of work, then the completed checklists should
                          become part of the project records. Some project managers require the project
                          team member completing the checklists to initial them as whole and
                          complete. Lessons learned documentation is also updated as a result of the
                          quality control process.


                   Chapter Summary
                   What good is a project deliverable if it doesn't work, is unacceptable, or is faulty? Proj-
                   ect quality management ensures that the deliverables that project teams create meet the
                   expectations of the stakeholders. For your CAPM or PMP examination, quality means
                   delivering the project at the exact level of the design specifications and the project
                   scope--no more, no less.
                       Grade and quality are two different things. Grade is the ranking assigned to differ-
                   ent components that have the same functional purpose. For example, sheet metal may
                   come in different grades based on what it is needed for. Another example is the grade
                   of paper based on its thickness, ability to retain ink, and so on. Low quality is always a
                   problem; low grade may not be.
                       Quality planning happens before project work begins, but also as work is com-
                   pleted. Quality planning can confirm the preexistence of quality or the need for quality

                         improvements. Quality is planned into a project, not inspected in. However, quality
                         control uses inspections to prove the existence of quality within a project deliverable.
                             The cost of quality is concerned with the monies invested in the project to attain the
                         expected level of quality. Examples of these costs include training, safety measures, and
                         quality management activities. The cost of nonconformance centers on the monies lost
                         by not completing the project work correctly the first time. In addition, this cost in-
                         cludes the loss of sales, loss of customers, and downtime within the project.
                             Quality assurance is prevention-driven and is a management process. Quality con-
                         trol is inspection-driven and is a project process. On your PMI exam, keep those two
                         thoughts separate and you'll be ahead of the game.

                         expected level of quality. It is also known as the cost of quality.
                         Cost of nonconformance to quality The cost associated with not satisfying quality
                         expectations. This is also known as the cost of poor quality.
                         Cost-benefit analysis A process to study the trade-offs between costs and the benefits

                   of problems and benefits are intertwined with one another.
                   ISO The abbreviation for the International Organization for Standardization. ISO is
                   Greek for "equal," while "International Organization for Standardization" in a differ-
                   ent language would be abbreviated differently. The organization elected to use "ISO"
                   for all languages.

                   Pareto diagram A histogram that illustrates and ranks categories of failure within a
                   project.
                   Prioritization matrices A table to rank and score project decisions and alternatives to
                   determine the best solution for the project.
                   Process decision program chart (PDPC) Helps the project team define all of the
                   steps to get from the current state to a desired goal. It facilitates a conversation about
                   what must be completed to reach the goal.
                   Process improvement plan A project management subsidiary plan that aims to im-
                   prove the project, not just the end result of the project. It strives to identify and elimi-
                   nate waste and non-value-added activities.
                   Quality According to ASQ, the degree to which a set of inherent characteristics fulfills
                   requirements.
                   Quality assurance A management process that defines the quality system or quality
                   policy that a project must adhere to. QA aims to plan quality into the project rather
                   than to inspect quality into a deliverable.
                   Quality control An inspection-driven process that measures work results to confirm
                   that the project is meeting the relevant quality standards.
                   Quality management plan This plan defines how the project team will implement
                   and fulfill the quality policy of the performing organization.
                   Quality metrics The operational definitions that specify the measurements within a
                   project and the expected targets for quality and performance.
                   Quality planning The process of first determining which quality standards are rele-
                   vant to your project and then finding out the best methods of adhering to those quality
                   standards.
                   Rule of Seven A component of a control chart that illustrates the results of seven
                   measurements on one side of the mean, which is considered "out of control" in the
                   project.
                   Run chart A quality control tool that shows the results of inspection in the order in
                   which they've occurred. The goal of a run chart is first to demonstrate the results of a
                   process over time and then to use trend analysis to predict when certain trends may
                   reemerge.

                         Scatter diagram A quality control tool that tracks the relationship between two vari-
                         ables over time. The two variables are considered related the closer they track against a
                         diagonal line.

                         grams, control charts, and scatter diagrams.
                         Statistical sampling A process of choosing a percentage of results at random. For ex-
                         ample, a project creating a medical device may have 20 percent of all units randomly
                         selected to check for quality.
                         System or process flowcharts Flowcharts that illustrate the flow of a process through
                         a system, such as a project change request through the change control system, or work
                         authorization through a quality control process.
                         Tree diagram Tree diagrams show the hierarchies and decomposition of a solution,
                         an organization, or a project team. The WBS and an org chart are examples of tree
                         diagrams.

                         cludes technical performance measures, project status, information on what the project
                         has created to date, corrective actions, and performance reports.

                         Questions
                              1. You are the project manager for the BBB Project. Stacy, a project team member,
                                 is confused about what QA is. Which of the following best describes QA?
                                  A. QA is quality assurance for the overall project performance.
                                  B. QA is quality acceptance according to scope verification.
                                  C. QA is quality assurance for the project deliverable.
                                  D. QA is quality assurance for the project stakeholders.
                              2. You are the project manager for the Photo Scanning Project. This project is
                                 similar to another project you have completed. Your project is to electronically
                                 store thousands of photos for your city's historical society. Quality is
                                 paramount on this project. Management approaches you and asks why you
                                 have devoted so much of the project time to planning. Your response is which
                                 of the following?
                                  A. This is a first-time, first-use project, so more time is needed for planning.
                                  B. Planning for a project of this size, with this amount of quality, is
                                     mandatory.
                                  C. Quality is planned into a project, not inspected in.

                                                                                                                                             PART II
                   Questions and
                   Answers
                      1. You are the project
                         manager for the BBB
                         Project. Stacy, a project
                         team member, is
                         confused about what QA
                         is. Which of the following
                         best describes QA?
                         A. QA is quality
                            assurance for the
                            overall project
                            performance.
                         B. QA is quality
                            acceptance according to scope verification.
                         C. QA is quality assurance for the project deliverable.
                         D. QA is quality assurance for the project stakeholders.
                         A. QA is concerned with overall project quality performance. B, C, and D are
                         incorrect because they do not correctly explain quality assurance.
                      2. You are the project manager for the Photo Scanning Project. This project is
                         similar to another project you have completed. Your project is to electronically
                         store thousands of photos for your city's historical society. Quality is
                         paramount on this project. Management approaches you and asks why you
                         have devoted so much of the project time to planning. Your response is which
                         of the following?
                         A. This is a first-time, first-use project, so more time is needed for planning.
                         B. Planning for a project of this size, with this amount of quality, is
                            mandatory.
                         C. Quality is planned into a project, not inspected in.
                         D. Quality audits are part of the planning time.

                                 C. Of all the choices presented, this is the best answer. Quality is planned
                                 into the project, and the planning requires time. A is incorrect because a
                                 project of this nature has been completed before. B is incorrect because there
                                 isn't enough information provided to determine what the quality demands of
                                 the project are. D is incorrect because quality audits are not part of the
                                 planning processes.
                              3. You are the project manager for the recently initiated Floor Installation
                                 Project. Today you plan to meet with your project team to ensure that the
                                 project is completed with no deviations from the project requirements. This
                                 process is which of the following?
                                  A. Quality planning
                                  B. Quality management
                                  C. Quality control
                                  D. Quality assurance
                                 A. Quality planning should be completed prior to the work beginning--and
                                 should thereafter be revisited as needed. B is incorrect because quality
                                 management is not an applicable answer to the scenario. C and D are
                                 incorrect because QC and QA are part of quality management.
                              4. You are the project manager for the ASE Project, which must map to industry
                                 standards in order to be accepted by the customer. You and your team
                                 have studied the requirements and have created a plan to implement the
                                 deliverables with the appropriate level of quality. What is this process called?
                                  A. Quality planning
                                  B. Quality management
                                  C. Quality control
                                  D. Quality assurance
                                 A. Quality planning is the process of creating a plan to meet the requirements
                                 of quality. B, C, and D are incorrect because they do not explain the process
                                 in the question's scenario.
                              5. Juan is the project manager for his organization and he's asked Beth, a project
                                 team member, to help him create a fishbone diagram. Beth doesn't know
                                 what this is and asks for your help. A fishbone diagram is the same as a(n)
                                 ______________________ diagram.
                                  A. Ishikawa

                                                                                         Chapter 8: Managing Project Quality

                                                                                                                          331
                     A. A fishbone diagram is the same as an Ishikawa diagram. B, C, and D are
                     incorrect. These charts and diagrams accomplish goals other than the cause-
                     and-effect outcome of the Ishikawa.
                   6. Management has asked you to define the correlation between quality and the
                      project scope. Which of the following is the best answer?
                      A. The project scope includes metrics for quality.




                                                                                                                                        PART II
                      B. Quality metrics are applied to the project scope.
                      C. Quality is the process of completing the scope to meet stated or implied
                         needs.
                     D. Quality is the process of evaluating the project scope to ensure that quality
                        exists.
                     C. Quality, in regard to the project scope, is about completing the work as
                     promised. A is incorrect because though the project scope will have
                     requirements for acceptance, it may not have metrics for quality defined. B
                     and D are also incorrect statements.
                   7. You are the project manager of the Condo IV Construction project and you're
                      working with your project team and the project sponsor to identify the quality
                      metrics and develop the quality management plan for the project. In light of
                      this planning event, which of the following is most true about quality?
                      A. It will cost more money to build quality into the project.
                      B. It will cost less money to build quality into the project process.
                      C. Quality is inspection-driven.
                     D. Quality is prevention-driven.
                     D. Quality is prevention-driven. Quality wants to complete the work correctly
                     the first time to prevent poor results, a loss of time, and a loss of funds. A and
                     B are incorrect. There is no guarantee that a project will cost more or less
                     depending on the amount of expected quality. Incidentally, lack of quality
                     will likely cost more than quality planning because of the cost of
                     nonconformance. C is incorrect because quality is planned into a project, not
                     inspected in.
                   8. You are the project manager for the KOY Project, which requires quality that
                      maps to federal guidelines. To ensure that you can meet these standards, you
                      have elected to put the project team through training specific to the federal
                      guidelines your project must adhere to. The costs of these classes can be
                      assigned to which of the following?
                      A. The cost of doing business
                      B. Cost of quality
                      C. Cost of adherence

              332
                                  D. Cost of nonconformance
                                 B. Training to meet the quality expectations is attributed to the cost of quality.
                                 A, C, and D are incorrect because these choices do not describe training as a
                                 cost of quality.
                              9. You are the project manager for the KOY Project, which requires quality that
                                 maps to federal guidelines. During a quality audit, you discover that a portion
                                 of the project work is faulty and must be done again. The requirement to do
                                 the work is an example of which of the following?
                                  A. Cost of quality
                                  B. Cost of adherence
                                  C. Cost of nonconformance
                                  D. The cost of doing business
                                 C. When project work results are faulty and must be done over, it is attributed
                                 to the cost of nonconformance to quality. A, B, and D are all incorrect. These
                                 values do not describe faulty work or the cost of nonconformance.
                             10. You are the project manager of the JKL Project, which currently has some
                                 production flaws. Which analysis tool will allow you to determine the cause
                                 and effect of the production faults?
                                  A. A flowchart
                                  B. A Pareto diagram
                                  C. An Ishikawa diagram
                                  D. A control chart
                                 C. The key words "cause and effect" equate to the Ishikawa diagram. A is
                                 incorrect because a flowchart will show how a process moves through the
                                 system, not the cause and effect of the problems involved. B is incorrect as
                                 well. A Pareto diagram maps out the causes and frequency of problems. D is
                                 incorrect because a control chart plots the results of sampling, but it doesn't
                                 show the cause and effect of problems.
                             11. Linda is the project manager of a manufacturing project. She and her project
                                 team are using design of experiments to look for ways to improve quality.
                                 Which of the following best describes design of experiments?
                                  A. It allows the project manager to move the relationship of activities to
                                     complete the project work with the best resources available.
                                  B. It allows the project manager to experiment with the project design to
                                     determine what variables are causing the flaws.
                                  C. It allows the project manager to experiment with variables to attempt to
                                     improve quality.

                                                                                                                           333
                       D. It allows the project manager to experiment with the project design
                          document to become more productive and to provide higher quality.
                       C. Design of experiments uses experiments and "what-if" scenarios to
                       determine what variables are affecting quality. A is incorrect because design of
                       experiments, in regard to quality, is not interested in changing the
                       relationship of activities to complete project work. B and D are also incorrect
                       because design of experiments will not be changing project design to




                                                                                                                                         PART II
                       determine where flaws exist or to become more productive.
                   12. You are the project manager of the Global Upgrade Project. Your project team
                       consists of 75 project team members around the world. Each team member
                       will be upgrading a piece of equipment in many different facilities. Which of
                       the following could you implement to ensure that project team members are
                       completing all of the steps in the install procedure with quality?
                       A. Checklists
                       B. Work breakdown structure (WBS)
                       C. Project network diagram (PND)
                       D. The WBS dictionary
                       A. Checklists are simple but effective quality management tools that the
                       project manager can use to ensure that the project team is completing the
                       required work. B, C, and D are all incorrect. The WBS, PND, and WBS
                       dictionary are not tools the project team can necessarily use to prove they've
                       completed required work. Checklists are the best approach for this scenario.
                   13. Mark is the project manager of the PMH Project. Quality inspections of the
                       deliverables show several problems. Management has asked Mark to create a
                       chart showing the distribution of problems and their frequencies. Given this,
                       management wants which of the following?
                       A. A control chart
                       B. An Ishikawa diagram
                       C. A Pareto diagram
                       D. A flowchart
                       C. Management wants Mark to create a Pareto diagram. Recall that a Pareto
                       diagram maps out the causes of defects and illustrates their frequency. A is
                       incorrect because a control chart does not identify the problems, only the
                       relation of the results to the expected mean. B is incorrect because a cause-
                       and-effect diagram does not map out the frequency of problems. D is also
                       incorrect. Flowcharts show how a process moves through a system and how
                       the components are related.

                             14. In the illustration to the
                                 right, what does the circled
                                 area represent?

                                  A. Out-of-control data
                                     points
                                  B. In-control data points
                                  C. The Rule of Seven
                                  D. Standard deviation
                                 C. The circled area shows seven consecutive sampling results, all on one side
                                 of the mean. This is known as the Rule of Seven and is an assignable cause. A
                                 is incorrect because these values are in control. B is correct, but it does not
                                 fully answer the question as C does. D is incorrect because standard deviation
                                 is a predicted measure of the variance from the expected mean of a sampling.
                             15. You are an IT project manager and are working with the project team to
                                 determine the best computer system for the project. You and the project team
                                 decide to measure the performance of both systems to determine which one
                                 performs best. This is an example of which one of the following?
                                  A. Cost-benefit analysis
                                  B. Benchmarking
                                  C. Design of experiments
                                  D. Determining the cost of quality
                                 B. This is an example of benchmarking because the project team is comparing
                                 one system to another. A is incorrect because the cost-benefit analysis would
                                 compare the costs and associated benefits of each system, rather than just
                                 how the two systems compare with each other. C is incorrect because the
                                 design of experiments is a method that determines which factors influence
                                 the variables of the project's deliverable. D is not a valid answer because the
                                 cost of quality is the dollar amount the project must invest to achieve the
                                 expected level of quality.
                             16. A project manager has elected not to enforce safety measures on his
                                 construction project. One of the project team members has been injured
                                 because of this oversight, and the job site is closed until an investigation
                                 into the lack of safety measures is completed. The project will now likely be
                                 late, be fined for the error, and lose credibility with the customer. This is an
                                 example of which one of the following?
                                  A. Risk

                                                                                                                             335
                       B. Trigger
                       C. Cost of poor quality
                       D. Cost of quality
                       C. This is an example of the cost of poor quality. The project manager should
                       have followed the safety measures for the job site, and costs associated with
                       the safety measures are considered part of D, the cost of quality. A is incorrect




                                                                                                                                           PART II
                       because risk is inherent to application work, while the ramifications of not
                       enforcing the safety measures is an example of the cost of poor quality. B is
                       incorrect because trigger is a risk management term that references a
                       condition or warning sign that a risk is coming into the project.
                   17. Your organization uses total quality management as part of its quality
                       assurance program. Maria, a leader in your organization's quality assurance
                       program, informs you that she will be reviewing your project to determine
                       if your project management activities comply with the total quality
                       management program. This is an example of which one of the following?
                       A. Process analysis
                       B. Quality control mechanism
                       C. Enterprise environmental factors
                       D. Quality audit
                       D. This is an example of a quality audit to confirm that your project is
                       adhering to the quality assurance program established within your
                       organization. A and B are incorrect choices for this question. C is incorrect
                       because although enterprise environmental factors may be a valid
                       characteristic of the total quality management program, it is not the best
                       answer for the question, which centers on the audit process rather than on
                       how the audit will be performed.
                   18. In the illustration to the
                       right, what does the circled
                       area represent?

                       A. Out-of-control data
                          points
                       B. In-control data points
                       C. The Rule of Seven
                       D. Standard deviation

                                 A. The circled area shows out-of-control data points. B is incorrect because
                                 "in-control data points" does not best answer the question. C is incorrect
                                 because the Rule of Seven refers to seven consecutive measurements, all on
                                 one side of the mean. D is incorrect because standard deviation is a predicted
                                 measure of the variance from the expected mean of a sampling.
                             19. You are the project manager for a plastics manufacturer. You would like to
                                 illustrate the categories of quality failure within your project so that you and
                                 your project team can attack the largest areas of failure first. This type of chart
                                 is known as which one of the following?
                                  A. A control chart
                                  B. An Ishikawa diagram
                                  C. A Pareto diagram
                                  D. A flowchart
                                 C. You want to create a Pareto diagram. A is incorrect because a control chart
                                 does not identify the problems, only the relation of the results to the expected
                                 mean. B is incorrect because a cause-and-effect diagram does not map out the
                                 frequency of problems. D is also incorrect. Flowcharts show how a process
                                 moves through a system and how the components are related.
                             20. What is the type of chart
                                 to the right called?

                                  A. A Pareto diagram
                                  B. A Control chart
                                  C. A Fishbone
                                  D. An Ishikawa
                                 A. This is a Pareto
                                 diagram. B is incorrect
                                 because a control chart
                                 shows the results of
                                 measurements over
                                 time. C and D are both
                                 incorrect because a
                                 fishbone diagram and
                                 an Ishikawa diagram are
                                 essentially the same type
                                 of chart.

                     In this chapter, you will
                        * Plan for human resources
                        * Acquire the project team
                        * Develop the project team
                        * Manage the project team




                   Your project relies on people to get the work done. Those people, your project team,
                   look to you, the project manager, to provide leadership, direction, motivation, and
                   your general management skills to help them know what their project assignments are,
                   get their work done, and resolve issues and dilemmas within the project.

                       It's a blast! Okay, that's a bit of sarcasm. In reality, and on your PMI exam, the re-
                   sources involved with the project know what is expected of them by the project man-
                   ager, management, and the stakeholders, and then they complete those expectations.
                   And if they don't? Then it's up to the project manager, the functional managers, and
                   even the other project team members to enforce the project's ground rules so that all
                   team members work toward the requirements in the project scope statement.

                       The type of organizational structure, from functional to projectized, will also influ-
                   ence how the project manager may discipline, motivate, and manage the project team.
                   In a functional environment, the project manager won't have much autonomy to disci-
                   pline or offer rewards beyond what management has deemed appropriate. In a projec-
                   tized structure, for example, the project manager has much more autonomy to both
                   discipline and reward.
                       Your project team may be assigned to you or you may have to build the team
                   one person at a time. Chances are that you'll have a core project team at the begin-
                   ning of the project and then more and more team members will join as the project
                   scope is defined and the activities are identified. Adding people to the project team

                         based on their interest in the project, experience levels, and, frankly, their compe-
                         tency about the project work. An analysis of the project team can help you plan
                         your team development approach.
                             A subset of the project team is the project management team--you've seen this term
                         already in this book. The project management team is the core group of project team mem-
                         bers that help with the project management decisions. Sometimes this bunch of folks
                         may also be called the core, executive, or leadership team. Your pal, the project sponsor,
                         works directly with you, the project manager, and the project management team to help
                         the team make the best decisions and to keep the project moving forward.
                             As the project manager, you'll need to manage and lead the project--yes, there is a
                         difference between management and leadership. Management is about getting things
                         done. Leadership is about aligning, motivating, and directing people. I believe that
                         people will work harder, smarter, and better for someone they want to work for than
                         they will for someone they are required to work for. As part of your leadership and
                         management, you want to maintain a professional and ethical behavior. Avoid playing
                         favorites, balance the tasks among the project team, and get involved in the work when
                         the team needs your help.
                             For your PMI examination, you'll need to know some vital facts about managing
                         the project team. We'll cover these vital facts in this chapter.


                         Planning for Human Resources
                         Here we go again. Have you noticed that every knowledge area for your PMI examina-
                         tion starts with a planning process? Hmmm, I hope so. Planning is an iterative process
                         that begins early in the project and continues through the project management life cy-
                         cle. Planning for project human resources is vital to a successful project. After all, you've
                         got to plan how the project work will be completed and which resources will complete
                         that work.
                              When it comes to planning human resources, the project manager is aiming to plan
                         for several facets of the project. Specifically, this planning process answers the following
                         questions:

                              * What project roles are needed on the project?
                              * What is the responsibility of each role on the project?
                              * To whom does each role report?
                              * Will resources on the project be from inside or outside of the organization?
                              * How will project team members be acquired?
                              * How will project team members be released from the project?
                              * What training needs to be completed for the project team?
                              * What are the rewards and recognition systems the project may utilize?
                              * What are the compliance and safety issues that must be addressed?

                        * How will the usage of the team resources affect the operations of the
                          organization?

                        Phew! That's a bunch of questions the project management team must answer dur-
                   ing this portion of planning. The good news is that some of these questions can be
                   answered when doing other project management planning exercises, such as time and
                   cost estimating. All of the answers to these questions are documented in the staffing
                   management plan. The human resource plan, of which the staffing management plan




                                                                                                                                              PART II
                   is a component, is the primary output of the human resources planning process.

                   Relying on Enterprise Environmental Factors
                   You've seen enterprise environmental factors over and over throughout this book.
                   When it comes to relying on the good ol' enterprise environmental factors for human
                   resource planning, the reliance is on how the organization identifies and utilizes roles
                   and responsibilities and on the interaction of the organization with the project man-
                   agement team. The project management team must consider five interfaces in its plan-
                   ning. These are project interfaces that the project team will likely have to interact with
                   throughout the project:

                        * Organizational The project management team needs to identify which
                          departments are going to be involved in the project. The team considers how
                          the project will interact with these different departments and organizations,
                          as well as what relationships exist between the departments, the project team,
                          and management.
                        * Technical The project team identifies the disciplines and specialties that the
                          project will require to complete the project scope statement. The technical
                          interfaces are the resources that will be doing the project work. In that light,
                          the project manager needs to examine what work needs to be completed,
                          how the project moves from phase to phase, and even the nature of the work
                          and how different disciplines may need to work together to allow the project
                          to move forward. The project manager must also consider the technical
                          interfaces required for the project deliverables to interact with the ongoing
                          operations of the organization.
                        * Interpersonal This organization interface considers the formal and informal
                          reporting relationships that may exist among the project team members. The
                          interpersonal interface also considers the job descriptions of the project team
                          members, existing reporting structures between supervisors and subordinates,
                          and what, if any, existing relationships may affect the project work. This
                          interface also considers any cultural or language differences among the project
                          team members that may need to be addressed.
                        * Logistical Have you ever worked with project team members who are
                          located around the world? What about project team members who are within
                          footsteps of each other? The logistical interface considers just that--the

                                  logistics of the project team and the stakeholders in relation to managing the
                                  project. The project manager must consider the geographical locales, the time
                                  zones, countries, and any other logistics that may affect the project.
                               * Political Uh-oh, here come the politics. This interface considers the hidden
                                 goals, personal agendas, and alliances among the project team and the
                                 stakeholders. Yep, politics is considered in project management and on the
                                 PMI examination.

                             While the interfaces mentioned previously should be considered during the human
                         resource planning phase for every project, constraints also could be introduced through
                         these interfaces or as independent constraints. Recall that a constraint is anything that
                         limits the project team's options. Here are three common constraints that may affect
                         your human resources planning:

                               * Organizational structure The structure of the organization has a direct
                                 correlation to the amount of power a project manager has. Figure 9-1 provides
                                 a refresher on the organizational structures. For a more in-depth refresher, see
                                 Chapter 2.
                               * Collective bargaining agreements Contracts and agreements with unions
                                 or other employee groups may serve as constraints for the project.
                               * Economic conditions Your organization may experience a hiring freeze,
                                 slash the training budget, or even cut out most travel expenses. These cuts are
                                 all examples of economic conditions that can serve as constraints on your
                                 project.

                                        EXAM TIP Contracts and grievances with unions are constraints. But the
                                        unions, themselves, are stakeholders.

                         power.

                   Using the Organizational Process Assets
                   Many projects within any organization are similar to past projects. For example, an ar-
                   chitecture firm designs buildings, an IT consultancy may design software or networks,
                   and a manufacturer manufactures things. Within each of these disciplines, and count-
                   less others, some projects are similar to projects that have gone before. The past project
                   records, lessons learned, and even past staffing management plans can be adapted for
                   the current project. Organizational process assets provide four elements for human re-




                                                                                                                                              PART II
                   sources planning that you should know for your PMI exam:

                        * Organization standards You need to understand the human resources
                          policies, procedures, expectations, role descriptions, and rules that you, the
                          project manager, will need to adhere to.
                        * Templates Using past project records, including older staffing management
                          plans as a base for the current project, is a great example of using past projects
                          as templates for the current project. Historical information can serve as a type
                          of template.
                        * Escalation procedures Are you in charge of the project team when it comes
                          to issue resolution? Or do you have to escalate the issue along to management
                          when there are problems? You need to know the process for escalation and
                          your level of authority over the project team.
                        * Checklists When it comes to planning for human resources, checklists,
                          which are part of organizational process assets, attempt to identify common
                          elements within similar projects. Ideal things that a checklist can help the
                          project management team identify include:
                          * Roles and responsibilities
                          * Competencies for the project work
                          * Training programs
                          * Team ground rules
                          * Safety issues
                          * Compliancy
                          * Rewards and recognition considerations

                   Referencing the Project Management Plan
                   The project management plan has many things to consider when it comes to staffing
                   the project. Let's take a quick peek at each subsidiary plan, elements within the project
                   management plan, and how they may affect what resources the project manager will
                   require on the project team. Here are the elements of the project management plan:

                        * Project scope management plan Defines how the project scope will be
                          planned, managed, and controlled. This plan is considered, because the
                          project team will be doing the work to create the things the scope promises.

              342
                              * Schedule management plan Defines how the project schedule will be
                                created and managed. The availability of, and the demand for, the project
                                team are influenced by the schedule management plan.
                              * Cost management plan This plan details how the project costs will be
                                planned for, estimated, budgeted, and then monitored and controlled. In most
                                projects, the project manager will need to account for the cost of the project
                                team and their contributions to the project work. In some instances, the cost is
                                more related to the time the team member is utilized, rather than the actual
                                salary of the project team member.
                              * Change management plan Changes are likely to happen on the project, so
                                you'll need to communicate the change management process to the project
                                team. You want to explain how all changes will be captured, analyzed, and
                                then, if approved, implemented into the project. Changes can affect what the
                                project will do and you don't want this to be a surprise to the project team.
                              * Configuration management plan Documentation, control, and confirmation
                                of the features and functions of the project's product are needed. Tied to scope
                                management, the configuration management plan communicates how changes
                                to the product may be permitted.
                              * Quality management plan Quality is expected on every project. This plan
                                defines what quality means for the project, how the project will achieve
                                quality, and how the project will map to organizational procedures pertaining
                                to quality. The project team members will need to adhere to quality
                                expectations, which may include training, team development, peer reviews,
                                and inspections.
                              * Process improvement plan Who wants an extra helping of waste in their
                                project? This plan aims to eliminate non-value-added activities, eliminate
                                waste, and determine how the project work, execution, and management can
                                be better executed and managed. The project manager wants the project team
                                to get rid of non-value-added activities.
                              * Human resource plan This plan defines project roles, responsibilities, and
                                the reporting structure, and includes the staffing management plan. The
                                staffing management plan defines how your project will get and manage the
                                needed resources on your project.
                              * Communications management plan This plan defines who will get what
                                information, how they will receive it, and in what modality the
                                communication will take place. The project team will need to communicate
                                with the project manager, the sponsor, stakeholders, vendors, and each other.
                              * Risk management plan Risk is an uncertain event or condition that may
                                affect the project's outcome. Project team members will need to know what
                                risks are within the project, which risk owners will be identified, and how risk
                                responses will be planned and communicated.

                        * Procurement management plan The project may need to procure goods
                          and services. The project team may need to interact with vendors,
                          consultants, and even internal stakeholders, such as a procurement office
                          or purchasing department. This plan may also address how procured
                          consultants will serve as project team members.
                        * Milestone list This list details the project milestones and their attributes.
                          The milestone list is used for several areas of project planning, but also helps




                                                                                                                                              PART II
                          track how quickly the project may be achieving its objectives.
                        * Resource calendar Resources are people and things like equipment, rooms,
                          and other facilities. This calendar defines when resources are available to
                          contribute to the project.
                        * Schedule baseline This is the planned start and finish of the project. The
                          comparison of what was planned and what was experienced is the schedule
                          variance.
                        * Cost baseline This is the aggregated costs of all of the work packages within
                          the work breakdown structure (WBS).
                        * Quality baseline This documents the quality objectives for the project,
                          including the metrics for stakeholder acceptance of the project deliverable.
                        * Risk register The risk register is a centralized database consisting of the
                          outcome of all the other risk management processes. Consider the outcome of
                          risk identification, qualitative analysis, and quantitative analysis.

                   Charting the Human Resources
                   Lots of charts can help the project manager and the project management team deter-
                   mine what resources are needed, what responsibilities are within the project, reporting
                   relationships, accountability concerns, and lots more. Your PMI examination will quiz
                   you on these schmancy charts and how they're used. Don't worry--they're not difficult.
                   Let's have a look.

                   Using a Hierarchical Chart
                   A hierarchical chart shows the relationship between superior and subordinate employees,
                   groups, disciplines, even departments. You've already seen one hierarchical chart: the WBS.
                   When it comes to human resource planning, there are five types of charts to consider:

                        * Organization chart This traditional chart shows how the organization
                          is broken down by departments and disciplines. It is sometimes called the
                          organizational breakdown structure (OBS) and is arranged by departments,
                          units, or teams. With regard to project management, an OBS can be used to
                          show which project responsibilities are linked with which departments.
                        * Resource breakdown structure (RBS) This hierarchical chart can decompose
                          the project by the types of resources it contains. For example, your project might
                          be using mechanical engineers in several different deliverables throughout the




09-ch09.indd 343                                                                                                                 7/12/2013 4:50:48 AM

              344
                                 project. The RBS would organize all of the usage of the mechanical engineers, as
                                 well as other resources, by their disciplines rather than by where the disciplines
                                 are being utilized. A RBS is an excellent tool for tracking resource utilization
                                 and resource costs.
                              * Responsibility assignment matrix (RAM) A RAM chart shows the correlation
                                between project team members and the work they've been assigned to complete.
                                A RAM chart doesn't necessarily have to be specific to individual team members;
                                it can also be decomposed to project groups or units. Most often, however, RAM
                                charts depict activities and individual workers.
                              * RACI chart A RACI chart is another matrix chart that only uses the activities
                                of responsible, accountable, consult, and inform (hence, the acronym RACI).
                                Technically, a RACI chart is a form of the responsibility assignment matrix,
                                but I want to include it here as a separate entry. This chart, depicted in Figure
                                9-2, has gained some popularity in recent years, so I'd wager you'll see it on
                                your PMI examination. Notice how the different roles have only one of four
                                responsibilities: responsible, accountable, consult, and inform for each
                                assignment.
                              * Text-oriented chart A text-oriented chart is really more of a shopping list of
                                what a team member is responsible for within the project. These listings
                                define project responsibilities, reporting relationships, project authority,
                                competencies, and qualifications. You might also know these as position
                                descriptions or role-responsibility-authority forms.




                         Figure 9-2   RACI charts show the relation between activities and project team members.

                   Networking Human Resources
                   My buddy, Rick, and I do an exaggerated used-car salesman thumbs-up whenever one
                   of us mentions networking. We know networking works--it's a great way to meet new
                   people, find new business, and make friends. Networking events, such as your PMI
                   chapter meetings, luncheons, and just working a room, are all ways to help your project
                   move forward by furthering better understanding of how your organization moves
                   through political and interpersonal relationships.




                                                                                                                                               PART II
                       Basically, networking supports the old adage that people like to do business with
                   people they like. If people don't know you, they won't get a chance to like you. Net-
                   working functions, especially those internal to your organization, are great methods
                   to meet and greet and share news about your projects. Attending networking events
                   on an ongoing basis is effective. Some project managers fall into the trap of network-
                   ing only at the launch of a project. However, it's the steady networking that builds
                   relationships.

                   Identifying the Roles and Responsibilities
                   Human resource planning accomplishes wonderful things. It communicates what re-
                   sources the project will need, the roles and responsibilities the project team will play on
                   the project, the structure of the project team, and more. One of the fundamental things
                   that human resource planning does for the project is to identify the attributes of the
                   project team. You'll need to know these four terms for your PMI examination:

                        * Role This denotes what a person is specifically responsible for in a project.
                          Roles are usually tied to job titles, such as network engineer, mechanical
                          engineer, and electrician. It's what a person does.
                        * Responsibility A responsibility is the work that a role performs. More
                          precisely, it's the work that a project team member is responsible for within
                          the project.
                        * Authority Project team members may have authority over other project team
                          members, have the ability to make decisions, and even sign approvals for
                          project work and purchases. The authority level defines which project team
                          member has what level of authority within the project.
                        * Competency This attribute defines what talents, skills, and capacities are
                          needed to complete the project work. If there is a skill gap, then training,
                          development, hiring, and even schedule and scope changes should be
                          enacted.

                   Creating a Project Organization Chart
                   Another output of the human resource planning process for your project is a project
                   organization chart. This chart, as its name implies, illustrates the organization of the
                   project, the project team members, and all the associated reporting relationships. The
                   level of detail of the project organization chart is relative to the size of the project team

              346
                         and the priority of the project. In other words, a massive international project with
                         3,000 project team members around the globe will likely have more detail than a
                         20-person project team to create a new piece of software.

                         Examining the Staffing Management Plan
                         Here's the meat of planning for project human resources: you and the project manage-
                         ment team create the human resource plan. The human resource plan includes the
                         more project manager-specific plan: the staffing management plan. The staffing man-
                         agement plan details all of the following concerns:

                              * Staff acquisition This portion of the project plan defines how the project
                                team will be assembled. In some organizations, the project team is assigned
                                to the project manager. In others, the project manager petitions for the project
                                team members that he'd like on the project. This portion of the plan also
                                defines how the organization's human resources department will interact
                                with the project management team and if the project team will be all internal,
                                all external, or a blend of resources. Staff acquisition also deals with the
                                geographical location of the project team members and the costs associated
                                with acquiring team members with the appropriate expertise.
                              * Timetable In most projects, not all team members will be utilized on the
                                project all of the time. A timetable can identify when project team members
                                are needed on the project and when related activities, such as team
                                acquisitions, can be scheduled. In some projects, a resource histogram, as
                                Figure 9-3 shows, demonstrates when resources will be utilized across the
                                project. Typically, each bar in the histogram represents a project team
                                member, although some resource histograms can be created to show when a

                                                                                                                           347
                     project unit or department is involved in the project. Timetables are linked to
                     the resource calendar to see the days when a particular resource is available for
                     project work. This is especially important in a matrix structure when the project
                     team member may be assigned to work on multiple projects.

                          EXAM TIP When an individual bar in a resource histogram extends beyond
                          the maximum allowed hours, resource leveling is needed. Resource leveling




                                                                                                                                         PART II
                          lops off the exceeded labor amount and often causes the project duration to
                          increase.

                   * Staff release plan The staffing management plan defines the conditions and
                     circumstances regarding when a project staff member may be released from
                     the project team. Technically, you'll create a staff release plan. This plan
                     defines how the project manager, functional managers, and other project
                     managers in the organization will use the identified resources in future
                     projects and operations. Once the staff has been released from the project, the
                     project expenses can go down, assuming that project is paying directly for the
                     labor of the staff.
                   * Training needs If the project team doesn't know how to complete the work
                     within the project, the project manager must hire a contracted resource or
                     train the project team. This section of the staffing management plan defines
                     the need for training, the benefits of certification, and how the training can
                     help the project--and often the organization--reach its goals.
                   * Rewards and recognition This is a key PMI point. A clearly defined system
                     for rewards and recognition will reinforce the behavior the project manager
                     wants from her project team. Rewards and recognition, however, must be
                     based on conditions within a person's control. For example, if Bob is to be
                     rewarded for managing costs within the project, but Bob has no authority
                     over the decisions that affect costs, he'll feel pretty insecure in his ability to
                     realize the reward your project promises.

                          EXAM TIP You want to avoid zero-sum awards. These are awards where
                          only one person can win the award, such as team member of the month.
                          (More on this shortly in "Rewarding the Project Team.")

                   * Compliance issues The staffing management plan also details how the
                     project will adhere to government regulations, union contracts, and human
                     resource practices your organization abides by.
                   * Safety Many projects must consider the safety of the project team. While
                     safety for the project team is part of the cost of quality, as I discussed in
                     Chapter 8, it's revisited here to reinforce the need for attention to safety issues.
                     We'll see this issue again in Chapter 11 when we discuss risks and the project
                     team.

                         Acquiring the Project Team
                         You need people to complete your project. But have you ever managed a project where
                         the resources you wanted on the project were not available? Or have you managed a
                         project where the resources you were assigned weren't the best resources to complete
                         the project work? Staff acquisition is the process of getting the needed resources on the
                         project team to complete the project work. It focuses on working within the policies
                         and procedures of the performing organization to obtain the needed resources to com-
                         plete the project work. Negotiation, communication, and political savvy are the keys to
                         getting the desired resources on the project team.

                         Examining the Staffing Pool
                         Sometimes the project manager doesn't have any say over the project team members
                         who are assigned to the project team. In other instances, the project manager can influ-
                         ence the decision makers to get the best team members. Your project team might also
                         include contractors that you'll have to manage. These are all part of enterprise environ-
                         mental factors--how an organization operates. The project manager should always ask
                         about the following things:

                              * Experience What is the experience of the project team member? Has he
                                done similar work in the past? Has he done it well?
                              * Interest level     Are the project team members interested in working on this
                                project?
                              * Characteristics How will each individual team member work with other
                                project team members?
                              * Availability Will the project team members desired for the project be
                                available? Project managers should confer with functional managers on the
                                availability of potential team members.
                              * Knowledge What is the competency and proficiency of the available project
                                team members?


                         Negotiating for Resources
                         Most projects require the project manager to negotiate for resources. The project man-
                         ager will likely have to negotiate with functional managers to obtain the needed re-
                         sources to complete the project work. The functional managers and the project man-
                         ager may struggle over an employee's time due to demands from ongoing operations,
                         other projects, and desires to effectively use resources. In other instances, functional
                         managers may want to assign under-utilized resources on projects in order to consume
                         their otherwise idle employees' time.
                             Project managers may also have to negotiate with other project managers to share
                         needed resources among projects. Scheduling the needed resources between the project
                         teams will need to be coordinated so that both projects may complete successfully.

                                                                                                                               349
                   Working with Preassigned Staff
                   Project team members are often preassigned to a project for a number of reasons:

                        * Availability of the individual
                        * Promised as part of a competitive contract
                        * Required as part of the project charter for an internal project




                                                                                                                                             PART II
                        * Opportunity for the staff member to complete on-the-job training

                       Whatever the reasoning behind the assignment of the staff to the project, the proj-
                   ect manager should evaluate the project team for skill gaps, availability to complete the
                   project work, and expectations of the project team members. The project manager must
                   address any discrepancies between the requirements of the project work and the project
                   team's ability to complete the work.

                   Procuring Staff
                   In some instances, the project manager may have no alternative but to procure the proj-
                   ect team or individuals to complete the project work. I'll talk all about procurement in
                   Chapter 12. With regard to project team procurement, reasons why the project man-
                   ager can use this alternative include, but are not limited to, the following:

                        * The performing organization lacks the internal resources with the needed
                          skills to complete the project work.
                        * The work is more cost-effective to procure.
                        * The project team members are present within the organization, but they are
                          not available to the current project because of the organizational structure,
                          such as a functional or projectized structure.
                        * The project team members are present within the organization, but they
                          cannot complete the needed work due to other project assignments.


                   Managing a Virtual Team
                   Placing all of the project team members in one geographical location is ideal for many
                   project managers. In theory, having all of the project team members together allows the
                   team members to quickly communicate, work with each other, and generally work bet-
                   ter as a team. In reality, that's not always possible: Team members are spread around the
                   globe, space isn't necessarily available in one locale, and other logistics could prevent
                   bringing all of the project team together in a project war room. (And yes, there's no
                   fighting in the war room.)
                        Virtual teams, however, are more likely in today's world. Collaboration software,
                   Internet tools, phone calls, and e-mails can help increase communications and the




09-ch09.indd 349                                                                                                                7/12/2013 4:50:49 AM

              350
                         sense of a co-located team without the expense and improbability of a co-located team.
                         Virtual teams allow the organization to:

                              * Create a project team that comprises experts from around the globe
                              * Permit people to work from home offices
                              * Permit people to work different shifts and hours
                              * Include people on the project team who may have mobility limitations
                              * Save monies by not incurring travel expenses

                                       EXAM TIP The negative side to virtual teams is that communication can be
                                       more difficult, and costs can be incurred from coordinating and managing the
                                       needed communication among the virtual team.

                         Utilizing a Multicriteria Decision Analysis Process
                         A multicriteria decision analysis process sounds real formal, scientific, and scary, but it's
                         mainly a method to rank a potential project team member on several factors to see if
                         the person should be on the project team. To use this approach, you'd identify several
                         factors, assign scores to the different factors, and then measure each team member by
                         those factors. Here's a quick example I made up with scoring:

                              * Skills, 5 points     What skills does the person have that the project needs?
                              * Knowledge, 3 points Does this person have specialized knowledge about
                                the processes, the customer, or the project life cycle?
                              * Costs, 6 points       How much is this person going to cost the project?
                              * Availability, 3 points       Will this person be available for the duration of the
                                project?
                              * Experience, 4 points Does this person have experience with the technology
                                the project will be implementing?

                             Using these simple factors, you could measure and compare each potential team
                         member and make a determination of their scored value to the project. You can add as
                         many factors as needed and perhaps create a minimum threshold of points that the
                         person must have to be invited onto your project team.

                         Assembling the Project Team
                         With the project team assembled, the project manager can continue planning, assign-
                         ing activities, and managing the project progression. Project team members can be as-
                         signed to the project on a full- or part-time basis, depending on the project conditions.
                         Once the project team is built, a project team directory should be assembled. The proj-
                         ect team directory should include the project team members':

                          web addresses, and so on


                   Developing the Project Team
                   The project team is developed by enhancing the competencies of the individual project
                   team members and promoting the interaction of all the project team members. Through-
                   out the project, the project manager will have to work to develop the project team. The
                   project manager may have to develop an individual team member's skills so that she can
                   complete her assignments. The project manager will also have to work to develop the
                   project team as a whole so that the team can work together to complete the project.
                       In matrix organizations, the project team members are accountable to the project
                   manager and to their functional managers. Developing the project team can prove chal-
                   lenging, since the project team members may feel pulled between multiple bosses. The
                   project manager must strive to involve and develop the project team members as indi-
                   viduals completing project work--and as team members completing the project objec-
                   tives together.

                   Preparing for Team Development
                   Team development is a natural process, but it's also a process that the project manager
                   can usher along. If you're the project manager and you want your team to work to-
                   gether, get along, and focus on completing the project rather than on who's really in
                   charge of the project, you'll need these inputs:

                       * Staff assignments The assignments of the project team members define their
                         skills, their needs for development, and their abilities to complete the project
                         work as individuals and as part of the team.
                        * Human resource plan Recall that the human resource plan details how
                          project team members will be brought onto the project, managed, and
                          released from the project team.
                        * Resource availability You'll need to know when your project team members
                          are available and when they're vacationing in the desert. This component also
                          considers when project team members are on multiple projects within your
                          organization and allows you to plan for when you'll utilize the project team
                          members best.

                         Leading Project Team Development
                         Due to the temporary nature of projects, it can be tough for a group of strangers to form
                         relationships and immediately create a successful project. Team development is the
                         guidance, direction, and leadership the project manager offers to influence a project
                         team. The project manager needs interpersonal skills, sometimes called "soft" skills, to
                         help alleviate the project team's fears, concerns, and anxiety about the project. The
                         project manager should use empathy, leadership, and group facilitation to move team
                         development along.
                             Training the project team is one of the best team development exercises. The staff-
                         ing management plan defines the need for training, and team development is the exe-
                         cution of that plan. In other words, if team members don't know how to do the project
                         work, train them!
                             Another facet of team development is a focus on getting the project work complet-
                         ed. The project managers are the power on the project team. While there may be some
                         resistance from the project team to cooperate with the project manager, complete as-
                         signed duties, or participate as requested, the project team should realize that the proj-
                         ect manager is the project authority. There are five types of powers that the project
                         manager wields:

                              * Expert The project manager's authority comes from both experience with the
                                technology the project focuses on and from expertise in managing projects.
                              * Reward       The project manager has the authority to reward the project team.
                              * Formal The project manager has been assigned the role of project manager
                                by senior management and is in charge of the project. This is also known as
                                positional power.
                              * Coercive The project manager has the authority to discipline the project
                                team members. This is also known as penalty power. When the team is afraid
                                of the project manager, the project manager has coercive power.
                              * Referent The project team personally knows the project manager. Referent
                                can also mean that the project manager refers to the person who assigned him
                                or her the position--for example, "The CEO assigned me to this position, so
                                we'll do it this way." This power can also mean the project team wants to work
                                on the project or with the project manager due to the high priority and impact
                                of the project.

                         Creating Team-Building Activities
                         Team-building activities are approaches to developing the team through facilitated
                         events. The goal of team-building exercises is to allow the project team to learn about
                         each other, rely on each other, and form cohesiveness among the project team mem-
                         bers. Events can include:

                              * Involving the team during planning processes
                              * Defining rules for handling team disagreements

                        * Facilitating activities to improve interpersonal skills and form relationships

                      There's a general belief that project teams actually go through their own natural
                   development processes. These processes can shift, linger, and even stall based on the
                   dynamics of the project team. This theory of team development was created by Dr.




                                                                                                                                                PART II
                   Bruce Tuckman in 1965. Here are the five phases of team development that project
                   managers may face:

                       * Forming The project team meets and learns about their roles and
                         responsibilities on the project. Little interaction among the project team
                         happens in this stage, as the team is learning about the project and project
                         manager. The project manager guides the project team through this stage of
                         team development by introducing members and helping them learn about
                         one another.
                        * Storming The project team struggles for project positions, leadership, and
                          project direction. The project team can become hostile toward the project
                          leader, challenge ideas, and try to establish and claim positions about the
                          project work. The amount of debate and fury can vary depending on whether
                          the project team is willing to work together, the nature of the project, and the
                          control of the project manager. The project manager's role in this stage is to
                          mediate disagreement and squelch unproductive behavior.
                        * Norming Project team members go about getting the project work, begin to
                          rely on one another, and generally complete their project assignments. In this
                          stage of team development, the project manager allows the project team to
                          manage themselves.
                        * Performing If a project team can reach the performing stage of team
                          development, they trust one another, work well together, and issues and
                          problems get resolved quickly and effectively. The project manager stays out
                          of the project team's way, but is available to help the project team get their
                          work done.
                        * Adjourning Once the project is done, either the team moves onto other
                          assignments as a unit, or the project team is disbanded and individual team
                          members go on to other work. The project manager uses the staffing
                          management plan as a guide for how project team members are released from
                          the project team.

                               NOTE Tuckman originally used just the first four stages of team development,
                               but added adjourning to the model in the 1970s.

                         Establishing Project Ground Rules
                         Creating ground rules for the project team is part of team development. Ground rules
                         establish the project expectations for the project team and define what is and is not ac-
                         ceptable behavior by all of the project team members, including the project manager.
                         When all of the project team members agree to abide by the defined ground rules, mis-
                         understandings diminish while productivity increases. Once ground rules are defined,
                         it's the responsibility of all the project team members to enforce them.

                                       EXAM TIP Ground rules are enforced by the project team, not just the
                                       project manager.

                         Relying on Interpersonal Management Skills
                         As a project manager, you need interpersonal skills to lead the project team. You might
                         know these as soft skills or emotional intelligence, but they're really about understand-
                         ing what motivates a person, how you can lead the person, and how to really listen to
                         a person on your project team. While project management is about getting things done,
                         you're dealing with people that have issues, concerns, stress, anxiety, and a life beyond
                         your project. You need to listen to the project team, empathize with them as needed,
                         and help them manage their project work and assignment. This is a great example
                         where a more experienced project manager can shift from the project manager role and
                         see the project from the perspective of the team member.
                             A chunk of project management relies on interpersonal skills. Specifically, the proj-
                         ect manager relies on:

                              * Leading Good project managers master the art of establishing direction,
                                aligning people, and motivating the project team to complete the project
                                work.
                              * Communicating Good project managers are good communicators.
                                Remember, half of communicating is listening.
                              * Negotiating Project managers will likely negotiate for scope, cost, terms,
                                assignment, and resources.
                              * Problem solving         Project managers must have the ability to confront and
                                solve problems.
                              * Influencing       Project managers use their influence to get things done.

                         Rewarding the Project Team
                         When discussing human resource planning, I mentioned that you, the project manager,
                         should create the rewards and recognition system. This system is part of team develop-
                         ment and encourages the behavior you want from your project team--that is, the be-
                         havior that promotes the project to completion and meets the project scope statement.
                         Performance appraisals tell the project manager, and sometimes functional manage-




09-ch09.indd 354                                                                                                                 7/12/2013 4:50:49 AM

                                                                                    Chapter 9: Managing Project Human Resources

                                                                                                                               355
                   ment, which team members should be rewarded based on the confines of the reward
                   system.
                       Obviously, positive behavior should be rewarded. If a project team member will-
                   ingly agrees to work overtime to ensure that the project will hit its schedule objective,
                   that should be rewarded or recognized by the project manager. However, if a project
                   team member has to work overtime because he has wasted time or resources, a reward
                   is not in order.




                                                                                                                                             PART II
                       Win-lose awards, sometimes called zero-sum awards, should be avoided because
                   they can hurt the project team's cohesiveness. Any award where only some of the proj-
                   ect team members can qualify shouldn't be given. For instance, I once worked on a
                   project where the project manager awarded the software developer who created the
                   most code a bonus every month. Well, since I wasn't a software developer, I could
                   never qualify for that bonus. (Thanks a lot, Ron! Ron was my boss then, and oh what
                   sweet printed vengeance this is. Just kidding... He dropped the bonus program when
                   he saw the trouble with his plan.)

                               EXAM TIP Your reward and recognition system should also consider
                               cultural differences. Creating team rewards in a culture that encourages
                               individualism can be difficult. In other words, the reward system must mesh
                               with the culture within which the project manager is operating.

                   Assessing the Project Team
                   You want your project team to be the best unit of people possible. You want them to
                   rely on one another, help each other, and communicate without fear of retribution. You
                   also want the project team to be competent in the project work and execution of the
                   project management plan. Personnel assessment tools, such as exams and surveys, can
                   help you gain some insight into the project team and where each person's strengths and
                   weaknesses lie. This can help you determine how to better manage the project team,
                   improve performance, and gain insight into what motivates team members.
                       The assessments of the project team can measure all sorts of factors, but there are
                   some common measurements as a result of the assessment program:

                        * Technical success of the project execution
                        * Project schedule adherence
                        * Cost baseline management
                        * Improvement in competencies
                        * Reduction in staff turnover
                        * Team functionality in communications and problem solving

                     Project team members' performance is reviewed and tied to their overall perfor-
                   mance on the project team. Performance appraisals can be in the form of a 360-degree

                         appraisal, where a project team member is reviewed in all directions by the project
                         team, the project manager, stakeholders, and even vendors, where appropriate.


                         Managing the Project Team
                         Now that the project manager has planned for the human resources and developed the
                         project team, he can focus on managing the project team. This process involves tracking
                         each team member's performance, offering feedback, taking care of project issues, and
                         managing those pesky change requests that can affect the project team and its work. The
                         staffing management plan may be updated based on lessons learned and changes with-
                         in the team management process.
                             In a matrix environment, where the project team members are accountable to both
                         the project manager and a functional manager, team management is a tricky business.
                         The project manager and the functional managers need to work together to communi-
                         cate the utilization of the project team member in both operations and on the project.
                         The project team's demand for dual reporting to the project manager and the func-
                         tional manager also has to be considered--and is often the responsibility of the project
                         manager rather than the functional manager or project team member.

                         Preparing for Team Management
                         Managing the project team is based on many conditions and scenarios within the proj-
                         ect. Management of the project team is really about one thing: getting the project work
                         done as promised in the project scope statement. There are many inputs to project team
                         management:

                              * Human resource plan You know this plan, right? Just in case you forgot,
                                it defines when project team members will complete their project work,
                                the training needs for the project, certification requirements, and any labor
                                compliance issues. It's an output of human resources planning.
                              * Project staff assignments The project manager and the project management
                                team both need a listing of the project staff assignments in order to monitor
                                and evaluate each project team member's project performance.
                              * Team performance assessments You'll know if your project team is doing a
                                good job or not, but you'll want to quantify their performance so that you can
                                make recommendations where needed. Assessments include information on
                                the project team's skills, competencies, turnover rate, and team cohesion.
                              * Issue log Any issues that have been found in the project should be
                                documented in this log. A project team member is assigned to the resolution
                                of the issue by a given date, so this log is considered an input to managing the
                                project team.
                              * Work performance reports The project management team observes and
                                records the work a project team member performs. This doesn't necessarily

                                                                                                                                357
                           mean the project management team peers over the shoulder of the project
                           team member, but rather observes the team member's participation in team
                           activities, their delivery on action items, and thoroughness in communication.
                        * Organizational process assets Consider the organization's approach to
                          rewarding employees for their work in a project. Organizational process assets
                          in team management rely on dinners, certificates of appreciation, newsletters,
                          and other methods to recognize a project team's hard work on a project.




                                                                                                                                              PART II
                       All of these inputs feed directly into the actual process of managing the project team.
                   The project manager and the project management team will use the evidence of these
                   things to better manage the team in order to move the project toward completion.

                   Dealing with Team Disagreements
                   In most projects, there will be instances when the project team, management, and oth-
                   er stakeholders disagree on the progress, decisions, and proposed solutions within the
                   project. It's essential for the project manager to keep calm, lead, and direct the parties
                   to a sensible solution that's best for the project. Here are seven reasons for conflict,
                   listed from most common to least common:

                        * Schedules
                        * Priorities
                        * Resources
                        * Technical beliefs
                        * Administrative policies and procedures
                        * Project costs
                        * Personalities

                                EXAM TIP You can expect questions on these areas of conflict on the exam.
                                Don't be duped into thinking personality conflicts are the biggest problem
                                with conflict resolution. They are the least important.

                       So what's a project manager to do with all the potential for strife in a project? There
                   are five different approaches to conflict resolution:

                        * Collaborate/Problem Solve This approach utilizes multiple viewpoints and
                          perspectives to find a resolution. To utilize this method, the participants need
                          a collaborative attitude to confront the problem rather than each other.
                        * Force/Direct The person with the power makes the decision. The decision
                          made may not be the best decision for the project, but it's fast. As expected,
                          this autocratic approach does little for team development and is a win-lose

              358
                                 solution. It should be used when the stakes are high and time is of the
                                 essence, or if relationships are not important.
                              * Compromise/Reconcile This approach requires that both parties give up
                                something. The decision made is a blend of both sides of the argument.
                                Because neither party really wins, it is considered a lose-lose solution. The
                                project manager can use this approach when the relationships are equal and
                                no one can truly "win." This approach can also be used to avoid a fight.
                              * Smoothing/Accommodating This approach smoothes out the conflict by
                                minimizing the perceived size of the problem. It is a temporary solution, but
                                can calm team relations and boisterous discussions. Smoothing may be
                                acceptable when time is of the essence or when any of the proposed solutions
                                will not currently settle the problem. This can be considered a lose-lose
                                situation as well, since no one really wins in the long run. The project
                                manager can use smoothing to emphasize areas of agreement between
                                disagreeing stakeholders and thus minimize areas of conflict.
                              * Withdrawal/Avoidance This conflict resolution has one side of the
                                argument walking away from the problem, usually in disgust. The conflict is
                                not resolved, and it is considered a yield-lose solution. The approach can be
                                used, however, as a cooling-off period or when the issue is not critical.

                         Creating an Issue Log
                         It's okay to have issues within a project as long as the issues are recorded in the issue
                         log. An issue, technically, is something that may be preventing the project team from
                         reaching the project objectives. Typically, issues are identified and recorded in the issue
                         log. Each issue is assigned to an owner who needs to find a method that will resolve the
                         issue by a given date. Each issue should also be identified as to its status and possible
                         resolution. Common issues are:

                              * Differences of opinion
                              * Situations to be investigated
                              * Unanticipated responsibilities that need to be assigned to someone on the
                                project team

                         Examining the Outputs of Team Management
                         Team management begins as soon as the project team comes together, and ends as soon
                         as the project is closed. Throughout the project, different conditions and scenarios will
                         affect how the project manager and the project management team will manage the proj-
                         ect and the resources within it. There are five outputs of managing the project team:




09-ch09.indd 358                                                                                                                 7/12/2013 4:50:50 AM

                                                                               Chapter 9: Managing Project Human Resources

                                                                                                                          359
                   * Requested changes Seems like just about everything can result in a change
                     request, doesn't it? Changes to the project team can have ripple effects on the
                     project scheduling, project cost, and even the project scope statement, so a
                     change request is needed when these conditions are true. Corrective actions
                     can include moving people to different assignments, outsourcing some of
                     the project work, and replacing project team members who may have left the
                     organization or project. Preventive actions can include cross-training, role




                                                                                                                                        PART II
                     clarification, and even additional labor through hiring or procurement to
                     ensure that all of the project work is completed as planned.
                   * Project management plan updates Just like any other area of project
                     management, if the project management plan needs to be updated, it should
                     be. Project management plan updates could include approved change requests,
                     corrective actions, new project team member roles, and training decisions.
                   * Project document updates Updates to the issue log, role description, and
                     staff assignments should be reflected in the project documents as needed. You
                     may need to update the roles and responsibility charts, such as your RACI
                     chart, to reflect the changes within the project and/or project team.
                   * Enterprise environmental factor updates It is possible that your
                     management approach could affect the enterprise environmental factors
                     within your organization. You may need to update the process for
                     performance appraisals and any information about project team members'
                     new skills as a result of the project training.
                   * Organizational process assets updates You'll need to update the
                     organizational process assets for your project as a result of managing the
                     project team. This will likely include any templates you've created, historical
                     information, and lessons learned documentation. What the project
                     management team learns in the project becomes part of organizational
                     process assets for future projects. For example, lessons learned in human
                     resources include:
                     * Staffing management plan
                     * Organizational charts
                     * Position descriptions
                     * Ground rules
                     * Conflict management techniques
                     * Successful rewards and recognition approaches
                     * Procedures for virtual team management
                     * Negotiating techniques

                         Relating to Organizational Theories
                         You can expect to see some of these topics on your exam, so let's have a look at these
                         theories in more detail.

                         Maslow's Hierarchy of Needs
                         According to Abraham Maslow, people work to take care of a hierarchy of needs. The
                         pinnacle of their needs is self-actualization. People want to contribute, prove their
                         worth, and use their skills and abilities. Figure 9-4 shows the pyramid of needs that all
                         people try to ascend by fulfilling each layer, one at a time.
                            Maslow's five layers of needs, from lowest to highest, are:

                              * Physiological People require these necessities to live: air, water, food,
                                clothing, and shelter.
                              * Safety People need safety and security. This can include stability in life,
                                work, and culture.
                              * Social         People are social creatures and need love, approval, and friends.
                              * Esteem          People strive for the respect, appreciation, and approval of others.
                              * Self-actualization At the pinnacle of needs, people seek personal growth,
                                knowledge, and fulfillment.


                         Figure 9-4
                         Maslow's theory
                         states that people
                         ultimately work for
                         self-actualization.

                                                                                                                                  361
                   Herzberg's Theory of Motivation
                   According to Frederick Herzberg, a psychologist and authority on the motivation of
                   work, there are two catalysts for success with people:

                        * Hygiene agents These elements are the expectations all workers have. They
                          include job security, a paycheck, clean and safe working conditions, a sense of
                          belonging, civil working relationships, and other basic attributes associated




                                                                                                                                                PART II
                          with employment.
                         * Motivating agents These are the elements that motivate people to excel.
                           They include responsibility, appreciation of work, public recognition for a job
                           well done, the chance to excel, education, and other opportunities associated
                           with work aside from financial rewards.

                       This theory says that the presence of hygiene factors will not motivate people to
                   perform because these are expected attributes. However, the absence of these elements
                   will demotivate performance. For people to excel, the presence of motivating factors
                   must exist. Figure 9-5 illustrates Herzberg's Theory of Motivation.

                                  EXAM COACH Use Herzberg's Theory for your exam. Find some things that
                                  will motivate you to excel so you can pass your exam: a career advancement, a
                                  day off work, new clothes, or some other reward. Create an incentive that
                                  means something to you. After all, part of Herzberg's Theory is that the
                                  motivating agents have to interest the person that's being motivated.

                   McGregor's Theory of X and Y
                   Douglas McGregor's theory states that, from their perspective, management believes
                   there are two types of workers, good and bad, as seen in Figure 9-6. Theory X sees work-
                   ers as lazy, uninterested in doing the project work, and that they must be micromanaged


                   Figure 9-5
                   Hygiene agents do
                   nothing to motivate,
                   but their absence will
                   cause performance
                   and morale to
                   decline.

                         Management believes

                         and coerced to do the work. Theory Y sees workers as good, self-directed, and able to do
                         the work that's assigned to them.

                              * X is bad. These people need to be watched all the time, micromanaged, and
                                cannot be trusted. X people avoid work, shun responsibility, and lack the
                                aptitude to achieve.
                              * Y is good. These people are self-led, motivated, and can accomplish new tasks
                                proactively.

                         Ouchi's Theory Z
                         William Ouchi's theory is based on the participative management style of the Japanese.
                         This theory states that workers are motivated by a sense of commitment, opportunity,
                         and advancement. Workers in an organization subscribing to Theory Z learn the busi-
                         ness by moving up through the ranks of the company.
                             Ouchi's theory also credits the idea of lifetime employment. Workers will stay with
                         one company until they retire because they are dedicated to the company, which is in
                         turn dedicated to them.

                                       EXAM TIP If you need a way to keep McGregor's X and Y and Ouchi's Z
                                       theories separate in your mind, think of this: X is bad;Y is good; Z is the best.


                         Vroom's Expectancy Theory
                         Vroom's Expectancy Theory states that people will behave based on what they expect as
                         a result of their behavior. In other words, people will work in relation to the expected
                         reward of the work. If the attractiveness of the reward is desirable to the worker, she will
                         work to receive it. In other words, people expect to be rewarded for their effort.

                         McClelland's Theory of Needs
                         David McClelland developed his acquired-needs theory based on his belief that a per-
                         son's needs are acquired and develop over time. These needs are shaped by circum-
                         stance, conditions, and life experiences for each individual. McClelland's Theory of
                         Needs is also known as the Three Needs Theory because there are just three needs for

                   each individual. Depending on the person's experiences, the order and magnitude of
                   each need shifts:

                        * Need for Achievement These people need to achieve, so they avoid both
                          low-risk and high-risk situations. Achievers like to work alone or with other
                          high achievers, and they need regular feedback to gauge their achievement and
                          progress.




                                                                                                                                               PART II
                        * Need for Affiliation People who have a driving need for affiliation look for
                          harmonious relationships, want to feel accepted by people, and conform to
                          the norms of the project team.
                        * Need for Power People who have a need for power are usually seeking
                          either personal or institutional power. Personal power generally is the ability
                          to control and direct other people. Institutional power is the ability to direct
                          the efforts of others for the betterment of the organization.

                       McClelland developed the Thematic Apperception Test to determine what needs are
                   driving individuals. The test is a series of pictures that the test taker must create a story
                   about. Through the storytelling, the test taker will reveal which need is driving his or
                   her life at that time.


                   Chapter Summary
                   The project manager has to plan for the needed human resources to complete the proj-
                   ect work. In addition, the project manager plans for how the human resources will be
                   managed, trained, motivated, and led throughout the duration of the project. The proj-
                   ect management team works to identify the roles within the project and their responsi-
                   bilities, which are the activities needed to complete the project work. The key output of
                   planning for human resources is the staffing management plan, which defines how the
                   project team will be acquired, managed, trained, rewarded for the work, and then re-
                   leased from the project team. The staffing management plan also defines how the proj-
                   ect management team will comply with government regulations and will manage team
                   safety concerns.
                       The project team is acquired just as the staffing management plan specifies. The
                   team, however, isn't always selected--it's often preassigned to the project. Sometimes,
                   the project manager gets to negotiate with the functional managers and other project
                   managers to get the best resources possible on the project. When the resources aren't
                   available inside the organization, the project manager often has to deal with contracted
                   help, which means procurement.
                       Some teams all work together in one locale and might huddle in the project's war
                   room. This idea of a co-located team supports ad-hoc conversations, team cohesive-
                   ness, and project performance. However, in many cases, the project team is not co-
                   located, and a virtual team is created. Virtual teams allow people with mobility handicaps
                   or travel issues, as well as home office workers, to be actively involved in the project.

                             Whatever conditions surround the project team, the project manager must work to
                         develop the team. Team development centers on building team cohesiveness through
                         team-building exercises, training, and team involvement. One team development tool
                         and technique is the creation of ground rules. Ground rules are created and agreed
                         upon by the project team to promote performance within the project. Once ground
                         rules are created, it's up to the project team to enforce them.
                             Through conversations, observations, performance appraisals, conflict manage-
                         ment, and the issue log, the project manager will manage the project team. The goal of
                         team management is getting the project done--meaning, it's all about results.
                             Human resource theories, such as Maslow's Hierarchy of Needs, McGregor's Theory
                         of X and Y, Ouchi's Theory Z, and Vroom's Expectancy Theory, all seek to determine
                         what motivates an employee to complete her project tasks. Project managers can use
                         these theories to determine the best approach to motivate or inspire a project team
                         member to elicit the behavior the project manager expects.

                         Key Terms
                         Adjourning Once the project is done, either the team moves onto other assignments
                         as a unit, or the project team is disbanded and individual team members go on to
                         other work.
                         Authority power Project management team members may have authority over other
                         project team members, may have the ability to make decisions, and perhaps even sign
                         approvals for project work and purchases.
                         Coercive power The project manager has the authority to discipline the project team
                         members. This is also known as penalty power.
                         Collaborate/Problem solving This approach confronts the problem head-on and is
                         the preferred method of conflict resolution. Multiple viewpoints and perspectives con-
                         tribute to the solution.
                         Collective bargaining agreement constraints Contracts and agreements with unions
                         or other employee groups may serve as constraints on the project.
                         Competency This attribute defines what talents, skills, and capabilities are needed to
                         complete the project work.
                         Compromising This approach requires that both parties give up something.
                         Vroom's Expectancy Theory This theory states that people will behave based on what
                         they expect as a result of their behavior. In other words, people will work in relation to
                         the expected reward.
                         Expert power The project manager's authority comes both from experience with the
                         technology the project focuses on and from expertise in managing projects.
                         Forcing power      The person with the power makes the decision.

                   Formal power The project manager has been assigned the role of project manager by
                   senior management and is in charge of the project.
                   Forming The project team meets and learns about their roles and responsibilities on
                   the project. Little interaction among the project team happens in this stage as the team
                   is learning about the project and project manager.

                   Hierarchical organizational chart A chart showing the relationship between superior
                   and subordinate employees, groups, disciplines, and even departments.
                   Human resource plan This plan defines staff acquisition, the timetable for staff ac-
                   quisition, the staff release plan, training needs for the project team, any organizational
                   compliance issues, rewards and recognitions, and safety concerns for the project team
                   doing the project work.
                   Interpersonal interfaces This organizational interface considers the formal and
                   informal reporting relationships that may exist among the project team members.
                   The interpersonal interface also considers the job descriptions of the project team
                   members, existing reporting structures between supervisors and subordinates, and
                   existing relationships, if any, that may affect the project work. This interface also
                   considers any cultural or language differences among the project team that may need
                   to be addressed.
                   Issue log A logbook of the issues the project team has identified and dates as to when
                   the issues must be resolved by. The issue log may also include team members or stake-
                   holders who are responsible for finding a solution to the identified issues.
                   Logistical interfaces The logistics of the team locale, time zones, geographical bound-
                   aries, and travel requirements within a project.

                   have and work toward.
                   McClelland's Theory of Needs David McClelland developed this theory, which states
                   our needs are acquired and developed by our experiences over time. All people are, ac-
                   cording to this theory, driven by one of three needs: achievement, affiliation, or power.
                   McGregor's Theory of X and Y Douglas McGregor's theory that states management
                   views workers in the Y category as competent and self-led and workers in the X catego-
                   ry as incompetent and needing to be micromanaged.
                   Multicriteria Decision Analysis A method to rate potential project team members
                   based on criteria such as education, experience, skills, knowledge, and more.

                         Organization chart Traditional chart that depicts how the organization is broken
                         down by department and disciplines. This chart is sometimes called the organizational
                         breakdown structure (OBS) and is arranged by departments, units, or teams.
                         Organizational interfaces The project management team needs to identify which de-
                         partments are going to be involved in the project.
                         Organizational structure constraint The structure of the organization has a direct
                         correlation to the amount of power a project manager has within a project.
                         Ouchi's Theory Z William Ouchi's theory is based on the participative management
                         style of the Japanese. This theory states that workers are motivated by a sense of com-
                         mitment, opportunity, and advancement.
                         Performing If a project team can reach the performing stage of team development,
                         they trust one another, work well together, and issues and problems get resolved quick-
                         ly and effectively.
                         Political interfaces The hidden goals, personal agendas, and alliances among the
                         project team members and the stakeholders.
                         RACI chart A RACI chart is a matrix chart that only uses the activities of responsible,
                         accountable, consult, and inform.
                         Referent power The project team personally knows the project manager. Referent can
                         also mean that the project manager refers to the person who assigned him the position.
                         Resource breakdown structure (RBS) This hierarchical chart can decompose the
                         project by the type of resources used throughout it.
                         Responsibility assignment matrix (RAM) A RAM chart shows the correlation be-
                         tween project team members and the work they've been assigned to complete.
                         Responsibility     A responsibility is the work that a role performs.
                         Reward     The project manager has the authority to reward the project team.
                         Role This denotes what a person is specifically responsible for in a project. Roles
                         are usually tied to job titles, such as network engineer, mechanical engineer, and
                         electrician.
                         Smoothing This approach smooths out the conflict by minimizing the perceived size
                         of the problem. It is a temporary solution, but can calm team relations and boisterous
                         discussions.
                         Staffing management plan A subsidiary plan of the project management plan that
                         defines staff acquisition, timetables, release criteria, training needs, reward and recogni-
                         tion systems, compliance issues, and safety concerns for the project.
                         Storming The project team struggles for project positions, leadership, and project
                         direction. The project team can become hostile toward the project leader, challenge
                         ideas, and try to establish and claim positions about the project work. The amount of

                   debate and fury can vary depending on if the project team is willing to work together,
                   the nature of the project, and the control of the project manager.
                   Technical interfaces The project team identifies the disciplines and specialties that
                   the project will require to complete the project scope statement. The technical inter-
                   faces are the resources that will be doing the project work.
                   Withdrawal This conflict resolution method sees one side of the argument walking
                   away from the problem, usually in disgust.

                       is a database administrator and developer whose work is always on time,
                       accurate, and of quality. He also has a reputation of being a "good guy" and
                       is well liked. Because of this, management has decided to move Tyler into the
                       role of a project manager for a new database administration project. This is an

                       company. It's come to your attention that three of your project team members
                       are in a disagreement about the direction the project work should take. This
                       disagreement is stalling the project schedule and causing the other project
                       team members to become uncomfortable. You need to resolve this situation
                       quickly and professionally. Which problem-solving technique is the best for

                       members respect Harold for his experience with the technology, but often
                       things have to go in Harold's favor, otherwise the team's in for a bumpy ride.
                       During a discussion on a solution, a project team member waves her arms
                       and says, "Fine, Harold, do it your way." This is an example of which of the
                       following?
                       A. A win-win solution

                                 you in the past, and they consider you to be an expert project manager. They
                                 also like working with you. Given all of this, you likely have what type of
                                 power on this project?

                     18. You are the project manager for your organization and it's come to your
                         attention that some of the project team members are in disagreement with the
                         senior network engineer about the installation of some equipment. You need

                         to resolve this situation quickly before the project stalls any longer. Which of
                         the following is an example of coercive power?
                         A. A project manager who has lunch with the project team every Thursday
                         B. A project manager who will openly punish any team member who is late
                            with an activity
                         C. A project manager who has worked with the technology on the project for
                            several years
                         D. A project manager who is friends with all of the project team members
                     19. Mike is the project manager for a project with a very tight schedule. The
                         project is running late, and Mike feels that he does not have time to consider

                   Questions and Answers
                      1. You are the project manager for the JHG Project. This project requires
                         coordination with the director of manufacturing, HR, the IT department, and
                         the CIO. This is an example of what type of input to organizational planning?
                         A. Organizational interfaces
                         B. Technical interfaces
                         C. Interpersonal interfaces

                                  D. Human resource coordination
                                 A. The reporting interfaces for this project--the director of manufacturing,
                                 HR, the IT department, and the CIO--are examples of the organizational
                                 interfaces. B is incorrect because technical interfaces are the technical gurus
                                 for the project, such as the engineers and designers. C, the interpersonal
                                 interfaces, is not the best choice because this relationship describes the
                                 different individuals working on the project. D, human resource
                                 coordination, is also incorrect.
                              2. You are the project manager of the Newton Construction Project. This project
                                 will use internal and external employees on your project team. Your project
                                 requires an electrician at month 8. This is an example of which of the following?
                                  A. Organizational interfaces
                                  B. Staffing requirements
                                  C. Contractor requirements
                                  D. Resource constraints
                                 B. Because the project requires the electrician, a project role, this is a staffing
                                 requirement. A is incorrect because it does not accurately describe the
                                 situation. C is incorrect because contractor requirements would specify the
                                 procurement issues, the minimum qualifications for the electrician, and so
                                 on. D is incorrect because a resource constraint, while a tempting choice,
                                 deals more with the availability of the resource or the requirement to use the
                                 resource.
                              3. You are the project manager of the PUY Project. This project requires a
                                 chemical engineer for seven months of the project, although there are no
                                 available chemical engineers within your department. This is an example of
                                 which of the following?
                                  A. Organizational interfaces
                                  B. Staffing requirements
                                  C. Contractor requirements
                                  D. Resource constraints
                                 B. The project needs the resource of the chemical engineer to be successful.
                                 When the project needs a resource, it is a staffing requirement. A, C, and D
                                 are all incorrect. This is not a situation describing an organizational interface
                                 or contractor requirements. Resource constraints might include a requirement
                                 to use a particular resource or that a resource must be available when certain
                                 project activities are happening.
                              4. You are the project manager in an organization with a weak matrix. Your
                                 project team will come from three different lines of business within the

                      C. Functional management
                      D. The team leader




                                                                                                                                        PART II
                     C. In a weak matrix structure, functional management will have more
                     authority than the project manager. A, B, and D are all incorrect because these
                     choices do not have as much authority on a project in a weak matrix
                     environment as functional management will have.
                   5. You are the project manager for the LMG Project. Your project will have
                      several human resource issues that must be coordinated and approved by the
                      union. Which of the following statements is correct about this scenario?
                      A. The union is considered a resource constraint.
                      B. The union is considered a management constraint.
                      C. The union is considered a project stakeholder.
                      D. The union is considered a project team member.
                     C. In this instance, the union is considered a project stakeholder because it
                     has a vested interest in the project's outcome. A is incorrect because the union
                     is not a resource constraint; they are interested in the project management
                     methodology and the project human resource management. B is incorrect
                     because the union is the counterweight to the management of the
                     organization, not to the project itself. D is also incorrect because the union is
                     not a project team member.
                   6. You are the project manager of the PLY Project. This project is similar to the
                      ACT Project you have completed. What method can you use to expedite the
                      process of organizational planning?
                      A. Use the project plan of the ACT Project on the PLY Project.
                      B. Use the roles and responsibilities defined in the ACT Project on the PLY
                         Project.
                      C. Use the project team structure of the ACT Project on the PLY Project.
                      D. Use the project team of the ACT Project on the PLY Project.
                     B. When projects are similar in nature, the project manager can use the roles
                     and responsibilities defined in the historical project to guide the current
                     project. A is incorrect because the entire project plan of the ACT Project is not
                     needed. Even the roles and responsibilities matrix of the historical project may
                     not be an exact fit for the current project. C is incorrect because copying the
                     project team structure is not the best choice of all the answers presented. D is
                     also incorrect because using the same project team may not be feasible at all.

                              7. You are the project manager in your organization. Your project is part of a
                                 larger program led by Nancy Whitting. Nancy is a believer of McGregor's
                                 Theory of X and Y. Which of the following is an example of Theory X?
                                  A. Self-led project teams
                                  B. Micromanagement
                                  C. Team members able to work on their own accord
                                  D. Earned value management
                                 B. Theory X states that workers have an inherent dislike of work and will
                                 avoid it if possible. With regard to this theory, micromanagement is a method
                                 used to make certain workers complete their work. A and C are actually
                                 examples of McGregor's Theory Y. D is incorrect because EVM is not directly
                                 related to McGregor's Theory of X and Y.
                              8. You are the project manager of the PLN Project. The team members
                                 are somewhat afraid of you as project manager because they see you as
                                 management. They know that a negative review from you about their project
                                 work will impact their yearly bonus. This is an example of which of the
                                 following?
                                  A. Formal power
                                  B. Coercive power
                                  C. Expert power
                                  D. Referent power
                                 B. When the project team is afraid of the power the project manager yields,
                                 this is called coercive power. A, C, and D are incorrect because they describe
                                 assigned, technical, and referential power over the project, respectively.
                              9. You are the project manager of the MMB Project. The president of the
                                 company has spoken to the project team and told them of the confidence
                                 and respect he has in you to lead the project to a successful completion. The
                                 project manager has what type of power on this project?
                                  A. Formal power
                                  B. Coercive power
                                  C. Expert power
                                  D. Halo power
                                 A. The company president has assigned you to the position of the project
                                 manager, so you have formal power. B is incorrect because coercive power is
                                 the fear associated with the project manager. C is incorrect because expert
                                 power is derived from the project manager's experience with the technology
                                 being implemented. D is also incorrect because halo power is not a viable
                                 answer to the question.

                                                                                                                            375
                   10. Management has approached Tyler, one of your project team members. Tyler
                       is a database administrator and developer whose work is always on time,
                       accurate, and of quality. He also has a reputation of being a "good guy" and
                       is well liked. Because of this, management has decided to move Tyler into the
                       role of a project manager for a new database administration project. This is an
                       example of which of the following?
                       A. Management by exception




                                                                                                                                          PART II
                       B. The halo effect
                       C. Management by objectives
                       D. McGregor's Theory of X and Y
                       B. The halo effect is the assumption that because the person is good at a
                       technology, he would also be good at managing a project dealing with that
                       said technology. A, C, and D are all incorrect because these do not describe
                       the halo effect.
                   11. You are the project manager of the Holson Implementation Project for your
                       company. It's come to your attention that three of your project team members
                       are in a disagreement about the direction the project work should take. This
                       disagreement is stalling the project schedule and causing the other project
                       team members to become uncomfortable. You need to resolve this situation
                       quickly and professionally. Which problem-solving technique is the best for
                       most project management situations?
                       A. Collaborating/Problem Solving
                       B. Compromising
                       C. Forcing
                       D. Avoiding
                       A. Collaborating/Problem Solving is the best problem-solving technique
                       because it meets the problem directly. B is incorrect because compromising
                       requires both sides on an argument to give up something. C is incorrect
                       because forcing requires the project manager to force a decision based on
                       external inputs, such as seniority, experience, and so on. D is also incorrect
                       because avoiding ignores the problem and does not solve it.
                   12. Harold is an outspoken project team member. All of the project team
                       members respect Harold for his experience with the technology, but often
                       things have to go in Harold's favor, otherwise the team's in for a bumpy ride.
                       During a discussion on a solution, a project team member waves her arms
                       and says, "Fine, Harold, do it your way." This is an example of which of the
                       following?
                       A. A win-win solution
                       B. A leave-lose solution




09-ch09.indd 375                                                                                                             7/12/2013 4:50:52 AM

              376
                                  C. A lose-lose solution
                                  D. A yield-lose solution
                                 D. When Harold always has to win an argument and team members begin to
                                 give in to Harold's demands simply to avoid the argument rather than finding
                                 an accurate solution, this is a yield-lose situation. A is incorrect because both
                                 parties do not win. B is incorrect because the project team member did not
                                 leave the conversation, but instead ended it. C is incorrect because a lose-lose
                                 is a compromise where both parties give up something.
                             13. You are the project manager for the GBK Project. This project affects a line of
                                 business, and the customer is anxious about the success of the project. Which
                                 of the following is likely not a top concern for the customer?
                                  A. Project priorities
                                  B. Schedule
                                  C. Cost
                                  D. Personality conflicts
                                 D. Personality conflicts are likely a concern for the customer, but are not as
                                 important as project priorities, schedule, and cost. The customer hired your
                                 company to solve the technical issues. A, B, and C are all incorrect because
                                 these are most likely the top issues for a company in a project of this
                                 magnitude.
                             14. There are several management theories that you should understand for your
                                 PMI exam and for your role as a project manager. Which theory believes that
                                 workers need to be involved with the management process?
                                  A. McGregor's Theory of X and Y
                                  B. Ouchi's Theory Z
                                  C. Herzberg's Theory of Motivation
                                  D. Expectancy Theory
                                 B. Ouchi's Theory Z states that workers need to be involved with the
                                 management process. A is incorrect because McGregor's Theory of X and Y
                                 believes that X workers don't want to work and need constant supervision,
                                 while Z workers will work if the work is challenging, satisfying, and
                                 rewarding. C is incorrect because Herzberg's Theory of Motivation describes
                                 the type of people and what excites them to work. D, the expectancy theory,
                                 describes how people will work based on what they expect in return.
                             15. You need a method to keep workers motivated and inspired on your project.
                                 This project has many conditions that the project team sees as unfavorable,
                                 but they do like you as a project manager. ___________________ states that as
                                 long as workers are rewarded, they will remain productive.

                       they expect in return. If people are rewarded because of the work they




                                                                                                                                         PART II
                       complete, and they like the reward (payment), they will continue to work. A,
                       B, and C are all incorrect because these theories do not accurately describe the
                       scenario presented.
                   16. You are the project manager for Industrial Lights Project. You have been hired
                       by your organization specifically because of your vast experience with the
                       technology and with projects of this nature. The project team is aware of your
                       experience. You likely have what type of power on this project?
                       A. Formal power
                       B. Coercive power
                       C. Expert power
                       D. Referent power
                       C. You, the project manager, have expert power on this project because of
                       your experience with the technology and with projects that are similar in
                       nature. A, B, and D are all incorrect. These project management powers do
                       not accurately describe the scenario. Formal power is appointed power.
                       Coercive power describes fear of the project manager. Referent power
                       describes power by association and personal knowledge.
                   17. You are the project manager for GHB Project. You have served as a project
                       manager for your organization for the past ten years. Practically all of your
                       projects come in on time and on budget. The project team has worked with
                       you in the past, and they consider you to be an expert project manager. They
                       also like working with you. Given all of this, you likely have what type of
                       power on this project?
                       A. Formal power
                       B. Coercive power
                       C. Expert power
                       D. Referent power
                       D. This is referent power because the project team knows the project manager
                       personally. A and B are incorrect choices because these do not describe the
                       scenario. C is incorrect because expert power does not deal with the ability to
                       lead and complete a project, but instead focuses on being an expert in the
                       technology that the project deals with.

                             18. You are the project manager for your organization and it's come to your
                                 attention that some of the project team members are in disagreement with the
                                 senior network engineer about the installation of some equipment. You need
                                 to resolve this situation quickly before the project stalls any longer. Which of
                                 the following is an example of coercive power?
                                  A. A project manager who has lunch with the project team every Thursday
                                  B. A project manager who will openly punish any team member who is late
                                     with an activity
                                  C. A project manager who has worked with the technology on the project for
                                     several years
                                  D. A project manager who is friends with all of the project team members
                                 B. Coercive power is the formal authority a project manager wields over the
                                 project team. A is incorrect because only referent power may come through
                                 lunch meetings. C is incorrect because experience is expert power. D is
                                 incorrect because interpersonal relationships are examples of referent power.
                             19. Mike is the project manager for a project with a very tight schedule. The
                                 project is running late, and Mike feels that he does not have time to consider
                                 all the possible solutions that two team members are in disagreement over.
                                 He quickly decides to go with the team member with the largest amount of
                                 seniority. This is an example of which of the following?
                                  A. Problem solving
                                  B. Compromising
                                  C. Forcing
                                  D. Withdrawal
                                 C. Forcing happens when the project manager makes a decision based on
                                 factors that are not relevant to the problem. Just because a team member has
                                 more seniority does not mean this individual is correct. A, B, and D are
                                 incorrect choices. A, problem solving, is not described in the scenario. B,
                                 compromising, happens when both parties agree to give up something. D,
                                 withdrawal, happens when a party leaves the argument.
                             20. You are a project manager in a projectized organization. Your job as a project
                                 manager can be described best by which of the following?
                                  A. Full-time
                                  B. Part-time
                                  C. Expeditor
                                  D. Coordinator
                                 A. Project managers are typically assigned to a project on a full-time basis in a
                                 projectized organization. B, C, and D do not accurately describe the work
                                 schedule of a project manager in a projectized environment.

                                                                                                                       10
                     In this chapter, you will
                        * Plan for project communications
                        * Manage project communications
                        * Control project communications




                   In the movie Cool Hand Luke, the prison captain says, "What we got here is a failure to
                   communicate." It's a famous line that has been repeated by musicians and politicians,
                   and even muttered by project managers. Hopefully, when you, the project manager,
                   quote this line, you aren't viewed as the prison captain by your project team.

                       The point is, many projects experience a breakdown in communications. It's been
                   said that 90 percent of a project manager's time is spent communicating. If you think
                   about it, this certainly makes sense. Your project plans all communicate what you're
                   going to do. Your project reports and forms communicate what you are doing or have
                   done. And all of your status meetings, ad-hoc meetings, and presentations are examples
                   of communicating.

                               Communications Formula video now.

                       Managing project communications is all about the creation, collection, distribu-
                   tion, storage, and handy retrieval of project information. It's what the project man-
                   ager does day in and day out. The project manager is at the hub of communications
                   and works with the project team, the project stakeholders, the sponsor, the vendors, and
                   often the public to send and receive communications about the project. It can be ex-
                   hausting because somebody always needs to tell you something, or you need to tell
                   somebody else something. The key, of course, is to plan how to communicate, and then
                   to share that plan and those expectations at the launch of the project.
                       This chapter discusses the three processes that project communication centers on.
                   Of course, you'll also need to know these processes to pass your Project Management
                   Institute (PMI) exam.

                         Examining the Communications Foundation
                         Communications are central to project management and, as part of communications
                         management, work with and through all of the other knowledge areas. A poor job of
                         communicating ensures that the other knowledge areas will likely suffer. Integration
                         management, which I discussed in Chapter 4, revisits us in this chapter since commu-
                         nication is the monitor of the other knowledge areas and serves as the vehicle for re-
                         porting information on these other facets of project management.

                         Communication Factors
                         In the Project Management Body of Knowledge's (PMBOK) introduction to Chapter
                         10, some interesting tips and terms sneak into the chapter that you'll likely see on your
                         PMI examination. The first foundation you've got to know in regard to project com-
                         munications is some of the skills a project manager uses to communicate. Consider
                         the following:

                              * Sender-receiver models These are feedback loops and barriers to
                                communications. Your project status meeting is a great example of a feedback
                                loop because all of your project team members hear what the other team
                                members say, offer feedback to the speaker, hear the speaker respond, and so
                                on. Basically, a feedback loop is a conversation between one or more speakers
                                centering on one specific topic. A barrier to communication is anything that
                                prevents communication from occurring at optimum levels. For example, if
                                you and I are on the same project team but we're mad at each other, we're not
                                going to communicate effectively--if at all.
                              * Choice of media The best modality to use when communicating is the
                                one that is relevant to the information that's being communicated. Some
                                communications demand a formal report, whereas others only warrant a
                                phone call, a face-to-face meeting, or a few sentences on a sticky note. The
                                right medium is dictated by what needs to be communicated.
                              * Writing style You don't have to be E.B. White to write effectively (look at
                                me!). You should, however, be conscious of the message you want to
                                communicate, and choose the appropriate writing style.
                              * Presentation techniques Some people cannot stand to be in front of an
                                audience, but as a project manager, they often find themselves having to
                                present project news and status. The presentation techniques, such as
                                confidence, body language, and visual aids, promote or distract from the
                                message the presenter is offering to the audience.

                                                                                                                              381
                        * Meeting management techniques Ever attend a WOT meeting? That's a
                          "waste of time" meeting. Meetings should have an agenda and order, and
                          someone needs to keep the meeting minutes for the project.


                   Understanding the Communication Model
                   The second foundation that is tucked into the introduction of Chapter 10 of the PM-




                                                                                                                                            PART II
                   BOK is the communication model. As you can see in Figure 10-1, the model demon-
                   strates how communication moves from one person to another. I like to think of each
                   portion of the model as a fax machine to visualize all the components. Take a look:

                       * Sender This is the person who wants to send the message. Let's say I want to
                         fax you a contract.
                        * Encoder This is the device that encodes the message to be sent. My fax
                          machine is the encoder.
                        * Medium This is the device or technology that transports the message. The
                          telephone line is the medium between our fax machines.
                        * Decoder This is the device that decodes the message as it is being received.
                          Your fax machine is the decoder.
                        * Receiver This is the person who receives the message. You receive my fax, jot
                          a note to me, and then send it back through your fax machine to mine. When

                        * Noise Anything that interferes with or disrupts the message. It's possible that
                          static on the phone line may distort the fax message between the two fax
                          machines.

                      You'll likely see some of this business on your PMI exam. However, throughout this
                   chapter, this model affects how communication happens between people.

                         Planning for Communications
                         As expected, effective communications begin with effective planning. The point of
                         planning for communications is to determine and answer five fundamental project
                         management questions:

                              * Who needs what information?
                              * When do they need the information?
                              * In what modality is the information needed?
                              * Who will provide the information?
                              * Who should have access to the information?

                             Communication planning, although it comes late in this book and in the PMBOK
                         Guide, is actually done very early in the project planning processes. It's essential to an-
                         swer the previous questions as early as possible because their outcomes can affect the
                         remainder of the project planning. Throughout the project, updates to communica-
                         tions planning are expected. Even the responses to the five project management com-
                         munication questions can change as stakeholders, project team members, vendors, and
                         other project interfaces change.

                         Preparing for Communications
                         The outputs of the communications planning process are the communications man-
                         agement plan and project document updates. The communications management plan
                         answers in detail the five questions previously mentioned and provides information on
                         communication requirements, expectations, and timings. When the project manage-
                         ment team begins to plan for communications in their project and answer those five
                         essential questions, they've got four inputs they'll rely on, which the following sections
                         describe.

                         Using Enterprise Environmental Factors
                         Many of the communications management processes are linked to the enterprise envi-
                         ronmental factors. Enterprise environmental factors that affect project communications
                         planning are:

                              * Organizational culture and structure
                              * Standards and regulations the project must comply with
                              * The logistics and organizational infrastructure
                              * The human resources the project will rely on and interact with
                              * The policies and procedures for personnel administration
                              * The project's work authorization system
                              * The marketplace conditions

                   Using Organizational Process Assets
                   The organizational process assets affect how the project manager, the project team, and




                                                                                                                                               PART II
                   the stakeholders will communicate within a project. The primary organizational pro-
                   cess assets that affect communication are:

                       * Standards and policies unique to the organization
                        * Organizational guidelines, work instructions, and performance measurement
                          criteria
                        * Organizational communication requirements for all projects, considering
                          required and approved technology, security issues, archiving, and allowed
                          communication media
                        * Project closure requirements
                        * Financial controls and procedures
                        * Issue and defect management procedures for all projects
                        * Change control procedures
                        * Risk control procedures
                        * Work authorization systems
                        * Process measurement databases
                        * Project file structure, organization, and retention
                        * Historical information and lessons learned requirements
                        * Issue and defect management databases
                        * Configuration management databases
                        * Project financial databases detailing labor hours, costs, budget issues, and cost
                          overruns

                   Relying on the Stakeholder Register
                   The stakeholder register defines whom you'll communicate with. Based on the stake-
                   holder register and the stakeholder analysis you've completed, you'll know which stake-
                   holders are most interested in your project and how much influence they have over
                   your project. For each stakeholder, you should know:

                       * The interest in the project
                        * The influence over the project
                        * Strategies for gaining stakeholder support

                             This information can be sensitive, so it's important for the project manager to guard
                         this information and share it only with the people who need to know this information.
                         In other words, you don't want to document how much of a pain the IT director is and
                         then post it on your blog. While it's important to create a definitive strategy for manag-
                         ing stakeholders' fears, threats, concerns, and objections, it's just as important to guard
                         the strategy from reaching the wrong people in your organization.

                                       EXAM COACH Most project managers are good communicators to begin
                                       with.You're probably going to do fine on this exam topic if you do fine in your
                                       role as project manager, but don't let your guard down. Pay attention to the
                                       terms and communications management plan in this chapter. These may be
                                       things you don't use in your day-to-day role as a project manager, but you'll
                                       find them on your exam. Keep positive communications with yourself.You can
                                       pass this exam!

                         Identifying Communication Requirements
                         The project manager and the project team work together to identify who needs what
                         information. In other words, the project management team needs to know what the
                         requirements for successful communications are in order to plan how to achieve those
                         requirements.
                             Stakeholders will need different types of information, depending on their interest
                         in the project and the priority of the project. The project manager will need to complete
                         an analysis of the identified stakeholders to determine what information they actually
                         need, as well as how often the information is needed.
                             There is no value in expending resources on generating information, reports, and
                         analyses for stakeholders who have no interest in the information. An accurate assess-
                         ment of stakeholders' needs for information is required early in the project planning
                         processes. As a rule of thumb, provide information when its presence contributes to
                         success or when a lack of information can contribute to failure.
                             The project manager and the project team can identify the demand for communica-
                         tions using the following:

                              * Organization charts
                              * The project structure within the performing organization
                              * Stakeholder responsibility relationships
                              * Departments and disciplines involved with the project work
                              * The number of individuals involved in the project and their locales
                              * Internal and external information needs
                              * Stakeholder information

                       On the Certified Associate in Project Management (CAPM) and Project Manage-
                   ment Professional (PMP) exams, and in the real world, the project manager will need
                   to identify the number of communication channels within a project. Here's a magic
                   formula to calculate the number of communication channels: N(N - 1)/2, where N
                   represents the number of identified stakeholders. For example, if a project has ten stake-
                   holders, the formula would read 10(10 - 1)/2, for a total of 45 communication chan-
                   nels. Figure 10-2 illustrates the formula.




                                                                                                                                                PART II
                                  EXAM TIP Know this formula: N(N - 1)/2, where N represents the number
                                  of stakeholders. It's easy, and you'll probably encounter it on the PMP exam.

                   Exploring Communication Technologies
                   Let's face it: A project manager and a project team can use many different avenues to
                   communicate. Project teams can effectively communicate through hallway meetings or
                   formal project status meetings. Information can be transferred from stakeholder to
                   stakeholder through anything from written notes to complex online databases and
                   tracking systems.
                       As part of the communications planning, the project manager should identify all of
                   the required and approved methods of communicating. Some projects may be highly
                   sensitive and contain classified information that not all stakeholders are privy to, while
                   other projects may contain information that's open for anyone to explore. Whatever the
                   case, the project manager should identify what requirements exist, if any, for the com-
                   munication modalities.
                       Communication modalities can also include meetings, reports, memos, e-mails,
                   and so on. The project manager should identify the preferred methods of communicat-
                   ing based on the conditions of the message to be communicated. Consider the follow-
                   ing, which may have an effect on the communications plan:

                        * Urgency of the information When the information is communicated can
                          often be as important as what's being communicated. For some projects,
                          information should be readily available, while other projects are less
                          demanding.

                   Communication
                   channels can be

                   simple formula.

                              * Technology Because of the demands of the project, technology changes may
                                be needed to fulfill the project request. For example, the project may require
                                an internal web site that details project progress. If such a web site does not
                                exist, time and monies will need to be invested into this communication
                                requirement. Also consider that some technologies you're currently using on
                                the project may be replaced by newer, better communication technologies.
                                That's right, the length of the project can influence the project technology.
                              * Ease of use The communication tool(s) that's selected for the project should
                                be easy to use, have training available if necessary, and be widely available for
                                all of the project team to utilize. You can imagine the frustration if the project
                                team is required to use a particular tool and that tool is difficult to use by the
                                project team.
                              * Project environment How a team communicates often depends on its
                                structure. Consider a co-located team versus a virtual team. Each type can be
                                effective, but there will be differing communication demands for each type
                                of team.
                              * Protecting the information Some of the information that's available in the
                                project will likely be sensitive and confidential. Pay grades, contracts, team
                                member discipline, and even stakeholder management will be confidential
                                and not all stakeholders should see this information. You'll need to take steps
                                to protect this information during and after the project. You'll also need to
                                determine the most appropriate method to communicate this sensitive
                                information.

                              There are loads of ways that communication can happen: e-mail, faxes, text mes-
                         saging, web technologies--and new ways of communicating are being created all the
                         time. Just think of all the new technologies that can help your project team communi-
                         cate that didn't exist just a few years ago. While all these new methods of communicat-
                         ing have been created, they're still part of the basic communication model. And when
                         you consider all of the different ways to communicate, you'll still find all communica-
                         tion falls into one of three categories:

                              * Interactive communication This is the most common and most effective
                                approach to communication. It's where two or more people exchange
                                information. Consider status meetings, ad-hoc meetings, phone calls, and
                                videoconferences.
                              * Push communication This approach pushes the information from the
                                sender to the receiver without any real acknowledgment that the information
                                was really received or understood. Consider letters, faxes, voicemail messages,
                                e-mails, and other communication modalities in which the sender packages
                                and sends information to the receivers through some intermediary network.
                              * Pull communication This approach pulls the information from a central
                                repository, like a database of information. Pull communications are good for

                                                                                                                              387
                          large groups of stakeholders who want to access project information at their
                          discretion. Consider a project web site where stakeholders can periodically
                          drop by for a quick update on the project status.


                   Creating the Communications Management Plan
                   Based on stakeholder analysis, the project manager and the project team can determine




                                                                                                                                            PART II
                   what communications are needed. There's no advantage to supplying stakeholders with
                   information that isn't needed or desired, and the time spent creating and delivering
                   such information is a waste of resources.
                       A communications management plan can organize and document the process,
                   types, and expectations of communications. It provides the following:

                       * The stakeholder communications requirements in order to communicate the
                         appropriate information as demanded by the stakeholders.
                        * Information on what is to be communicated. This plan includes the expected
                          format, content, and detail--think project reports versus quick e-mail updates.
                        * Details on how needed information flows through the project to the correct
                          individuals. The communication structure documents where the information
                          will originate, to whom the information will be sent, and in what modality
                          the information is acceptable.
                        * Appropriate methods for communicating include e-mails, memos, reports,
                          and even press releases.
                        * Schedules of when the various types of communication should occur. Some
                          communications, such as status meetings, should happen on a regular
                          schedule, while other communications may be prompted by conditions
                          within the project.
                        * Escalation processes and time frames for moving issues upward in the
                          organization when they can't be solved at lower levels.
                        * Instructions on how the communications management plan can be updated
                          as the project progresses.
                        * A project glossary.
                        * Identification of the stakeholder who will communicate specific project
                          information.
                        * Identification of the stakeholder responsible for managing, controlling, and
                          releasing confidential project information.
                        * Schedule, budget, and resource allocation for communication activities.
                        * Communication constraints such as technology, regulations, policies, and
                          other enterprise environmental factors.

                             The communications management plan may also include information and guide-
                         lines for project status meetings, team meetings, e-meetings (that's electronic meetings,
                         not meetings about the letter e), and even e-mail. Setting expectations for communica-
                         tions and meetings early in the project establishes guidelines for the project team and
                         stakeholders.


                         Managing Project Communications
                         Now that the project's communications management plan has been created, it's time to
                         execute it. Managing project communications is the process of ensuring that the proper
                         stakeholders get the appropriate information when and how they need it. Essentially,
                         it's the implementation of the communications management plan. This plan details
                         how the information is to be created and dispersed, and also how the dispersed infor-
                         mation is archived.

                         Examining Communication Skills
                         Here's a newsflash: Communication skills are used to send and receive information.
                         Sounds easy, right? If communication is so easy, then why do so many problems on
                         projects stem from misunderstandings, miscommunications, failures to communicate,
                         and similar communication failings? Communication skills are part of the project
                         manager's arsenal of general management skills--basically, it's delivering on the prom-
                         ise that the right stakeholders will get the right information at the right time. General
                         management skills, in regard to project communications, are also about managing
                         stakeholder requirements.
                             In the communication model that your PMI exam will quiz you on, it's the sender's
                         responsibility to make the message clear, complete, and concise so that the recipient
                         can receive it. The sender must also confirm that the recipient truly understands the
                         information. Have you ever been in a project team meeting where a team member im-
                         plied he understood the message that was being sent, but later proved that he really
                         didn't understand what was being sent?

                                       EXAM TIP Face-to-face meetings, like those in ad-hoc meetings, are ideal for
                                       project communications.

                             Communication happens when information is transferred from one party to an-
                         other. Transmission of a message is just like a radio signal--it's transmitting, but there's
                         no evidence that anyone is actually picking up the signal. Along these same lines, the
                         acknowledgment of a message means that the receiver has indeed received the message,
                         but she may not necessarily agree with the message that has been sent.

                                                                                                                               389
                   Examining Communication Factors and Technologies
                   The most common type of communication between a sender and a receiver is verbal
                   communication. When verbal communications are involved, the project manager
                   should remember that half of communication is listening. This means that the project
                   manager must confirm that the receiver understands the message being sent. The con-
                   firmation of the sent message can be seen in the recipient's body language, feedback,
                   and verbal confirmation of the sent message. Five terms are used to describe the process




                                                                                                                                             PART II
                   of communicating:

                        * Paralingual The pitch, tone, and inflections in the sender's voice affect the
                          message being sent.
                         * Feedback The sender confirms that the receiver understands the message by
                           directly asking for a response, questions for clarification, or other
                           confirmation of the sent message.
                         * Active listening The receiver confirms that the message is being received
                           through feedback, questions, prompts for clarity, and other signs of
                           confirmation.
                         * Effective listening The receiver is involved in the listening experience by
                           paying attention to visual cues from the speaker and paralingual
                           characteristics and also by asking relevant questions.
                         * Nonverbal It's been said that approximately 55 percent of communication
                           is nonverbal. Facial expressions, hand gestures, and body language contribute
                           to the message.

                       As pictured in Figure 10-3, the words in an oral message actually only account for
                   7 percent of the message. The tonality of the message accounts for 38 percent of the
                   message. The remaining 55 percent is body language. A classic example involves a
                   person talking to a dog. If the person has a friendly voice and posture, the dog will
                   likely be receptive. However, if the person has a mean voice and guarded posture, the
                   dog may feel threatened and on guard. When project managers talk with stakeholders,
                   they must be aware of their body language and posture--not just the words they are
                   communicating.


                   Figure 10-3
                   The words used in
                   communication are
                   only a small portion
                   of a message.

                             The medium in communication can help or hinder the message. For example, when
                         a project manager talks to a stakeholder in person, the stakeholder has the advantage
                         not only of hearing the message and tone, but also of seeing the body language. Re-
                         move body language from a conversation, and the message is interpreted by just the
                         words and tonality. Always be aware of the downsides of various non-direct communi-
                         cation modalities: e-mail, reports, memos, and letters.

                         Creating Information Management Systems
                         What good is information if no one can find it? An information management system
                         allows for fast and accurate access to project information. It can be a simple manual
                         filing system, an advanced database of information storage, or a robust project manage-
                         ment software suite. Whatever the approach, the information must be accessible, orga-
                         nized, and secure.
                              Project information can be hard-copy, printed information--like letters, reports, and
                         brochures from vendors. You will also have electronic information such as e-mails, voice-
                         mails, videos, web resources, and even text messages. Your project may also rely on proj-
                         ect management tools that are software-based for project organization, communication
                         among the project team, and interfaces with stakeholders. All of this information and
                         how it's sorted, stored, and retrieved is part of the information management system.
                              The project team, the project manager, the customer, and other stakeholders may
                         need access to design specs, blueprints, plans, and other project information. A good
                         information retrieval system is reliable, easy to navigate, and updated as new informa-
                         tion becomes available.

                         Distributing Information
                         Throughout the project, the project manager, project sponsor, project team, and other
                         stakeholders are going to need to supply information to one another. The methods for
                         distributing information can vary, but the best modality is the one that's most appro-
                         priate to the information being conveyed. In other words, an e-mail may not be the
                         correct format in which to share variance information regarding project costs.
                             Information can be distributed through some of the following methods, given proj-
                         ect demands and available technology:

                   Creating Lessons Learned
                   Do you ever wish you could travel back in time? With lessons learned, you almost can.
                   The whole point of lessons learned is to improve future projects by sharing what was
                   learned during the current project.
                       A lessons learned session is completed with the project manager, the project team,
                   and key stakeholders to identify lessons they've learned in the technical, managerial, and
                   project processes. Think of it: You're helping other project managers in the future by




                                                                                                                                              PART II
                   documenting what works and what doesn't in your project.
                       Lessons learned should happen throughout the project, not just at the project's
                   conclusion. As a project moves through each phase, project managers can use a lessons
                   learned session as a good team-building exercise. This means documenting and learn-
                   ing from what worked and what didn't within the project.

                   Examining the Results of Communications Management
                   Communications management results in the following:

                        * Lessons learned When lessons learned sessions are completed, they're
                          available to be used and applied. They are now part of the organizational
                          process assets.
                        * Project records All project communications are also part of the
                          organizational process assets. This includes e-mails, memos, letters, and faxes.
                          In some instances, the project team can also contribute by keeping their
                          records in a project notebook.
                        * Project reports Reports are formal communications on project activities,
                          their status, and conditions. Management, customers, and policies within the
                          performing organization may have differing requirements for when reports
                          are required.
                        * Project presentations Presentations are useful in providing information to
                          customers, management, the project team, and other stakeholders. The
                          delivery and degree of formality of the presentation should be appropriate for
                          the conditions and information being delivered within the project.
                        * Feedback from stakeholders Stakeholders are usually happy to offer
                          their feedback on the project performance. Project managers should
                          document this feedback and apply it to improve the project's performance.
                        * Stakeholder notifications As the project rolls along, there undoubtedly will
                          be notifications to the stakeholders about resolved issues, approved changes,
                          and the overall health of the project. This information should be kept for
                          future reference.

                         Controlling Communications
                         Throughout the project, customers and other stakeholders are going to need updates
                         on the project performance, work status, and project information. The work perfor-
                         mance information--the status of what's been completed and what's left to do--is al-
                         ways at the heart of performance reporting. Stakeholders want to be kept abreast of
                         how the project is performing, but also what issues, risks, and conditions in the project
                         have evolved.
                              Controlling communication is the process of following the communications man-
                         agement plan, distributing information, and sharing how the project is performing.
                         Performance reporting is the process of collecting, organizing, and disseminating infor-
                         mation on how project resources are being used to complete the project objectives. In
                         other words, the people footing the bill and who are affected by the outcome of the
                         project need some confirmation that things are going the way the project manager has
                         promised.
                              Based on changing conditions within the project, the project manager and team
                         may need to go back to communications planning, update the communications man-
                         agement plan, and then manage communications accordingly. At the heart of control-
                         ling communications is performance reporting. Performance reporting covers more
                         than just cost and schedule, although these are the most common concerns. Another
                         huge issue is the influence of risks on the project's success. The project manager and the
                         project team must continue to monitor and evaluate risks, including pending risks and
                         their impact on the project's success.
                              Another major concern with reporting is the level of quality. No one will praise the
                         project manager and the project team for completing the project on time and on budget
                         if the quality of the work is unacceptable. In fact, the project could be declared a failure
                         and canceled as a result of poor quality, or the project team may be forced to redo the
                         work, business could be lost, or individuals could even be harmed as a result of the poor
                         quality of the project work.

                         Examining the Tools for Controlling Communications
                         Stakeholders expect you to keep them abreast of the project's performance, issues, con-
                         ditions, changes, risk, and other concerns about the project. You'll utilize three tools to
                         control communications, but understand that you, the project manager, being involved
                         and available is the strongest asset for communications. The three tools you'll use are:

                              * Reporting systems You'll need some tool, probably part of your project
                                management information system, to collect, assemble, and generate
                                information about the project. You could use a simple spreadsheet, but the
                                collection of project information is going to be more cumbersome, while
                                a large, complex PMIS requires the knowledge and skill of both the project
                                manager and the project team to use it effectively.
                              * Expert judgment One of the best tools and techniques you can use is to rely
                                on the expertise of others. Experts, such as the project team, stakeholders, and

                           communications. These experts can help you ensure that your message is
                           timely, appropriate, and on-target with the correct stakeholders.
                        * Meetings Meetings allow the project manager, the project team,
                          stakeholders, and experts to have conversations about the project.
                          Communication meetings can help you and the stakeholder determine if the
                          current communication approach is working or if there should be refinements




                                                                                                                                              PART II
                          to how you and the stakeholders communicate.


                   Reviewing Project Performance
                   The project manager will host performance review meetings to ascertain the progress
                   and level of success the project team is having with the project work. Performance re-
                   view meetings focus on the work that has been completed and how the work results are
                   living up to the time and cost estimates. In addition, the project manager and the proj-
                   ect team will evaluate the project scope to protect it from change and creep. The project
                   manager and the project team will also examine quality and its effect on the project as
                   a whole. Finally, the project manager must lead a discussion on pending or past risks,
                   and then determine any new risks, as well as the overall risk likelihood and its potential
                   impact on the project's success.

                   Analyzing Project Variances
                   Performance review meetings are not the only tools the project manager uses to as-
                   sess project performance. Prior to the performance reviews, or spurred by a perfor-
                   mance review, the project manager needs to examine the time, scope, quality, and
                   cost variances within the project. The project manager will examine the estimates
                   supplied for the time and cost of activities and compare it with the time and cost ac-
                   tually experienced.
                       The goals of analyzing project variances include the following:

                        * Prevent future variances.
                        * Determine the root cause of variances.
                        * Determine if the variances are an anomaly or if the estimates were flawed.
                        * Determine if the variances are within a predetermined acceptable range, such
                          as -10 percent or +5 percent.
                        * Determine if the variances can be expected on future project work.

                       In addition to examining the time and cost variances, which are the most common,
                   the project manager must examine any scope, resource, and quality variances. A change
                   in the scope can skew time and cost predictions. A variance in resources, such as the
                   expected performance by a given resource, can alter the project schedule and even
                   the predicted costs of a project. Quality variances may result in rework, lost time, lost
                   monies, and even the rejection of the project product.

              394
                                       EXAM TIP Performance reporting is often based on the results of earned
                                       value management (EVM). See Chapter 7 for detailed information on how to
                                       calculate EVM.

                         Examining the Results of Controlling Communications
                         The goal of controlling communications is to share information regarding the project's
                         performance with the appropriate stakeholders and to improve upon the established
                         communication process. Of course, performance reporting is not something done only
                         at the end of the project or after a project phase. Instead, it is done according to a regu-
                         lar schedule, as detailed in the communications plan or as project conditions warrant.
                         There are five outputs of controlling communications:

                              * Performance reports These are the results and summation of the project
                                performance analysis. The communications management plan will detail the
                                type of report needed, based on the conditions within the project, the timing
                                of the communication, and the demands of the project stakeholder.
                              * Change requests Performance results may prompt change requests to some
                                areas of the project. The change requests should flow into the change control
                                system (CCS) for consideration and then be approved or denied.
                              * Project document updates Will the project end on schedule? Will the
                                project be on budget? How much longer will it take to complete the project?
                                And how much more money will this project need to finish? Earned value
                                management can answer many of these questions for the project management
                                team. You'll update the appropriate project documents based on the
                                conditions within the project.
                              * Project management plan updates You may have to edit the project
                                management plan based on the outcome of this process. Stakeholder
                                communication preferences may change, interests on different project areas
                                can change, and reactions to how the information is sent may also prompt
                                updates to the project management plan.
                              * Organizational process assets updates Controlling communications may
                                create lessons learned, templates, reporting formats, and other assets that
                                could be used in other projects.


                         Chapter Summary
                         Communication is a project manager's most important skill. Project managers have to
                         communicate with management, customers, the project team members, and the rest of
                         the stakeholders involved with the project. The project manager's foundation is com-
                         munication. Without effective communication, how will work get completed, progress
                         reported, and information dispersed?

                                                                                                                                395
                       Communications planning centers on asking, "Who needs what information and
                   when do they need it?" Consider all of the different channels for communication on
                   any project. There are many different possibilities for information to be lost, messages
                   to be skewed, and progress to be hindered. The formula for calculating the communica-
                   tion channels is N(N - 1)/2, where N represents the number of stakeholders. As a gen-
                   eral rule, larger projects require more detail--and detail means more planning for
                   communications.




                                                                                                                                              PART II
                       The communications management plan organizes and documents the communica-
                   tion processes, acceptable modalities for types of communication, and the stakeholder
                   expectations for communication. The plan should detail how information is gathered,
                   organized, accessed, and dispersed. The plan should also provide a schedule of ex-
                   pected communication based on a calendar schedule, such as project status meetings.
                   Some communications are prompted by conditions within the project, such as cost
                   variances, schedule variances, or other performance-related issues.

                   Key Terms
                   Acknowledgment The receiver signals that the message has been received. An ac-
                   knowledgment shows receipt of the message, but not necessarily agreement with the
                   message.
                   Active listening The receiver confirms that the message is being received through
                   feedback, questions, prompts for clarity, and other signs of confirmation.
                   Choice of media The best modality to use when communicating that is relevant to
                   the information being communicated.
                   Communication assumptions Anything that the project management team believes
                   to be true but hasn't proven to be true. For example, the project management team may
                   assume that all of the project team can be reached via cell phone, but parts of the world,
                   as of this writing, don't have a cell signal.
                   Communication barrier       Anything that prohibits communication from occurring.
                   Communication channels formula N(N - 1)/2, where N represents the number of
                   identified stakeholders. This formula reveals the total number of communication chan-
                   nels within a project.
                   Communication constraints Anything that limits the project management team's
                   options. When it comes to communication constraints, geographical locales, incom-
                   patible communications software, and even limited communications technology can
                   constrain the project team.
                   Communications management plan A project management subsidiary plan that de-
                   fines the stakeholders who need specific information, the person who will supply the
                   information, the schedule for the information to be supplied, and the approved modal-
                   ity to provide the information.
                   Cost reporting system     A system to record the actual costs of the project activities.

                         Decoder     The device that decodes a message as it is being received.
                         Effective listening The receiver is involved in the listening experience by paying atten-
                         tion to visual cues from the speaker and paralingual characteristics, and by asking rel-
                         evant questions.
                         Encoder The device that encodes the message being sent.
                         Feedback The sender confirms that the receiver understands the message by directly
                         asking for a response, questions for clarification, or other confirmation.
                         Influence/impact grid Stakeholders are mapped on a grid based on their influence
                         over the project in relation to their influence over the project execution.
                         Information presentation tools A software package that allows the project manage-
                         ment team to present the project's health through graphics, spreadsheets, and text.
                         (Think of Microsoft Project.)
                         Information retrieval system A system to quickly and effectively store, archive, and
                         access project information.
                         Interactive communication This is the most common and most effective approach to
                         communication. It's where two or more people exchange information. Consider status
                         meetings, ad-hoc meetings, phone calls, and videoconferences.
                         Lessons learned This is documentation of what did and did not work in the project
                         implementation. Lessons learned documentation is created throughout the project by
                         the entire project team. When lessons learned sessions are completed, they're available
                         to be used and applied by the entire organization. They are now part of the organiza-
                         tional process assets.
                         Medium The device or technology that transports a message.
                         Noise    Anything that interferes with or disrupts a message.
                         Nonverbal Facial expressions, hand gestures, and body language are nonverbal
                         cues that contribute to a message. Approximately 55 percent of communication is
                         nonverbal.
                         Paralingual The pitch, tone, and inflections in the sender's voice affecting the mes-
                         sage being sent.
                         Performance report A report that depicts how well a project is performing. Often, the
                         performance report is based on earned value management and may include cost or
                         schedule variance reports.
                         Project presentations Presentations are useful in providing information to custom-
                         ers, management, the project team, and other stakeholders.
                         Project records All the business of the project communications is also part of the
                         organizational process assets. This includes e-mails, memos, letters, and faxes.
                         Project reports Reports are formal communications on project activities, their status,
                         and conditions.

                   Pull communication This approach pulls the information from a central repository,
                   like a database of information. Pull communications are good for large groups of
                   stakeholders who want to access project information at their discretion. Consider a
                   project web site where stakeholders can periodically drop by for a quick update on
                   the project status.
                   Push communication This approach pushes the information from the sender to the
                   receiver without any real acknowledgment that the information was really received or




                                                                                                                                              PART II
                   understood. Consider letters, faxes, voicemail messages, e-mails, and other communi-
                   cations modalities that the sender packages and sends to receivers through some inter-
                   mediary network.
                   Receiver    The person who receives the message.
                   Sender     The person who is sending the message.
                   Sender-receiver models     Feedback loops and barriers to communications.
                   Stakeholder notifications Notices to the stakeholders about resolved issues, ap-
                   proved changes, and the overall health of the project.
                   Status review meeting A regularly scheduled meeting to discuss the status of the proj-
                   ect and its progress toward completing the project scope statement.
                   Time reporting system A system to record the actual time to complete project activities.

                                 the timing of some of the project management processes. In particular,
                                 Gary doesn't understand the concept, purpose, and timing of the lessons
                                 learned documentation. He asks for your help. When does lessons learned
                                 identification take place?

                                 hired you as a project management consultant. Gary is confused about the
                                 timing of some of the project management processes. He now has a good
                                 understanding of the lessons learned purpose, but he's still confused about
                                 why you've recommended that the project team participate in the lessons
                                 learned documentation, too. Why should a project team complete lessons
                                 learned documentation?
                                  A. To ensure project closure

                       three different countries. As part of your communications management plan
                       you've scheduled face-to-face meetings with the project team and you're




                                                                                                                                         PART II
                       utilizing web conferencing software for the virtual team. Based on this
                       information, the process of sending information from the project manager to

                       considers the relationship between himself and the customer to be of utmost
                       importance. Which one of the following is a valid reason for George's belief in
                       the importance of this relationship?
                       A. The customer will complete George's performance evaluation. A poor
                          communication model between George and the customer will affect his
                          project bonus.
                       B. The customer is not familiar with project management. George must
                          educate the customer about the process.
                       C. The customer is always right.
                       D. The communication between the customer and George can convey the
                          project objectives more clearly than can the language in the project
                          contract.

                         Questions and Answers
                              1. You are the project manager of the BlueSky Network Upgrade Project. You
                                 have 15 project team members and you're speaking with them about the
                                 importance of communication. You show them the communication model
                                 and give examples of each of the components of the model. One of the
                                 project team members asks for an example of noise. Of the following, which
                                 one is an example of noise?
                                  A. Fax machine
                                  B. Ad-hoc conversations
                                  C. Contractual agreements
                                  D. Distance
                                 D. Noise is anything that interferes with the transmission and understanding
                                 of the message. Distance is an example of noise. A, a fax machine, is an
                                 example of a decoder. B is incorrect because ad-hoc conversations are
                                 informal conversations. C, contractual agreements, are a type of formal
                                 communication.
                              2. You are the project manager for the JHG Project. Management has requested
                                 that you create a document detailing what information will be expected
                                 from stakeholders and to whom that information will be disseminated.
                                 Management is asking for which one of the following?
                                  A. The roles and responsibilities matrix
                                  B. The scope management plan
                                  C. The communications management plan
                                  D. The communications worksheet
                                 C. Management is requesting a communications management plan, which
                                 details the requirements and expectations for communicating information
                                 among the project stakeholders. A is incorrect because a roles and
                                 responsibilities matrix depicts who does what and who makes which
                                 decisions. B, the scope management plan, is also incorrect because this plan
                                 explains how changes to the scope may be allowed, depending on the
                                 circumstances. D is not a valid choice for the question.
                              3. Which of the following will help you, the project manager, complete the
                                 needed communications management plan by identifying the stakeholders'
                                 communication needs?
                                  A. Identification of all communication channels
                                  B. Formal documentation of all communication channels
                                  C. Formal documentation of all stakeholders
                                  D. Lessons learned from previous similar projects

                                                                                                                          403
                     D. Lessons learned and historical information from a previous project are
                     ideal inputs to communications planning. A, B, and C are incorrect because
                     these choices do not fully answer the question. Lessons learned from
                     previous, similar projects are the best tool to identify stakeholders'
                     requirements for communication.
                   4. You are the project manager for the JGI Project. You have 32 stakeholders on
                      this project. How many communication channels do you have?




                                                                                                                                        PART II
                      A. Depends on the number of project team members
                      B. 496
                      C. 32
                     D. 1
                     B. Using the formula N(N - 1)/2, where N represents the number of
                     stakeholders, gives us 496 communication channels. A, C, and D are
                     incorrect. These values do not reflect the number of communication channels
                     on the project.
                   5. You are the project manager for the KLN Project. You had 19 stakeholders on
                      this project and have added three team members to the project. How many
                      more communication channels do you have now compared with before?
                      A. 171
                      B. 231
                      C. 60
                     D. 1
                     C. This is a tough question, but typical of the CAPM and PMP exams. The
                     question asks how many more communication channels exist. You'll have to
                     calculate the new value, which is 231, and then subtract the original value,
                     which is 171, for a total of 60 new channels. A is incorrect because 171 is the
                     original number of communication channels. B is incorrect because this value
                     reflects the new number of communication channels. D is not a valid choice.
                   6. A memo has been sent to you, the project manager, the project team
                      members, and the project customers from the project sponsor. In this
                      instance, who is the sender?
                      A. The project sponsor
                      B. The project manager
                      C. The project team members
                     D. The project customers
                     A. The project sponsor is the source of the memo, since this is the sender of
                     the message. B, C, and D are all recipients of the memo, not the sender, so
                     they cannot be the source of the message.

                              7. Beth is a project manager for her organization and she is working with the
                                 stakeholders to develop a communications management plan. She wants to
                                 acknowledge the assumptions and constraints in the project. Which one of
                                 the following is an example of a project communication constraint?
                                  A. Ad-hoc conversations
                                  B. Demands for formal reports
                                  C. Stakeholder management
                                  D. Team members in different geographical locales
                                 D. Team members who are not located physically close together can be a
                                 communications constraint, since it can be tougher to communicate when
                                 distance between team members exists. A, B, and C are all incorrect because
                                 these are not project communications constraints.
                              8. Project managers can present project information in many different ways.
                                 Which one of the following is not a method a project manager can use to
                                 present project performance?
                                  A. Histograms
                                  B. S-curves
                                  C. Bar charts
                                  D. RACI charts
                                 D. RACI charts do not show project performance, but instead accountability
                                 of the resources involved in the project. A, B, and C are incorrect because
                                 these choices do present project performance.
                              9. There are many terms that you'll need to know for your PMI examination that
                                 deal with project communications. Of the following, which term describes the
                                 pitch and tone of an individual's voice?
                                  A. Paralingual
                                  B. Feedback
                                  C. Effective listening
                                  D. Active listening
                                 A. Paralingual is a term used to describe the pitch and tone of a voice. B,
                                 feedback, is a request to confirm the information sent in the conversation. C,
                                 effective listening, is the ability to understand the message through what is
                                 said, through facial expressions, gestures, tone, pitch, and so on. D, active
                                 listening, is the process of confirming what is understood and asking for
                                 clarification when needed.
                             10. You are the project manager of the KMH Project. This project is slated to last
                                 eight years. You have just calculated EVM and have a cost variance (CV) of

                                                                                Chapter 10: Managing Project Communications

                                                                                                                            405
                       -$3,500, which is outside of the acceptable thresholds for your project. What
                       type of report is needed for management?
                       A. Progress report
                       B. Forecast report
                       C. Exception report
                       D. Trends report




                                                                                                                                          PART II
                       C. An exception report is typically completed when variances exceed a given
                       limit. A is incorrect. Progress reports describe the progress of the project or
                       phase. B is incorrect because this is not a valid answer. D, a trends report, is
                       an analysis of project trends over time.
                   11. You are presenting your project performance to your key stakeholders. Several
                       of the stakeholders are receiving phone calls during your presentation, and
                       this is distracting people from your message. This is an example of what?
                       A. Noise
                       B. Negative feedback
                       C. Outside communications
                       D. Message distracter
                       A. Noise is the correct answer, since their phone calls are distracting from
                       your message. B, C, and D are incorrect because they do not answer the
                       question. Negative feedback can mean the recipient didn't respond well to
                       the message you've sent. Outside communications isn't a valid term. And a
                       message distracter can be the pitch, inflection, and body language that sends
                       a conflicting message to what you're saying to your audience.
                   12. You are the project manager for the OOK Project. You will be hosting project
                       meetings every week. Of the following, which one is not a valid rule for
                       project meetings?
                       A. Schedule recurring meetings as soon as possible.
                       B. Allow project meetings to last as long as needed.
                       C. Distribute meeting agendas prior to the meeting start.
                       D. Allow the project team to have input to the agenda.
                       B. Project meetings should have a set time limit. A, C, and D are incorrect
                       answers, even though these are good attributes of project team meetings.
                   13. What percentage of a message is sent through nonverbal communications,
                       such as facial expressions, hand gestures, and body language?
                       A. Greater than 50 percent
                       B. 30 to 40 percent
                       C. 20 to 30 percent

                                  D. 10 to 20 percent
                                 A. Greater than 50 percent of a message is sent through nonverbal
                                 communications. B, C, and D are incorrect.
                             14. Gary is the project manager of the HBA Update Project and his company
                                 has hired you as a project management consultant. Gary is confused about
                                 the timing of some of the project management processes. In particular,
                                 Gary doesn't understand the concept, purpose, and timing of the lessons
                                 learned documentation. He asks for your help. When does lessons learned
                                 identification take place?
                                  A. At the end of the project
                                  B. At the end of each project phase
                                  C. Throughout the project life cycle
                                  D. Whenever a lesson has been learned
                                 C. Lessons learned takes place throughout the project life cycle, not just at the
                                 end of the project or its phases. A, B, and D are incorrect choices.
                             15. Gary is the project manager of the HBA Update Project and his company has
                                 hired you as a project management consultant. Gary is confused about the
                                 timing of some of the project management processes. He now has a good
                                 understanding of the lessons learned purpose, but he's still confused about
                                 why you've recommended that the project team participate in the lessons
                                 learned documentation, too. Why should a project team complete lessons
                                 learned documentation?
                                  A. To ensure project closure
                                  B. To show management what they've accomplished on the project
                                  C. To show the project stakeholders what they've accomplished on the project
                                  D. To help future project teams complete their projects more accurately
                                 D. Lessons learned documentation helps future project teams complete their
                                 projects with more efficiency and effectiveness. A, B, and C are incorrect
                                 because each statement does not reflect the intent of lessons learned
                                 documentation: to help future project teams.
                             16. You are the project manager for the PMU Project. Your project has 13
                                 members. You have been informed that next week your project will receive
                                 the seven additional members you requested. How many channels of
                                 communication will you have next week?
                                  A. 1
                                  B. 78
                                  C. 190
                                  D. 201

                                                                                                                           407
                       C. The project currently has 13 team members, and next week, seven
                       additional team members will come aboard, thus making a total of 20 team
                       members. Using the formula N(N - 1)/2, where N is the number of identified
                       stakeholders, the communication channels equal 190. A, B, and D are all
                       incorrect.
                   17. Performance reporting should generally provide information on all of the
                       following except for which one?




                                                                                                                                         PART II
                       A. Scope
                       B. Schedule
                       C. Labor issues
                       D. Quality
                       C. Labor issues are not part of performance reporting. A, B, and D are all part
                       of performance reporting.
                   18. You are the project manager of a project that will last 18 months and includes
                       three different countries. As part of your communications management plan
                       you've scheduled face-to-face meetings with the project team and you're
                       utilizing web conferencing software for the virtual team. Based on this
                       information, the process of sending information from the project manager to
                       the project team is called what?
                       A. Functioning
                       B. Matrixing
                       C. Blended communications
                       D. Transmitting
                       D. When information is sent, it is considered to be transmitted regardless of
                       the technology involved. A, B, and C are all incorrect.
                   19. George is the project manager of the 7YH Project. In this project, George
                       considers the relationship between himself and the customer to be of utmost
                       importance. Which one of the following is a valid reason for George's belief in
                       the importance of this relationship?
                       A. The customer will complete George's performance evaluation. A poor
                          communication model between George and the customer will affect his
                          project bonus.
                       B. The customer is not familiar with project management. George must
                          educate the customer about the process.
                       C. The customer is always right.
                       D. The communication between the customer and George can convey the

                                 D. George and the customer's relationship can allow clearer communication
                                 on the project objectives than what may be expressed in the project contract.
                                 The contract should take precedence on any issues, but direct contact is often
                                 the best way to achieve clear and concise communication. A is an incorrect
                                 choice because the focus is on personal gain rather than the good of the
                                 project. B is incorrect because the customer does not necessarily need to be
                                 educated about the project management process. C is incorrect because the
                                 customer is not always right--the contract will take precedence in any
                                 disagreements.
                             20. You are the project manager for your company and you're working with the
                                 project team to develop the project's communication management plan.
                                 The project team is confused about some of the communication terms.
                                 Basically, they want to know how communication actually happens and how
                                 you can prove the communication was effective. Which one of the following
                                 means that communications occur?
                                  A. The transfer of knowledge
                                  B. The outputting of knowledge
                                  C. The presence of knowledge
                                  D. The transmission of knowledge
                                 A. The transfer of knowledge is evidence that communication has occurred. B
                                 and C do not necessarily mean the knowledge has originated from the source
                                 and been transferred to the recipient. D is also incorrect because messages are
                                 transmitted, but knowledge is transferred.

                                                                                                                        11
                     In this chapter, you will
                        * Plan for risk management
                        * Identify project risks
                        * Complete qualitative risk analysis
                        * Complete quantitative risk analysis
                        * Plan the risk responses
                        * Monitor and control project risks




                   A project risk is an uncertain event or condition that can have a positive or negative im-
                   pact on the project. That's correct--it's possible for a risk to have a positive impact.
                   Risks that have a positive impact are also known as opportunities. Technically, risk isn't
                   a bad thing. It's the impact that can be painful, costly, or delay the project work. Most
                   project managers look at risk the same way they'd look at leftover shrimp cocktail.
                   Yuck. Some risks, though, are good for the project, and the project manager wants to
                   accept them; other risks aren't so welcome.

                       Let's look at this from another point of view. Imagine a golfer teeing up. To the right
                   of the tee box, there's a water hazard, but just beyond the water is the green. The golfer
                   can either avoid the water and take longer to get to the green, or try to shoot over the
                   water and get on the green in fewer strokes. Driving up the fairway is the safer play, but
                   cutting over the water will improve the golfer's score. The risk with the water hazard is
                   that if he can't make the shot, then he's down a penalty stroke.

                                VIDEO For a more detailed explanation, watch the Creating a Risk Matrix
                                video now.

                       Risk, as in the golfing scenario, must be in proportion to the reward the risk taker
                   can realize as a result of taking the chance. The willingness to accept the risk is called
                   the utility function. Some call the utility function your risk tolerance--the amount of
                   risk you'll take on in relation to the impact the risk event may bring. Your risk appetite
                   (think yummy!) is how much risk you'll accept in relation to the reward the risk may
                   bring. An experienced golfer may have a high risk appetite, so he's willing to accept the
                   water hazard. A golf hack like me would likely have a low risk tolerance and drive up


                                                                                                                    409

                         the fairway away from the water. Someone with a high tolerance for risk is called a risk
                         seeker, while someone with a low tolerance for risk is called risk-averse.
                             It's true in project management, too. With some projects, you and your organiza-
                         tion are willing to accept risks to realize rewards such as cost savings, time savings, or
                         on-the-job training. On other projects--typically, those projects with high-impact and
                         high-profile characteristics--you're not so willing to accept the risks. In this chapter,
                         we'll look at the six processes that dictate project risk management, and you'll have
                         plenty of risk management questions on your Project Management Institute (PMI)
                         exam.
                             Let me be very clear: The risks you can readily identify are the known risks. The risks
                         that are more ambiguous, like the weather or vendor delays, are called known un-
                         knowns. You can anticipate and plan for the known unknowns, but the planning is
                         about the probability of the event and the impact the risk might have on the project
                         objectives. Project risk describes the likelihood of the overall project being successful
                         for the organization. Individual project risks are the risks within the project. When a
                         risk event actually happens, it can shift from being just a risk to being an issue in the
                         project.
                             The project management processes described here are presented in the most logical
                         order. They are actually iterative processes throughout the project life cycle. Pay special
                         attention to monitoring and controlling project risks because new risks can creep into
                         the project or be discovered as the project moves toward closure.


                         Planning for Risk Management
                         Risk management planning is not the identification of risks or even the response to
                         known risks within a project. Risk management planning is how the project manage-
                         ment team will complete the risk management activities within the project. These ac-
                         tivities really set up the project to effectively manage the five other risk management
                         activities. Risk management planning creates the risk management plan.
                              By deciding the approach to each of the risk management activities before moving
                         into them, the project management team can more effectively identify risks, complete
                         risk analysis, and then plan risk responses. In addition, planning for risk management
                         also allows the project management team to create a strategy for the ongoing identifica-
                         tion and monitoring of existing risks within the project.

                         Preparing for Risk Management Planning
                         There are five inputs to risk management planning, although some are more impor-
                         tant than others. It's essential for the project management team to understand the
                         priority of the project, which shouldn't be too tough to do. Important projects, high-
                         profile projects, or projects with hefty budgets are generally risk-averse. Smaller proj-
                         ects are generally more willing to accept risks. You'll need the following to prepare for
                         risk management:

                                                                                                                                 411
                        * Project management plan Risk management planning considers all of the
                          project's subsidiary plans, baselines, project documentation, and supporting
                          detail. The project manager will pay special attention to the project scope,
                          project communications, cost, and schedule because these knowledge areas
                          can be most widely affected by risk.
                        * Project charter The project charter is needed because it defines the high-
                          level objectives for the project and also identifies the initial known risks.




                                                                                                                                               PART II
                        * Stakeholder register The stakeholder register is referenced for stakeholder
                          concerns, threats, perceived threats, contact information, and roles involved in
                          the project.
                        * Enterprise environmental factors An organization's attitude toward risk
                          may vary (as I mentioned) based on the type, size, and profile of the project.
                        * Organizational process assets An organization may have a predefined
                          approach to risk management. If that's the case, the project management team
                          uses the organization's approach and follows its established procedures. For
                          example, an organization could define risk tolerance levels, risk categories,
                          templates, roles and responsibilities, and more. A project team may also use
                          other similar projects to guide the current risk management planning activities.


                   Completing Risk Management Planning
                   Planning for risk happens in--surprise, surprise!--planning meetings, where the proj-
                   ect team develops the risk management plan and analyzes the inputs previously men-
                   tioned to make the best decisions for the current project. While the project team is the
                   primary participant at the risk management planning meeting, the attendees may actu-
                   ally include the project manager, stakeholders, and other subject matter experts within
                   an organization who influence the risk management processes.
                       The purpose of these risk management planning meetings is to create the risk man-
                   agement plan and to define the cost and schedule for risk management activities. Let's
                   face facts: It'll take time and monies for most projects to identify, test, and challenge the
                   risks that may exist within the project. These initial meetings allow monies and time to
                   be incorporated within the project. Risk responsibilities are also assigned in these meet-
                   ings, as are the risk terminologies the project will use. Risk management planning also
                   defines and tailors the following for the project:

                        * Risk templates the project should use
                        * Definitions and terms for risk levels
                        * Probability according to risk type
                        * Impact of the risks
                        * Guidelines for the probability and impact matrix to be used during risk
                          analysis

                         Creating the Risk Management Plan
                         The whole point of risk management meetings and analysis is to create the risk man-
                         agement plan. This plan does not detail the planned responses to individual risks with-
                         in the project--this is the purpose of the risk response plan. The risk management plan
                         is responsible for determining how:

                              * The project will utilize the selected risk management methodology
                              * Risks will be identified
                              * Quantitative analysis will be completed
                              * Qualitative analysis will be completed
                              * Risk response planning will happen
                              * Risks will be monitored and tracked
                              * Ongoing risk management activities will happen throughout the project's
                                life cycle

                         Defining the Risk Management Methodology
                         The methodology is concerned with how the risk management processes will take place.
                         It asks the following:

                              * What tools are available to use for risk management?
                              * What approaches are acceptable within the performing organization?
                              * What data sources can be accessed and used for risk management?
                              * What approach is best for the project type and the phase of the project?
                              * Which approach is most appropriate given the conditions of the project?
                              * How much flexibility is available for the project given the conditions, time
                                frame, and the project budget?

                         Identifying Risk Roles and Responsibilities
                         The roles and responsibilities identify the groups and individuals who will participate
                         in the leadership and support of each of the risk management activities within the proj-
                         ect plan. In some instances, risk management teams outside of the project team may
                         have a more realistic, unbiased approach to the risk identification, impact, and overall
                         risk management needs than the actual project team does.

                         Creating a Risk Management Budget
                         Based on the size, impact, and priority of the project, a budget may need to be estab-
                         lished for the project's risk management activities. This section of the risk management
                         plan defines a cost estimate for the resources needed to complete risk management.
                         These costs are rolled into the project's cost baseline. A project with high priority and
                         no budget allotment for risk management activities may face uncertain times ahead.

                                                                                                                                   413
                   Identifying the Risk Management Schedule
                   The risk management process needs a schedule to determine how often, and when, risk
                   management activities should happen throughout the project. If risk management hap-
                   pens too late in the project, the project could be delayed because of the time needed to
                   identify, assess, and respond to the risks. A realistic schedule should be developed early
                   in the project to accommodate risks, risk analysis, and risk reaction.




                                                                                                                                                 PART II
                   Defining a Project's Risk Categories
                   Based on the nature of the work, there should be identified categories of risks within
                   the project. Figure 11-1 depicts one approach to identifying risk categories by using a
                   risk breakdown structure (RBS). Throughout the project, the risk categories should be
                   revisited to update and reflect the current status of the project. If a similar risk manage-
                   ment plan is available from a previous project, the project team may elect to use this
                   plan as a template and tailor the risk categories accordingly. There are four general cat-
                   egories of risks:

                        * Technical, quality, or performance risks Technical risks are associated
                          with new, unproven, or complex technologies being used on the project.
                          Changes to the technology during the project implementation can also be a
                          risk. Quality risks are the levels set for expectations of impractical quality and
                          performance. Changes to industry standards during the project can also be
                          lumped into this category of risks.
                        * Project management risks These risks deal with faults in the management
                          of the project: the unsuccessful allocation of time, resources, and scheduling;
                          unacceptable work results (low-quality work); and poor project management
                          as a whole.
                        * Organizational risks The performing organization can contribute to the
                          project's risks through unreasonable cost, time, and scope expectations; poor

                                 project prioritization; inadequate funding or the disruption of funding; and
                                 competition with other projects for internal resources.
                              * External risks These risks are outside of the project, but directly affect it--
                                for example, legal issues, labor issues, a shift in project priorities, or weather.
                                "Force majeure" risks can be scary, and usually call for disaster recovery rather
                                than project management. These are risks caused by earthquakes, tornadoes,
                                floods, civil unrest, and other disasters.

                             The discipline that you work in may allow you to identify and categorize risk be-
                         yond these generic categories I've listed here. The idea is to create risk themes so you can
                         group associated risks by topic. This allows you to identify trends in the risk and look
                         for root causes to attack many risks at once. An RBS is an ideal way to visualize where
                         project risks are lurking in each phase or within the project as a whole.


                         Identifying the Project Risks
                         Risk identification is the systematic process of combing through the project, the project
                         plan, the work breakdown structure (WBS), and all supporting documentation to iden-
                         tify as many of the risks that may affect the project as possible. Remember, a risk is an
                         uncertain event or condition that may affect the project outcome. Risks can be positive
                         or negative. In the big picture of risk identification, there are two categories of risks:

                              * Pure risks These risks have only a negative outcome. Examples include loss
                                of life or limb, fire, theft, natural disasters, and the like. These risks are often
                                referred to as insurable risks.
                              * Business risks These risks may have a negative or a positive outcome.
                                Examples include using a less experienced worker to complete a task, allowing
                                phases or activities to overlap, or forgoing the expense of formal training for
                                on-the-job education. These risks are also known as speculative risks.

                             The initial risk identification meeting can be wild and unwieldy if the approach
                         isn't structured. The project manager may elect to address risks by category, project
                         phase, or the project life cycle. The goal of these meetings is to capture all of the risks so
                         that the project management team can plan adequately for the risk responses. The par-
                         ticipants of the risk identification meetings can include:

                              * The project manager
                              * The project team
                              * The risk management team (if one exists, of course)
                              * Subject matter experts
                              * Customers
                              * End users
                              * Other project managers

                       Risk identification is not a one-time event. The project manager should encourage
                   the project team and these participants to continually be on the lookout for risk events
                   as the project moves toward closure. The risk management plan also includes timings
                   for iterations of risk identification and management. Risk identification is an iterative




                                                                                                                                              PART II
                   process, because new risks can creep into the project, or existing risks may be identi-
                   fied later as more detail becomes available. You'll need several inputs to complete risk
                   identification:

                        * Risk management plan This lone output of risk management planning
                          is needed during risk identification because the plan will identify the
                          organization's and the project's proper approach for identifying risks within
                          the project.
                        * Cost management plan You'll likely need funds for risk identification and
                          for risk responses. Your cost management plan should address the
                          organization's approach to requesting funds for contingency reserves and risk
                          responses.
                        * Schedule management plan How the project is structured can actually
                          create risks or avoid risks. Generally, the faster the pace of the project, the
                          more risks the project will experience.
                        * Quality management plan The quality management plan and the
                          organization's approach to quality management may create risks or, more
                          likely, help the project avoid risks.
                        * Human resource plan This plan helps the project manager anticipate how the
                          project will be staffed and the roles that can contribute to risk identification and
                          management. The staffing management plan can also help the project manager
                          anticipate any risks associated with the resources leaving the project team.
                        * Project scope baseline The project scope statement includes the assumptions
                          that the project is based on. These assumptions are often sources of risk within
                          the project. You'll use the work breakdown structure (WBS) and the WBS
                          dictionary to examine the work packages and deliverables for risk events.
                        * Activity cost estimates The project's activity cost estimates are needed to
                          determine the likelihood of achieving the cost estimates based on the
                          identified risks in the project. If risks come into fruition in the project, the
                          cost of the activities will increase. An examination of the cost of the estimates,
                          the cost of the risks, and the cost of risk responses is often needed as part of
                          risk management planning and risk identification.
                        * Activity duration estimates Just as risks can affect the cost of the activities,
                          so too can risks affect the duration of an activity. In addition, you may need to

                                 adjust activity duration to slow the work down to avoid risks, add labor, or
                                 consider risk responses and how these may affect the duration of activities.
                              * Stakeholder register Customers and other stakeholders need to participate
                                in the risk identification process. You'll need their expert judgment,
                                experience, and knowledge to help identify risks in the project.
                              * Project documents The project manager will need several project
                                documents to identify project risks. Consider the following:
                                 * An assumptions log
                                 * Work performance reports
                                 * Project network diagrams
                                 * Earned value findings
                                 * Time, cost, and scope baselines
                              * Procurement documents There is always risk associated with hiring a third
                                party to complete a portion of the project work. An analysis of the agreements
                                is needed to identify the risks associated with the vendor completion of the
                                project work, the reliability of the vendor, and the ramifications of vendor-
                                based work on the project schedule, costs, quality, and scope.
                              * Enterprise environmental factors When it comes to risk identification,
                                having commercial databases, academic studies, benchmarking results, white
                                papers, and other statistics and information related to your discipline is ideal.
                              * Organizational process assets If an organization has completed projects
                                similar to the current project, using the historical information can help with
                                the risk identification.


                         Finding Project Risks
                         Now the fun part of risk identification: Anything goes as long as it can be perceived as
                         a risk. All of the risk identification participants should identify as many risks as possi-
                         ble, regardless of their perceived initial threat. I'm not really talking about sunspots and
                         asteroid crashes here, but relevant risks should be recorded, regardless of their size
                         and impact on the project. What begins as a small risk can bloom into something much
                         larger as the project progresses.

                         Reviewing the Project Documentation
                         One of the first steps the risk identification participants can take is to review the project
                         documentation. The project plan, scope, and other project files should be reviewed.
                         Constraints and assumptions should be reviewed, considered, and analyzed for risks.
                         This structure review takes a broad look at the project plan, the scope, and the activities
                         defined within the project.

                   Relying on Risk Identification Methods
                   There are five methods you can use when it comes to gathering project information
                   regarding risks. You'll likely see these on your exam:

                        * Brainstorming Good, old-fashioned brainstorming is the most common
                          approach to risk identification. It's usually completed by a project team with
                          subject matter experts to identify the risks within the project. The risks are




                                                                                                                                             PART II
                          identified in broad terms and posted, and then the risks' characteristics are
                          detailed. Your pal, the risk breakdown structure (RBS), can help facilitate
                          the brainstorming process. The identified risks are categorized and will pass
                          through the qualitative and quantitative risk analyses later. I'll discuss those
                          in just a few pages--no peeking!
                        * The Delphi Technique The Delphi Technique, shown in Figure 11-2, is an
                          anonymous method used to query experts about foreseeable risks within a
                          project, phase, or component of a project. The results of the survey are
                          analyzed by a third party, organized, and then circulated to the experts. There
                          can be several rounds of anonymous discussion with the Delphi Technique
                          without fear of backlash or offending other participants in the process. The
                          Delphi Technique is completely anonymous, and the goal is to gain consensus
                          on project risks within the project. The anonymous nature of the process
                          ensures that no single expert's advice overtly influences the opinion of
                          another participant.
                           I'm often asked why this approach is called the Delphi Technique. It was
                           developed during the Cold War as a forecasting and consensus-building
                           device, and was named after the "Oracle at Delphi." Delphi is a Greek

                   The Delphi
                   Technique
                   uses rounds of
                   anonymous surveys
                   to gain consensus.

                                 However, as fascinating as Greek mythology is, there won't be any legends on
                                 your PMI examination. Sorry.
                              * Hosting interview sessions Interviewing subject matter experts and project
                                stakeholders is an excellent approach to identifying risks on the current
                                project based on the interviewees' experiences. The people responsible for risk
                                identification share the overall purpose of the project, the project's work
                                breakdown structure (WBS), and, likely, the same assumptions as the
                                interviewee. The interviewee, through questions and discussion, shares his
                                insight on what risks he perceives within the project. The goal of the process is
                                to learn from the expert what risks may be hidden within the project, what
                                risks this person has encountered in similar work, and what insight the person
                                has into the project work.
                              * Root cause identification Project managers and the project team often see
                                the impact of a risk, but not always its cause. Root cause identification aims to
                                find out why a risk event may be occurring, the causal factors creating the risk
                                events, and then, eventually, how the events can be mitigated or eliminated.
                              * Implementing SWOT analysis SWOT stands for strengths, weaknesses,
                                opportunities, and threats. SWOT analysis is the process of examining the project
                                from the perspective of each characteristic. For example, a technology project may
                                identify SWOT as:
                                 * Strengths The technology to be installed in the project has been installed
                                   by other large companies in our industry.
                                 * Weaknesses        We have never installed this technology before.
                                 * Opportunities The new technology will allow us to reduce our cycle time
                                   for time-to-market on new products. Opportunities are things, conditions, or
                                   events that allow an organization to differentiate itself from competitors
                                   and improve its standing in the marketplace.
                                 * Threats The time to complete the training and simulation may overlap
                                   with product updates, new versions, and external changes to our
                                   technology portfolio.

                                       EXAM COACH You can use SWOT as you prepare to pass your PMI exam.
                                       Look at your scores for the end-of-chapter exams. Which chapters are you
                                       strong or weak in? Which chapters are threatening your exam? And which
                                       exam objectives can you ace on the actual test? Continue to work smart--
                                       your goal is to pass the exam.

                         Using Checklists
                         Checklists are a quick approach to risk identification. The lowest of the risk breakdown
                         structures (RBS) might serve as a checklist, for example. More likely, similar projects

                                                                                                                                 419
                   that have been completed in the past have risk registers that the current risk identifica-
                   tion process can benefit from. While checklists can be created quickly and easily, it's
                   impossible to build an exhaustive risk checklist.

                                EXAM TIP The danger in using or relying on risk identification checklists is
                                that the risk identification participants don't consider risks that aren't on the
                                checklists. Even for projects that have been completed over and over, based on




                                                                                                                                               PART II
                                the nature of the work, the project team must actively seek to identify risks
                                that are outside of the organizational process assets checklists.

                   Examining the Assumptions
                   All projects have assumptions. Assumption analysis is the process of examining the as-
                   sumptions to see what risks may stem from false assumptions. Examining assumptions
                   is about gauging the validity of the assumptions. For example, consider a project to
                   install a new piece of software on every computer within an organization. The project
                   team has made the assumption that all of the computers within the organization meet
                   the minimum requirements to install the software. If this assumption were wrong, cost
                   increases and schedule delays would occur.
                       Examining the assumptions also requires a review of assumptions across the whole
                   project for consistency. For example, consider a project with an assumption that a se-
                   nior employee will be needed throughout the entire project work; the cost estimate,
                   however, has been billed at the rate of a junior employee.

                   Utilizing Diagramming Techniques
                   Several diagramming techniques can be utilized by the project team to identify risks:

                        * Ishikawa These cause-and-effect diagrams are also called fishbone diagrams,
                          as seen in Figure 11-3. They are great for analyzing the root causes of risk
                          factors within the project. The goal is to identify and treat the root of the
                          problem, not the symptom.
                        * Flowchart System or process flowcharts show the relationships between
                          components and how the overall process works. These are useful for
                          identifying risks between system components.
                        * Influence An influence diagram charts out a decision problem. It identifies
                          all of the elements, variables, decisions, and objectives, and also how each
                          factor may influence another.


                   Creating a Risk Register
                   The only output of risk identification is the project's risk register. The risk register is a
                   component of the project management plan that contains all of the information relat-
                   ed to the risk management activities. It's updated as risk management activities are

                         conducted to reflect the status, progress, and nature of the project risks. The risk register
                         includes the following:

                              * Risks Of course, the most obvious output of risk identification is the risk
                                that has been successfully identified. Recall that a risk is an uncertain event or
                                condition that could potentially have a positive or negative effect on project
                                success.
                              * Potential responses The initial risk identification process may yield solutions
                                and responses to identified risks. This is fine, as long as the responses are
                                documented here. Along with the risk responses, the identification of risk
                                triggers may also occur. Triggers are warning signs or symptoms that a risk has
                                occurred or is about to occur. For example, should a vendor fail to complete her
                                portion of the project as scheduled, the project completion may be delayed.
                              * The root causes of risk Risk identification can identify why risk conditions
                                exist. Project managers can also use if-then statements based on the cause of
                                the risk event to predict the effect of the risk event.
                              * Updated risk categories Risk identification may prompt the project team to
                                identify new categories of risks. These new categories should be documented
                                in the risk register, and if a risk breakdown structure (RBS) is utilized, it will
                                need to be updated as well.

                                                                                                                                 421
                   Using Qualitative Risk Analysis
                   The first, and somewhat shallow, risk analysis is qualitative analysis. Qualitative risk
                   analysis "qualifies" the risks that have been identified in the project. Specifically, quali-
                   tative risk analysis examines and prioritizes the risks based on their probability of oc-
                   curring and the impact on the project if the risks do occur. Qualitative risk analysis is a
                   broad approach to ranking risks by priority, which then guides the risk reaction process.




                                                                                                                                               PART II
                   The end result of qualitative risk analysis (once risks have been identified and priori-
                   tized) can either lead to more in-depth quantitative risk analysis or move directly into
                   risk response planning.
                       The status of the project will also affect the process of qualitative risk analysis. Early
                   in the project, there may be several risks that have not yet surfaced. Later in the project,
                   new risks may become evident and need to pass through qualitative analysis. The status
                   of the project is linked to the available time needed to analyze and study the risks. There
                   may be more time early in the project, while a looming deadline near the project's
                   end may create a sense of urgency to find a solution for the newly identified risks.

                                EXAM TIP When you think of "qualitative," think of qualifying.You are
                                qualifying, or justifying, the seriousness of the risk for further analysis. Some
                                Certified Associate in Project Management (CAPM) and Project Management
                                Professional (PMP) candidates like to remember that qualitative is a list. The
                                "L" in qualitative and list ties the two together.

                   Preparing for Qualitative Analysis
                   As with most of the project planning processes, the project management team is in-
                   cluded in the rapid analysis of the project risks. There are five inputs to qualitative
                   analysis:

                        * Risk management plan The risk management plan is the key input to
                          qualitative risk analysis. The plan will dictate the process, the methodologies
                          to be used, and the scoring model for identified risks. In addition to the risk
                          management plan, the identified risks from the risk register will obviously
                          be needed to perform an analysis. These are the risks that will be scored and
                          ranked based on their probability and impact.
                        * Project scope baseline Consider an organization that does the same type of
                          projects over and over, such as installing networks or constructing bridges.
                          These repetitive projects have known risks and known risk responses. An
                          organization that is attempting project work that it has never done before has
                          more unknowns, which can represent risks in a project. The project scope
                          baseline can help identify a project's uniqueness. The project scope
                          statement's assumptions and constraints can also be examined for risks.
                        * Risk register This project-centric database of identified risks and their status
                          is referenced to qualify risks.

                              * Enterprise environmental factors Risk databases, industry studies, internal
                                risk management policies, and program governance can all be considered as
                                part of the risk analysis.
                              * Organizational process assets Past projects and lessons learned--the
                                organization's historical information--are ideal resources for the qualitative
                                risk analysis process. No need to reinvent the wheel.

                                       EXAM TIP You'll always update the risk register when any new information
                                       about a risk is discovered.

                         Completing Qualitative Analysis
                         During the risk identification process, all possible risks are identified. Of course, not all
                         risks are worth responding to, while others demand attention. Qualitative analysis is a
                         subjective approach to organizing and prioritizing risks. Through a methodical and
                         logical approach, the identified risks are rated according to probability and potential
                         impact.
                             The outcome of the ranking determines four things:

                              * It identifies the risks that require additional analysis through quantitative risk
                                analysis.
                              * It identifies the risks that may proceed directly to risk response planning.
                              * It identifies risks that are not critical, project-stopping risks, but that still must
                                be documented.
                              * It prioritizes risks.


                         Applying Probability and Impact
                         The project risks are rated according to their probability and impact. Risk probability
                         is the likelihood that a risk event may happen, while risk impact is the consequence that
                         the result of the event will have on the project objectives. Two approaches exist to rank-
                         ing risks:

                              * Cardinal scales identify the probability and impact on a numerical value, from
                                .01 (very low) to 1.0 (certain).
                              * Ordinal scales identify and rank the risks from very high to very unlikely.


                         Creating a Probability-Impact Matrix
                         Each identified risk is fed into a probability-impact matrix, as seen in Figure 11-4. The
                         matrix maps out the risk, its probability, and its possible impact. The risks with higher
                         probability and impact are a more serious threat to the project objectives than risks
                         with lower impact and consequences. The risks that are threats to the project require

                   quantitative analysis to determine the root causes, the methods to control the risks, and
                   effective risk management. We'll discuss quantitative risk management later in this
                   chapter.
                       The project is best served when the probability scale and the impact scale are pre-
                   defined prior to qualitative analysis. For example, the probability scale rates the likeli-
                   hood of an individual risk happening and can be on a linear scale (.1, .3, .5, .7, .9), or
                   on an ordinal scale. The scale, however, should be defined and agreed upon in the risk
                   management plan. The impact scale, which measures the severity of the risk on the
                   project's objectives, can also be ordinal or cardinal.
                       By identifying and assigning the scales to use prior to the process of qualitative
                   analysis, all risks can be ranked by the system, including future identified risks. A shift
                   in risk-rating methodologies midproject can cause disagreements with regard to how
                   the project risks should be handled.
                       A probability-impact matrix multiplies the value for the risk probability by the risk
                   impact, giving a total risk score, as seen in Figure 11-5. The risk's scores can be cardinal,
                   and then preset values can qualify the risk for a risk response. For example, an identi-
                   fied risk in a project is the possibility that the vendor may be late in delivering the

                   risk score.

                         hardware. The probability is rated at .9, but the impact of the risk on the project is rated
                         at .1. The risk score is calculated by multiplying the probability times the impact--in
                         this case, resulting in a score of .09.
                             The scores within the probability-impact matrix can be referenced against the per-
                         forming organization's policies for risk reaction. Based on the risk score, the perform-
                         ing organization can place the risk in differing categories to guide risk reaction. There
                         are three common categories, based on an RAG (Red, Amber, Green) rating risk score:

                              * Red condition        High risk. These risk scores are high in impact and
                                probability.
                              * Amber condition (also called yellow condition)                   These risks are somewhat
                                high in impact and probability.
                              * Green condition Risks with a green label are generally fairly low in impact,
                                probability, or both.


                         Relying on Data Precision
                         Here's the truth about qualitative risk analysis: It's easy, fast, cheap, and not very reli-
                         able. One of the toughest parts of qualitative risk analysis is the biased, subjective na-
                         ture of the process. A project manager and the project team must question the reliabil-
                         ity and reality of the data that leads to the ranking of the risks. For example, Susan may
                         have great confidence in herself when it comes to working with new, unproven tech-
                         nologies. Based on this opinion, she determines the probability of the work to be a very
                         low score. However, because she has no experience with the technology due to its new-
                         ness, the probability of the risk of failure is actually very high. The biased opinion that
                         Susan can complete the work with zero defects and problems is slightly skewed because
                         she has never worked with the technology before. Obviously, a low-ranked score on a
                         risk that should be ranked high can have detrimental effects on the project's success.
                              Data precision ranking takes into consideration the biased nature of the ranking,
                         the accuracy of the data submitted, and the reliability of the nature submitted to exam-
                         ine the risk scores. Data precision ranking is concerned with the following:

                              * The level of understanding of the project risk
                              * The available data and information about the identified risk
                              * The quality of the data and information about the identified risk
                              * The reliability of the data about the identified risk


                         Assessing the Risk Score
                         Once the qualitative risk assessment has been completed, you can step back, heave a
                         sigh of relief, and then acknowledge that this process will need to be repeated through-
                         out the project as new risks come into play. Risk assessment is an ongoing, iterative
                         process that lasts throughout the project. Want some more sad news? The risk ratings in

                                                                                                                                425
                   the qualitative risk matrix can change based on conditions in the project or as more
                   information about the risks becomes available.
                       One nice thing about the qualitative risk analysis process is the ability to categorize
                   risks. Remember the RBS? The qualitative risk analysis process may give you an oppor-
                   tunity to create new risk categories that you've identified or to reorganize the RBS. The
                   goal of updating the RBS is to group risks by common categories to create better risk
                   responses later on in the risk management processes.




                                                                                                                                              PART II
                       Finally, assessing the risk score gives the project manager an opportunity to address
                   near-term risks. Imminent risks are usually considered of higher urgency than future
                   risks. Consider the risk ranking, the time needed for the risk response, and the condi-
                   tions that indicate the risk is coming to fruition.

                   Updating the Risk Register
                   At the beginning of the qualitative risk analysis process, the risk register was fairly sim-
                   ple. The list of identified risks, some potential responses, and supporting detail for the
                   risks are all that you'd likely find in that database. Now that more information has be-
                   come available, the project manager and the project team can update the risk register
                   accordingly.
                       As qualitative risk analysis happens throughout the project, new risks will be identi-
                   fied. The project manager should route the risks through the qualitative risk analysis
                   process. The end results of qualitative risk analysis are all updated in the risk register:

                        * Overall risk ranking of the project This allows the project manager,
                          management, customers, and other interested stakeholders to comprehend the
                          risk, the nature of the risks, and the condition between the risk score and the
                          likelihood of success for a project. The risk score can be compared with other
                          projects to determine project selection, the placement of talent in a project,
                          prioritization, the creation of a benefit/cost ratio, or even the cancellation of a
                          project because it is deemed too risky.
                        * Risk categories Within the risk register, categories of risks should be created.
                          The idea is that not only will related risks be lumped together, but also there
                          may be some trend identification and root cause analysis of identified risks.
                          As risks are categorized, it should be easier to create risk responses as well.
                        * Near-term risks Qualitative analysis should also help the project team
                          identify which risks require immediate or near-term risk responses. However,
                          risks that are likely to happen later in the project can be acknowledged,
                          allowing imminent risks to be managed first.
                        * Risks requiring additional analysis The risks categorized as high will likely
                          need additional analysis, such as quantitative analysis. Some risks may
                          demand immediate risk management based on the nature of the risks and the
                          status of the project.

                                analysis. However, these low-priority risks should be identified and assigned
                                to a watch list for periodic monitoring.
                              * Trends in qualitative analysis As the project progresses and risk analysis is
                                repeated, trends in the ranking and analysis of the risks may become
                                apparent. These trends can allow the project manager and other risk experts to
                                respond to the root cause and predicted trends to either eliminate or respond
                                to the risks within the project.


                         Preparing for Quantitative Risk Analysis
                         Quantitative risk analysis attempts to numerically assess the probability and impact of
                         the identified risks. It also creates an overall risk score for the project. This method is
                         more in-depth than qualitative risk analysis and relies on several different tools to ac-
                         complish its goal.
                             Qualitative risk analysis typically precedes quantitative risk analysis. I like to say
                         that qualitative analysis qualifies risks, while quantitative analysis quantifies risks. All
                         or a portion of the identified risks in qualitative risk analysis can be examined in the
                         quantitative analysis. The performing organization may have policies on the risk scores
                         in qualitative analysis that require the risks to advance to the quantitative analysis. The
                         availability of time and budget may also be a factor in determining which risks should
                         pass through quantitative analysis. Quantitative analysis is a more time-consuming
                         process, and is, therefore, also more expensive. The goals of quantitative risk analysis
                         are to:

                              * Quantify the cost and impact of the risk exposure
                              * Ascertain the likelihood of reaching project success
                              * Ascertain the likelihood of reaching a particular project objective
                              * Determine the risk exposure for the project
                              * Determine the likely amount of the contingency reserve needed for the project
                              * Determine the risks with the largest impact on the project
                              * Determine realistic time, cost, and scope targets


                         Interviewing Stakeholders and Experts
                         Interviews with stakeholders and subject matter experts can be one of the first tools to
                         quantify the identified risks. These interviews can focus on worst-case, best-case, and
                         most-likely scenarios if the goal of the quantitative analysis is to create a triangular
                         distribution. Most quantitative analysis, however, uses continuous probability distribu-
                         tions. Figure 11-6 shows five sample distributions: normal, lognormal, beta, triangular,
                         and uniform.

                       Continuous probability distribution examines the probability of all possibilities
                   within a given range. For each variable, the probability of a risk event and the corre-
                   sponding consequence of the event may vary. In other words, dependent on whether
                   the risk event occurs and how it happens, a reaction to the event may also occur. The
                   distribution of the probabilities and impact includes:

                        * Normal
                        * Lognormal
                        * Beta
                        * Triangular
                        * Uniform

                                 EXAM TIP It's doubtful you'll be tested on these risk distributions for the
                                 exam. The PMBOK mentions them only briefly, so you just need to be topically
                                 aware of them. Don't invest hours memorizing the subject.

                   Applying Sensitivity Analysis
                   Sensitivity analysis examines each risk to determine which one has the largest impact
                   on the project's success. All other risks in the project are set at a baseline value and then
                   compared against all of the other risks individually. The individual risk is then exam-
                   ined to see how it may affect the success of the project. The goal of sensitivity analysis
                   is to determine which individual risks have the greatest impact on the project's success
                   and then to escalate the risk management processes based on these risk events.
                        The tornado diagram is best used when completing sensitivity analysis. The tornado
                   diagram maps out all the variables in a situation from largest to smallest impact on the
                   project or situation. If you've ever seen a tornado, you know it's really big on top and
                   small at the bottom--that's what the tornado diagram looks like, too. The closer the
                   bar is to the top of the diagram, the more impact it has on the situation, project, or
                   investment. The closer the bar is to the bottom of the chart, the less impact it has on the
                   situation. Tornado diagrams are also sometimes called tornado plots or tornado
                   charts.

                         Finding the Expected Monetary Value
                         The expected monetary value (EMV) of a project or event is based on the probability of
                         outcomes that are uncertain. For example, one risk may cost the project an additional
                         $10,000 if it occurs, but there's only a 20 percent chance of the event occurring. In its
                         simplest form, the expected monetary value of this individual risk impact is, thus,
                         $2,000. Project managers can also find the expected monetary value of a decision by
                         creating a decision tree.
                             Table 11-1 is an example of a simple risk matrix that determines the expected mon-
                         etary value for some sample risks. Note that the sum of the EMV reveals what the con-
                         tingency reserve for these risks should be.

                         Using a Decision Tree
                         A decision tree is a method used to determine which of two or more decisions is the
                         best one. For example, it can be used to determine buy-versus-build scenarios, lease-or-
                         purchase equations, or whether to use in-house resources rather than outsourcing proj-
                         ect work. The decision tree model examines the cost and benefits of each decision's
                         outcome and weighs the probability of success for each of the decisions.
                             The purpose of the decision tree is to make a decision, calculate the value of that
                         decision, or determine which decision costs the least. Follow Figure 11-7 through the
                         various steps of the decision tree process.

                         Completing a Decision Tree
                         As the project manager of the new GFB Project, you have to decide whether to create a
                         new web application in-house or send the project out to a developer. The developer you
                         would use (if you were to outsource the work) quotes the project cost at $175,000.
                         Based on previous work with this company, you are 85 percent certain they will finish
                         the work on time.
                             Your in-house development team quotes the cost of the work as $165,000. Again,
                         based on previous experience with your in-house developers, you feel 75 percent certain
                         they can complete the work on time. Now let's apply what we know to a decision tree:

                              * Buy or Build is simply the decision name.

                           assigned to the "weak" value on the Buy branch. You complete the same
                           process for the Build branch of the tree.
                         * The value of the decision is the percentage of strong and weak applied to each
                           branch of the tree.
                         * The best decision is based solely on the largest value of all possible decisions.


                   Using a Project Simulation
                   Project simulations allow the project team to play "what-if" games without affecting
                   any areas of production. The Monte Carlo analysis (sometimes called the Monte Carlo
                   technique) is the most common simulation. This technique got its name from Monte
                   Carlo, Monaco (world-renowned for its slot machines, roulette wheels, and other games
                   of pure chance). The Monte Carlo technique, typically completed using a computer
                   software program, completely simulates a project by using values for all possible vari-
                   ables to predict the most likely model.

                   Examining the Results of Quantitative Risk Analysis
                   Quantitative risk analysis is completed throughout the project as risks are identified
                   and passed through qualitative analysis, as project conditions change, or on a preset
                   schedule. The end result of quantitative risk analysis should be reflected in the risk reg-
                   ister and includes the following:

                        * Probabilistic analysis The risks within the project allow the project manager
                          or other experts to predict the likelihood of project success. The project may

                                 be altered by the response to certain risks. This response can increase cost and
                                 push back the project completion date.
                              * Probability of costs and schedule objectives Based on the identified risks,
                                their impact, and the probability of occurrence, forecasts for the project
                                schedule and the project costs are created. The more negative the risks that
                                occur within a project, the greater the chance of delays and increased costs.
                              * A prioritized list of risks This list of quantified risks demonstrates those
                                with the highest potential for endangering project success. This list includes
                                the risks that have the greatest opportunity to affect the project. Each risk is
                                identified with its probability and impact.
                              * Trends As the project moves toward completion, quantitative risk analysis
                                may be repeated over and over. In each round of analysis, trends in the
                                identified risks may become visible. These trends can help the project team
                                eliminate the root cause of the risks, reduce their probability, or control their
                                impact.


                         Updating the Risk Register
                         You guessed it. After completing a round of quantitative risk analysis, the risk register
                         needs to be updated to reflect all the new information the project manager has learned
                         about the project and its risks. Here's what gets updated in the risk register:

                              * Probability of the project succeeding
                              * Probability of achieving the project's cost and time objectives
                              * Prioritized list of quantified risks
                              * Trends the project management team has discovered

                             The risk register and the risk information will be updated throughout the project.
                         This is a PMI-ism--the risk register is part of the project management plan and has to
                         be updated throughout the project.


                         Planning for Risk Responses
                         Risk response planning is all about options and actions. It focuses on how to decrease
                         the possibility of risks adversely affecting the project's objectives and also on how to
                         increase the likelihood of positive risks that can aid the project. Risk response planning
                         assigns responsibilities to people and groups close to the risk event. Risks will increase
                         or decrease based on the effectiveness of risk response planning.
                             The responses to identified risks must be in balance with the risks themselves. The
                         cost and time invested in a risk must be met with the gains from reducing the risk's
                         impact and probability. In other words, a million-dollar solution for a hundred-dollar
                         problem is unacceptable. The individuals who are assigned to the risk must have the
                         authority to react to the project risk as planned. In most cases, several risk responses

                                                                                                  Chapter 11: Managing Project Risks

                                                                                                                                  431
                   may be viable for the risk--the best choice for the identified risk must be documented,
                   agreed upon, and then followed through should the risk come to fruition.

                   Preparing for Risk Responses
                   To successfully prepare for risk response, the project manager, project team, and appro-
                   priate stakeholders rely on several inputs--many of which stem from qualitative and
                   quantitative risk analyses. The risk management plan is needed during the risk response




                                                                                                                                                PART II
                   planning, but the risk register is also needed to provide the following:

                        * A list of prioritized risks
                        * A risk ranking
                        * A prioritized list of quantified risks
                        * A probabilistic analysis of the project
                        * The probability of the project meeting the cost and schedule goals
                        * The list of potential responses decided upon when risks were first identified
                        * Any risk owners who have been identified
                        * A list of risks with common causal factors
                        * Trends from qualitative and quantitative analyses


                   Creating Risk Responses
                   The project team can employ several tools and techniques to respond to risks. Each risk
                   should be evaluated to determine which category of risk response is most appropriate.
                   When a category has been selected, the response must then be developed, refined, doc-
                   umented, and readied for use if needed. In addition, secondary responses may be se-
                   lected for each risk. The purpose of risk response planning is to bring the overall risk of
                   the project down to an acceptable level. In addition, risk response planning must ad-
                   dress any risks that have unacceptably high scores.

                   Avoiding Negative Risks
                   Avoidance is simply avoiding the risk. This can be accomplished in many different ways
                   and generally happens early in the project, when any change will result in fewer conse-
                   quences than later in the project plan. Examples of avoidance include the following:

                        * Changing the project plan to eliminate the risk
                        * Clarifying project requirements to avoid discrepancies
                        * Reducing the project scope to avoid the risk
                        * Using a proven methodology rather than a new approach

                                       EXAM TIP One avoidance risk strategy is to shut down the entire project to
                                       avoid the risk entirely.

                         Transferring Negative Risks
                         Transference is the process of transferring the risk (and the ownership of the risk) to a
                         third party. The risk doesn't disappear--it just becomes someone else's problem. Trans-
                         ference of a risk usually costs a premium for the third party to own and manage. Com-
                         mon examples of risk transference include:

                              * Insurance
                              * Performance bonds
                              * Warranties
                              * Guarantees
                              * Fixed-priced contracts

                         Mitigating Negative Risks
                         Mitigating risks is an effort to reduce the probability and/or impact of an identified risk
                         in the project. Mitigation is done based on the logic before the risk happens. The cost
                         and time to reduce or eliminate the risks is more cost-effective than repairing the dam-
                         age caused by the risk. The risk event may still happen, but hopefully the cost and im-
                         pact of the risk will both be very low.
                             Mitigation plans can be created so that they are implemented should an identified
                         risk cross a given threshold. For example, a manufacturing project may have a mitiga-
                         tion plan to reduce the number of units created per hour should the equipment's tem-
                         perature cross a given threshold. The reduction is the number of units per hour that it
                         may cost the project in time. In addition, the cost of extra labor to run the equipment
                         longer because the machine is now operating at a slower pace may be attributed to
                         the project. However, should the equipment fail, the project would have to replace the
                         equipment and be delayed for weeks while awaiting repairs.
                             Examples of mitigation include:

                              * Adding activities to the project to reduce the risk probability or impact
                              * Simplifying the processes within the project
                              * Completing more tests on the project work before implementation
                              * Developing prototypes, simulations, and limited releases


                         Managing the Positive Risk and Opportunities
                         While most risks have a negative connotation, not all risks are bad. There are instances
                         when a risk may create an opportunity that can help the project, other projects, or the
                         organization as a whole. The type of risk and the organization's willingness to accept
                         the risks will dictate the appropriate response.

                   Exploiting Positive Risks or Opportunities
                   When an organization would like to take advantage of a positive risk that will likely
                   happen, it can exploit the risk. Positive risk exploitation can be realized by adding re-
                   sources to finish faster than was originally planned, increasing quality to recognize
                   sales and customer satisfaction, utilizing a better way of completing the project work,
                   or any other method that creates the positive outcomes of the identified risk.




                                                                                                                                              PART II
                   Sharing Positive Risks
                   The idea of sharing a positive risk really means sharing a mutually beneficial opportu-
                   nity between two organizations or projects, or creating a risk-sharing partnership. When
                   a project team can share the positive risk, ownership of the risk is given to the organiza-
                   tion that can best capture its benefits.

                   Enhancing Positive Risks
                   This risk response seeks to modify the size of the identified opportunity. The goal is to
                   strengthen the cause of the opportunity to ensure that the risk event does happen. En-
                   hancing a project risk looks for solutions, triggers, or other drivers to ensure that the
                   risk does come to fruition so that the rewards of the risk can be realized by the perform-
                   ing organization.

                   Accepting the Risks
                   Risk acceptance is the process of simply accepting the risks because no other action is
                   feasible, or because the risks are deemed to be of small probability, impact, or both,
                   and a formal response is not warranted. Passive acceptance requires no action; the proj-
                   ect team deals with the risks as they happen. Active acceptance entails developing a
                   contingency plan should the risk occur. Acceptance may be used for both positive and
                   negative risks.
                       A contingency plan is a predefined set of actions the project team will take should
                   certain events occur. Events that trigger the contingency plan should be tracked. A fall-
                   back plan is a reaction to a risk that has occurred when the primary response proves to
                   be inadequate.

                   Updating the Risk Register
                   Are you noticing a theme here? Every time new information about the project's risks is
                   learned, the risk register has to be updated. Since I'm dealing with risk responses in this
                   section, the updates to the risk register are:

                        * Identified risks and how each one can threaten the project
                        * Risk owners and their responsibilities for the risk events
                        * Risk response strategies and the responses to risk events
                        * Symptoms and warning signs of risk
                        * Budget and schedule impact of the risk response activities

                              * Contingency reserves for time and costs
                              * Contingency plans and triggers to implement the plan

                              * Residual risks (risks that are expected to remain after a risk response)
                              * Secondary risks (new risks created as a result of a risk response)

                         Creating Contracts for Risk Response
                         When multiple entities are involved in a project, contractual agreements may be neces-
                         sary to identify the responsible parties for identified risks. The contract may be needed
                         for insurance purposes, customer acceptance, or the acknowledgment of responsibili-
                         ties between the entities completing the project. Transference is an example of contrac-
                         tual agreements for the responsibility of risks within a project.

                         Justifying Risk Reduction
                         To reduce risk, additional time or monies are typically needed. The process and logic
                         behind the strategies to reduce the risk should be evaluated to determine if the solution
                         is worth the trade-offs. For example, a risk may be eliminated by adding $7,500 to a
                         project's budget. However, the likelihood of the risk occurring is relatively low. Should
                         the risk happen, it would cost, at a minimum, $8,000 to correct, and the project would
                         be delayed by at least two weeks.
                             The cost of preventing the risk versus the cost of responding to it must be weighed
                         and justified. If the project manager gambles that the risk won't happen and doesn't
                         spend the $7,500 cost for the risk response, and the project moves forward as planned
                         without the risk happening, it has theoretically saved $15,500 because the risk did not
                         happen and the response to the risk did not need to happen.
                             However, if the risk does happen without the $7,500 preventive risk response, the
                         project will lose at least $8,000 and be delayed at least two weeks. The cost inherent in
                         the project delay may be more expensive than the solution to the risk. The judgment of
                         solving the risk to reduce the likelihood of delaying the project may be wiser than ig-
                         noring the risk.

                         Updating the Project Plan
                         The risk reactions, contingency plans, and fallback plans should all be documented and
                         incorporated into the project plan--for example, updating the schedule, budget, and
                         WBS to accommodate additional time, money, and activities for risk responses. The
                         responses to the risks may change the original implementation of the project and
                         should be updated to reflect the project plan and intent of the project team, manage-
                         ment, and other stakeholders. A failure to update the project plan and the risk register
                         may cause risk reactions to be missed--and skew performance measurements.
                             There's a chance you'll also need to update the scope, cost, and schedule baselines
                         to reflect the changes to these components of the project. For example, you may edit the
                         project scope as part of risk response. This change in the project scope may in fact affect

                                                                                                                               435
                   the costs and schedule of the project so you'd need to reflect these baselines, too. This
                   is a great example of the integrated nature of project management. Any decision you
                   make here in risk management, in particular risk responses, can affect the entire project
                   and will cause a need to update the project management plan accordingly.
                       You'll also need to update the assumption log if you've identified risks that change
                   the project assumptions. It's also possible that during the management of the risk, you
                   had to generate new assumptions about how the project would behave if you were to




                                                                                                                                             PART II
                   enact certain risk responses. The technical documentation that supports the project
                   management plan may also need to be updated if you've added risk responses that af-
                   fect the project deliverables.


                   Monitoring and Controlling Project Risks
                   Risks must be actively monitored, and new risks must be responded to as they are dis-
                   covered. Risk monitoring and control is the process of monitoring identified risks for
                   signs that they may be occurring, controlling identified risks with the agreed-upon re-
                   sponses, and looking for new risks that may creep into the project. Risk monitoring and
                   control also is concerned with the documentation of the success or failure of risk re-
                   sponse plans and keeping records of metrics that signal risks are occurring or disappear-
                   ing from the project.
                       Risk monitoring and control is an active process that requires participation from
                   the project manager, the project team, key stakeholders, and, in particular, risk owners
                   within the project. As the project progresses, risk conditions may change and require
                   new responses, additional planning, or the implementation of a contingency plan.
                       There are several goals to risk monitoring and control:

                        * Confirm that risk responses are implemented as planned
                        * Determine if risk responses are effective or if new responses are needed
                        * Determine the validity of the project assumptions
                        * Determine if risk exposure has changed, evolved, or declined due to trends in
                          the project progression
                        * Monitor risk triggers
                        * Confirm that policies and procedures happen as planned
                        * Monitor the project for new risks


                   Preparing for Risk Monitoring and Control
                   A project manager's work is never done--at least, not until the project is closed. Risk
                   monitoring and controlling is an active process. There are several inputs the project
                   team and the project manager must rely on to effectively monitor and control risks:

                        * The project management plan Specifically, it's the risk management
                          plan that you're after. This plan defines the organization's approach to risk

                                 management. It is not the strategy for specific risks within a project, but the
                                 overall strategy for risk analysis and planning.
                              * The risk register The risk register is the central repository for all project risk
                                information. It includes the identified risks, the potential responses, the root
                                causes of risks, and any identified categories of risk.
                              * Work performance information The results of project work can inform the
                                project manager and the project team of new and impending risks. In
                                addition, project team members may create reports to monitor or document
                                risks. These reports are known as issue logs, action items, jeopardy warnings,
                                and escalation notices.
                              * Work performance data The project performance focuses on the balance of
                                the project schedule, costs, and deliverables that have been created. Should
                                any of these factors suffer, new risks are likely to enter the project.


                         Monitoring and Controlling Risks
                         Risk monitoring and control happens throughout the project. These are not solitary
                         activities that are completed once and never revisited. The project manager and the
                         project team must actively monitor risks, respond with the agreed-upon actions, and
                         scan the horizon for risks that have not been addressed. Risk monitoring and control is
                         a recurring activity that requires input from all project participants.
                             Project risk should be on the agenda at every project team meeting. The periodic
                         risk review is a regularly scheduled discussion throughout the project to ascertain the
                         level of foreseeable risks, the success of risk responses in the project to date, and a re-
                         view of pending risks. Based on circumstances within the project, risk rankings and
                         prioritization may fluctuate. Changes to the project scope, team, or conditions may
                         require qualitative and quantitative analyses.

                         Completing Risk Response Audits
                         You don't just assume your risk responses work--you have to test them. A risk response
                         audit examines the planned risk responses, how well the planned actions work, and the
                         effectiveness of the risk owners in implementing the risk responses. The audits happen
                         throughout the project to measure the effectiveness of mitigating, transferring, and
                         avoiding risks. The risk response audit should measure the effectiveness of the decision
                         and its impact on time and cost. Of course, you'll update the risk register once the audit
                         has been completed.

                         Analyzing Project Variances
                         A variance is the difference between what was planned and what was experienced. No
                         one likes to hear that variances are in the project, but ignoring variances can only lead
                         to more risks, more troubles, and more headaches. Cost variances can eat into the proj-
                         ect budget, which in turn creates new risks, such as running out of cash, having to




11-ch11.indd 436                                                                                                                 7/10/2013 1:55:43 AM

                                                                                                Chapter 11: Managing Project Risks

                                                                                                                                437
                   choose a lower grade of materials, or even removing deliverables from the scope. Cost
                   variances can also force the project manager to have to ask for more funds, which is not
                   a pleasant experience.
                       Schedule variances are just as deadly. Delays in the project work, vendor deliveries,
                   and time estimates that were too optimistic can eat into the management reserve and
                   consume the project's float. These risks can create new risks. Consider the risks inherent
                   to the schedule variance responses:




                                                                                                                                              PART II
                        * Crashing the project
                        * Fast-tracking the project
                        * Overworking the project team
                        * Rushing the project work
                        * Rushing through quality control and quality audits to regain time

                       Remember earned value analysis? Earned value analysis measures project perfor-
                   mance. When project performance is waning, the project is likely missing targeted costs
                   and schedule goals. The results of earned value analysis can signal that risks are hap-
                   pening within the project or that new risks may be developing.
                       For example, a schedule performance index (SPI) of .93 means the project is off
                   schedule by 7 percent. A risk based on this value could mean that the project team is
                   having difficulty completing the project work as planned. Additional work will con-
                   tinue to be late, the project will finish late, and quality may suffer as the team attempts
                   to rush to complete assigned tasks.

                   Measuring Technical Performance
                   Throughout the project, the project team's technical competence with the technology
                   being used in the project should increase. The level of technical achievement should be
                   in proportion to the expected level of technical performance within the project. If the
                   project team is not performing at a level of expected technical expertise, the project may
                   suffer additional risks due to the discrepancy. Technical performance can be measured
                   by the successful completion of activities throughout the project or project phases.

                   Monitoring Contingency Reserve
                   As risk events happen, you'll need to keep an eye on the risk reserves and how this bud-
                   get for risk events is being depleted. Let's say you have a risk reserve of $250,000 based
                   on your quantitative analysis. When a risk begins, you'll use some of the reserve to off-
                   set the impact of the event or to pay for the risk response. The cost of the actual risk
                   event is subtracted from the $250,000--let's pretend in this instance it's $90,000. Now
                   the reserve only has $160,000 to cover the remaining risk events in the project. To
                   monitor the contingency reserve, you'll need to see what events are still left in the proj-
                   ect, what their probability and impact are, and compare the remaining risk exposure to
                   what's left in the reserve.

                         Examining the Results of Risk Monitoring and Control
                         Risk monitoring and control helps the project become more successful. Risk monitor-
                         ing and control measures the planned responses to risks and creates reactions to un-
                         planned risks. The outputs of risk monitoring and control also aim to help the project
                         reach its objectives. Consider these outputs:

                              * Risk register updates As the project moves along and the project manager
                                and the project team complete the risk assessments, audits, and risk reviews,
                                they'll need to record their findings in the risk register. This update may
                                include the reevaluation of the risk's impact, probability, and expected
                                monetary value. For those risks that have passed in the project, the risk register
                                should record what actually happened with the risk event and its impact on
                                the project.
                              * Change requests Your favorite, I'm sure. As workarounds and contingency
                                plans are used, they require changes to the project plan. Changes that occur as
                                a result of the risks are completed through integrated change control. The
                                changes are documented, approved, and incorporated into the project plan.
                              * Recommended corrective actions As risks come to fruition, corrective
                                actions are needed to bypass them. The two types of corrective action are
                                work-arounds and contingency plans. Corrective actions are actions taken to
                                bring the project back into compliance with the project plan.
                              * Recommended preventive actions Preventive actions are steps taken to
                                bring the project back into alignment with the project management plan.
                              * Risk response plan updates As risks occur, the responses to them should be
                                documented and updated in the risk response plan. Should risk rankings
                                change during the project, the change in ranking, the logic behind the change,
                                and the results of the risk rank change should be documented in the risk
                                response plan. For the risks that do not occur, the risks should be documented
                                and considered closed in the risk response plan.
                              * Organizational process asset updates The risks from the current project can
                                help other project managers in the future. Therefore, the project manager
                                must work to ensure that the current risks, their anticipated impact, and their
                                actual impact are recorded. The current risk probability and impact matrix, for
                                example, can become a risk template for other projects in the future. This is
                                true for just about any risk document--from the risk register to the risk
                                breakdown structure, lessons learned, and checklists.
                              * Project management plan updates Some change requests and risk
                                responses may require updates to the project management plan.

                                                                                                                                 439
                   Chapter Summary
                   All projects have some level of risks--just how much the project stakeholders are will-
                   ing to accept varies by project and organization. The quantification of the stakeholders'
                   tolerance for risk is called the utility function: the higher the project's importance, the
                   lower the utility function. Low-priority projects are generally more likely to accept risks
                   than those projects that have a big impact on your organization. Some organizations




                                                                                                                                               PART II
                   may define their utility function as a risk-reward ratio, where a project with a large
                   amount of risk must equate to a large amount of reward for doing the project.
                        Recall that at the launch of the risk planning process, there's the creation of the risk
                   management plan. This plan addresses how the project's risk management approach
                   will be directed. This plan is not specific to the risks within the project, but creates the
                   boundaries, expectations, and general rules for the risk management process. Once this
                   plan is in place and everyone is in agreement to abide by it, the project-specific risk
                   management activities can commence.
                        The first stop is all about risk identification. This isn't a private meeting--the proj-
                   ect team, project manager, project sponsor, vendors, stakeholders, end users, and even
                   customers can participate if it's necessary. Any project-relevant risks are documented.
                   It's good to have a variety of participants, as their point of view can help identify risks
                   that may have been overlooked otherwise.
                        As risks are identified, the project manager can use the Delphi Technique to build a
                   consensus on which risks have the highest impact on the project. This anonymous ap-
                   proach allows participants to speak freely about the risks, unhindered by the opinions
                   of other stakeholders. The comments on the identified risks are distributed to all of
                   the participants, allowing participants to comment, concur, or dismiss opinions on the
                   identified risks. Through rounds of discussion, a consensus on the risks is reached.
                        Quick, subjective, qualitative risk analysis almost always happens before quantita-
                   tive analysis. Qualitative analysis qualifies the risk for more analysis or identifies the
                   risk as a low-level risk event and adds it to the low-level risk watch list. More serious risk
                   events and the prioritized risk events of qualitative analysis go onto quantitative analy-
                   sis. Quantitative analysis provides an in-depth look at the risk events and aims to quan-
                   tify the risks.
                        Specifically, the risk exposure for the project is tied to a dollar amount. The risk ex-
                   posure is offset by a contingency reserve. Should risk events happen, monies from the
                   contingency reserve are used to counteract the risk events. Ongoing monitoring and
                   controlling of the risk events and their impact is essential to effective risk management.
                        Involved with all of these processes is the risk register. It's the project's journal and
                   database of risks, their status, their impact, and any supporting detail about the risk
                   events. As more information is gathered about the risks, the project management team
                   updates the risk register. As the project moves past risk events, their status and out-
                   comes are updated in the risk register. The risk register is part of the project manage-
                   ment plan and becomes, once the project closes, part of organizational process assets
                   for future projects.

                         Key Terms
                         Acceptance A risk response appropriate for both positive and negative risks, but often
                         used for smaller risks within a project.
                         Avoidance     A risk response to avoid the risk.
                         Brainstorming The most common approach to risk identification; usually completed
                         by a project team with subject matter experts to identify the risks within the project.
                         Business risks These risks may have negative or positive outcomes. Examples include
                         using a less experienced worker to complete a task, allowing phases or activities to over-
                         lap, or forgoing the expense of formal training for on-the-job education.
                         Cardinal scales A ranking approach to identify the probability and impact by using a
                         numerical value, from .01 (very low) to 1.0 (certain).
                         Checklists    A quick and cost-effective risk identification approach.
                         Data precision The consideration of the risk ranking scores that takes into account
                         any bias, the accuracy of the data submitted, and the reliability of the nature of the data
                         submitted.
                         Decision tree A method to determine which of two or more decisions is the best one.
                         The model examines the costs and benefits of each decision's outcome and weighs the
                         probability of success for each of the decisions.
                         Delphi Technique An anonymous method of querying experts about foreseeable
                         risks within a project, phase, or component of a project. The results of the survey are
                         analyzed by a third party, organized, and then circulated to the experts. There can be
                         several rounds of anonymous discussion with the Delphi Technique, without fear of
                         backlash or offending other participants in the process. The goal is to gain consensus
                         on project risks within the project.
                         Enhancing A risk response that attempts to enhance the conditions to ensure that a
                         positive risk event will likely happen.
                         Expected monetary value (EMV) The monetary value of a risk exposure based on the
                         risk's probability and impact in the risk matrix. This approach is typically used in quan-
                         titative risk analysis because it quantifies the risk exposure.
                         Exploit A risk response that takes advantage of the positive risks within a project.
                         External risks These risks are outside of the project, but directly affect it--for exam-
                         ple, legal issues, labor issues, a shift in project priorities, or weather. "Force majeure"
                         risks call for disaster recovery rather than project management. These are risks caused
                         by earthquakes, tornadoes, floods, civil unrest, and other disasters.
                         Flowcharts System or process flowcharts show the relationship between components
                         and how the overall process works. These are useful for identifying risks between system
                         components.

                   Influence diagrams An influence diagram charts out a decision problem. It identifies
                   all of the elements, variables, decisions, and objectives and also how each factor may
                   influence another.
                   Ishikawa diagrams These cause-and-effect diagrams are also called fishbone dia-
                   grams and are used to find the root cause of factors that are causing risks within the
                   project.
                   Low-priority risk watch list     Low-priority risks are identified and assigned to a watch




                                                                                                                                               PART II
                   list for periodic monitoring.
                   Mitigation A risk response effort to reduce the probability and/or impact of an identi-
                   fied risk in the project.
                   Monte Carlo technique A simulation technique that got its name from the casinos of
                   Monte Carlo, Monaco. The simulation is completed using a computer software pro-
                   gram that can simulate a project, using values for all possible variables, to predict the
                   most likely model.
                   Ordinal scales A ranking approach that identifies and ranks the risks from very high
                   to very unlikely or to some other value.
                   Organizational risks The performing organization can contribute to the project's
                   risks through unreasonable cost, time, and scope expectations; poor project prioritiza-
                   tion; inadequate funding or the disruption of funding; and competition with other
                   projects for internal resources.
                   Probability and impact matrix A matrix that ranks the probability of a risk event oc-
                   curring and its impact on the project if the event does happen; used in qualitative and
                   quantitative risk analyses.
                   Project management risks These risks deal with faults in the management of the
                   project: the unsuccessful allocation of time, resources, and scheduling; unacceptable
                   work results; and poor project management.
                   Pure risks These risks have only a negative outcome. Examples include loss of life or
                   limb, fire, theft, natural disasters, and the like.
                   Qualitative risk analysis This approach "qualifies" the risks that have been identified
                   in the project. Specifically, qualitative risk analysis examines and prioritizes risks based
                   on their probability of occurring and their impact on the project should they occur.
                   Quantitative risk analysis This approach attempts to numerically assess the proba-
                   bility and impact of the identified risks. It also creates an overall risk score for the proj-
                   ect. This method is more in-depth than qualitative risk analysis and relies on several
                   different tools to accomplish its goal.
                   RAG rating An ordinal scale that uses red, amber, and green (RAG) to capture the
                   probability, impact, and risk score.
                   Residual risks    Risks that are expected to remain after a risk response.

                         Risk A project risk is an uncertain event or condition that can have a positive or nega-
                         tive impact on the project.
                         Risk identification The systematic process of combing through the project, the proj-
                         ect plan, the work breakdown structure, and all supporting documentation to identify
                         as many risks that may affect the project as possible.
                         Risk management plan A project management subsidiary plan that defines how
                         risks will be identified, analyzed, responded to, and monitored within the project. The
                         plan also defines the iterative risk management process that the project is expected to
                         adhere to.
                         Risk management planning The agreed-upon approach to the management of the
                         project risk processes.
                         Risk owners The individuals or entities that are responsible for monitoring and re-
                         sponding to an identified risk within the project.
                         Risk register The risk register is a project plan component that contains all of the in-
                         formation related to the risk management activities. It's updated as risk management
                         activities are conducted to reflect the status, progress, and nature of the project risks.
                         Risk response audit      An audit to test the validity of the established risk responses.
                         Risk responsibilities      The level of ownership an individual or entity has over a proj-
                         ect risk.
                         Risk score The calculated score based on each risk's probability and impact. The ap-
                         proach can be used in both qualitative and quantitative risk analysis.
                         Root cause identification Root cause identification aims to find out why a risk event
                         may be occurring, the causal factors for the risk events, and then, eventually, how the
                         events can be mitigated or eliminated.
                         Secondary risks      New risks that are created as a result of a risk response.
                         Sensitivity analysis A quantitative risk analysis tool that examines each risk to deter-
                         mine which one has the largest impact on the project's success.
                         Sharing    A risk response that shares the advantages of a positive risk within a project.
                         SWOT analysis SWOT analysis is the process of examining the project from the per-
                         spective of each characteristic: strengths, weaknesses, opportunities, and threats.
                         Technical, quality, or performance risks Technical risks are associated with new, un-
                         proven, or complex technologies being used on the project. Changes to the technology
                         during the project implementation can also be a risk. Quality risks are the levels set for
                         expectations of impractical quality and performance.
                         Transference A risk response that transfers the ownership of the risk to another par-
                         ty. Insurance, licensed contractors, or other project teams are good examples of trans-
                         ference. A fee and contractual relationships are typically involved with the transference
                         of a risk.

                      1. Mary and Thomas are project managers for their organization and they're
                         discussing risk management and risk responses. Thomas insists that an
                         organization should never accept a project risk and Mary says that sometimes
                         it's okay. They've called on you, a project management expert, to help with
                         this decision. When is it appropriate to accept a project risk?
                         A. It is never appropriate to accept a project risk.




                                                                                                                                            PART II
                         B. All risks must be mitigated or transferred.
                         C. It is appropriate to accept a risk if the project team has never completed
                            this type of project work before.
                         D. It is appropriate if the risk is in balance with the reward.

                         agreed to substitute the type of plastic used in the product to a slightly thicker
                         grade should there be more than 7 percent error in production. The thicker plastic
                         will cost more and require the production to slow down, but the errors should
                         diminish. This is an example of which of the following?
                         A. Threshold

                                  A. The risk planning should always be the same amount of time as the
                                     activities required by the scope change.
                                  B. Risk planning should always occur whenever the scope is adjusted.

                             17. The water sanitation project manager has determined that the risks associated
                                 with handling certain chemicals are too high. He has decided to allow
                                 someone else to complete this portion of the project, and so has outsourced
                                 the handling and installation of the chemicals and filter equipment to an
                                 experienced contractor. This is an example of which of the following?

                       the project team to identify the project risks, rank the risks on probability and
                       impact, and then create a risk contingency reserve. As part of these processes,
                       you want to explore multiple scenarios of risk events in the project so you're
                       utilizing different tools to analyze the project risks. Based on this information,
                       which of the following can determine multiple scenarios, given various risks
                       and the probability of their impact?

                         Questions and Answers
                              1. Mary and Thomas are project managers for their organization and they're
                                 discussing risk management and risk responses. Thomas insists that an
                                 organization should never accept a project risk and Mary says that sometimes
                                 it's okay. They've called on you, a project management expert, to help with
                                 this decision. When is it appropriate to accept a project risk?
                                  A. It is never appropriate to accept a project risk.
                                  B. All risks must be mitigated or transferred.
                                  C. It is appropriate to accept a risk if the project team has never completed
                                     this type of project work before.
                                  D. It is appropriate if the risk is in balance with the reward.
                                 D. Risks that are in balance with the reward are appropriate for acceptance.
                                 Risk acceptance as a response planning technique to an identified risk is
                                 appropriate when the cost of a mitigation strategy is equal to or greater than
                                 the cost of the risk event to the project should the risk event occur. A, B, and
                                 C are all incorrect because these solutions are all false responses to risk
                                 management.
                              2. Frances is the project manager of the LKJ Project. Which of the following
                                 techniques will she use to create the risk management plan?
                                  A. Risk tolerance
                                  B. Status meetings
                                  C. Planning meetings
                                  D. Variance meetings
                                 C. Planning meetings are used to create the risk management plan. The
                                 project manager, project team leaders, key stakeholders, and other individuals
                                 with the power to make decisions regarding risk management attend the
                                 meetings. A, B, and D are incorrect because these choices do not fully answer
                                 the question.
                              3. You are the project manager of the GHK Project. You and the manufacturer
                                 have agreed to substitute the type of plastic used in the product to a
                                 slightly thicker grade should there be more than 7 percent error in
                                 production. The thicker plastic will cost more and require the production
                                 to slow down, but the errors should diminish. This is an example of which
                                 of the following?
                                  A. Threshold
                                  B. Tracking
                                  C. Budgeting
                                  D. JIT manufacturing

                                                                                                                           449
                     A. An error value of 7 percent represents the threshold the project is
                     allowed to operate under. Should the number of errors increase beyond 7
                     percent, the current plastic will be substituted. B is incorrect because
                     tracking is the documentation of a process through a system or workflow,
                     or the documentation of events through the process. C, budgeting, is also
                     incorrect. D is incorrect because JIT manufacturing is a scheduling
                     approach to ordering the materials only when they are needed in order to




                                                                                                                                         PART II
                     keep inventory costs down.
                   4. You are a project manager consultant for the Allen T1 Company and you're
                      helping them create a risk management plan for their project management
                      office. You're explaining the concept of risk tolerance and how it affects the
                      risk management policies. An organization's risk tolerance is also known as
                      what?
                      A. The utility function
                      B. Herzberg's theory of motivation
                      C. Risk acceptance
                      D. The risk-reward ratio
                     A. The utility function describes an organization's willingness to tolerate risk.
                     B is incorrect. Herzberg's Theory of Motivation is a human resource theory
                     that describes motivating agents for workers. C is also incorrect. Risk
                     acceptance describes the action of allowing a risk to exist because it is deemed
                     low in impact, low in probability, or both. D, the risk-reward ratio, is
                     incorrect. This describes the potential reward for taking on a risk in the project.
                   5. The customers of the project have requested additions to the project scope.
                      The project manager notifies you that additional risk planning will need to be
                      added to the project schedule. Why?
                      A. The risk planning should always be the same amount of time as the
                         activities required by the scope change.
                      B. Risk planning should always occur whenever the scope is adjusted.
                      C. Risk planning should only occur at the project manager's discretion.
                      D. The project manager is incorrect. Risk planning does not need to happen
                         at every change in the project.
                     B. When the scope has been changed, the project manager should require risk
                     planning to analyze the changes for risks to the project's success. A is incorrect.
                     The scope changes may not require the same amount of time as the activities
                     needed to complete the risk planning. C is incorrect because risk planning
                     should not occur at the project manager's discretion. Instead, it should be
                     based on evidence within the project and the policies adopted in the risk
                     management plan. D is also incorrect. When changes are added to the project
                     scope, risk planning should occur.

                              6. Jason is the project manager for his organization and he's working with his
                                 project team to identify and analyze project risks. Jason begins to create a
                                 risk register as part of this process, but his team doesn't understand what
                                 a risk register is or its purpose. Which one of the following best describes
                                 the risk register?
                                  A. It documents all of the outcomes of the other risk management processes.
                                  B. It's a document that contains the initial risk identification entries.
                                  C. It's a system that tracks all negative risks within a project.
                                  D. It's part of the project's project management information system (PMIS)
                                     for integrated change control.
                                 A. The risk register documents all of the outcomes of the other risk
                                 management processes. B, C, and D are all incorrect definitions of the risk
                                 register.

                                 you're helping them categorize risks they may encounter in their projects.
                                 For starters, you identify some basic risk categories but your client wants
                                 to see some examples of these categories. You tell them, for example, that
                                 _______________________ include(s) fire, theft, or injury, and offer(s) no
                                 chance for gain.
                                  A. Business risks
                                  B. Pure risks
                                  C. Risk acceptance
                                  D. Life risks
                                 B. Pure risks are the risks that could threaten the safety of the individuals on
                                 the project. A is incorrect because business risks affect the financial gains or
                                 losses of a project. C and D are incorrect because these terms are not relevant.
                              8. Complete this sentence: A project risk is a(n) ______________________
                                 occurrence that can affect the project for good or bad.
                                  A. Known

                                 C. Risks are not planned; they are left to chance. The accommodation and the
                                 reaction to a risk can be planned, but the event itself is not planned. If risks
                                 could be planned, Las Vegas would be out of business. A, B, and D are all
                                 incorrect because these terms do not accurately complete the sentence.
                              9. Bradley is the project manager for his organization and he's working with his
                                 project team to identify risks. Some of the project team members are confused

                       as to when risk identification should happen in the project. When should risk
                       identification happen?
                       A. As early as possible in the initiation process
                       B. As early as possible in the planning process
                       C. Throughout the product management life cycle
                       D. Throughout the project life cycle




                                                                                                                                           PART II
                       D. Risk identification is an iterative process that happens throughout the
                       project's life cycle. A and B are both incorrect because risk identification is not
                       limited to any one process group. C is incorrect because risk identification
                       happens, technically, throughout the project management life cycle, which is
                       unique to each project, and not through the product management life cycle.
                   10. You are the project manager of the KLJH Project. This project will last two
                       years and has 30 stakeholders. How often should risk identification take
                       place?
                       A. Once at the beginning of the project
                       B. Throughout the execution processes
                       C. Throughout the project
                       D. Once per project phase
                       C. Risk identification happens throughout the project. Recall that planning is
                       iterative: as the project moves toward completion, new risks may surface that
                       call for identification and planned responses. A is incorrect. Risk
                       identification should happen throughout the project, not just at the
                       beginning. B is incorrect because risk identification is part of planning. D is
                       incorrect because the nature of the project phase may require and reveal more
                       than one opportunity for risk identification.
                   11. Ruth is a project management expert and consultant for businesses creating
                       project management offices. Ruth's current client wants help to better identify
                       risks. Which one of the following is an acceptable tool for risk identification?
                       A. Decision tree analysis
                       B. Decomposition of the project scope
                       C. The Delphi Technique
                       D. Pareto charting
                       C. The Delphi Technique, an anonymous risk identification method, is the
                       correct answer. A is incorrect. Decision tree analysis is appropriate for
                       calculating the expected monetary value of a decision, but not risk
                       identification. B is incorrect because the decomposition of the project scope
                       will result in the WBS. D is incorrect. Creating a Pareto chart is part of quality
                       control, not risk identification.

                             12. You are the project manager for a project that will create a new and improved
                                 web site for your company. Currently, your company has over 8 million users
                                 around the globe. You would like to poll experts within your organization
                                 with a simple, anonymous form asking about any foreseeable risks in the
                                 design, structure, and intent of the web site. With the collected information,
                                 subsequent anonymous polls are submitted to the group of experts. This is an
                                 example of _________________________________.

                                 D. An anonymous poll that allows experts to freely submit their opinion
                                 without fear of backlash is an example of the Delphi Technique. A, B, and C
                                 are incorrect. These choices do not accurately answer the question.
                             13. Alice is a project manager for her organization and she's working with
                                 the project team to identify project risks and rank them by impact and
                                 probability. Which risk analysis technique provides the project manager with
                                 a risk ranking?
                                  A. Quantifiable
                                  B. Qualitative
                                  C. The utility function
                                  D. SWOT analysis
                                 B. The risk ranking is based on the very high, high, medium, low, and very
                                 low attributes of the identified risks. A is incorrect because it is not relevant to
                                 the question. This answer is quantifiable, not quantitative. C is incorrect.
                                 "Utility function" describes an organization's tolerance for risk. D, SWOT
                                 analysis, is part of risk identification.
                             14. A table of risks, their probability, impact, and a number representing the
                                 overall risk score is called a ____________________________.
                                  A. Risk table
                                  B. Probability-impact matrix

                                  D. Qualitative matrix
                                 B. A table of risks, their probability, and impact equate to a risk score, and is a
                                 risk probability-impact matrix. A is incorrect because it does not fully answer
                                 the question. C and D are incorrect because a risk matrix can be used in both
                                 quantitative and qualitative risk analyses.

                       What is the EMV for Risk Event 3?
                       A. $135
                       B. -$300
                       C. $45
                       D. -$135
                       D. Risk Event 3 has a probability of 45 percent and an impact cost of -$300,
                       which equates to -$135. A, B, and C are incorrect because their values are
                       wrong answers for the formula.

                                 A, B, and D are incorrect answers because they do not reflect the contingency

                             17. The water sanitation project manager has determined that the risks associated
                                 with handling certain chemicals are too high. He has decided to allow
                                 someone else to complete this portion of the project, and so has outsourced
                                 the handling and installation of the chemicals and filter equipment to an
                                 experienced contractor. This is an example of which of the following?
                                  A. Avoidance
                                  B. Acceptance

                                  D. Transference
                                 D. Because the risk is not eliminated but transferred to someone else or
                                 another entity, it is considered transference. A is incorrect because the risk still
                                 exists--it is just being handled by another entity. B is incorrect because the
                                 project manager has not accepted the risk, deciding instead to allow another
                                 entity to deal with it. C is incorrect. The risk has not been mitigated in the
                                 project.
                             18. A project manager and the project team are actively monitoring the pressure
                                 gauge on a piece of equipment. Sarah, the engineer, recommends a series of
                                 steps to be implemented should the pressure rise above 80 percent. The 80
                                 percent mark represents what?
                                  A. An upper control limit
                                  B. The threshold
                                  C. Mitigation
                                  D. A work-around
                                 B. The 80 percent mark is a threshold. A is incorrect. An upper control limit is
                                 a boundary for quality in a control chart. C is incorrect. Mitigation is a
                                 planned response should a risk event happen. D is also incorrect. A work-
                                 around is an action to bypass the risk event.

                       What would Risk Event 6 be, based on the following information: Marty is
                       60 percent certain that he can get the facility needed for $45,000, which is
                       $7,000 less than what was planned for.
                       A. .60, 45,000, 27,000
                       B. .60, 52,000, 31,200
                       C. .60, 7,000, 4,200
                       D. .60, -7,000, -4,200
                       C. Marty is 60 percent certain that he can save the project $7,000. The $4,200
                       represents the 60 percent certainty of the savings. A, B, and D are all incorrect
                       since these values do not reflect the potential savings of the project.
                   20. You are the project manager for your organization and you're working with
                       the project team to identify the project risks, rank the risks on probability and
                       impact, and then create a risk contingency reserve. As part of these processes
                       you want to explore multiple scenarios of risk events in the project so you're
                       utilizing different tools to analyze the project risk. Based on this information,
                       which of the following can determine multiple scenarios, given various risks
                       and the probability of their impact?
                       A. A decision tree
                       B. The Monte Carlo technique
                       C. A Pareto chart
                       D. A Gantt chart
                       B. The Monte Carlo technique can reveal multiple scenarios and examine the
                       risks and probability of impact. A, a decision tree, helps guide the decision-
                       making process. C, a Pareto chart, helps identify the leading problems in a
                       situation. D, a Gantt chart, compares the lengths of activities against a
                       calendar in a bar chart format.

                                                                                                                        12
                     In this chapter, you will
                        * Plan for project procurement
                        * Select the project vendors
                        * Create contracts for the project work
                        * Control and administer the contractual relationships
                        * Close out the contract with the project vendors




                   Projects routinely require procurements. Projects need materials, equipment, consul-
                   tants, training, books, software, hardware, and lots of other stuff in order for the project
                   to be successful. Project procurement management is the process of purchasing the
                   products necessary to meet the needs of the project scope. It's also the control and de-
                   livery of the promises made between the buyer and the seller.

                      Procurement management also involves planning, requesting seller information,
                   choosing a source, administering the contract, and closing out the contract. Procure-
                   ment management, as far as your Certified Associate in Project Management (CAPM)
                   and Project Management Professional (PMP) exams are concerned, focuses on the
                   practices from the buyer's point of view, not the seller's. Usually. Sometimes, you may
                   be presented as the vendor that is completing a project for your customer, the buyer.
                   You should also recognize that the seller can be seen as a contractor, subcontractor,
                   vendor, or supplier. In whatever situation you're put into on your exam, always do
                   what's "fair" for both parties and what's in the best interest of the project scope.
                      When buying anything from a vendor, the buyer needs a contract. A contract be-
                   comes a key input to many of the processes within the project. The contract, above
                   anything else, specifies the rules and agreements for the project.

                                video now.

                      Here's a neat twist: When the seller is completing his or her obligations to supply a
                   product, the Project Management Institute (PMI) treats those obligations as a project. In

                                                                                                                    457

                         other words, if ABC Electricians was wiring a building for your company, ABC Electri-
                         cians would be the performing organization completing its own project. Your company
                         becomes the customer of their project--and is, of course, a stakeholder in their project.
                             In the scenarios described in this chapter, the seller will be outside of the performing
                         organization. The buyer will be managing a project and procuring resources from a ven-
                         dor. However, all of the details in this chapter can be applied to internal work orders,
                         formal agreements, and contracts between organizational units within a single entity.


                         Planning for Procurement
                         Procurement planning is the process of identifying which part of the project should be
                         procured from resources outside of the organization. Generally, procurement decisions are
                         made early on in the planning processes. Procurement planning centers on four elements:

                              * Whether procurement is needed
                              * What to procure
                              * How much to procure
                              * When to procure

                             The project schedule is also taken into consideration when procurement decisions
                         are made. Consider the lead time from when the purchase decision is made to when
                         the purchase actually happens. And then consider the time from when the purchase
                         happens to the time when the vendor actually delivers the goods or services. In light of
                         the schedule, it's often more practical to just hire an expert to complete the work than
                         to do the work in-house because of limited resources, the expertise of the internal re-
                         sources, and the promised (or demanded) project completion date.
                             There are nine inputs to the plan purchases and acquisitions processes:

                              * Project management plan The project management plan is needed because
                                the decisions made in the project may affect the procurement processes, and the
                                procurement process can alter previous plans and decisions in the project. From
                                the project management plan, you'll pay special attention to the scope baseline
                                as part of your procurement planning. Because the project scope statement
                                defines the project work--and only the required work--to complete the project,
                                it also defines the limitations of the project. The work breakdown structure
                                (WBS) is needed during procurement decisions because it exposes all of the
                                project deliverables and what needs to be purchased to create all of the promised
                                deliverables. And if you're going to use the WBS, you might as well rely on the
                                WBS dictionary, too. The WBS dictionary provides the full description of the WBS
                                deliverables. This can, of course, help the project manager and the project team
                                determine exactly what should be procured and what should not.
                              * Requirements documentation You need to know exactly what the project is
                                required to deliver so that the customer will accept what the project creates. The
                                requirements documentation will define the requirements for project acceptance.

                                                                                                                               459
                           These documents may also contain information about the contractual and legal
                           obligations the project must adhere to. Consider safety, licenses and permits,
                           insurance, environmental, and industry-specific requirements.
                        * Risk register In Chapter 11, I discussed the risk register: the centralized
                          database of all project risks and their impact. The risk exposure, risk owners,
                          and risk responses may all need to be considered for possible procurement
                          decisions.




                                                                                                                                             PART II
                        * Activity resource requirements Resources are people and things. A project
                          manager may need to hire a consultant, a contractor, or a new employee to
                          complete the project work. Resource requirements may also include tools,
                          equipment, and materials. All of this costs--cha-ching!--money.
                        * Project schedule The project schedule helps with cash-flow forecasting, the
                          consideration of purchase decisions, and the timing for procurement
                          processes.
                        * Activity cost estimates Remember these from Chapter 7? You'll need your
                          cost estimates to complete cost budgeting and to track your expenses for
                          activities.
                        * Stakeholder register The project manager and team will need the contact
                          information for the stakeholders interested in the procurement decisions.
                          Some decisions in procurement may affect the interests of stakeholders--
                          consider costs, materials, schedules, and contractual obligations.
                        * Enterprise environmental factors These are the conditions of the
                          marketplace; the available products, services, and results; the availability of
                          the things you'd like to purchase; and the terms and conditions of the
                          purchase agreement. If your organization doesn't have a formal purchasing
                          department, the project team has to step up and complete the project
                          procurement activities.
                        * Organizational process assets When it comes to purchases, you likely have
                          rules and procedures unique to your organization on how you can buy anything
                          for your project. The internal rules in your organization police how the project
                          manager may purchase, negotiate, agree to contractual obligations, and pay the
                          vendor. (If you don't have these rules and policies in your organization, allow
                          me to offer my services directly to you. Sign on the dotted line.)

                   Determining the Contract Type
                   There are multiple types of contracts when it comes to procurement. The project work, the
                   market, and the nature of the purchase determine the contract type. Here are some general
                   rules that CAPM and PMP exam candidates, and project managers, should know:

                        * A contract is a formal agreement between the buyer and the seller. Contracts
                          can be oral or written--although written is preferred.

                              * The United States backs all contracts through the court system.
                              * Contracts should clearly state all requirements for product acceptance.
                              * Any changes to the contract must be formally approved, controlled, and
                                documented.
                              * A contract is not fulfilled until all of its requirements are met.
                              * Contracts can be used as a risk mitigation tool, as in transferring the risk. All
                                contracts have some level of risk; depending on the contract type, the risk can
                                be transferred to the seller. If a risk response strategy is to transfer, risks
                                associated with procurement are considered secondary risks and must go
                                through the risk management process.
                              * There are legal requirements governing contracts. For a contract to be valid, it
                                must:
                                 * Contain an offer
                                 * Have been accepted
                                 * Provide for a consideration (payment)
                                 * Be for a legal purpose
                                 * Be executed by someone with the capacity and authority
                              * The terms and conditions of the contract should define breaches, copyrights,
                                intellectual rights, and force majeure.

                                       EXAM TIP Force majeure is a powerful and unexpected event, such as a
                                       hurricane or other natural disaster.


                         Fixed-Price Contracts
                         These contracts must clearly define the requirements the vendor is to provide. These
                         contracts may also provide incentives for meeting or exceeding contract requirements--
                         such as meeting deadlines--and require the seller to assume the risk of cost overruns,
                         as Figure 12-1 demonstrates.

                         Cost-Reimbursable Contracts
                         These contract types pay the seller for the product. The payment to the seller includes a
                         profit margin--the difference between the actual costs of the product and the sales
                         amount. The actual costs of the product fall into two categories:

                              * Direct costs Costs incurred by the project in order for the project to exist.
                                Examples include the equipment needed to complete the project work, the
                                salaries of the project team, and other expenses tied directly to the project's
                                existence.
                              * Indirect costs Costs attributed to the cost of doing business. Examples
                                include utilities, office space, and other overhead costs.

                        * Cost-reimbursable contracts require the buyer to assume the risk of cost
                          overruns. There are three types of cost-reimbursable contracts:
                           * Cost plus fixed fee
                           * Cost plus percentage of costs
                           * Cost plus incentive fee

                                 EXAM TIP Cost plus percentage of costs is not used often--and isn't allowed
                                 in many organizations. Don't plan on seeing this contract type on your exam.


                   Time and Materials Contracts
                   Time and materials (T&M) contracts are sometimes called unit price contracts. They are
                   ideal when an organization contracts out a small project or when smaller amounts of
                   work within a larger project are to be completed by a vendor. T&M contracts, however,
                   can grow dangerously out of control as more work is assigned to the seller. While time
                   and materials is an easy to create and administer contract type, it can pose a threat to
                   the buyer if a "not-to-exceed" clause is not included in the contract. A not-to-exceed
                   clause states the maximum amount of monies the vendor can bill for the contracted
                   work. Figure 12-2 is an example of how T&M contracts can pose a risk for the buyer.

                   Figure 12-2                                                                Cost

                         Understanding Contract Types
                         On the CAPM and PMP examinations, you can anticipate a few questions on contract
                         types. Familiarize yourself with Table 12-1.

                                       EXAM TIP The contractual relationship between the buyer and the seller is
                                       often considered confidential. The terms, conditions, and private nature of a
                                       contractual relationship are known as privity.

                         Using the Procurement Planning Tools
                         Procurement planning should be done early in the planning processes, with certain
                         exceptions. As needs arise, as project conditions change, or as other circumstances de-
                         mand, procurement planning may be required throughout the project. Whenever pro-
                         curement planning happens early in the project, as preferred, or later in the project, as
                         needed, a logical approach to securing the proper resources is necessitated.

                         Determining to Make or Buy
                         The decision to make or buy a product is a fundamental aspect of project management.
                         In some conditions, it is more cost-effective to buy; in others, it makes more sense to
                         create an in-house solution. The make-or-buy analysis should be made in the initial
                         scope definition to determine if the entire project should be completed in-house or
                         procured. As the project evolves, additional make-or-buy decisions are often needed.
                              The initial costs of the solution for the in-house or procured product must be
                         considered, but so, too, must the ongoing expenses of the solutions. For example, a
                         company may elect to lease a piece of equipment. The ongoing expense of leasing the
                         piece of equipment should be weighed against the expected ongoing expense of pur-
                         chasing the equipment and the monthly costs to maintain, insure, and manage the
                         equipment.
                              For example, Figure 12-3 shows the mathematical approach to determining wheth-
                         er it is better to create a software program in-house or to buy one from a software com-
                         pany. The in-house solution will cost your company $25,000 to create your own
                         software package and, based on historical information, another $2,500 per month to
                         maintain it.
                              The development company has a solution that will cost your company $17,000 to
                         purchase, but the development company requires a maintenance plan for each software
                         program installed, which will cost your company $2,700 per month. The difference
                         between making the software and buying it is $8,000. The difference between support-
                         ing the software the organization has made and allowing the external company to sup-
                         port their software is only $200 per month.
                              The $200 per month is divided into the difference between creating the software
                         internally and buying it--which is $8,000 divided by $200, or 40 months. If the soft-
                         ware is to be replaced within 40 months, the company should buy the software. If the
                         software will not be replaced within 40 months, it should build the software.

                         need to know the
                         make-or-buy process.




                            There are multiple reasons why an organization may choose to make or buy. Table 12-2
                         provides some common reasons for making and buying.

                                        EXAM TIP You may be presented with one or two questions on make-or-
                                        buy analysis. In the preceding example, and on the exam, you won't be
                                        confronted with the tax benefits of make-or-buy--although in your job as a
                                        project manager, you may be. For the exam, focus on determining which is the
                                        most cost-effective, fair solution.

                         Using Expert Judgment
                         Procurement planning can rely on expert judgment. It may be beneficial to rely on the
                         wisdom of others--whether those in the performing organization or subject matter

                   management planning can come from the following:

                        * Units or individuals within the performing organization
                        * Consultants and subject matter experts
                        * Professional, trade, or technical associations
                        * Industry groups




                                                                                                                                               PART II
                   Examining the Results of Procurement Planning
                   Procurement planning is a process that should happen early in the planning processes.
                   The outputs of procurement planning allow the project manager and the project team
                   to proceed with confidence in the procuring of products and services needed to success-
                   fully complete the project. If it is determined early in the project that there's no need for
                   procurements, then, obviously, the remaining procurement processes are unnecessary
                   for the project.

                   The Procurement Management Plan
                   This subsidiary project plan documents the decisions made in the procurement plan-
                   ning processes and specifies how the remaining procurement activities will be man-
                   aged. The plan details the following:

                        * How vendors will be selected
                        * The type of contracts to be used
                        * The risk management approach for contracted work
                        * The process of independent estimating
                        * The relationship between the project team and the procurement office within
                          the performing organization (if one exists)
                        * The management of lead time for procurement and vendor delivery
                        * Requirements for performance bonds and vendor insurance
                        * Identification of an approved vendors list (if appropriate according to
                          organizational requirements)
                        * The procurement forms, such as contracts, the project team is required to use
                        * How multiple vendors will be managed to supply their contracted product
                        * The coordination between sellers and the project team and among project
                          activities, project reporting, scheduling, business operations, and other project
                          concerns

                         Using the Procurement Statement of Work
                         In the procurement statement of work (often just called the SOW), the seller fully de-
                         scribes the work to be completed and/or the product to be supplied. The SOW becomes
                         part of the contract between the buyer and the seller. It is typically created as part of the
                         procurement planning process, and it allows the seller to determine if he or she can
                         meet the written requirements of the SOW.
                             Particular industries have different assumptions about what constitutes an SOW.
                         What one industry calls an SOW may be a statement of objectives (SOO) in another. An
                         SOO is a document describing a problem to be solved by the seller.

                                       EXAM TIP The SOW can be updated as the project moves through
                                       negotiations with the vendor or as more details about the purchase become
                                       available.


                         Creating the Procurement Documents
                         The primary outputs of the plan-contracting process are the procurement documents.
                         These documents guide the relationship between the buyer and the seller. Communi-
                         cation between the buyer and the seller should always be specific as to the require-
                         ments and expectations of the seller. In initial communications, especially when re-
                         questing a price or proposal, the buyer should include the contract statement of work,
                         relevant specifications, and, if necessary, any nondisclosure agreements (NDAs). Re-
                         quests from buyers to sellers should be specific enough to give the seller a clear idea of
                         what the buyer is requesting, but general enough to allow the seller to provide viable
                         alternatives.
                             Here are some specific documents the project manager--and the PMP and CAPM
                         candidate--should be familiar with:

                              * Invitation for Bid (IFB) From buyer to seller. Requests the seller to provide
                                a price for the procured product or service.
                              * Request for Quote (RFQ) From buyer to seller. Requests the seller to
                                provide a price for the procured product or service.
                              * Request for Proposal (RFP) From buyer to seller. Requests the seller to
                                provide a proposal to complete the procured work or to provide the procured
                                product.
                              * Purchase order (PO) A purchase order is a form of a unilateral contract that
                                the buyer provides to the vendor and shows the purchase has been approved
                                by the buyer's organization.
                              * Request for Information (RFI) From buyer to seller. Requests the seller to
                                provide more information about the seller's products and/or services.
                              * Bid From seller to buyer. Price is the determining factor in the decision-
                                making process.

                                of your study efforts, your positive outlook for passing the exam, and the

                                your PMI exam--you deserve it!

                   Creating Source Selection Criteria
                   Another output of the plan-contracting process is the evaluation criteria. This is used to
                   rate and score proposals from the sellers. In some instances, such as with a bid or quote,
                   the evaluation criteria are focused just on the price the seller offers. In other instances,
                   such as a proposal, the evaluation criteria can be multiple values: experience, referenc-
                   es, certifications, and more. The project management team can use any combination of
                   the following questions to help determine which vendor should be selected to supply
                   the project's procurement needs:

                        * Does the vendor understand the project needs?
                        * What's the overall cost of the project?
                        * What's the life-cycle cost of the deliverable?
                        * Does the seller have the technical capability to complete the deliverable?
                        * What's the vendor's technical approach to the project's needs?
                        * What's the vendor's management approach to creating the deliverable?
                        * Does the seller have the financial backing to deliver as promised?
                        * Will the vendor have sustained capacity and interest in the project's
                          deliverable for future assignments?
                        * What is the vendor's business model? Is it a small business, woman-owned, or
                          disadvantaged business that may qualify for the contract as defined in some
                          governmental agencies?
                        * Can the vendor provide references?
                        * Who retains the intellectual and proprietary property rights?

                       These questions--and others--can help the project management team make the
                   best decision when it comes to choosing which vendor should support the project. For
                   your PMP or CAPM exam, always choose the vendor that offers the best solution for the
                   project.

                         Conducting Procurements
                         Once the plan-contracting process has been completed, the actual process of asking the
                         sellers to participate can begin. Fortunately, the sellers, not the buyers, perform most of
                         the activity in this process--usually at no additional cost to the project. The sellers are
                         busy trying to win the business. There are eight inputs to the conduct procurement
                         process:

                              * Procurement management plan This plan is needed because it directs the
                                procurement processes. Go figure.
                              * Procurement documents These are created in plan-contracting processes.
                                These are the Invitation for Bid (IFB), Request for Proposal (RFP), and
                                Request for Quote (RFQ) documents.
                              * Source selection criteria The project management team and the
                                organization identify what attributes the vendor must have to qualify for the
                                contract.
                              * Seller proposals Vendors will provide the project manager a response to a
                                RFP, IFB, or RFQ. Proposals will undergo an evaluation to determine how well
                                the proposals satisfy the procurement need of the organization.
                              * Project documents You'll need to reference the risk register and risk-related
                                contractual agreements if the project is to use the risk response of transference.
                              * Make-or-buy decisions The results of the project's make-or-buy decisions
                                are needed because these direct the project manager to purchase resources for
                                the project.
                              * Procurement statement of work The statement of work defines what your
                                project wants to procure from the vendors. It lists the specifics of what you
                                want to buy and what you want the vendors to provide. It's this document
                                that the vendors will utilize to create their responses.
                              * Organizational process assets Yes, you've seen organizational process assets
                                throughout the project, but the specific asset you're considering is a history of
                                qualified sellers. A list of qualified sellers (also preferred sellers or approved
                                sellers) generally has contact information, history of past experience with the
                                seller, and other pertinent information. In addition to the internal qualified
                                seller list, there are other resources that can help determine which sellers may
                                qualify for the proposed work: Internet resources, industry directories, trade
                                associations, and so on.


                         Hosting a Bidder Conference
                         Buy some donuts and make the coffee--all your bidders are coming over! A bidder
                         conference, also called a contractor conference or vendor conference, is a meeting with
                         prospective sellers to ensure that all sellers have a clear understanding of the product or
                         service to be procured and are all on equal footing. Bidder conferences allow sellers to

                                                                                        Chapter 12: Managing Project Procurement

                                                                                                                                469
                   query the buyer on the details of the project statement of work to help ensure that their
                   proposals are adequate and appropriate for the proposed agreement. At this point in
                   the process, all sellers are considered equal.

                   Advertising for Sellers
                   Have you ever opened your Sunday newspaper and checked out the classifieds?
                   Chances are, you've seen classified ads announcing opportunities for organizations




                                                                                                                                              PART II
                   to bid on upcoming projects. That's the idea behind this tool and technique. These
                   advertisements usually run in newspapers or trade journals specific to the industry of
                   the organization. Some government agencies require advertisements inviting sellers
                   to solicit the project work, attend a bidder conference, or present a proposal for the
                   described work.

                   Creating a Qualified Sellers List
                   One of the inputs to this process is to rely on your organizational process assets' quali-
                   fied sellers list. If the organization doesn't have such a list, the project management
                   team can start creating one. The qualified sellers list can be created through trade mag-
                   azines, interviews, the Internet, interviews with past customers, and even site visits. It's
                   a bunch of fun!


                   Selecting a Seller
                   Once the sellers have presented their proposals, bids, or quotes (depending on what
                   the buyer requested), their documents are examined so that the project manager can
                   select which sellers are the best choice for the project work. In many instances, price
                   may be the predominant factor for choosing a particular seller--but not always. Other
                   factors besides price may also be taken into consideration:

                        * The cost of an item may not reflect the true cost to the performing
                          organization if the item cannot be delivered in a timely manner. If a seller
                          promises to have a product on site by a specific date and fails to do so, the
                          project can be delayed, costing the organization thousands--or more--in
                          losses.
                        * Proposals can be separated into two categories: technical and commercial.
                          The technical category describes the approach and methodology to
                          complete the project work. The commercial category delves into the price
                          to complete the project work. An evaluation takes into consideration both
                          categories in order to determine the best choice for the project.
                        * Critical, high-priority projects may rely on multiple sellers to complete the
                          project work. This redundancy can balance risk, cost, and opportunity among
                          multiple vendors.

                         Examining Vendor Responses
                         The procurement document package is a collection of documents prepared by the buyer
                         and sent to each of the vendors that may participate in the procurement process. The
                         procurement document package defines the requirements of the purchase, specifies the
                         needs, and describes how the vendor should respond.
                              The end result of requesting a seller response is, as expected, a collection of propos-
                         als, bids, or quotations, depending on what the buyer asked for. These documents indi-
                         cate the sellers' ability and preparedness to complete the project work. The proposals
                         should be in alignment with the stated expectations of the buyer, and they may be pre-
                         sented orally, electronically, or in hardcopy format. Of course, the relationship between
                         the buyer and seller--and the type of information being shared--will determine which
                         modality is the best choice of communication.

                         Choosing the Seller
                         For the performing organization to finalize the process of selecting a vendor, there must
                         first be eligible sellers. Assuming more than one seller can satisfy the demands of the
                         project, there are seven tools and techniques the project manager can rely on:

                              * Weighting system A weighting system takes out the personal preferences
                                of the decision maker in the organization to ensure that the best seller is
                                awarded the contract. A weighting system creates a matrix, as seen in Figure
                                12-4. Weights are assigned to the values of the proposals, and each proposal
                                is scored. Because the weights are determined before reviewing the proposals,
                                the process is guaranteed to be free of personal preferences and bias. The seller
                                with the highest score is awarded the contract.
                              * Independent estimates These estimates are often referred to as "should/cost"
                                estimates. These estimates are created either by the performing organization or
                                outside experts to predict what the cost of the procured product should be. If
                                there is a significant difference between what the organization has predicted
                                and what the sellers have proposed, either the statement of work was inadequate,
                                or the sellers have misunderstood the requirements.

                                                                                                                               471
                        * Screening system A screening system is a tool that filters or screens out
                          vendors that don't qualify for the contract. For example, the project manager
                          could say that only vendors that have built eight bridges in Utah can qualify
                          for the contract. Sellers that don't meet the requirements are removed from
                          the selection process, and their proposals are not considered.
                        * Contract negotiation The performing organization creates an offer, and the
                          seller considers the offer. The contract negotiation process is an activity to




                                                                                                                                             PART II
                          create a fair price for the work the seller is to complete. The performing
                          organization and the seller must be in agreement on the expectations,
                          requirements, authorities, terms, technical and business management
                          approaches, price--and any other pertinent factors covered within and by the
                          contract--prior to signing the contract.
                        * Seller rating systems Seller rating systems are used by organizations to rate
                          prior experience with each vendor that it has worked with in the past. The
                          seller rating system can track performance, quality ratings, delivery, and even
                          contract compliance. The project manager of the current project can reference
                          this internal seller rating system to determine the expectations of working
                          with a vendor based on the vendor's past performance.
                        * Expert judgment Sometimes, the project manager isn't the best person to
                          make a decision as to which vendor should be selected. Consider very large
                          projects, like building a new skyscraper. The project manager likely wouldn't
                          be the only person involved in making the procurement decision, but rather
                          a team comprising different experts would contribute to the decision.
                        * Proposal evaluation techniques This big bucket of tools and techniques
                          can include objective and subjective considerations from experts within the
                          organization, weighting systems, multiple reviewers, scoring systems,
                          screening systems--just about any source-selection technique that the project
                          management team feels like using. The point is that there are many different
                          approaches to compare and contrast proposals, so the project management
                          team should use all of the appropriate techniques available to make the best
                          decision for the good of the project.
                        * Internet search No doubt the Internet has changed the way companies buy
                          and sell goods and services. Many commercially available goods can be located
                          online at a guaranteed fixed-price for organizations. However, complex goods
                          and services often can't use the Internet for cost estimating, budgeting, and
                          exact pricing. The Internet can be used as a tool for procurement, but it's often
                          just the start of the buyer-seller communication process.


                   Examining the Results of Seller Selection
                   The primary output, other than the selected seller, of the selecting seller process is a
                   contract between the buyer and the seller. A contract is a legally binding agreement

                         between the buyer and seller in which the seller provides the described product and the
                         buyer pays for the product. Contracts are known by many names:

                              * Agreement
                              * Subcontract
                              * Purchase order
                              * Memorandum of understanding


                                       EXAM TIP A letter of intent is not a contract, but a letter stating that the
                                       buyer is intending to create a contractual relationship with the seller. A letter
                                       contract is a contract that may be used when the work needs to start
                                       immediately. A letter contract is often considered a "stopgap" solution in
                                       procurement.

                             Contracts have to be signed by a person with the power to authorize the require-
                         ments and payment specified in the contract. This role is called the delegation of pro-
                         curement authority. Whether this person is the project manager depends on the
                         procurement policies of the performing organization.
                             In some organizations, all contracts flow through centralized contracting. Centralized
                         contracting requires all contracts for all projects to be approved through a central unit
                         within the performing organization. Other organizations use a decentralized contracting
                         approach, which assigns a contract administrator or contract officer to the project.
                             There are five other outputs of the conduct procurement process that PMP and
                         CAPM candidates should be familiar with:

                              * Project management plan updates When dealing with large, unwieldy
                                contracts, a new subsidiary management plan may need to be created. This
                                subsidiary plan, the contract management plan, defines how the contract
                                will be administered through the duration of the project. The contract may
                                cause integration management to kick in. Changes to the procurement
                                process, or changes to the procured item itself, may cause ripples in the
                                procurement management plan, which also means updates to the project
                                management plan.
                              * Project document updates The procurement process can create a need for
                                the project documents to be updated. You may need to update the
                                requirements documentation and the associated requirement traceability
                                matrix. Based on the details of the contract type selected, there may be new
                                risks introduced into the project, so the risk register and risk response plans
                                may also need to be updated.
                              * Resource calendars The demand and availability of resources related to the
                                contracted decision should be documented. This documentation includes
                                when resources are active in the project and when they're not needed and can
                                be utilized elsewhere.

                        * Contract award The vendor that is selected for the project work is awarded
                          the project contract. The contract includes the statement of work, schedule,
                          performance requirements of the vendor, seller requirements, pricing,
                          payment obligations, warranty of the work, and any terms for penalties. Some
                          contracts define termination and alternative dispute resolution should there
                          be claims or should the need diminish for the goods and services the contract
                          provides.




                                                                                                                                              PART II
                        * Change requests We all know that change requests are likely to happen, and
                          when dealing with procurement management, it's no different. Change
                          requests are fed into the change control system, considered through
                          integration change control, and, if approved, are then reflected in the time,
                          cost, and scope baselines. Nothing new or surprising here.


                   Controlling Project Procurements
                   Controlling procurements is the process of ensuring that both the buyer and the seller
                   live up to the agreements in the contract. The project manager and the contract admin-
                   istrator must work together to make certain the seller meets its obligations, just as the
                   vendor will ensure that the buyer lives up to its agreements as well. If either party does
                   not fulfill its contractual requirements, legal remedies may ultimately be pursued.

                                EXAM TIP Because of the legalities associated with the contract, contract
                                administration is often handled as an operation of the organization rather than
                                as part of project management.

                       Another aspect of contract administration, especially on larger projects with multi-
                   ple sellers providing various products, is the coordination between the contractors. The
                   project manager or contract officer schedules and confirms the performance of the sell-
                   ers so that the deliverables, schedule, and performance of a contractor do not infringe
                   or adversely affect the performance of another contractor.
                       Within the contract must be the terms for payment. Typically, the performance
                   and progress of the contractor is directly linked to payments it receives. The project
                   manager must track performance and quality to approve or decline payment as need-
                   ed. The contract should define the metrics for acceptance to avoid disagreements on
                   performance.
                       This process is integrated into the project's control as a whole. You will likely per-
                   form procurement control along with other project management control processes to
                   ensure that what happens in procurement doesn't adversely affect the remainder of the
                   project. You'll direct and manage the procurement work and do quality control on
                   what the vendor provides. You'll also need to perform integrated change control on any
                   of the changes the procurement may bring about--or that get introduced to the project
                   that could affect the contracted work. Finally, you will always be looking to control the
                   risks associated with the procured work.

                         Completing the Procurement Control Process
                         The actual process of completing procurement control relies heavily on communication
                         between the project manager, the contract officer, and the seller. The communications plan
                         may have considerations for how and when the communication between the buyer and
                         seller should take place and what the purpose of the communication should be. There are
                         several tools and techniques to assist the project management team with the contract ad-
                         ministration process:

                              * Contract change control system The contract change control system
                                defines the procedures for how the contract may be changed. The process
                                for changing the contract includes the forms, documented communications,
                                dispute resolution procedures, tracking methods, the procedures for getting
                                the changes approved within the performing organization, and the conditions
                                within the project, business, or marketplace that justify the need for the
                                change. The system is part of integrated change control.
                              * Procurement performance reviews The buyer has to confirm that the seller
                                is living up to the terms of the contract. Specifically, the buyer reviews the
                                quality of what the vendor has created, the cost of what's been created, and if
                                the vendor is on schedule and in alignment with the agreement and the
                                project scope. All of these items are documented in the terms of the contract--
                                no fudging from the vendors is allowed.
                              * Inspections and audits If you hired an architect to build your dream home,
                                would you wait until the house is completely built before inspecting the
                                work? Of course not. You'd have to, and likely want to, perform periodic
                                inspections, audits, and walkthroughs of the home as it's under construction.
                                The same is true in project management: the buyer completes inspections and
                                audits to confirm that the seller is abiding by the contracted requirements for
                                the project.
                              * Performance reporting Performance reporting is the communication
                                between the project manager and management on how the seller is
                                performing under the guidelines in the contract. This is part of
                                communications and should be documented within the communications
                                management plan. The buyer has to confirm that the vendor is living up to
                                the terms of the contract.
                              * Payment systems Sellers like to be paid when they have completed their
                                obligations. How the sellers are paid is controlled by the payment system,
                                which includes the interaction of the project manager and the accounts
                                payable department. The performing organization may have strict guidelines
                                for how payment requests are submitted and approved and how payments are
                                completed. On larger projects, the project management team may have
                                specific procedures for submitting the payment requests.
                              * Claims administration Uh-oh! Claims are disagreements between the buyer
                                and the seller, usually centering on a change, who did the change, and even




12-ch12.indd 474                                                                                                                 7/12/2013 4:55:30 AM

                                                                                                                              475
                          whether a change has occurred. Claims are also called disputes and appeals,
                          and are monitored and controlled through the project in accordance with the
                          contract terms. The contract can, and usually does, determine the path to
                          resolution, which may include arbitration or litigation to resolve the claims
                          between the buyer and seller. No fun. Alternative dispute resolution is an
                          agreed-upon approach to work out the claim without, usually, involving the
                          expense of lawyers and court cases.




                                                                                                                                            PART II
                        * Records management system Guess what this system does. Yep. It records and
                          organizes all of the documentation of the contract, the related communications,
                          the work results, and the performance of the vendor. The records management
                          system is part of the project management information system.


                               EXAM TIP Who's administering a contract manually? Information
                               technology (IT) can help the project manager, the project management team,
                               and the vendor efficiently abide by the terms of the contract and keep the
                               project moving forward.

                   Reviewing the Results of Procurement Control
                   Procurement control calls for communication between the seller and buyer, the project
                   manager and the vendor, and the stakeholders. There must be significant documenta-
                   tion of the agreement that both the buyer and the seller agree to before the procured
                   work begins. Once the procured work, service, or product has been delivered from the
                   seller to the buyer, there must be agreement that the delivery is in alignment with the
                   original agreement. There are five outputs of the procurement control process:

                       * Work performance information Performance reporting is the
                         communication between the project manager and management on how
                         the seller is performing under the guidelines in the contract. This is part of
                         communications and should be documented within the communications
                         management plan. The buyer has to confirm that the vendor is living up
                         to the terms of the contract. Specifically, the buyer reviews the quality of what
                         the vendor has created, the cost of what's been created, and if the vendor is on
                         schedule. All of these items are documented in the terms of the contract--no
                         fudging from the vendors is allowed. Performance reviews can be an input to
                         future procurement decisions.
                        * Change requests Changes to the project's scope, costs, or schedule can
                          directly influence the contracted work between the buyer and the seller.
                          Changes that affect the project contracts must flow through the contract
                          change control system. Recall that the contract change control system defines
                          the procedures for how the contract may be changed. The process for

                          tracking methods, dispute resolution procedures, the procedures for getting
                          the changes approved within the performing organization, and the conditions

                                 within the project, business, or marketplace that justify the need for the
                                 change. The system is part of integrated change control. The vendor may not
                                 be obligated to accept the changes to the contract and this can create claims
                                 and disputes between the vendor and the buyer.
                              * Project management plan updates You may need to update the project
                                management plan based on the outcomes of controlling procurement. For
                                example, the project's procurement management plan could be updated based
                                on procurement decisions. You may also need to update the schedule baseline
                                based on the abilities of vendors to deliver the goods and services requested.
                              * Project document updates Any procurement documentation should be
                                included as part of the project's supporting detail and will become part of
                                organizational process assets. Change requests related to the procured goods
                                and services, technical specifications from the vendor, performance reports,
                                and other communications are all included as part of project documentation.
                              * Organizational process assets updates All procurement communications,
                                outcomes of performance reporting, outcomes of inspections and audits,
                                vendor invoices, and any documentation created and submitted by the vendor
                                will become part of the project's archive and is technically an update to the
                                organizational process assets.


                         Performing Contract Closure
                         Contract closure is analogous to administrative closure. Its purpose is to confirm that
                         the obligations of the contract were met as expected. The project manager, the cus-
                         tomer, key stakeholders, and, in some instances, the seller, may finalize product verifi-
                         cation together to confirm that the contract has been completed.
                             Contract closure can also be linked to administrative closure, because it is the pro-
                         cess of confirming that the work was finished. In instances where the contract was ter-
                         minated, contract closure is reviewed, and the contract is considered closed because of
                         the termination. The project records should be updated to reflect the contract closure
                         and the acceptance of the work or product.

                         Auditing the Procurement Process
                         The successes and failures within the procurement process of the project are reviewed
                         from the procurement planning stage through to contract closure. The intent of the
                         audit is to learn what worked and what didn't during the procurement processes. This
                         knowledge can then be applied to other areas within the current project and to other
                         projects within the performing organization.

                         Negotiating Settlements
                         Before the contract can be officially closed, all issues, disputes, claims, and disagree-
                         ments must be settled between the buyer and the seller. The terms of the contract over-

                                                                                                                                477
                   ride all other agreements, so this is one of the first things the two parties must agree
                   upon (again!). The goal is to settle the disagreement in a fair manner, usually through
                   alternative dispute resolution--which can include mediation and arbitration. If the
                   buyer and seller can agree upon a settlement to an issue, then the claim is escalated to
                   litigation and the court system. Almost all contracts define the court where the claim
                   and associated lawsuit will be filed.




                                                                                                                                              PART II
                   Completing Contract Closure
                   Once the deliverables have been accepted and the contract has been closed, it's essential
                   to collect all of the contract information and to record it in the contract file. A contract
                   file is a complete indexed set of records of the procurement process and is incorporated
                   into the administrative closure process. These records include financial information as
                   well as information on the performance and acceptance of the procured work.
                        Assuming the procured work is acceptable and meets the requirements of the con-
                   tract, the contract can be closed. The formal closure of a project comes in a written
                   notice from the contract officer to the seller. The notice informs the seller that the work
                   is acceptable and that the contract is considered closed. The formal closure process may
                   vary according to the size of the project. The requirements for contract closure should
                   be documented within the contract.


                   Chapter Summary
                   Projects can buy or build as much as they need in order to be successful. Part of the
                   procurement process is deciding what needs to be procured. The WBS and the project
                   scope can help the project management team determine what things or services need to
                   be procured in order for the project to be completed. Once the decision of what needs
                   to be procured is made, the project manager can, often with the help of expert judg-
                   ment, query the vendors for bids, quotes, or proposals based on the details of the proj-
                   ect manager's SOW.
                        Vendors may need to attend a bidder conference in order to get clarification on
                   the SOW--plus, it helps to chat with the project manager to get a clear understanding
                   of what the project calls for. Vendors will then provide their quotes, bids, or propos-
                   als, according to what the project manager has requested. And then they'll hope they
                   win the gig.
                        Once the project manager's organization has made the decision as to what vendor
                   will be providing the service, the contract is issued. Now both parties have to live up
                   to the terms and conditions of the contract. Of course, if there are issues that escalate
                   during contract administration, there can be--gulp!--claims between the buyer and
                   seller.
                        The project manager and the vendor should work together for the best interest of
                   the project. During contract closure, the buyer inspects the project work and confirms
                   that the vendor delivered and performed according to the contract terms. And then
                   everyone lives happily ever after.

                         Alternative dispute resolution When there is an issue or claim that must be settled
                         before the contract can be closed, the parties involved in the issue or claim will try to
                         reach a settlement through mediation or arbitration.
                         Bid From seller to buyer. Price is the determining factor in the decision-making
                         process.
                         Bidder conference A meeting of all the project's potential vendors to clarify the con-
                         tract statement of work and the details of the contracted work.
                         Claims These are disagreements between the buyer and the seller, usually centering
                         on a change, who did the change, and even whether a change has occurred. Claims are
                         also called disputes and appeals, and are monitored and controlled through the project
                         in accordance with the contract terms.
                         Contract A contract is a formal agreement between the buyer and the seller. Contracts
                         can be oral or written--though written is preferred.
                         Contract change control system This defines the procedures for how the contract
                         may be changed. The process for changing the contract includes the forms; document-
                         ed communications; tracking; conditions within the project, business, or marketplace
                         that justify the needed change; dispute resolution procedures; and the procedures for
                         getting the changes approved within the performing organization.
                         Contract statement of work (SOW also CSOW) This document requires that the
                         seller fully describe the work to be completed and/or the product to be supplied. The
                         SOW becomes part of the contract between the buyer and the seller.
                         Cost plus award fee contract A contract that pays the vendor all costs for the project,
                         but also includes a buyer-determined award fee for the project work.
                         Cost plus fixed fee contract A contract that requires the buyer to pay for the cost of
                         the goods and services procured plus a fixed fee for the contracted work. The buyer as-
                         sumes the risk of a cost overrun.
                         Cost plus incentive fee A contract type that requires the buyer to pay a cost for the
                         procured work, plus an incentive fee, or a bonus, for the work if terms and conditions
                         are met.
                         Cost plus percentage of costs A contract that requires the buyer to pay for the costs
                         of the goods and services procured plus a percentage of the costs. The buyer assumes
                         all of the risks for cost overruns.
                         Direct costs These are costs incurred by the project in order for the project to exist.
                         Examples include the equipment needed to complete the project work, salaries of the
                         project team, and other expenses tied directly to the project's existence.
                         Fixed-price contracts Also known as firm fixed-price and lump-sum contracts, these
                         are agreements that define a total price for the product the seller is to provide.

                   Fixed-price incentive fee A fixed-price contract with opportunities for bonuses for
                   meeting goals on costs, schedule, and other objectives. These contracts usually have a
                   price ceiling for costs and associated bonuses.
                   Fixed-price with economic price adjustments A fixed-price contract with a special
                   allowance for price increases based on economic reasons such as inflation or the cost
                   of raw materials.

                   amples include fire, hurricanes, tornadoes, and earthquakes.
                   Independent estimates These estimates are often referred to as "should cost" esti-
                   mates. They are created by the performing organization or outside experts to predict
                   what the cost of the procured product should be.
                   Indirect costs These are costs attributed to the cost of doing business. Examples in-
                   clude utilities, office space, and other overhead costs.
                   Invitation for Bid (IFB) From buyer to seller. Requests the seller to provide a price for
                   the procured product or service.
                   Letter contract A letter contract allows the vendor to begin working on the project
                   immediately. It is often used as a stopgap solution.
                   Letter of intent A letter of intent is not a contract, but a letter stating that the buyer is
                   intending to create a contractual relationship with the seller.
                   Make-or-buy decision A process in which the project management team determines
                   the cost-effectiveness, benefits, and feasibility of making a product or buying it from a
                   vendor.
                   Privity The contractual relationship between the buyer and the seller is often consid-
                   ered confidential and secret.
                   Procurement management plan A project management subsidiary plan that docu-
                   ments the decisions made in the procurement planning processes.
                   Procurement planning A process to identify which parts of the project warrant pro-
                   curement from a vendor by the buyer.
                   Proposal A document the seller provides to the buyer. The proposal includes more
                   than just a fee for the proposed work. It also includes information on the vendor's
                   skills, the vendor's reputation, and ideas on how the vendor can complete the con-
                   tracted work for the buyer.
                   Purchase order (PO) A purchase order is a form of unilateral contract that the buyer
                   provides to the vendor showing that the purchase has been approved by the buyer's
                   organization.
                   Quotation From seller to buyer. Price is the determining factor in the decision-
                   making process.

                         Request for Proposal (RFP) From buyer to seller. Requests the seller to provide a
                         proposal to complete the procured work or to provide the procured product.
                         Request for Quote (RFQ) From buyer to seller. Requests the seller to provide a price
                         for the procured product or service.
                         Risk-related contractual agreements When the project management team decides to
                         use transference to respond to a risk, a risk-related contractual agreement is created

                         contract.
                         Seller rating systems These are used by organizations to rate prior experience with
                         each vendor that they have worked with in the past. The seller rating system can track
                         performance, quality ratings, delivery, and even contract compliance.
                         Time and materials contract A contract type in which the buyer pays for the time and
                         materials for the procured work. This is a simple contract, usually for smaller procure-
                         ment conditions. These contract types require a not-to-exceed clause, or the buyer as-
                         sumes the risk for cost overruns.
                         Weighting system This takes out the personal preferences of the decision maker in
                         the organization to ensure that the best seller is awarded the contract. Weights are as-
                         signed to the values of the proposals, and each proposal is scored.


                         Case Study
                         Litke Greenhouse and Nursery: Procurement Processes
                         Litke Greenhouse and Nursery is Knoxville, Tennessee's agricultural supplier. They spe-
                         cialize in commercial and home-based plants, ranging from orchids and roses to dog-
                         wood and jasmine trees. Ros Litke, owner, sponsored a project to create a year-round
                         garden and showcase that would serve multiple purposes:

                              * A greenhouse that could hold plants
                              * An educational facility for classes and seminars
                              * A marketing piece that could gain national attention
                              * A tourist destination for gardeners, photographers, and local residents

                             The project scope called for the design and installation of a large greenhouse like no
                         other facility in the Southeast. The greenhouse simulates a lush Smoky Mountain cove
                         with adult trees, younger saplings, indigenous plants, a water feature with rainbow
                         trout, and a limited number of birds. The project was dubbed "Snapshot of East Ten-
                         nessee" because it reflected the ideal East Tennessee environment.

                                                                                                                                481
                   Planning for Procurement
                   Ros Litke, the project sponsor, named Jen Stein as the project manager and Ty Koenig
                   as the project manager assistant. When Jen, Ty, and the project team planned this proj-
                   ect, they identified which deliverables in the WBS they would be able to feasibly create
                   in-house and which items needed to be procured. The internal team was qualified to
                   complete the placement of the plants, the design of the garden environment, and the
                   installation of the water feature. The deliverables in the WBS that required procurement




                                                                                                                                              PART II
                   included:

                        * The architectural design and construction of the greenhouse
                        * The fish and wildlife for the greenhouse
                        * The marketing process to inform the public of the final product

                       The project team, Jen, and Ty determined that Litke Greenhouse and Nursery would
                   need to procure these resources because the internal talent did not have the skill sets to
                   complete the required work. In addition, the fish and birds required for the project
                   would need to come from a supplier. While Litke Greenhouse and Nursery does have a
                   full-time marketing manager, it was determined that this individual, Jeff Honeycutt,
                   did not have the time to dedicate to the complete campaign. In addition, Jeff did not
                   have the skill set to create the desired web site to promote the new space. Jeff Honeycutt
                   was, however, involved with selecting the vendor for the marketing campaign.
                       As there were multiple items to procure, different procurement documents were
                   created.

                   Procuring the Architectural Design
                   The vision of the finished project was discussed in detail with Ros Litke, Jen Stein, and
                   Ty Koenig. The details of the facility were documented and mapped to a statement of
                   work (SOW). The statement of work defined the design of the architectural plans ac-
                   cording to the specifications of Litke Greenhouse and Nursery.
                       With the SOW created, Jen created a request for proposal that she submitted to five
                   selected architectural and construction organizations.

                   Procuring the Wildlife
                   Based on the planned space of the facility, it was determined that eight birds and 144
                   rainbow trout would need to be procured. Jen created a Request for Quote (RFQ) for
                   this procurement, because price was the only determining factor in the selection. The
                   RFQ was sent to five suppliers of the birds and fish.

                   Procuring the Marketing
                   Jeff Honeycutt, the full-time marketing pro at Litke Greenhouse and Nursery, worked
                   with Jen and Ty to define the SOW for the marketing. Because of the nature of the work
                   to be procured, a Request for Proposal (RFP) was created. Jeff wanted a marketing com-
                   pany to see the whole vision of the project and then share that vision with the public.

                         Hosting a Bidder Conference
                         Jen and Ty agreed to meet with each of the proposed bidders to discuss the RFP, the
                         project, and to answer any questions the bidders might have. The conferences were held
                         on a preset date, as detailed in the RFP, and each bidder had the opportunity to sched-
                         ule a 40-minute session with Jen and Ty. This allowed the vendor to clarify any issues
                         and to gather as much detail as possible to create the proposal that he or she believed
                         would be most valuable to the buyer.
                             A bidder conference was allowed for both the architectural and the marketing pro-
                         curement processes. During the marketing bidder conferences, Jen and Ty relied on Jeff's
                         marketing experience to help lead the conversation and to answer vendor questions.
                             A bidder conference was not needed for the procurement of the fish and birds. Jen
                         and Ty did allow the bidders to call them to clarify any questions on the procured
                         items. Only one bidder for the wildlife called with a question: "How many female rain-
                         bow trout would the project require?"

                         Selecting a Vendor
                         Jen and Ty read each of the proposals and bids supplied by the sellers. The bid for the
                         wildlife was the easiest decision to make because it was driven solely by price. While
                         all of the bids supplied for the wildlife were close, Jen and Ty selected the vendor with
                         the lowest price. All of the vendors guaranteed their fish and fowl to be healthy and
                         disease-free.
                             The architectural selection process was not as clear because of the proposals in-
                         volved. Ty assisted Jen in creating evaluation criteria to compare and contrast each
                         proposal. Proposals were ranked according to the following specifications:

                              * Qualifications and experience of each firm
                              * Ability to address all issues in the provided statement of work
                              * Ability to fulfill the design and construction based on the determined
                                timeline
                              * New ideas presented within the proposal
                              * Price

                            Based on this ranking of information, Jen selected an architectural firm to design
                         and build the facility. Jen and Ty followed a similar approach in selecting the marketing
                         vendor, but also involved Jeff Honeycutt to make the best decision.

                         Negotiating the Contract
                         After selecting the vendors for each of the items that needed procurement, Jen worked
                         with the vendors to negotiate the contract. Each contract was relative to the type of
                         work or item to be procured. For example, the architectural firm initially wanted a cost
                         plus percentage of costs contract. This would have caused the final price for the project
                         to fluctuate based on the costs of the materials throughout the project.

                                                                                                                                483
                       Jen negotiated with the seller to use a fixed-price and incentive fee contract for
                   the project. This contract ensured that the vendor would receive a guaranteed fee for the
                   project work, but also created an opportunity to gain a bonus if the contracted work
                   was completed ahead of schedule.
                       The contracted work for the marketing was assigned to a time and materials con-
                   tract. This contract type allowed the selected marketing firm to bill for time invested in
                   the project's marketing creation, the web site, and on marketing literature. The contract




                                                                                                                                              PART II
                   did, however, include a not-to-exceed fee for the entire project work. Jen and the seller
                   agreed that reports on the expense of the work would be provided every two weeks. This
                   would allow Jen to track the marketing expenses against the deliverables the seller was
                   creating.

                       his company. He is in the process of determining which contracts to use in
                       this project. His company is risk-averse, so the correct choice of contract is
                       important to Bradley. Of the following contract types, which one requires the
                       seller to assume the risk of cost overruns?

                                 Once the code is written, you estimate you'll spend $3,000 per month
                                 updating the software with client information, government regulations, and
                                 maintenance. A vendor has proposed to write the code for your company
                                 and charge a fee based on the number of clients using the program every
                                 month. The vendor will charge you $5 per month per user of the web-based
                                 accounting system. You will have roughly 1,200 clients using the system per
                                 month. However, you'll need an in-house accountant to manage the time and
                                 billing of the system, so this will cost you an extra $1,200 per month. How
                                 many months will you have to use the system before it is better to write your
                                 own code than to hire the vendor?
                                  A. 3 months
                                  B. 4 months
                                  C. 6 months
                                  D. 15 months
                             14. Henry has been negotiating with the ABN Contracting Company for two
                                 weeks regarding some procured work on the project. Henry has sent the ABN
                                 Contracting Company a letter of intent. This means what?
                                  A. Henry intends to sue the ABN Contracting Company.
                                  B. Henry intends to buy from the ABN Contracting Company.
                                  C. Henry intends to bid on a job from the ABN Contracting Company.
                                  D. Henry intends to fire the ABN Contracting Company.
                             15. Martha is the project manager of the MNB Project. She wants a vendor to offer
                                 her one price to do all of the detailed work. Martha will issue which type of
                                 document?
                                  A. A Request for Proposal (RFP)
                                  B. A Request for Information (RFI)
                                  C. A proposal
                                  D. An Invitation for Bid (IFB)

                                 your project. You've worked with the vendors collectively to organize and
                                 schedule their overlapping work, scope control, and changes within their
                                 contract requirements. You have created many procurement documents in this
                                 project. Which one of the following is true about procurement documents?
                                  A. They offer no room for bidders to suggest changes.
                                  B. They ensure receipt of complete proposals.
                                  C. They inform the performing organization why the bid is being created.
                                  D. The project manager creates and selects the bid.

                         company. You will be managing the selection of several vendors to participate
                         in this process and your project team wants to know when seller selection
                         actually happens. In what process group does the select seller event happen?

                         start work immediately. What contract is needed now?
                         A. T&M
                         B. Fixed-price
                         C. Letter contract

                         project. Things have gone well on the project, and the work is nearly
                         complete. There is still a significant amount of funds in the project budget.
                         The buyer's representative approaches you and asks that you complete some
                         optional requirements to use up the remaining budget. You should do what?

                   Questions and Answers
                      1. You are the project manager of the Adams Construction Project. Some of the
                         work in the project contains pure risk that you're not willing to accept. You
                         decided to mitigate the pure risks in this project. Which of the following may
                         be used as a risk mitigation tool?
                         A. The vendor proposal

                                  B. The contract
                                  C. The quotation
                                  D. Project requirements
                                 B. Contracts can be used as a risk mitigation tool. Procurement of risky
                                 activities is known as transference; the risk does not disappear, but the
                                 responsibility for the risk is transferred to the vendor. A, C, and D are all
                                 incorrect. A vendor proposal, a quotation, and project requirements do
                                 nothing to serve as a risk mitigation tool.
                              2. You are the project manager for the 89A Project. You have created a contract
                                 for your customer. The contract must have what two things?
                                  A. An offer and consideration
                                  B. Signatures and the stamp of a notary public
                                  C. Value and worth of the procured item
                                  D. Start date and acceptance of start date
                                 A. Of all the choices presented, A is the best choice. Contracts have an offer
                                 and a consideration. B is incorrect because not all contracts demand
                                 signatures and notary public involvement. C is incorrect because a contract
                                 may not explicitly determine what the value and worth of the procured
                                 product or service is. D is also incorrect because a contract may specify a start
                                 date, but the acceptance of the start date is vague and not needed for all
                                 contracts.
                              3. Britney is the project manager of the FTG Software Project. She's relying on
                                 the project scope to help her analyze the procurement needs of the project.
                                 The project scope statement can help a project manager create procurement
                                 details. Which one of the following best describes this process?
                                  A. The project scope statement defines the contracted work.
                                  B. The project scope statement defines the requirements for the contract
                                     work.
                                  C. The project scope statement defines the contracted work, which must
                                     support the requirements of the project customer.
                                  D. Both parties must have and retain their own copy of the product

                                 C. The project scope statement defines the details and requirements for
                                 acceptance of the project, serves as a valuable input to the process of
                                 determining what needs to be procured, and defines what the end result will
                                 be. When dealing with vendors to procure a portion of the project, the
                                 procured work must support the requirements of the project's customer. A is
                                 incorrect because the project scope statement defines the project as a whole,
                                 not just the contracted work, which may be just a portion of the project. B is

                                                                                                                          489
                     incorrect because the project scope statement does not define the
                     requirements for the contract work. D is also incorrect because the vendor
                     likely will not have a copy of the product description.
                   4. Yolanda has outsourced a portion of a project to a vendor. The vendor has
                      discovered some issues that will influence the cost and schedule of its portion
                      of the project. How must the agreement be updated?
                      A. As a new contract signed by Yolanda and the vendor.




                                                                                                                                        PART II
                      B. As directed by the contract change control system.
                      C. As a memo and SOW signed by Yolanda and the vendor.
                     D. Project management contracts have clauses that allow vendors to adjust
                        their work according to unknowns.
                     B. This is the best answer of all the choices presented. The contract change
                     control system will determine the best route to incorporate the change. A, while
                     feasible, is not the best answer to the question. A new contract does not update
                     the original agreement and may cause delays because the contract may have to
                     be resubmitted, reapproved, and so on. C and D are not viable answers.
                   5. You are creating a new contract for some procured work in the project. Your
                      manager wants you to define how issues and claims will be resolved including
                      the possibility of any lawsuits related to the procured work. The United States
                      backs all contracts through which of the following?
                      A. Federal law
                      B. State law
                      C. The court system
                     D. Lawyers
                     C. All contracts in the United States are backed by the U.S. court systems. A,
                     B, and D are all incorrect answers.
                   6. Terry is the project manager of the MVB Project. She needs to purchase a piece
                      of equipment for her project. The accounting department has informed Terry
                      that she needs a unilateral form of contract. Accounting is referring to which
                      of the following?
                      A. The statement of work (SOW)
                      B. A legally binding contract
                      C. A purchase order
                     D. An invoice from the vendor
                     C. A purchase order is an example of a unilateral contract. A, B, and D are all
                     incorrect answers. An SOW is a statement of work, and a legally binding
                     contract does not fully answer the question. D, an invoice from the vendor, is
                     not what the purchasing department is requesting.

                              7. You are a project management consultant for the Hopson Company and
                                 you're working with them to determine the best vendor and contract choice
                                 for a portion of their project. The purpose of a contract is to distribute
                                 between the buyer and seller a reasonable amount of what?
                                  A. Responsibility
                                  B. Risk
                                  C. Reward
                                  D. Accountability
                                 B. A fair contract shares a reasonable amount of risk between the buyer and
                                 the seller. A is incorrect because a contract may transfer the majority of the
                                 responsibility to the vendor. C is incorrect because the reward is not an
                                 appropriate answer to the question. D is also incorrect because the
                                 accountability of the services contracted to the vendor is not shared between
                                 the buyer and the seller.
                              8. You are the project manager of the Communications Projects for your
                                 organization. Management has stressed that you use privity throughout this
                                 project. Privity is what?
                                  A. The relationship between the project manager and a known vendor
                                  B. The relationship between the project manager and an unknown vendor
                                  C. The contractual, confidential information between customer and vendor
                                  D. The professional information regarding the sale between customer and
                                     vendor
                                 C. Privity is a confidential agreement between the buyer and seller. A, B, and
                                 D are incorrect choices because these do not fully answer the question.
                              9. Sammy is the project manager of the DSA Project. He is considering proposals
                                 and contracts presented by vendors for a portion of the project work. Of the
                                 following, which contract is least risky to the DSA Project from Sammy's
                                 perspective?
                                  A. Cost plus fixed fee
                                  B. Cost plus percentage of cost
                                  C. Cost plus incentive fee
                                  D. Fixed-price
                                 D. A fixed-price contract contains the least amount of risk for a buyer. The
                                 seller assumes all of the risk. A, B, and C are incorrect because these contract
                                 types carry the risk of cost overruns being assumed by the buyer.
                             10. Bradley is the project manager of the Warehouse Remodeling Project for
                                 his company. He is in the process of determining which contracts to use in
                                 this project. His company is risk-averse so the correct choice of contract is

                                                                                                                            491
                       important to Bradley. Of the following contract types, which one requires the
                       seller to assume the risk of cost overruns?
                       A. Cost plus fixed fee
                       B. Cost plus incentive fee
                       C. Lump-sum
                       D. Time and materials




                                                                                                                                          PART II
                       C. A lump-sum contract provides a fixed fee to complete the contract; the
                       seller absorbs any cost overruns. A and B are incorrect because these contracts
                       do not require the seller to carry the risk of cost overruns. D is incorrect
                       because a time and materials contract requires the buyer to pay for cost
                       overruns on the materials and the time invested in the project work.
                   11. Benji is the project manager of the PLP Project. He has hired an independent
                       contractor for a portion of the project work. The contractor is billing the
                       project $120 per hour plus materials. This is an example of what?
                       A. Cost plus fixed fee
                       B. Time and materials
                       C. Unit price
                       D. Lump-sum
                       B. The contractor's rate of $120 per hour plus the cost of the materials is an
                       example of a time and materials contract. A is incorrect because a cost plus
                       fixed fee contract charges the cost of the materials, plus a fixed fee, for the
                       installation or work to complete the contract. C is incorrect because a unit
                       price contract has a set price for each unit installed on the project. D is also
                       incorrect because a lump-sum contract does not break down the time and
                       materials.
                   12. Mary is the project manager of the JHG Project. She has created a
                       procurement statement of work (SOW) for a vendor. What project component
                       is the procurement statement of work based on?
                       A. The project scope statement
                       B. The work breakdown structure (WBS)
                       C. The scope baseline
                       D. The WBS dictionary
                       C. The statement of work is developed from the scope baseline. A, B, and D
                       are all incorrect because these are the three components of the scope baseline.
                   13. You are the project manager for a software development project for an
                       accounting system that will operate over the Internet. Based on your research,
                       you have discovered that it will cost you $25,000 to write your own code.
                       Once the code is written, you estimate you'll spend $3,000 per month




12-ch12.indd 491                                                                                                             7/12/2013 4:55:32 AM

                                 updating the software with client information, government regulations, and
                                 maintenance. A vendor has proposed to write the code for your company
                                 and charge a fee based on the number of clients using the program every
                                 month. The vendor will charge you $5 per month per user of the web-based
                                 accounting system. You will have roughly 1,200 clients using the system per
                                 month. However, you'll need an in-house accountant to manage the time and
                                 billing of the system, so this will cost you an extra $1,200 per month. How
                                 many months will you have to use the system before it is better to write your
                                 own code than to hire the vendor?
                                  A. 3 months
                                  B. 4 months
                                  C. 6 months
                                  D. 15 months
                                 C. The monies invested in the vendor's solution would have paid for your
                                 own code in six months. This is calculated by finding your cash outlay for the
                                 two solutions: $25,000 for your own code creation; zero cash outlay for the
                                 vendor's solution. The monthly cost to maintain your own code is $3,000.
                                 The monthly cost of the vendor's solution is $7,200. Subtract your cost of
                                 $3,000 from the vendor's cost of $7,200 and this equals $4,200. Divide this
                                 number into the cash outlay of $25,000 to create your own code, and you'll
                                 come up with 5.95 months. Of all the choices presented, C, 6 months, is the
                                 best answer. A, B, and D are all incorrect because they do not answer the
                                 question.
                             14. Henry has been negotiating with the ABN Contracting Company for two
                                 weeks regarding some procured work on the project. Henry has sent the ABN
                                 Contracting Company a letter of intent. This means what?
                                  A. Henry intends to sue the ABN Contracting Company.
                                  B. Henry intends to buy from the ABN Contracting Company.
                                  C. Henry intends to bid on a job from the ABN Contracting Company.
                                  D. Henry intends to fire the ABN Contracting Company.
                                 B. Henry intends to buy from the ABN Contracting Company. A, C, and D are
                                 all incorrect because these choices do not adequately describe the purpose of

                             15. Martha is the project manager of the MNB Project. She wants a vendor to offer
                                 her one price to do all of the detailed work. Martha will issue which type of
                                 document?

                       D. An Invitation for Bid (IFB)
                       D. An Invitation for Bid (IFB) is a request for a sealed document that lists the
                       seller's firm price to complete the detailed work. A and B, Request for
                       Proposal (RFP) and Request for Information (RFI), are documents from the
                       buyer to the seller requesting information on completing the work. C, a
                       proposal, does not list the price to complete the work, but instead offers
                       solutions to the buyer for completing the project needs.




                                                                                                                                         PART II
                   16. You are the project manager for your company and you have six vendors on
                       your project. You've worked with the vendors collectively to organize and
                       schedule their overlapping work, scope control, and changes within their
                       contract requirements. You have created many procurement documents in this
                       project. Which one of the following is true about procurement documents?
                       A. They offer no room for bidders to suggest changes.
                       B. They ensure receipt of complete proposals.
                       C. They inform the performing organization why the bid is being created.
                       D. The project manager creates and selects the bid.
                       B. Procurement documents detail the requirements for the work to ensure
                       complete proposals from sellers. A is incorrect because procurement
                       documents allow input from the seller to suggest alternative ways to complete
                       the project work. C is incorrect because informing the performing
                       organization as to why the bid is being created is not the purpose of the
                       procurement documents. D is not realistic.
                   17. You are the project manager of the SRQ City Network Project for your
                       company. You will be managing the selection of several vendors to participate
                       in this process and your project team wants to know when seller selection
                       actually happens. In what process group does the select seller event happen?
                       A. Initiating
                       B. Planning
                       C. Executing
                       D. Closing
                       C. The select seller event happens during the execution process group. The
                       process is the conduct procurement process and is based primarily on the
                       outcomes of the procurement planning process. A, B, and D are all incorrect
                       because these process groups do not include source selection.
                   18. You have an emergency on your project. You have hired a vendor who is to
                       start work immediately. What contract is needed now?
                       A. T&M
                       B. Fixed-price

                                  C. Letter contract
                                  D. Incentive contract
                                 C. For immediate work, a letter contract may suffice. The intent of the letter
                                 contract is to allow the vendor to get to work immediately to solve the project
                                 problem. A, B, and D are all incorrect because these contracts may require
                                 additional time to create and approve. When time is of the essence, a letter
                                 contract is acceptable.
                             19. You are the project manager for a seller and are managing another company's
                                 project. Things have gone well on the project, and the work is nearly
                                 complete. There is still a significant amount of funds in the project budget.
                                 The buyer's representative approaches you and asks that you complete some
                                 optional requirements to use up the remaining budget. You should do what?
                                  A. Negotiate a change in the contract to take on the additional work.
                                  B. Complete a contract change for the additional work.
                                  C. Gain the approval of the project stakeholder for the requested work.
                                  D. Deny the change because it was not in the original contract.
                                 C. Any additional work is a change in the project scope. Changes to the
                                 project scope should be approved by the mechanisms in the contract change
                                 control system. The stakeholder needs to approve the changes to the project
                                 scope. A, B, and D are not realistic expectations of the project. This question
                                 borders on the PMP Code of Professional Conduct. Typically, when a project
                                 scope has been fulfilled, the project work is done. The difference in this situation
                                 is that the additional tasks are optional requirements for the project scope.
                             20. There are some risks that you can do little about. In your most recent project,
                                 for example, a tornado has wrecked your construction project. The tornado is
                                 known as what?
                                  A. A force majeure
                                  B. A risk transference
                                  C. Direct costs
                                  D. An unknown unknown
                                 A. Force majeure, sometimes called "an act of God," is a natural disaster that
                                 can wreck a project. B, risk transference, is incorrect because this describes the
                                 response to the risk, not the tornado itself. C, direct cost, describes costs that
                                 cannot be shared with other organizations but that are attributed directly to
                                 your project. D, an unknown unknown, does not fully describe the tornado
                                 as A does, so this choice is also incorrect.

                                                                                                                           13
                     In this chapter, you will
                        * Identify the project stakeholders
                        * Plan for stakeholder management
                        * Manage stakeholder engagement
                        * Control stakeholder engagement




                   I've always said that the hardest part of the project isn't execution, following processes
                   or regulations, or even planning complex work. The hardest part of the project is deal-
                   ing with people. People can be demanding, unreasonable, rude, shift their priorities,
                   and exhibit many other bad behaviors you've probably already experienced as a project
                   manager. People can also be wonderful, kind, caring, and genuinely interested in the
                   project. They can be reasonable, understand how their demands don't mesh with what
                   they've already asked you for in the project, and can be your biggest allies in getting the
                   project done.

                       These are the project stakeholders, and they are looking to you to complete the project
                   work, not spend too much money, and beat a deadline. Stakeholders are the people who
                   are affected by your project and those who can affect your project--for better or worse.
                   Stakeholder management, the focus of this chapter, is a new knowledge area in the PMBOK
                   Fifth Edition. In older PMBOK versions, stakeholder management was still considered but
                   was lumped into other knowledge areas rather than pulled out as one big topic. I think the
                   subject is a great addition to the latest PMBOK Guide, and along with project communica-
                   tion, is probably where you'll spend the bulk of your time as a project manager.

                                video now.

                       Because this is a new knowledge area, I'd reason that you'll see plenty of exam questions
                   on stakeholder management on your CAPM and PMP exams. Spend a little extra time in
                   this chapter and with the chapter key terms to make sure you've got the science, theory, and
                   PMI approach down for stakeholder management. There are just four processes in this new

                         knowledge area: identifying stakeholders, planning stakeholder management, managing
                         stakeholder engagement, and controlling stakeholder engagement. The basic theme of
                         these four processes is that you need to identify, engage, and manage how you interact with
                         the project stakeholders. If you master this knowledge area, you'll be on your way to becom-
                         ing a fantastic project manager--and a certified one.


                         Identifying Project Stakeholders
                         Just to be clear, stakeholders are the people who can affect your project and also be af-
                         fected by your project. Affecting your project means that the stakeholder can positively
                         or negatively influence it. Your project can do the same to stakeholders' lives. For in-
                         stance, imagine a construction project to replace an existing bridge and all the people
                         that could be involved in that project. You'll work with architects, engineers, construc-
                         tion gurus, and the day-to-day workers on the project. There will be city planners, gov-
                         ernment inspectors, and other bureaucrats involved in the project. You'll also have all
                         of the people who live near the bridge eagerly awaiting its completion and possibly ag-
                         gravated by the inconvenience your project causes them.
                              All of these people are stakeholders who can affect your project, and whose lives
                         you'll be affecting. Now imagine if you didn't take the time to identify the correct stake-
                         holders for the project. What would happen if you forget to identify the government
                         agencies for the bridge project? Or you forget to identify the people who use the bridge
                         every day as part of their commute? Or you miss identifying the architect for the bridge?
                         Stakeholder identification is vital to project success. You and the project team must
                         pause and really think about the stakeholders and how your project affects them, and
                         also how the stakeholders can affect your project.
                              Stakeholder identification should happen as early as possible in the project. If you
                         wait too long to properly identify the stakeholders, you may end up missing decisions
                         and requirements that will only cause the project to stall, you could possibly create bad
                         relationships with the stakeholders, and perhaps cause turmoil within the project.
                         Stakeholder identification is a project initiating activity and requires the project man-
                         ager, the project team, and other stakeholders to help identify who should be involved
                         in the project. As you identify stakeholders, you'll classify them according to their pow-
                         er, influence, interests, and other characteristics so as to help you better manage the
                         project and control stakeholder engagement.

                         Preparing for Stakeholder Identification
                         Let's go back to that bridge construction project. How do you know who should be
                         included as a stakeholder? You could rely on your experience as a project manager, and
                         those colleagues you know who are part of the project, but what other things would
                         help you really capture all of the stakeholders in the project? There are four definite
                         things you should always have as you begin stakeholder identification:

                              * Project charter The project charter should identify some of the parties
                                involved in the project. The charter can identify the project sponsor, of

                                                                                                                               497
                          course, the project manager, and it can identify other parties affected by the
                          project and the people who may also be working with the project manager
                          to plan and complete the project. For example, in the bridge construction
                          project, your project charter may include any vendors that your company has
                          partnered with to complete the work.
                        * Procurement documents When you have a contract between two or more
                          parties you've identified some stakeholders. In the bridge construction project,




                                                                                                                                             PART II
                          you'll procure materials and probably hire resources from different companies.
                          These companies are now stakeholders in your project--they can affect your
                          project in a positive way or a negative way depending on how they live up to the
                          terms of the contract. You'll also have internal stakeholders who are identified
                          through procurement documents--consider the employees you work with to
                          complete procurement. Your company may have a central contracting office,
                          an accounts payable office, and a procurement office. These are all stakeholders
                          now as they too can affect your project positively or negatively. In this instance,
                          procurement documents will help you identify project stakeholders.
                        * Enterprise environmental factors You can identify stakeholders through
                          the enterprise environmental factors you're working with in your project.
                          The culture of your company, how your organization is identified, and the
                          departments and offices you're obliged to work with can all reveal project
                          stakeholders. Your industry regulations, government agencies, and industry
                          standards are also part of enterprise environmental factors, and these elements
                          can help you identify stakeholders, too. Depending on where the project is
                          taking place in the world, you may also have local influences that should be
                          considered to be stakeholders.
                        * Organizational process assets Don't forget to look at past projects to
                          identify current stakeholders. If you've done similar work in the past, you'll
                          probably have some of the same or similar stakeholders. Your organizational
                          process assets can also include stakeholder identification approaches, a
                          stakeholder register template, and lessons learned. Use what already exists so
                          you can work smarter and not harder.

                       These four elements are the inputs to stakeholder identification. You'll want to
                   gather these elements as early as possible in the project to begin identifying the stake-
                   holders. Don't wait too long into the project or you'll find you've not considered all of
                   the stakeholders and their concerns for it.

                   Identifying the Project Stakeholders
                   Now that you've gathered the need inputs to stakeholder analysis, it's time to officially
                   launch stakeholder identification. Stakeholder identification aims to identify the stake-
                   holders, document who the stakeholders are, and record their interests, contributions,
                   and expectations for the project. There are just three tools and techniques for stake-
                   holder identification, but they are exhaustive and broad-reaching. You should know
                   these tools not just for your examination, but also for your role as a project manager.

                             Stakeholder identification is also linked closely with project communications. Re-
                         call that you'll plan for project communication and identify who needs what informa-
                         tion, when the information is needed, and how the information is to be delivered.
                         Stakeholder identification and communication planning can go hand in hand because
                         you'll need to identify the stakeholders before you can determine what communication
                         demands they may have.

                         Performing Stakeholder Analysis
                         Some stakeholders are more important than others. Yeah, I said that. Some stakehold-
                         ers, like the CEO of your company who's counting on your team to implement a new
                         piece of software, is probably more important than the new receptionist who doesn't
                         like the new software. Too bad for her that she thinks the software looks "icky." She may
                         be a stakeholder, but the CEO of the company has far more power and influence than
                         the receptionist does. Stakeholder analysis is the process of analyzing and classifying the
                         stakeholders and interests in the project. It helps you determine and prioritize the needs
                         and requirements of the stakeholders.
                              Stakeholder analysis follows three steps:

                              * Identify and document the stakeholders' contact information, knowledge,
                                expectations of the project, and their level of influence over project decisions.
                              * Prioritize and classify stakeholders based on their power, influence,
                                expectations, and concerns for the project.
                              * Plan for managing the stakeholders based on possible negative or positive
                                scenarios in the project that may affect the stakeholders.

                                       EXAM TIP To identify stakeholders, it's useful to ask known stakeholders
                                       who else should be involved in the project.

                         Classifying Stakeholders
                         One of the best tools in stakeholder analysis is a classification model. A classification
                         model is a way to group and prioritize stakeholders. There are four models (three of
                         which are very similar) you should know for your PMP or CAPM exam:

                              * Power/influence grid This is a grid, as shown in Figure 13-1, that plots out
                                the amount of power and influence a stakeholder has over the project. You'll
                                position the stakeholder on this grid based on the amount of power and
                                influence they have. Stakeholders with high power and high influence are top
                                priority. Stakeholders with little power and influence are still considered, but
                                they have less priority than other stakeholders in the project.
                              * Power/interest grid This grid also maps out stakeholders' power over the
                                project, but considers their interest in the project as a consideration for
                                prioritization of their project needs, expectations, and contributions.

                         * Influence/impact grid This classification model considers the influence
                           the stakeholder may have over the project, but also considers the impact the
                           stakeholder can bring to the project. Consider stakeholders who may have
                           little influence, but whose presence or absence from the project could have
                           great impact--such as a key project team member.
                         * Salience model This model, shown in Figure 13-2, maps out stakeholders'
                           power, urgency, and legitimacy in the project. Power means they can enforce
                           their will on the project's success. Urgency describes the stakeholders' need for
                           attention. Legitimacy describes if their involvement in the project is even
                           warranted.

                   Finalizing Stakeholder Identification
                   The final two tools and techniques for stakeholder identification are meetings and ex-
                   pert judgment. First, let's talk about meetings. Stakeholder identification meetings,

                         sometimes called profile analysis meetings, help the project manager and the manage-
                         ment team realize the expectations and interests of the key project stakeholders. These
                         meetings are useful to identify and document the different roles in the project, the types
                         of stakeholders you'll work with, and all of the differing objectives, interests, and inputs
                         for the project.
                             As you meet with your project team and your key stakeholders, you may also rely
                         on expert judgment to help identify and analyze stakeholders. Expert judgment simply
                         means you're working with someone who has more insight on the stakeholders, the
                         type of work being done, or can identify stakeholders you may have overlooked. Ex-
                         perts can be individuals from the project team, business leaders in your company, cli-
                         ents, vendors, consultants, government agencies, focus groups, and more. You're
                         working with these people and groups to ensure that you've identified all of the stake-
                         holders in the project.

                         Creating the Stakeholder Register
                         Stakeholder identification is only as good as the documentation that comes out of the
                         process. The stakeholder register is the only output of stakeholder identification. It's a
                         log of all of the stakeholder information you've gathered in the project. It will help you
                         communicate with project stakeholders, ensure you understand the stakeholders' needs,
                         wants, and expectations, and it helps you classify stakeholder objectives and priorities.
                         The stakeholder register is a document that will identify at least three things about your
                         project stakeholders:

                              * Identification You'll need to capture the stakeholder names, project role,
                                company position, contact information, and where they're located should you
                                need to meet with them face to face
                              * Assessment information Stakeholders expectations are documented in the
                                stakeholder register. You'll capture the stakeholders' primary expectations,
                                their expected contributions to the project, influence, and the periods of the
                                project when you anticipate the stakeholder to be most involved and
                                interested in the project.
                              * Stakeholder classification A primary activity of stakeholder identification is
                                to classify the stakeholders by their role, position, attitude toward the project,
                                and other factors.

                             The creation of the stakeholder register isn't a one-time event. You'll refer to the
                         stakeholder register throughout the project and update it as new information becomes
                         available. For example, stakeholders may leave the project, new stakeholders could be
                         identified in the project, and stakeholder attitudes and influences can change as the
                         project is in motion.

                                                                                                                                501
                   Planning Stakeholder Management
                   Now that you've identified the stakeholders, how will you manage them? Planning
                   stakeholder management creates the stakeholder management plan and helps you and
                   the project team create a strategy for stakeholder management and engagement. Imag-
                   ine that you're the project manager of a large project to install new software throughout
                   your company. Some of your stakeholders are excited for the new software--these are




                                                                                                                                              PART II
                   positive stakeholders. Other stakeholders hate the idea of changing software and learn-
                   ing something new--these are negative stakeholders. And some of the stakeholders
                   don't care either way--these are neutral stakeholders. Each of these stakeholder types
                   need to be managed by you and the project team.
                       Planning stakeholder management is the process of determining how stakeholders
                   will be affected and how you'll manage the project in consideration of the stakeholders.
                   This means you'll be working to engage the stakeholders--to get them involved in the
                   project, to maintain their interest, calm their fears and threats the project may be caus-
                   ing--and working with the stakeholder to create relationships among the project team,
                   the customers, vendors, and all stakeholders in the project. You, the project manager,
                   are at the center of stakeholder management, but you also want your project team to
                   work proactively to engage stakeholders support the project objectives.
                       This planning process, like almost all the planning processes, creates a plan. The
                   stakeholder management plan defines your approach for stakeholder engagement. As
                   the project moves through its life cycle, the stakeholder concerns, interests, support,
                   and interactions may fluctuate. It's because of this fluctuation in stakeholder involve-
                   ment that you'll likely revisit stakeholder management planning many times through-
                   out the project. Don't worry--this is expected because stakeholder management
                   planning is an iterative activity throughout the entire project.

                   Preparing to Plan for Stakeholder Management
                   You won't just rush into stakeholder management planning--surely by this point in the
                   book you know that you'll always arm yourself with some inputs to effectively start off
                   these processes. This planning process is no different. While you may have a good idea
                   what stakeholders expect from the project, you need to consider what stakeholders ex-
                   pect from you as the project manager. This includes the key stakeholders like your
                   project sponsor and the project customer, but you must also consider your most trusted
                   stakeholders: the project team.
                       To plan for stakeholder management, you'll need four inputs:

                        * Project management plan Yes, yes, the stakeholder management plan is part
                          of the project management plan, but you're going to need a bunch of other
                          stuff from the project management plan to help you create the stakeholder
                          management plan. You'll need the project management plan because it
                          defines:
                          * The life cycle of the project and its phases

                                 * Selected processes for the project
                                 * The plan for project work execution
                                 * Human resource requirements, roles and responsibilities, reporting
                                   relationships, and staffing management approaches
                                 * The change management plan
                                 * Communication requirements and strategy
                              * Stakeholder register Recall that the stakeholder register is an output of
                                stakeholder identification. The stakeholder register will identify the
                                stakeholders, their contact information for communications, and what their
                                expectations of the project are.
                              * Enterprise environmental factors Recall that organizational structure, the
                                culture of the organization, and even the politics can all affect how you plan
                                for stakeholder management.
                              * Organizational process assets Of course, you'll rely on organizational
                                process assets to help with the current project's stakeholder management
                                planning. Consider elements like historical files, templates, lessons learned,
                                and other data from past projects as part of your organizational process assets
                                items.

                              If you're working through project planning, you'll probably already have these in-
                         puts readily available. These are similar inputs you'll use in planning the project com-
                         munications. Stakeholder management and communications work together, but there
                         is a difference. Project communications is about getting the right stakeholder the right
                         information. Stakeholder engagement is about getting stakeholders involved and act-
                         ing on the communications you give them.

                         Creating the Stakeholder Management Plan
                         Now that you've gathered the necessary inputs to planning stakeholder engagement,
                         you'll need to gather the correct experts to help. Stakeholder engagement planning isn't
                         a solo activity--you'll need experts from around your organizations and possibly con-
                         sultants to help with the planning. Subject matter experts for actually creating the stake-
                         holder engagement plan include senior management, consultants, the project team,
                         leaders within the organization, other project managers with similar project experience,
                         and other needed and identified experts within your organization. The goal is to in-
                         clude as many readily available experts to help you accurately plan an approach to en-
                         gage your stakeholders.
                             When you have all of these experts together, either one on one or through a group
                         format, you're going to be hosting meetings. Yes, meetings are one of the tools and
                         techniques for creating the stakeholder engagement plan. These meetings can be tradi-
                         tional conference room events, focus groups, or even panels. The goal isn't to get fancy,
                         just to define the needed engagement level for the stakeholders. Engagement levels

                                                                                                                               503
                   define the amount of interest the stakeholder has in the project, but also the amount of
                   support the stakeholder may have, or lose, in the project. There are five engagement
                   levels:

                        * Unaware The stakeholder doesn't know about the project and the effect the
                          project may have on them.
                        * Resistant The stakeholder knows about the project and doesn't want the




                                                                                                                                             PART II
                          change the project may bring.
                        * Neutral The stakeholder knows about the project, but neither supports nor
                          resists the project.
                        * Supportive The stakeholder knows about the project and is supportive of
                          the change the project will bring about.
                        * Leading The stakeholder knows about the project, is supportive of the
                          change the project may bring about, and is working to make the project
                          successful.

                       In larger projects with lots of different stakeholders, you may find it beneficial to
                   create a Stakeholder Engagement Assessment Matrix. This is a table that defines all of
                   the stakeholders and their engagement levels in the project. This can help you identify
                   stakeholder trends, commonalities, and group stakeholders together by their level of
                   support in the project. Stakeholders are tagged in the matrix with a C, for current en-
                   gagement level, and D for their desired engagement level. Not all stakeholders need to
                   be in the leading category, but your strategy may work to get most stakeholders to at
                   least the supportive level for the project.

                   Examining the Stakeholder Management Plan
                   There are two results of planning for stakeholder management: the stakeholder man-
                   agement plan and updates to the project documents. The primary output of this pro-
                   cess, the stakeholder management plan, aims to engage stakeholders and keep stake-
                   holders engaged throughout the entire project. The stakeholder management plan
                   may contain sensitive information that shouldn't necessarily be shared with everyone.
                   You may need to protect the contents of the stakeholder management plan from the
                   project team and other stakeholders. The stakeholder management plan defines sev-
                   eral things:

                        * Changes the project will bring to stakeholders
                        * Current and desired levels of stakeholder engagement
                        * Interrelationships among stakeholders
                        * Communication requirements throughout the project
                        * Information to be distributed to stakeholders and why the information is
                          needed by the stakeholders

                              * Timing of communications
                              * Conditions and methods for updating the stakeholder management plan

                             The second output of planning for stakeholder engagement includes the project
                         document updates. The project schedule is a likely candidate for what may be updated
                         as a result of the stakeholder planning process. Consider the timing of communica-
                         tions, meetings, and feedback for the project stakeholders. You might also update the
                         stakeholder register if new stakeholders are identified during planning or if the details
                         of an identified stakeholder changes as a result of planning.


                         Managing Stakeholder Engagement
                         As a project manager, you'll constantly work to engage the project stakeholders. This
                         means communication, fostering relationships, facilitating meetings, negotiating, set-
                         tling disputes, and managing all of the questions, demands, and inputs from the project
                         stakeholders. Managing stakeholder engagement is a constant, ongoing activity--it's
                         what's expected of you as the project manager. You'll have to be available to the project
                         stakeholders, but it also means you must go seek out stakeholders when conditions and
                         situations call for you to get stakeholders more (or less) involved in the project.
                             Managing stakeholder engagement works right along with the project communica-
                         tions, but it's more than just communicating. Think of all the different types of stake-
                         holders you could have on any of your projects. Surely some of these stakeholders
                         require a bit more attention than others. And some of your stakeholders may offer
                         minimal input, stay out of the way, or dodge the project as much as possible. Other
                         stakeholders may be in your office once, twice, or several times every day with a new fire
                         drill and panic each time. That's stakeholder engagement, giving your time and atten-
                         tion to what's most important in the project while maintaining stakeholder interest,
                         commitment, and buy-in of the project objectives.
                             Stakeholder influence on the project objectives is usually highest in the early parts
                         of the project. Once you've garnered commitment from the stakeholders, identified the
                         agreed-upon project scope, and set the project to work executing the plans, stakeholder
                         influence should wane. As the project moves forward, some stakeholders may still try
                         to influence the project for their objectives and goals, and you may have to get the proj-
                         ect sponsor involved to squelch some of the more overbearing stakeholders. You'll also
                         manage, track, and report on issues that happen in the project that may affect stake-
                         holders. It's an ongoing process.

                         Preparing to Manage the Stakeholders
                         The stakeholder management plan will be your primary input to the actual manage-
                         ment of stakeholders' engagement. Recall that the stakeholder management plan de-
                         scribes the approach to get the stakeholder involved in the project, how best to com-
                         municate with the stakeholders, and the desired level of stakeholder engagement. You'll
                         rely on this plan, along with other parts of the project management plan (such as the

                                                                                                                                505
                   communications management plan) to work with the stakeholders to create synergy,
                   promote buy-in, and interact with the stakeholders.
                       As I mentioned, much of stakeholder engagement is related to the communications
                   management plan. It is the second input for managing stakeholder engagement. This
                   plan will help you review the communication requirements of the project stakeholders.
                   You'll need to know what information is to be communicated and when the stakehold-
                   ers are expecting the communication. Of course, not all information is to be distributed




                                                                                                                                              PART II
                   to all of the stakeholders--some people just don't need (or want) to know everything.
                   The communications management plan defines who needs what information--this is
                   important so you don't send confidential information to the wrong people.
                       Recall that change is inevitable in most projects. The change log documents the
                   changes that have occurred in the project and the changes that have been proposed in
                   the project. The change log will help you manage stakeholder engagement because
                   you'll need to relay information about change to the appropriate parties. Change can
                   be a sensitive issue in some instances, so always examine the change and think through
                   all of the possible scenarios and reactions the stakeholders may have to the change.
                   Cost and schedule are the two largest concerns most stakeholders have with changes,
                   but you may also need to consider the effect a change has on the project scope. In ad-
                   dition, the project scope may mean changes in other parts of the scope. It's also pos-
                   sible that due to time, costs, risks, or other concerns, you've been forced to remove
                   things from scope. This is another thing that needs to be communicated delicately to
                   stakeholders.
                       Finally, you'll also rely on organizational process assets to help you prepare in man-
                   aging stakeholder engagement. Your organization may have forms, templates, and re-
                   quirements for communications. You may have issue management policies to follow
                   that may alter your approach to stakeholder engagement. Whatever the organizational
                   process assets that can affect your stakeholder engagement, it's a good idea to think
                   through what's being communicated, how you're communicating the information, and
                   what the anticipated reaction is from the stakeholder.

                   Managing the Stakeholder Engagement
                   Managing the stakeholder engagement is really about creating and fostering relation-
                   ships with the people in your project. You want the project to be successful and you
                   need the buy-in and synergy from your project stakeholders. Sure, some low-influence,
                   low-power stakeholders can refuse to buy in to the project, object to the project goals
                   throughout the entire project life cycle, and hate your guts, and you can still be success-
                   ful. But it's not an enjoyable project when you're fighting a challenging stakeholder the
                   entire time. No one wants to do that.
                        For your PMI exams, you want stakeholders to be supportive of the project. This
                   means you'll use communication methods and interpersonal skills as your stakeholder
                   engagement tools and techniques. You know communication already--it's how you
                   spend the bulk of your time as a project manager. You have planned the communication,
                   identified who needs what information, documented when the information will be
                   needed, and you know the modality of the information. Good communicators generally

                         make good project managers. Interpersonal skills are the characteristics that make people
                         like you, or at least work with you, as a project manager. Interpersonal skills involve:

                              * Trustworthiness        People need to be able to trust the project manager.
                              * Conflict resolution        Stakeholders will look to the project manager to resolve
                                conflicts.
                              * Active listening      Making sure you understand the message and its underlying
                                meaning.
                              * Overcoming resistance to change You need to help stakeholders see why
                                the project is important and how it affects their lives.

                            Of course, project management isn't all about getting people to like you and trust
                         you. Project management is really about getting things done. Management skills are the
                         tools you'll need as part of stakeholder engagement to move the project toward its
                         completion. Management skills are things that involve:

                              * Negotiations You'll have to lead negotiations regarding give and take on
                                project objectives.
                              * Influence      You'll need to persuade people to buy in and support the project.
                              * Facilitation Through meetings and messages, you'll build consensus on
                                project goals.
                              * Behavior management You'll have to modify stakeholder behavior to lead
                                them to accepting the project and its objectives.

                             Managing stakeholder engagement takes practice and time. The longer you work as
                         a project manager, the better you'll become at engaging stakeholders. Treat people the
                         way they want to be treated, don't make promises you cannot keep, and always do
                         what's in the best interest of the project and you'll be well on your way to not only en-
                         gaging stakeholders, but also becoming a leader in your project environment.

                         Reviewing Stakeholder Engagement Results
                         Because stakeholder engagement is a process--and something you'll do throughout
                         the project--you can expect some outputs of the process. While it may be important to
                         know the results of stakeholder engagement for your PMI exam, it's also important
                         to know what all the actions in this process are creating for your project. Of course, you
                         don't want to just do a process because it's handy and makes sense, you want to do it
                         because you're creating things that can help your project become more successful--and
                         this will make you more successful in your career, too.
                             Managing stakeholder engagement creates five outputs:

                              * Issue log An issue log can be created as an output of managing stakeholders.
                                As issues are identified, updated, and resolved, an issue log is updated to
                                reflect the status of the issues.

                   * Change requests Change requests can come as a result of stakeholder
                     engagement. Changes to the project scope, schedule, corrective actions, and
                     preventive actions are all changes that can stem from stakeholder engagement.
                     Changes can also happen with the communication approach and interaction
                     with the project stakeholders.
                   * Project management plan updates Based on what you learn in stakeholder
                     engagement, you may need to update the project management plan. Updates

                     are likely going to be in the stakeholder management plan and in the project
                     communications management plan. Stakeholders may change the way they
                     want you to communicate with them, the information they want in the
                     project, or even how they want the information delivered. If there are changes,
                     defects, issues, and even conflict resolution, you may need to update the
                     project management plan to reflect these concerns.
                   * Project documents updates You may need to update the stakeholder
                     register if new stakeholders are identified in the project, stakeholder
                     information changes, or stakeholders leave the project.
                   * Organizational process assets updates This involves future historical
                     information, which means you'll be updating organizational process assets
                     with new information that can be leveraged later in the current project or in
                     future projects. Organizational process assets updates can include:
                     * Lessons learned documentation What you learn and document in the
                       project can utilized later in the project or in similar projects. Root cause
                       analysis of issues, supporting details of corrective actions, preventive
                       actions, and changes should be included as part of lessons learned
                       documentation. Any other stakeholder management lessons from the
                       project should also be recorded as part of the project's lessons learned
                       documentation.
                     * Stakeholder notifications The information you send and receive from
                       stakeholders becomes part of organizational process assets.
                     * Feedback from stakeholders Communications from stakeholders
                       become part of the project's organizational process assets.
                     * Project reports Reports on the project's performance, issues, risks, and
                       closure are part of organizational process assets.
                     * Project records Communications, meeting minutes, reports, and all other
                       types of stakeholder communications are part of organizational process

                         Controlling Stakeholder Engagement
                         Controlling stakeholder engagement doesn't mean you're controlling what stakehold-
                         ers do, but rather you're controlling the stakeholder engagement process. Think of it as
                         a check-up for the project management team and key stakeholders to ensure that all of
                         the stakeholder management work is being done properly, effectively, and according
                         to the stakeholder management plan. As the project moves deeper into its project life
                         cycle, you and the project team will work through stakeholder engagement. There can
                         become a lovely rhythm or a dreadful rut in the relationships created in stakeholder
                         engagement. This process ensures that you're following the stakeholder management
                         plan and meeting stakeholder expectations.
                             Controlling stakeholder engagements also occurs when conditions in the project
                         change. For example, let's revisit a bridge construction project. If the bridge construc-
                         tion project is expected to last six months, that's six months of some unhappy resi-
                         dents that are delayed or detoured because of your bridge project. The residents may
                         be happy for the new bridge, but the pain of the delay and detour is still aggravating.
                         Now imagine there's been rough weather, delays due to poor materials, or other issues
                         that have crept into the project. forcing your timeline to be expanded to ten months.
                         Conditions within the project have changed and you'll need to communicate with the
                         stakeholders about the delay, but you'll also need to continue to engage the stakehold-
                         ers in the project. You'll have to remind them about the new bridge, how much safer
                         it will be for them, and communicate other upbeat information to keep the stakehold-
                         ers engaged.

                                       EXAM TIP Don't engage the stakeholders just when there is good news or
                                       bad news. Controlling stakeholder engagement is a continuous process
                                       throughout the project.

                         Preparing to Control Stakeholder Engagement
                         In order to control the stakeholder engagement, you'll need some inputs to the project.
                         Specifically, you'll need four things to get this process moving:

                              * Project management plan The project management plan will define the
                                life cycle of the project, the execution of the project work, human resource
                                requirements, roles and responsibilities, staffing management, change
                                management, and communication requirements for stakeholders.
                              * Issue log You'll use the issue log to document, review, and update issues as
                                part of stakeholder engagement.
                              * Work performance data You'll need insight into how well the project is
                                performing in order to communicate with and engage the stakeholder
                                appropriately.

                                                                                                                               509
                        * Project documents All of the supporting details for the project and the
                          corresponding documentation can contribute to controlling stakeholder
                          engagement. Consider the project schedule, stakeholder register, issue log,
                          change log, and the project communications as the key project documents
                          you'll need for this process.

                   Controlling Stakeholder Engagement




                                                                                                                                             PART II
                   The actual day-to-day work of controlling stakeholder engagement is reliant on just
                   three tools and techniques. First, you'll need an information management system. An
                   information management system is where you'll document project information like
                   estimated and actual project costs, schedule progress, and overall project performance.
                   It's the system you'll use for project and performance reporting for the project stake-
                   holders. The information management system is the repository of all your project infor-
                   mation. This could be inside your favorite project management software, a spreadsheet
                   you've created, or a database. Whatever approach you and your organization decide to
                   use, it's only as good as the last time it was updated.
                        The second tool and technique is to rely on expert judgment to help control the
                   stakeholder engagement, identify new stakeholders as needed, and do periodic reas-
                   sessments of the stakeholders' attitudes and concerns toward the project. Expert judg-
                   ment can come from:

                       * Project managers
                        * Senior management
                        * Other key stakeholders
                        * Subject matter experts
                        * Consultants
                        * Trade associations

                       Your expert judgment resources can contribute through one-on-one meetings, focus
                   groups, or even surveys. Whatever approach you take, you must document the approach
                   and the outcomes of the event, and then act on what you've learned.
                       The third and final tool and technique for controlling stakeholder engagement is
                   every project manager's favorite: meetings. Yes, good old meetings help you control
                   stakeholder engagement because they allow you to bring stakeholders together to re-
                   view status, talk about the project performance, and analyze stakeholder information.
                   Meetings should have an agenda and a set time period, and someone should keep min-
                   utes from the meeting.

                   Reviewing the Outputs of Stakeholder Engagement
                   So you're working at controlling stakeholder engagement. Guess when this process
                   ends? When execution is done and the project moves into closing, that's when. It's a
                   long, iterative controlling process that you'll do throughout the entire project. As you

                         control stakeholder engagements, you'll be creating five things for your project and
                         organization:

                              * Work performance information The performance data from across the
                                project is collected and organized into comprehensive work performance
                                information. This is needed for project communications with the
                                stakeholders. You'll share project status, project performance reports, forecasts
                                for costs and schedule, and other information with the stakeholders.
                              * Change requests Yes, change requests can be a result of controlling
                                stakeholder engagement. Corrective actions and preventive actions are the
                                most likely changes you'll have as a result of controlling stakeholder
                                engagement.
                              * Project management plan updates You may need to update the project
                                plan as a result of controlling stakeholder engagement. While all areas of the
                                project management plan may need to be updated, the most likely
                                components to be updated are the:
                                 * Change management plan
                                 * Communications management plan
                                 * Cost management plan
                                 * Human resource management plan
                                 * Procurement management plan
                                 * Requirements management plan
                                 * Risk management plan
                                 * Schedule management plan
                                 * Scope management plan
                                 * Stakeholder management plan
                              * Project document updates Just as you may need to update the project
                                management plan, you may also need to update the project documents.
                                Specifically, the stakeholder register will likely be updated as a result of
                                controlling the stakeholder engagement, as will the issue log to reflect any
                                issue changes or new issues in the project.


                         Chapter Summary
                         Project stakeholder management is an ongoing activity in the project to ensure that the
                         stakeholders are identified, analyzed, and engaged throughout the project life cycle. It's
                         no secret that in many projects people are excited about the new endeavor, but as the
                         project moves into its planning and execution, the excitement and interest can wane.

                                                                                                                                511
                   It's up to the project manager to ensure that stakeholders are communicated with and
                   actively engaged in an ongoing effort during the project.
                        This new knowledge area in PMBOK Fifth Edition has just four processes. The first
                   process, which is part of project initiation, is to identify the project stakeholders. Re-
                   call that this activity should be as early as possible in the project to ensure that the
                   correct stakeholders are identified and classified for proper planning and engagement.
                   If you fail to identify a stakeholder, the stakeholder could, based on their power and




                                                                                                                                              PART II
                   influence in the organization, cause your project to be delayed, create additional costs,
                   or even have it canceled. That's why it's imperative to find and classify the project
                   stakeholders.
                        The second process in this knowledge area is to plan stakeholder management. This
                   process created the stakeholder management plan to ensure that the stakeholders have
                   been identified and that their needs are met during the project. Through the analysis
                   and classification of the stakeholders, you'll identify the level of engagement of the
                   project stakeholders. Recall that there are five levels of stakeholder engagement: un-
                   aware, resistant, neutral, supportive, and leading. These classifications can help you set
                   goals in a stakeholders' engagement assessment matrix to move stakeholders to new
                   levels of engagement.
                        The execution of engaging the project stakeholder really comes down to two key
                   tools: interpersonal skills and management skills. Interpersonal skills are characteristics
                   like being trustworthy, resolving conflict, and overcoming resistance to change. These
                   are more of the soft skills of project management that foster a good working relation-
                   ship between the project manager and the stakeholders. The second set of skills is
                   lumped into management skills. These are activities like facilitating consensus, influ-
                   encing people for project support, negotiating agreements, and changing organization-
                   al behavior for the betterment of the project.
                        The final process in project stakeholder management is the controlling of stake-
                   holder engagement. This process ensures that the project manager, the project team,
                   and other stakeholders are all being engaged and contributing to the project as needed.
                   Through information management systems, the project manager can collect perfor-
                   mance data and create reports, communications, and track events in the project for the
                   stakeholders. Expert judgment and meetings can also help the project manager ensure
                   that the stakeholders are being engaged and are informed as directed in the stakehold-
                   er management plan.

                   Key Terms
                   Interactive communications This type of communication means that information is
                   happening among stakeholders, like in a forum. Examples of interactive communica-
                   tions are meetings, videoconferences, phone calls, and ad-hoc conversations. Interac-
                   tive communications means that the participants are actively communicating with one
                   another.
                   Key stakeholder Stakeholders--such as management, the project manager, program
                   manager, or customers--that have the authority to make decisions in the project.

                         Leading stakeholder status Part of stakeholder analysis classification. A leading
                         stakeholder is aware of your project, they want your project to be successful, and
                         the stakeholder is working to make certain the project is a success.
                         Negative stakeholder A stakeholder who does not want the project to exist and is op-
                         posed to the project.
                         Neutral stakeholder A stakeholder who has neither a positive nor negative attitude
                         about the project's existence.
                         Neutral stakeholder status Part of stakeholder analysis classification. A neutral stake-
                         holder is aware of your project and is not concerned if the project succeeds or fails.
                         Positive stakeholder A stakeholder who sees the benefits of the project and is in favor
                         of the change the project is to bring about.
                         Profile analysis meeting This is an analysis meeting to examine and document the
                         roles in the project. The role's interests, concerns, influence, project knowledge, and at-
                         titude are documented.
                         Pull communications This type of communication pulls information from a central
                         repository. Pull communications allow stakeholders to retrieve information from a
                         central source as needed.
                         Push communications This type of communication happens when the sender push-
                         es the same message to multiple people. Good examples of push communications are
                         broadcast text messages, faxes, press releases, and group e-mails.
                         Reporting system A reporting system is a software program to store and analyze proj-
                         ect data for reporting. A common reporting system will take project data, allow the
                         project manager to pass the data through earned value management, for example, and
                         then create forecasting reports about the project costs and schedule.
                         Resistant stakeholder status Part of stakeholder analysis classification. A resistant
                         stakeholder is aware of your project, but they do support the changes your project will
                         create.
                         Stakeholder Anyone who is affected by the existence of the project or who can affect
                         the project's existence. Stakeholders can enter and exit the project as conditions change
                         within the project.
                         Stakeholder analysis An activity that ranks stakeholders based on their influence,
                         interests, and expectations of the project. Stakeholders are identified and ranked, and
                         then their needs and expectations are documented and addressed.
                         Stakeholder classification models These are charts and diagrams that help the proj-
                         ect manager determine the influence of stakeholders in relation to their interest in the
                         project. Common classification models include the power/interest grid, the power/in-
                         fluence grid, the influence/impact grid, and the salience model.
                         Stakeholder engagement The project manager works to keep the project stakehold-
                         ers interested, involved, and supportive of the project. Through communication, man-

                   Stakeholder management plan The stakeholder management plan documents a
                   strategy for managing the project stakeholders. The stakeholder management plan es-
                   tablishes stakeholder engagement and defines how the project manager can increase
                   and improve stakeholder engagement.
                   Stakeholder management planning The project manager works with the project team
                   and subject matter experts to create a strategy to manage the project stakeholders.
                   Stakeholder register A documentation of each stakeholder's contact information,
                   position, concerns, interests, and attitude toward the project. The project manager up-
                   dates the register as new stakeholders are identified and when stakeholders leave the
                   project.
                   Supportive stakeholder status This is part of stakeholder analysis classification. A
                   supportive stakeholder is aware of your project and is supportive and hopeful that the
                   project will be successful.
                   Unaware stakeholder status Part of stakeholder analysis classification. An unaware
                   status means the stakeholder doesn't know about the project and the effect the project
                   may create on the stakeholder.

                         Questions and Answers
                              1. You are the project manager of the GUY Project for your organization.
                                 This project has recently been chartered and you're starting the process of
                                 stakeholder identification. In this process, you're working with your project
                                 team, some of the known stakeholders, and your project sponsor. Which one
                                 of the following inputs will you NOT need for the stakeholder identification
                                 process?
                                  A. Organizational process assets
                                  B. Communications management plan
                                  C. Procurement documents
                                  D. Project charter
                                 B. The communications management plan is not an input to the stakeholder
                                 identification process. Choices A, C, and D are incorrect because these
                                 answers are inputs to the stakeholder identification process. The four inputs
                                 to this process are project charter, procurement documents, enterprise
                                 environmental factors, and organizational process assets.
                              2. Beth is the project manager for a large health care project. She is working
                                 with the project sponsor to define the steps she'll use to perform stakeholder
                                 analysis. Which of the following correctly defines the steps for stakeholder
                                 analysis?
                                  A. Identify and document the stakeholder information, create a
                                     communications management plan, plan for stakeholder management.
                                  B. Identify and document the stakeholder information, prioritize and classify
                                     the stakeholders, create the communications management plan for
                                     stakeholder management.
                                  C. Identify and document the stakeholder information, prioritize and classify
                                     the stakeholders, plan for stakeholder management.
                                  D. Create a focus group for known stakeholders, identify and document
                                     the stakeholder information, prioritize and classify the stakeholders, plan
                                     for stakeholder management.

                                                                      Chapter 13: Managing Project Stakeholder Management

                                                                                                                          519
                     C. Of all the choices presented, C is the best answer. Stakeholder identification
                     starts with the project manager identifying and documenting the stakeholders'
                     contact information, knowledge, expectations of the project, and their level of
                     influence over project decisions. Then, the project manager must prioritize and
                     classify stakeholders based on their power, influence, expectations, and
                     concerns for the project. Finally, Beth should plan for managing the
                     stakeholders based on possible negative or positive scenarios in the project




                                                                                                                                        PART II
                     that may affect the stakeholders. A, B, and D are incorrect because these
                     answers do not reflect the correct ordering of steps for stakeholder analysis.
                   3. You are the project manager for your organization. Management has asked
                      you to create a stakeholder classification model to show the amount of
                      authority stakeholders have over project decisions in relation to how much
                      their political capital and position in the company could affect the project.
                      What type of stakeholder classification model should you create?
                      A. A power/influence grid
                      B. A RAM matrix
                      C. An influence/impact grid
                      D. A RACI chart
                     A. Management is asking you to create a power/influence grid. Evaluating the
                     amount of power and influence a stakeholder has over the project will
                     determine where the stakeholder is placed on the grid. Stakeholders with
                     high power and high influence are top priority. Stakeholders with little power
                     and influence are still considered, but they have less priority than other
                     stakeholders in the project. B is incorrect because a RAM is a responsibility
                     assignment matrix. C is incorrect because this classification model focuses on
                     the influence of the stakeholders and the impact, not the power. D is
                     incorrect because RACI is a responsibility matrix that tracks a person's
                     responsibility, accountability, consulted, or informed status for each
                     assignment in the project.
                   4. Henry has been tasked to create a salience model for his project. This model
                      defines three characteristics for project stakeholders. Which one of the
                      following is NOT one of the three characteristics of the stakeholders mapped
                      in the salience model?
                      A. Power
                      B. Urgency
                      C. Legitimacy
                      D. Influence
                     D. A salience model plots out a person's power, urgency, and legitimacy in
                     the project. It does not include their influence. A, B, and C are incorrect
                     because these answers are part of the salience model.

                              5. You are the project manager of a large technology project for your company.
                                 This project will span the United States and parts of Europe. There are key
                                 stakeholders in all countries represented. As part of your stakeholder analysis
                                 you'd like to create a document that captures all of the stakeholders' contact
                                 information, assessment information, and classification in the project. What
                                 type of document are you creating?
                                  A. Stakeholder directory
                                  B. Stakeholder management plan
                                  C. Stakeholder register
                                  D. Stakeholder communications matrix
                                 C. You are creating a stakeholder register. The stakeholder register is the only
                                 output of stakeholder identification. It's a log of all the stakeholder
                                 information you've gathered in the project. It will help you communicate
                                 with project stakeholders, ensure that you understand the stakeholders needs,
                                 wants, and expectations, and helps you classify stakeholder objectives and
                                 priorities. A and D are incorrect because there are no project management
                                 documents called the stakeholder directory or the stakeholder
                                 communications matrix. B is incorrect because the stakeholder management
                                 plan defines how the stakeholder will be identified and engaged, and how
                                 stakeholder engagement will be controlled.
                              6. Terry is the project manager of the ARB project for his company. Terry
                                 approaches Scott for his insight about the schedule for releasing the product
                                 the project will create. Scott doesn't know anything about the project Terry
                                 is working on and is surprised to learn about the product. What type of
                                 stakeholder is Scott?
                                  A. Unaware
                                  B. Uninformed
                                  C. Neutral
                                  D. Sensitive
                                 A. Scott is an unaware stakeholder. Scott doesn't know about the project and
                                 the effect the project may have on him. B and D are incorrect choices because
                                 there is no stakeholder classification known as uninformed or sensitive. C is
                                 also incorrect because neutral describes a stakeholder who is neither opposed
                                 nor in favor of the project.
                              7. You are a project management consultant for your company and you're
                                 meeting the stakeholders for the first time. Mary, a stakeholder, tells you
                                 that she hates the project and she hopes that it fails miserably. What type of
                                 stakeholder is Mary?
                                  A. Resistant

                                                                                                                          521
                       B. Unhappy
                       C. Honest
                      D. Defiant
                      A. Mary is a resistant stakeholder. Mary, the stakeholder, knows about the
                      project and doesn't want the change the project will bring. While Mary may
                      be unhappy, honest, and defiant, these answers are not stakeholder




                                                                                                                                        PART II
                      classification types, so choices B, C, and D are incorrect.
                    8. You are the project manager of the HQL Project for your company. Henry, a
                       stakeholder, is in favor of your project and he's working with you to express
                       the importance of the project. Henry has offered to help with the project,
                       communicate with other stakeholders, and host status meetings. What type of
                       stakeholder is Henry?
                       A. Supportive
                       B. Cheerleader
                       C. Contractual
                      D. Leading
                      D. Henry is considered to be a leading stakeholder. Henry, the stakeholder,
                      knows about the project, is supportive of the change the project may bring
                      about, and is working to make the project successful. A, supportive, isn't the
                      best choice because Henry is doing more than just supporting the project--
                      he's helping the project be successful. B, cheerleader, and C, contractual, are
                      not valid stakeholder classification types.
                    9. Sammy is the project manager of the KHG Project. Some of the stakeholder
                       in this project are opposed to the project, some are in favor of the project,
                       and some stakeholders are neutral. Management has asked Sammy to create
                       a chart that shows the current status of engagement for each stakeholder and
                       the desired level of engagement for each stakeholder. What type of chart is
                       management asking for?
                       A. Stakeholder engagement mapping
                       B. Stakeholder engagement control chart
                       C. Stakeholder histogram
                      D. Stakeholder engagement assessment matrix
                      D. Management is asking Sammy to create a stakeholder engagement
                      assessment matrix to see where stakeholder engagement is now and where it
                      should be in the future. A, B, and C are incorrect because these are not valid
                      charts for stakeholder engagement assessments.
                   10. You are the project manager of the GUY Project for your company and you're
                       working with your project team on some stakeholder issues. You want to

                                 examine the interrelationships among the project stakeholders for better
                                 communications. What project management plan will you refer to?
                                  A. Project communications management plan
                                  B. Project stakeholder management plan
                                  C. Project stakeholder register
                                  D. Project staffing management plan
                                 B. The stakeholder management plan defines several things to the project
                                 manager about the stakeholders, including information about the
                                 interrelationships among the project stakeholders. A, C, and D are incorrect.
                                 The project communications management plan does not define the
                                 interrelationships among stakeholders. C, the stakeholder register, defines
                                 contact information about each stakeholder. D, the project staffing
                                 management plan, addresses human resource needs, not communications
                                 and stakeholder management.
                             11. Holly is a new project manager and she's confused about the need for
                                 the change log and how it relates to the stakeholder engagement. Why is the
                                 change log an input to the management stakeholder engagement process?
                                  A. Because it documents any changes to the stakeholder contact information
                                  B. Because it documents any changes to the stakeholder register
                                  C. Because it communicates changes to the stakeholders
                                  D. Because it communicates changes about the stakeholders to management
                                 C. The change log will help Holly manage stakeholder engagement because
                                 she will need to relay information about changes to the appropriate parties.
                                 Change can be a sensitive issue in some instances, so always examine the
                                 change and think through all of the possible scenarios and reactions the
                                 stakeholders may have to the change. Changes to the stakeholder information
                                 are reflected in the stakeholder register, not the change log, so A and B are
                                 incorrect. D is also incorrect because the change log isn't needed to update
                                 and communicate changes about the stakeholders.
                             12. Part of stakeholder management is the reliance on interpersonal skills. Which
                                 one of the following is an interpersonal skill?
                                  A. Facilitation
                                  B. Analysis of product scope
                                  C. Conflict resolution
                                  D. Influence
                                 C. Conflict resolution is an interpersonal skill a project manager will need to
                                 engage and manage stakeholders' interests in the project. A is incorrect
                                 because facilitation is a management skill. B is incorrect because analysis of




13-ch13.indd 522                                                                                                                 7/12/2013 4:58:22 AM

                                                                       Chapter 13: Managing Project Stakeholder Management

                                                                                                                           523
                       the product scope is not an interpersonal skill. D is also incorrect because
                       influence is part of the managerial skills.
                   13. Just as you need interpersonal skills, you'll also need management skills to
                       effectively engage the stakeholders in the project. Which one is a management
                       skill?
                       A. Trustworthiness




                                                                                                                                         PART II
                       B. Active listening
                       C. Influence
                       D. Conflict resolution
                       C. Influence is considered a management skill because you'll need to
                       persuade people to buy in and support the project. A, B, and D are all
                       incorrect because these answers are part of the interpersonal skill set for
                       project managers.
                   14. As a PMP and CAPM candidate, you should be familiar with the inputs,
                       tools and techniques, and outputs of the project management process. The
                       management of stakeholder engagement creates five outputs. Which one of
                       the following is not an output of the process?
                       A. An issue log
                       B. Change requests
                       C. Project management plan updates
                       D. Project schedule for stakeholder communications
                       D. The schedule for stakeholder communications is more likely a part of the
                       project communications management plan. A, B, and C are incorrect because
                       these answers are outputs of the manage stakeholder engagement process.
                       The process creates five outputs: issue log, change requests, project
                       management plan updates, project document updates, and organizational
                       process assets updates.
                   15. You are coaching several new project managers on effective control of
                       stakeholder engagement. The project managers are confused as to why the
                       change requests come from this project. What is the most likely type of change
                       that will come from controlling stakeholder engagements?
                       A. Technology change
                       B. Errors or omissions in requirements
                       C. External changes
                       D. Corrective actions
                       D. Defects are changes that have already happened because the defect is
                       different than what was planned in the project. A defect to be solved requires
                       a change through a corrective action to get the results back in alignment with




13-ch13.indd 523                                                                                                            7/12/2013 4:58:22 AM

              524
                                 the project scope. A, B, and C are all examples of common change requests,
                                 but the most likely change from controlling stakeholder engagements will be
                                 from corrective actions.
                             16. Ned is the project manager of the NHQ Project and he's meeting with a few
                                 key stakeholders to determine their roles, interests, concerns, influence, and
                                 attitude about the project. What type of meeting is Ned hosting?
                                  A. Kickoff meeting
                                  B. Stakeholder classification meeting
                                  C. Profile analysis meeting
                                  D. Stakeholder status meeting
                                 C. This is an example of a profile analysis meeting. Ned is learning and
                                 documenting as much as he can about the stakeholders to better engage them
                                 in the project. A is incorrect because the kickoff meeting launches the project.
                                 B and D are incorrect because the stakeholder classification meeting and the
                                 stakeholder status meeting are not valid meeting types.
                             17. What type of communication is happening in a meeting with several
                                 stakeholders exchanging ideas?
                                  A. Interactive
                                  B. Push-pull
                                  C. Conferring
                                  D. Cooperative
                                 A. This is an example of interactive communications. This type of
                                 communication means that information is happening among stakeholders,
                                 like in a forum or meeting. B, C, and D are incorrect because push-pull,
                                 conferring, and cooperative are not valid communication types.
                             18. You are the project manager of a large construction project. You have created
                                 a website that allows the different functional manager to log in to a secured
                                 area, run queries, and generate reports on the time, cost, scope, changes, risks,
                                 and human resource aspects of your project. What type of communication is
                                 this?
                                  A. Pull
                                  B. Push
                                  C. Conferring
                                  D. Static
                                 A. This is an example of pull communication because the functional
                                 managers are retrieving information from your web server. B is incorrect
                                 because push communications require the project manager to push




13-ch13.indd 524                                                                                                                 7/12/2013 4:58:22 AM

                                                                       Chapter 13: Managing Project Stakeholder Management

                                                                                                                           525
                       information out to the stakeholders. C and D are incorrect because conferring
                       and static are not valid communication types.
                   19. Which one of the following examples best describes a push communication?
                       A. A blog about the project
                       B. A secured blog for functional managers
                       C. A project newsletter for the stakeholders from the project manager




                                                                                                                                         PART II
                       D. The project management plan
                       C. Push communication means that one person is sending out the information
                       to other people. Of all the choices, the newsletter from the project manager to
                       the project stakeholders is the best example of a push communication. A and B
                       are incorrect because the blog, secured or not, represents pull communication.
                       D is incorrect because although the project management plan provides
                       information, it's not a definitive communication method.
                   20. Your project has 45 stakeholders as of today. You've just learned that next
                       week 29 new stakeholders will be joining the project. How many more
                       communication channels will you have next week?
                       A. 406
                       B. 990
                       C. 1711
                       D. 2701
                       C. To solve this problem, you'll have to use the communications channel
                       formula of N(N-1)/2, where N represents the number of stakeholders. You'll
                       first have to find the current number of communication channels, which is
                       990. Then, you'll find the channels with added stakeholders, which is 2701.
                       Finally, you'll find the difference of 2701 and 990, which is 1711 more
                       communication channels. A is incorrect because 406 represents the
                       communication channels just among the 29 additional stakeholders. B is
                       incorrect because 990 represents the current amount of communication
                       channels. D is incorrect because 2701 is the total amount of communication
                       channels, not the difference in communication channels between this week
                       and next.

                        * Explore the PMI Code of Ethics and Professional Conduct
                        * Learn the structure of the Code
                        * Learn about the Code's stance on fairness and honesty
                        * Adhere to the Code's mandatory standards




                   In 1981, back when Jordache jeans and the song "Bette Davis Eyes" were all the rage,
                   some folks at the PMI (Project Management Institute) were more concerned with ethics
                   than parachute pants. The PMI created the Ethics, Standards, and Accreditation Group
                   to generate a code of ethics for the project management profession. Sounds like a bunch
                   of fun, doesn't it? By the end of the '80s, the group's discussions and reports evolved
                   into the "Ethics Standard for the Project Management Professional." In 1998, this doc-
                   ument became the early version of a new "Code of Ethics." The Code of Ethics was a
                   code that all PMI members, whether certified as a project manager or not, agreed to
                   abide by in their professional practices. Consequently, in January 1999, the Ethics,
                   Standards, and Accreditation Group approved a process for ethics complaints to be
                   filed, reviewed, and then acted on if the complaint proved valid.

                       Since the late '90s the global economy has changed. The business world has been
                   rocked by billion-dollar companies going bankrupt, we've all witnessed (or participat-
                   ed in) the dot-com bust, and we've experienced the rise of worldwide competition for
                   jobs. Part of all this chaos is the realization that ethics and moral standards vary among
                   countries, companies, and cultures. The PMI Code of Ethics and Professional Conduct,
                   once just a one-page document, has become outdated.
                       The PMI also has considered the boom in their membership population. The PMI
                   has grown from just a few hundred U.S.-based members to several hundred thousand
                   members worldwide. From its inception, the goal of the Code of Ethics and Profes-
                   sional Conduct was to create a moral guideline for project managers of all industries to
                   subscribe to a common concept of fairness and honesty, and to be held to a higher

                                                                                                                    527

                         level of expectations than project managers who were not members of the PMI. At least
                         that was the theory. I'm sure most of us know project managers who are PMI members
                         but who certainly don't subscribe to the PMI Code of Ethics. Shame, shame, shame on
                         them.
                             Because the PMI Code of Ethics and Professional Conduct was outdated, the PMI
                         created a new governing body, the Ethics Standard Review Committee, to examine the
                         project management Code of Ethics in regard to this new world that project managers
                         operate within. Part of this committee's work was to include a global approach to the
                         review of the now-defunct Code of Ethics and Professional Conduct, the ethical consid-
                         erations of the global market, and a desire to create a more exact and detailed descrip-
                         tion of what the ethics and character of a PMI member should be. The result was the
                         PMI Code of Ethics and Professional Conduct.
                             While the concepts in the PMI Code of Ethics and Professional Conduct are appli-
                         cable to all project managers, you'll also be tested on these principles. Your PMI exami-
                         nation will include these ethical concepts throughout the exam. You'll be tested on
                         ethics as part of your overall project management, not just on a separate section on the
                         code. After all, ethics are interspersed in your duties as a project manager, thus it is ap-
                         propriate they be included in your examination as well.
                             The PMI Code of Ethics and Professional Conduct is arranged by chapters and sec-
                         tions. And, as is the case with most documents from the PMI, you'd think a bunch of
                         attorneys wrote the thing. No offense to my pals at the PMI--it's a great document. Re-
                         ally. However, in this chapter, I'll break down their document into a slightly less formal,
                         and much less official, approach. I hope you like it.

                         Learning the Code of Ethics
                         The first chapter of the PMI Code of Ethics and Professional Conduct paints the big
                         picture of what the code is intended for. The vision of the code is, no doubt, that the
                         project management community will adopt the code in their day-to-day operations
                         and lives as representatives of the PMI. The code is needed because project managers
                         are often in situations where their ethics could be jeopardized. When you consider is-
                         sues with project labor, unscrupulous vendors, and the temptation of personal gain for
                         project managers, it's a great idea to have a Code of Ethics and Professional Conduct.
                         Let's take a detailed look at this first chapter.

                         Exploring the Code's Vision and Purpose
                         The project management community should do what's "right and honorable." I'm sure
                         we all want to reflect those same values in our conduct and see them in the conduct of
                         other project managers. The PMI Code of Ethics and Professional Conduct goes beyond
                         your role as a project manager. The code wants adherence in all areas of our lives: "at

                                                            Chapter 14: Understanding the Code of Ethics and Professional Conduct

                                                                                                                                 529
                   work, at home, and in service to our profession." Don't most of us live, eat, and sleep
                   project management, anyway?
                       The real purpose of the code is reputation. From the PMI's point of view, the code
                   and our agreement to adhere to the code will raise the perception of the ethical values
                   project managers agree to--and are expected to abide by--as members and participants
                   in PMI programs. The code is also a motivation to become a better project management
                   practitioner. In theory, establishing a globally accepted code for our ethics and behavior




                                                                                                                                               PART II
                   should raise our credibility, reputation, and collective behavior to new standards.

                   Participating in the Code
                   In the past, Project Management Professionals (PMPs) were expected to adhere to the
                   PMP Code of Conduct. Certified Associates in Project Management (CAPMs) were ex-
                   pected to adhere to the CAPM Code of Conduct. And members of the PMI who were
                   credentialed as PMPs or CAPMs were also held to a separate ethical standard. It made
                   more sense, of course, to create a blanket code of ethics for all members and certified
                   candidates. So basically, everyone who's a PMI member, a CAPM, a PMP, Program Man-
                   ager Professional (PgMP), or any other PMI designation must agree to participate in
                   this PMI Code of Ethics and Professional Conduct.

                                NOTE Kudos to the PMI on this decision! A simple solution is usually the
                                best solution. I'm thrilled with this new code, its detailed descriptions, and
                                application to all PMI participants.

                   Learning the Code Details
                   The code includes four values that are core to the ethics and standards for project
                   managers:

                        * Responsibility
                        * Respect
                        * Fairness
                        * Honesty

                       These four values compose the final four chapters of the Code of Ethics and Profes-
                   sional Conduct. Within each of these values are aspirational standards and mandatory
                   standards. Basically, there are some characteristics of these values that we as project
                   managers should aspire to, and there are other facets of these values that we must ad-
                   here to.
                       The code also contains some comments for examples and clarification. You'll also
                   find a glossary of terms in the code--something our pals at the PMI haven't provided
                   before. I'll list those terms at the end of this chapter. No fair peeking!

                         Serving Responsibly as a Project Manager
                         The second chapter of the PMI Code of Ethics and Professional Conduct centers on
                         responsibility. We as project managers already have a level of responsibility based
                         on the organizational structure we operate in (from functional to projectized).

                         Defining Responsibility
                         According to the Code of Ethics and Professional Conduct, responsibility is our duty to
                         take ownership for the decisions we make--or fail to make. It's also our duty to take
                         ownership of our actions--or lack of actions. And finally, it's our duty to take owner-
                         ship of the results of those decisions and actions.

                                       NOTE That's my favorite section of the entire Code of Ethics and
                                       Professional Conduct. I may be on my soapbox here, but I tire of project
                                       managers who won't own their decisions or failures. It's an excellent section.

                         Aspiring to Responsibility Expectations
                         Project managers need to aspire to responsibility. Here are the details of the responsi-
                         bility aspirations for this section of the Code of Ethics and Professional Conduct:

                              * Project managers need to make decisions that don't adversely affect the best
                                interests of society, public safety, and the environment.
                              * Project managers should only accept assignments that mesh with their
                                background, experience, skills, and qualifications.
                              * Project managers keep their promises.
                              * Project managers take ownership of and accountability for their errors and
                                omissions and make quick and accurate corrections. When errors are
                                discovered, project managers are to communicate them to the proper parties
                                and to act to repair those errors immediately.
                              * Project managers protect proprietary and confidential information. No
                                gossiping or blabbing.
                              * Project managers uphold the Code of Ethics and Professional Conduct and
                                hold others accountable to it as well.

                             Remember, these are aspirations of the responsibility portion of the Code of Eth-
                         ics and Professional Conduct. There will be tough instances, mutually exclusive deci-
                         sions, and scenarios that will call these aspirations into question.

                                                           Chapter 14: Understanding the Code of Ethics and Professional Conduct

                                                                                                                               531
                   Adhering to Mandatory Standards
                   Project managers have to deal with regulations, laws, contracts, and other mandatory
                   requirements in their projects. This section acknowledges those requirements. Let's
                   have a look at what the Code of Ethics and Professional Conduct calls for:

                        * Project managers have a mandatory responsibility to adhere to regulatory
                          requirements and laws.




                                                                                                                                             PART II
                        * Project managers adhering to this code have a mandatory responsibility to
                          report unethical or illegal conduct to management and those affected by the
                          conduct.
                        * Project managers are required to bring valid, fact-driven violations of the
                          Code of Ethics and Professional Conduct to the PMI for resolution.
                        * Disciplinary action should commence for project managers who seek to
                          retaliate against a person raising ethics violations concerns.

                       Project managers must adhere to these points and agree to participate in them in
                   their roles in the project management community.


                   Adhering to the Respect Value
                   Rodney Dangerfield always quipped, "I don't get no respect." And Aretha Franklin
                   sang "R-E-S-P-E-C-T" in Blues Brothers 2000. Okay, I may be reaching here when it
                   comes to a topic intro, but how many times in a project management book are you
                   going to see Aretha Franklin and Rodney Dangerfield mentioned, and in the same
                   paragraph no less?
                       My point is that both of these performers were talking about the same thing: the
                   admiration and reverence they believed they deserved from their peers. Respect in
                   the PMI Code of Ethics and Professional Conduct centers not only on the respect we
                   may deserve as project managers, but also on the respect that others are due through
                   their work and contributions to our projects. Respect in project management also is
                   aimed toward our respect for the environment we operate within.

                   Aspiring to Respect
                   There are four standards for respect:

                        * Learn about the norms and customs of others, and avoid behavior that others
                          may find disrespectful.
                        * Listen to others and seek to understand their points of view and opinions.
                        * Don't avoid people whom you have conflicts or disagreement with. Approach
                          them in an attempt to resolve your differences.
                        * Conduct yourself professionally, even when those you deal with don't act
                          professionally.

                            Respect among individuals and toward the environment promotes trust, confi-
                         dence, and shared ownership of the project work and deliverables.

                         Adhering to the Mandatory Values of Respect
                         As project managers, we demand of ourselves and of fellow project managers four things
                         regarding respect. Here's what the Code of Ethics and Professional Conduct details:

                              * Project managers negotiate in good faith.
                              * Project managers don't influence decisions for personal gain at the expense of
                                others.
                              * Project managers are not abusive toward others.
                              * Project managers respect the property rights of others.

                             Project managers are to "take the high road" in their dealings with clients and
                         stakeholders.


                         Being a Fair Project Manager
                         Ever hear the phrase, "All's fair in love and war"? Or how about, "Life just isn't fair"?
                         Sure you have. So, what is fairness? Do we need the wisdom of King Solomon to know
                         what's fair? Is fairness different from what's just? These are the types of questions the
                         PMI Code of Ethics and Professional Conduct hopes we will ask ourselves and others.
                             Fairness is our duty to make decisions and act impartially and objectively. Our be-
                         havior, as project managers, is to be void of competing self-interests, prejudice, and fa-
                         voritism. Sounds wonderfully complex, doesn't it?

                         Aspiring to Fairness
                         Project managers are to aspire to four things in the realm of fairness:

                              * Project managers should demonstrate transparency in decision making.
                              * Project managers must constantly be impartial and objective and take
                                corrective actions when appropriate.
                              * Project managers provide equal access to information to those who are
                                authorized to have that information.
                              * Project managers make opportunities equally available to all qualified
                                candidates.

                             These are some of the lofty aspirations we must have as project managers. They are
                         also characteristics we should strive toward in our day-to-day lives.

                                                            Chapter 14: Understanding the Code of Ethics and Professional Conduct

                                                                                                                                 533
                   Adhering to the Mandatory Standards on Fairness
                   There are five values that PMI participants must adhere to regarding fairness. Two of the
                   standards apply to conflict-of-interest scenarios, while the remaining three require-
                   ments center on favoritism and discrimination. Project managers are to:

                        * Fully disclose any real or potential conflict of interest.
                        * Refrain from participating in any decision where a real or potential conflict of




                                                                                                                                               PART II
                          interest exists until we, the project managers, have disclosed the situation,
                          have an approved mitigation plan, and have the consent of the project
                          stakeholders to proceed.
                        * Refrain from hiring or firing, rewarding or punishing, or awarding or denying
                          contracts based on personal considerations such as favoritism, nepotism, or
                          bribery.
                        * Refrain from discriminating against others on as the basis of race, gender, age,
                          religion, disability, nationality, or sexual orientation.
                        * Always apply the rules of the organization (the organization being your
                          employer, the PMI, or other performing organization) without favoritism or
                          prejudice.

                        I think it's safe to say, in regard to these requirements, that if we follow the rules of
                   our employers, the laws of our country, and the calling voice of our conscience, we'll be
                   all right.


                   Being an Honest Project Manager
                   Honesty is being truthful in our conversations and in our actions. This means that we,
                   as project managers, don't over promise, give dates that we know are bad, or sandbag
                   our budgets and deliverables. We do what we say and we say what's truthful. Like the
                   other values in the Code of Ethics and Professional Conduct, honesty has both aspiring
                   and mandatory standards.

                   Aspiring to Honesty
                   According to the Code of Ethics and Professional Conduct, project managers should
                   aspire to five traits of honesty:

                        * Seek the truth.
                        * Be truthful in communications and conduct.
                        * Provide accurate and timely information.
                        * Provide commitments and promises in good faith.
                        * Strive to create an environment where others feel safe to tell the truth.

                            These five aspirations are noble. As project managers, we are often rushed by stake-
                         holders to get the work done. These five aspirations cause us to pause and reflect on
                         what's honest and truthful in our communications to project team members, stake-
                         holders, and ourselves.

                                       EXAM COACH To answer project management ethics questions, you should
                                       first abide by the laws of the country. Second, follow your company's policies.
                                       Third, follow the cultural standards of the location where the project is being
                                       managed. Fourth, follow your own ethics. And fifth, as a last resort, if you don't
                                       know what to do, imagine what an angel would do and answer the question
                                       accordingly.

                         Living the Honesty Requirements
                         There are just two mandatory standards for honesty in the Code of Ethics and Profes-
                         sional Conduct:

                              * We do not engage in or condone behavior that is designed to mislead others.
                                This includes, but isn't limited to:
                                 * Creating misleading statements
                                 * Creating false statements
                                 * Stating half-truths
                                 * Providing information out of context
                                 * Withholding information that if known would render our statements as
                                   false
                              * We do not engage in dishonest behavior with the intention of personal gain at
                                the expense of others.

                             Basically, as project managers, we don't lie. We are required, according to the code,
                         to tell the truth regardless of the impact it may have on us, our project team, or our
                         projects. How many project managers do you know who are living by this requirement
                         already?


                         Chapter Summary
                         PMPs and CAPMs agree to abide by the PMI Code of Ethics and Professional Con-
                         duct--it's part of the exam application process. While no document can force anyone
                         to behave ethically and professionally, this document encourages all PMI members to
                         adhere to a standard of ethics, morals, and professionalism. While the goal of the PMI
                         Code of Ethics and Professional Conduct is to promote ethics in project management
                         as a profession, you'll also be tested on these concepts on the CAPM and the PMP ex-

                                                           Chapter 14: Understanding the Code of Ethics and Professional Conduct

                                                                                                                                535
                   ams. It will behoove you to read over the actual PMI document from their website and
                   familiarize yourself with the associated concepts, sections, and key terms.
                       The code includes four values for all PMI members: responsibility, respect, fairness,
                   and honesty. You can apply these four values to all areas of a project, from initiation all
                   the way through closing. As a project manager you'll likely face some ethical choices,
                   but these four values can help guide you through the correct decisions. It's also these
                   four values that make up the major sections of the Code of Ethics and Professional




                                                                                                                                              PART II
                   Conduct. In each of these values you'll also find mandatory standards and aspirational
                   standards: things we're required to do and things we should do.
                       As a project manager you may find yourself working with people from different
                   cultures and countries than your own. You should treat other cultures with respect; just
                   because your culture is different from others doesn't mean your culture is better or
                   worse, only different. When you're working in a different country than your home, you
                   should first educate yourself on how to behave in this new environment. You'll want to
                   understand the politics, the culture, and the work ethic to better operate in the environ-
                   ment. And finally, just because you take the initiative to learn about and respect other
                   cultures doesn't mean they'll do the same for you. Regardless, treat all with respect and
                   you'll win respect in return.

                   Key Terms
                   Abusive manner Treating others with conduct that may result in harm, fear, humilia-
                   tion, manipulation, or exploitation. For example, berating a project team member be-
                   cause they've taken longer than expected to complete a project assignment may be
                   considered humiliation.
                   Conflict of interest A situation where a project manager may have two competing
                   duties of loyalty. For example, purchasing software from a relative may benefit the rela-
                   tive, but it may do harm to the performing organization.
                   Duty of loyalty A project manager's responsibility to be loyal to another person, or-
                   ganization, or vendor. For example, a project manager has a duty of loyalty to promote
                   the best interests of an employer rather than the best interests of a vendor.
                   PMI member Anyone, whether certified as a project manager or not, who has joined
                   the Project Management Institute.
                   Practitioner A person who is serving in the capacity of a project manager or contrib-
                   uting to the management of a project, portfolio of projects, or program. For example, a
                   program manager is considered to be a project practitioner under this definition.

                   Questions
                        1. You are the project manager of the JKN Project. The project customer has
                           requested that you inflate your cost estimates by 25 percent. He reports that
                           his management always reduces the cost of the estimates, so this is the only

                                 method to get the monies needed to complete the project. Which of the
                                 following is the best response to this situation?
                                  A. Do as the customer asked to ensure that the project requirements can be
                                     met by adding the increase as a contingency reserve.
                                  B. Do as the customer asked to ensure that the project requirements can be
                                     met by adding the increase across each task.
                                  C. Do as the customer asked by creating an estimate for the customer's
                                     management and another for the actual project implementation.
                                  D. Complete an accurate estimate of the project. In addition, create a risk
                                     assessment on why the project budget would be inadequate.
                              2. You are the project manager for the BNH Project. This project takes place in
                                 a different country than where you are from. The project leader from this
                                 country presents a team of workers that are only from his family. What should
                                 you do?

                                  D. Replace the project leader with an impartial project leader.
                              3. You are about to begin negotiations on a new project that is to take place
                                 in another country. Which of the following should be your guide on what
                                 business practices are allowed and discouraged?
                                  A. The project charter
                                  B. The project plan

                                 because he needed to pay for his daughter's school tuition. He says that he
                                 has paid back the money by working overtime without reporting the hours
                                 worked so that his theft remains private. What should you do?

                   5. You are the project manager of the SUN Project. Your organization is a
                      functional environment, and you do not get along well with the functional
                      manager leading the project. You disagree with the manager on how the
                      project should proceed, the timings of the activities, the suggested schedule,
                      and the expected quality of the work. The manager has requested that you get
                      to work on several of the activities on the critical path even though you and
                      she have not solved the issues concerning the project. What should you do?




                                                                                                                                         PART II

                   6. The PMI has contacted you regarding an ethics violation of a PMP candidate.
                      The question is in regard to a friend who said he worked as a project manager
                      under your guidance. You know this is not true, but to save a friendship, you
                      avoid talking with the PMI. This is a violation of what?
                      A. The Code of Ethics and Professional Conduct to cooperate on ethics
                         violations investigations

                      D. The law concerning ethical practices
                   7. You are the project manager for the Log Cabin Project. One of your vendors
                      is completing a large portion of the project. You have heard a rumor that
                      the vendor is losing many of its workers due to labor issues. In light of this
                      information, what should you do?
                      A. Stop work with the vendor until the labor issues are resolved.
                      B. Communicate with the vendor in regard to the rumor.
                      C. Look to secure another vendor to replace the current one.
                      D. Negotiate with the labor union to secure the workers on your project.
                   8. You are the project manager for the PMH Project. Three vendors have
                      submitted cost estimates for the project. One of the estimates is significantly
                      higher than similar project work in the past. In this scenario, you should do
                      what?
                      A. Ask the other vendors about the higher estimate from the third vendor.
                      B. Use the cost estimates from the historical information.
                      C. Take the high cost to the vendor to discuss the discrepancy before
                         reviewing the issue with the other vendors.

                                  D. Ask the vendor that supplied the high estimate for information on how
                                     the estimate was prepared.
                              9. You are the project manager of the LKH Project. This project must be
                                 completed within six months. The project is two months into the schedule
                                 and is starting to slip. As of now, the project is one week behind schedule.
                                 Based on your findings, you believe that you can make some corrective
                                 actions and recover the lost time over the next month to get the project back
                                 on schedule. Management, however, requires weekly status reports on cost
                                 and schedule. What should you do?
                                  A. Report that the project is one week behind schedule, but will finish on
                                     schedule based on cited corrective actions.
                                  B. Report that the project is on schedule and will finish on schedule.
                                  C. Report that the project is off schedule by a few days, but will finish on
                                     schedule.
                                  D. Report that the project is running late.
                             10. As a contracted project manager, you have been assigned a project with a
                                 budget of $1.5 million. The project is scheduled to last seven months, but
                                 your most recent earned value management (EVM) report shows that the
                                 project will finish ahead of schedule by nearly six weeks. If this happens, you
                                 will lose $175,000 in billable time. What should you do?
                                  A. Bill for the entire $1.5 million, since this was the approved budget.
                                  B. Bill for the $1.5 million by adding additional work at the end of the
                                     project.
                                  C. Report to the customer the project status and completion date.
                                  D. Report to the customer the project status and completion date, and ask if
                                     they'd like to add any additional features to account for the monies not
                                     spent.
                             11. You are the project manager of the PMH Project. You have been contracted
                                 to design the placement of several pieces of manufacturing equipment. You
                                 have completed the project scope and are ready to pass the work over to the
                                 installer. The installer begins to schedule you to help with the installation of
                                 the manufacturing equipment. You should do what?
                                  A. Help the installer place the equipment according to the design documents.
                                  B. Help the installer place the equipment as the customer sees fit.
                                  C. Refuse to help the installer, since the project scope has been completed.
                                  D. Help the installer place the equipment, but insist that the quality control
                                     be governed by your design specifications.
                             12. You are the project manager of the 12BA Project. You have completed the
                                 project according to the design documents and have met the project scope.

                       The customer agrees that the design document requirements have been met;
                       however, the customer is not pleased with the project deliverables and is
                       demanding additional adjustments be made to complete the project. What is
                       the best way to continue?
                       A. Complete the work as the customer has requested.
                       B. Complete the work at 1.5 times the billable rate.

                       C. Do nothing. The project scope is completed.
                       D. Do nothing. Management from the performing organization and the
                          customer's organization will need to determine why the project failed
                          before adding work.
                   13. You are the project manager of the AAA Project. Due to the nature of the
                       project, much of the work will require overtime between Christmas and New
                       Year's Day. Many of the project team members, however, have requested
                       vacation during that week. What is the best way to continue?
                       A. Refuse all vacation requests and require all team members to work.
                       B. Only allow vacation requests for those team members who are not needed
                          during that week.
                       C. Divide tasks equally among the team members so each works the same
                          amount of time.
                       D. Allow team members to volunteer for the overtime work.
                   14. You are a project manager for your organization. Your project is to install
                       several devices for one of your company's clients. The client has requested that
                       you complete a few small tasks that are not in the project scope. To maintain
                       the relationship with the client, you oblige her request and complete the work
                       without informing your company. This is an example of what?
                       A. Effective expert judgment
                       B. Failure to satisfy the scope of professional services
                       C. Contract change control
                       D. Integrated change control
                   15. You are completing a project for a customer in another country. One of the
                       customs in this country is to honor the project manager of a successful project
                       with a gift. Your company, however, does not allow project managers to accept
                       gifts worth more than $50 from any entity. At the completion of the project,
                       the customer presents you with a new car in a public ceremony. What should
                       you do?
                       A. Accept the car, since it is a custom of the country. To refuse it would be an
                          insult to your hosts.
                       B. Refuse to accept the car, since it would result in a conflict with your
                          organization's policy on gifts.

                                  D. Accept the car and then donate the car to a charity in the customer's name.
                             16. You have a project team member who is sabotaging your project because he
                                 does not agree with it. What should you do?

                                 leader has hired family members for several lucrative contracts on the project.
                                 What should you consider?
                                  A. Cultural issues
                                  B. Ethical issues

                             18. Of the following, which one achieves customer satisfaction?
                                  A. Completing the project requirements
                                  B. Maintaining the project cost
                                  C. Maintaining the project schedule
                                  D. Completing the project with the defined quality metrics
                             19. A PMP has been assigned to manage a project in a foreign country. The
                                 disorientation the PMP will likely experience as he gets acclimated to the
                                 country is known as what?
                                  A. Sapir-Whorf hypothesis

                                  C. Ethnocentrism
                                  D. Culture shock
                             20. You are the project manager for an information technology project. It has
                                 come to your attention that a technical problem has stopped the project work.
                                 How should you proceed?
                                  A. Measure the project performance to date, and account for the cost of the
                                     technical problem.
                                  B. Rebaseline the project performance to account for the technical problem.

                                                       Chapter 14: Understanding the Code of Ethics and Professional Conduct

                                                                                                                            541
                        C. Work with the project team to develop alternative solutions to the
                           technical problem.
                       D. Outsource the technical problem to a vendor.


                   Questions and Answers
                     1. You are the project manager of the JKN Project. The project customer has




                                                                                                                                          PART II
                        requested that you inflate your cost estimates by 25 percent. He reports that
                        his management always reduces the cost of the estimates, so this is the only
                        method to get the monies needed to complete the project. Which of the
                        following is the best response to this situation?
                        A. Do as the customer asked to ensure that the project requirements can be
                           met by adding the increase as a contingency reserve.
                        B. Do as the customer asked to ensure that the project requirements can be
                           met by adding the increase across each task.
                        C. Do as the customer asked by creating an estimate for the customer's
                           management and another for the actual project implementation.
                       D. Complete an accurate estimate of the project. In addition, create a risk
                          assessment on why the project budget would be inadequate.
                       D. It would be inappropriate to bloat the project costs by 25 percent. A risk
                       assessment describing how the project may fail if the budget is not accurate is
                       most appropriate. A, B, and C are all incorrect, since these choices are ethically
                       wrong. The PMP should always provide honest estimates of the project work.
                     2. You are the project manager for the BNH Project. This project takes place in
                        a different country than where you are from. The project leader from this
                        country presents a team of workers that are only from his family. What should
                        you do?
                        A. Reject the team leader's recommendations, and assemble your own project
                           team.
                        B. Review the resumes and qualifications of the proposed project team before
                           approving the team.
                        C. Determine if the country's traditions include hiring from the immediate
                           family before hiring from outside the family.
                       D. Replace the project leader with an impartial project leader.
                       C. You should first confirm what the local practices and customs call for in
                       regard to hiring family members before others. A and D are incorrect, since
                       they do not consider the qualifications of the project team leader and the
                       project team. In addition, they do not take into account local customs. B is
                       incorrect as well. Although it does ponder the qualifications of the project
                       team, it does not consider the local customs.

                              3. You are about to begin negotiations on a new project that is to take place
                                 in another country. Which of the following should be your guide on what
                                 business practices are allowed and discouraged?
                                  A. The project charter
                                  B. The project plan
                                  C. Company policies and procedures
                                  D. The Code of Ethics and Professional Conduct
                                 C. The company policies and procedures should guide the project manager
                                 and the decision he makes in the foreign country. A and B are incorrect
                                 because these documents are essential, but usually do not reference allowed
                                 business practices. D is incorrect because while the PMI Code of Ethics and
                                 Professional Conduct does possess crucial information, the company's
                                 policies and procedures are most specific to the project work and
                                 requirements.
                              4. One of your project team members reports that he sold pieces of equipment
                                 because he needed to pay for his daughter's school tuition. He says that he
                                 has paid back the money by working overtime without reporting the hours
                                 worked so that his theft remains private. What should you do?
                                  A. Fire the project team member.
                                  B. Report the team member to his manager.
                                  C. Suggest that the team member report his action to human resources.
                                  D. Tell the team member you're disappointed in what he did, and advise him
                                     not to do something like this again.
                                 B. This situation calls for the project team member to be reported to his
                                 manager for disciplinary action. A is inappropriate because the project manager
                                 may not have the authority to fire the project team member. C is inappropriate
                                 because the project manager must take action to bring the situation to
                                 management's attention. D is also inappropriate because no formal disciplinary
                                 actions are taken to address the problem.
                              5. You are the project manager of the SUN Project. Your organization is a
                                 functional environment, and you do not get along well with the functional
                                 manager leading the project. You disagree with the manager on how the
                                 project should proceed, the timings of the activities, the suggested schedule,
                                 and the expected quality of the work. The manager has requested that you get
                                 to work on several of the activities on the critical path even though you and
                                 she have not solved the issues concerning the project. What should you do?
                                  A. Go to senior management and voice your concerns.
                                  B. Complete the activities as requested.
                                  C. Ask to be taken off of the project.

                                                      Chapter 14: Understanding the Code of Ethics and Professional Conduct

                                                                                                                           543
                      D. Refuse to begin activities on the project until the issues are resolved.
                     B. The project manager must respect the delegation of the functional manager.
                     A, C, and D are all inappropriate actions because they do not complete the
                     assigned work the functional manager has delegated to the project manager.
                   6. The PMI has contacted you regarding an ethics violation of a PMP candidate.
                      The question is in regard to a friend who said he worked as a project manager




                                                                                                                                         PART II
                      under your guidance. You know this is not true, but to save a friendship, you
                      avoid talking with the PMI. This is a violation of what?
                      A. The Code of Ethics and Professional Conduct to cooperate on ethics
                         violations investigations
                      B. The Code of Ethics and Professional Conduct to report accurate
                         information
                      C. The Code of Ethics and Professional Conduct to report any PMP violations
                      D. The law concerning ethical practices
                     A. By avoiding the conversation with PMI in regard to your friend's ethics
                     violation, you are, yourself, violating the Code of Ethics and Professional
                     Conduct to cooperate with the PMI. B, C, and D are incorrect answers because
                     they do not fully answer the question.
                   7. You are the project manager for the Log Cabin Project. One of your vendors
                      is completing a large portion of the project. You have heard a rumor that
                      the vendor is losing many of its workers due to labor issues. In light of this
                      information, what should you do?
                      A. Stop work with the vendor until the labor issues are resolved.
                      B. Communicate with the vendor in regard to the rumor.
                      C. Look to secure another vendor to replace the current one.
                      D. Negotiate with the labor union to secure the workers on your project.
                     B. The project manager should confront the problem by talking with the
                     vendor about the rumor. A is incorrect and would delay the project and
                     possibly cause future problems. C is incorrect and may violate the contract
                     between the buyer and seller. D is also incorrect--the agreement is between
                     the performing organization and the vendor, not the labor union.
                   8. You are the project manager for the PMH Project. Three vendors have
                      submitted cost estimates for the project. One of the estimates is significantly
                      higher than similar project work in the past. In this scenario, you should do
                      what?
                      A. Ask the other vendors about the higher estimate from the third vendor.
                      B. Use the cost estimates from the historical information.

              544
                                  C. Take the high cost to the vendor to discuss the discrepancy before
                                     reviewing the issue with the other vendors.
                                  D. Ask the vendor that supplied the high estimate for information on how
                                     the estimate was prepared.
                                 D. Most likely, the vendor did not understand the project work to be
                                 procured, so the estimate is skewed. A clear statement of work is needed for
                                 the vendors to provide accurate estimates. A and C are inappropriate actions
                                 because they discuss another vendor's estimate with the competing vendors.
                                 Choice B, historical information, isn't a viable solution because costs may
                                 have changed since the historical information was created. In addition, there's
                                 no evidence in the question that historical information even exists. This
                                 information should be kept confidential between the buyer and seller. In
                                 some government projects, the winning bid may be required to be
                                 announced.
                              9. You are the project manager of the LKH Project. This project must be
                                 completed within six months. The project is two months into the schedule
                                 and is starting to slip. As of now, the project is one week behind schedule.
                                 Based on your findings, you believe that you can make some corrective
                                 actions and recover the lost time over the next month to get the project back
                                 on schedule. Management, however, requires weekly status reports on cost
                                 and schedule. What should you do?
                                  A. Report that the project is one week behind schedule, but will finish on
                                     schedule based on cited corrective actions.
                                  B. Report that the project is on schedule and will finish on schedule.
                                  C. Report that the project is off schedule by a few days, but will finish on
                                     schedule.
                                  D. Report that the project is running late.
                                 A. The project manager should report an honest assessment of the project,
                                 with actions on how he plans to correct the problem. B is incorrect because
                                 it does not provide an honest answer to management. C is also incorrect
                                 because it does not provide an honest answer to management. D is
                                 incorrect because it does not provide a solution to the problem.
                             10. As a contracted project manager, you have been assigned a project with a
                                 budget of $1.5 million. The project is scheduled to last seven months, but
                                 your most recent earned value management (EVM) report shows that the
                                 project will finish ahead of schedule by nearly six weeks. If this happens, you
                                 will lose $175,000 in billable time. What should you do?
                                  A. Bill for the entire $1.5 million, since this was the approved budget.
                                  B. Bill for the $1.5 million by adding additional work at the end of the
                                     project.

                                                                                                                            545
                       C. Report to the customer the project status and completion date.
                       D. Report to the customer the project status and completion date, and ask if
                          they'd like to add any additional features to account for the monies not
                          spent.
                      C. An honest and accurate assessment of the project work is always required.
                      A and B are incorrect because these actions do not reflect an honest
                      assessment of the work. D is incorrect because it offers gold plating and




                                                                                                                                          PART II
                      recommends additional changes that were not part of the original project
                      scope. In addition, because this is a contracted relationship, the additional
                      work may not be covered within the original project contract and may result
                      in legal issues.
                   11. You are the project manager of the PMH Project. You have been contracted
                       to design the placement of several pieces of manufacturing equipment. You
                       have completed the project scope and are ready to pass the work over to the
                       installer. The installer begins to schedule you to help with the installation of
                       the manufacturing equipment. You should do what?
                       A. Help the installer place the equipment according to the design documents.
                       B. Help the installer place the equipment as the customer sees fit.
                       C. Refuse to help the installer, since the project scope has been completed.
                       D. Help the installer place the equipment, but insist that the quality control
                          be governed by your design specifications.
                      C. When the project scope is completed, the contract is fulfilled and the
                      project is done. Any new work items should not be sent through. In this
                      instance, the contract change control system should be invoked, or a new
                      contract should be created. A, B, and D are incorrect because these choices are
                      outside of the scope and have not been covered in the contract.
                   12. You are the project manager of the 12BA Project. You have completed the
                       project according to the design documents and have met the project scope.
                       The customer agrees that the design document requirements have been met;
                       however, the customer is not pleased with the project deliverables and is
                       demanding additional adjustments be made to complete the project. What is
                       the best way to continue?
                       A. Complete the work as the customer has requested.
                       B. Complete the work at 1.5 times the billable rate.
                       C. Do nothing. The project scope is completed.
                       D. Do nothing. Management from the performing organization and the
                          customer's organization will need to determine why the project failed
                          before adding work.

                                 C. When the project scope has been completed, the project is completed. Any
                                 additional work, without a contract change or new contract, would be
                                 dishonest and would betray the customer or the project manager's company.
                                 This is a good example of a question where none of the choices are good, but
                                 you must choose the best answer available. Of course, in a real project, you'd
                                 have many other choices and options to achieve customer satisfaction. A and
                                 B are both incorrect because additional work is not covered in the current
                                 contract. D is incorrect because the project did not fail--the deliverables met
                                 the requirements of the project scope and the design document.
                             13. You are the project manager of the AAA Project. Due to the nature of the
                                 project, much of the work will require overtime between Christmas and New
                                 Year's Day. Many of the project team members, however, have requested
                                 vacation during that week. What is the best way to continue?
                                  A. Refuse all vacation requests and require all team members to work.
                                  B. Only allow vacation requests for those team members who are not needed
                                     during that week.
                                  C. Divide tasks equally among the team members so each works the same
                                     amount of time.
                                  D. Allow team members to volunteer for the overtime work.
                                 D. This is the best choice for this scenario, because it allows the project team
                                 to be self-led and is sensitive to the needs of the project team. A, B, and C are
                                 all autocratic responses to the problem, and while the results may seem fair, D
                                 is the best choice.
                             14. You are a project manager for your organization. Your project is to install
                                 several devices for one of your company's clients. The client has requested that
                                 you complete a few small tasks that are not in the project scope. To maintain
                                 the relationship with the client, you oblige her request and complete the work
                                 without informing your company. This is an example of what?
                                  A. Effective expert judgment
                                  B. Failure to satisfy the scope of professional services
                                  C. Contract change control
                                  D. Integrated change control
                                 B. When the project manager completes activities outside of the contract and
                                 does not inform the performing organization, it is essentially the same as
                                 stealing. The PMP must be held accountable for all the time invested in a
                                 project. A is incorrect because this is not expert judgment. C is incorrect
                                 because the contract has not been changed or attempted to be changed. D is
                                 also incorrect because the changes the project manager completed for the
                                 customer were not sent through any change control system. Instead, they were
                                 completed without documentation or reporting.

                   15. You are completing a project for a customer in another country. One of the
                       customs in this country is to honor the project manager of a successful project
                       with a gift. Your company, however, does not allow project managers to accept
                       gifts worth more than $50 from any entity. At the completion of the project,
                       the customer presents you with a new car in a public ceremony. What should
                       you do?
                       A. Accept the car, since it is a custom of the country. To refuse it would be an




                                                                                                                                         PART II
                          insult to your hosts.
                       B. Refuse to accept the car, since it would result in a conflict with your
                          organization's policy on gifts.
                       C. Accept the car and then return it, in private, to the customer.
                       D. Accept the car and then donate the car to a charity in the customer's name.
                       B. This is the best answer. Although this solution may seem extreme, to accept
                       the car in public would give the impression that the project manager has
                       defied company policy. In addition, accepting the car would appear to be a
                       conflict of interest for the project manager. A, C, and D are all incorrect.
                       Accepting the car, even with the intention of returning it or donating it to
                       charity, would conflict with the company's policies regarding the acceptance
                       of gifts.
                   16. You have a project team member who is sabotaging your project because he
                       does not agree with it. What should you do?
                       A. Fire the project team member.
                       B. Present the problem to management.
                       C. Present the problem to management with a solution to remove the team
                          member from the project.
                       D. Present the problem to management with a demand to fire the project
                          team member.
                       C. The problem should be presented to management, with a solution to
                       remove the project team member from the project. Remember, whenever the
                       project manager must present a problem to management, she should also
                       present a solution to the problem. A is incorrect because it likely is not the
                       project manager's role to fire the project team member. B is incorrect because
                       it does not address a solution for the problem. D is incorrect because the
                       project manager's focus should be on the success of the project. By
                       recommending that the project team member be removed from the project,
                       the problem is solved from the project manager's point of view. Management,
                       however, may come to the decision on their own accord to dismiss the
                       individual from the company altogether. In addition, a recommendation from
                       the project manager to fire someone may be outside the boundary of human
                       resources' procedure for employee termination.

                             17. You are the project manager of a project in Asia. You discover that the project
                                 leader has hired family members for several lucrative contracts on the project.
                                 What should you consider?
                                  A. Cultural issues
                                  B. Ethical issues
                                  C. Organizational issues
                                  D. Political issues
                                 A. The project manager should first determine what the country's customs and
                                 culture call for when hiring relatives. It may be a preferred practice in the
                                 country to work with qualified relatives first before hiring other individuals to
                                 complete the project work. B, C, and D are not the best choice in this
                                 scenario. They may be used to follow up after first examining the cultural
                                 issues within the country.
                             18. Of the following, which one achieves customer satisfaction?
                                  A. Completing the project requirements
                                  B. Maintaining the project cost
                                  C. Maintaining the project schedule
                                  D. Completing the project with the defined quality metrics
                                 A. The largest factor when it comes to customer satisfaction is the ability to
                                 complete the project requirements. B, C, and D are incorrect because
                                 achieving these factors, while good, is not as complete as achieving the project
                                 requirements, which may include the cost, schedule, and quality expectations.
                             19. A PMP has been assigned to manage a project in a foreign country. The
                                 disorientation the PMP will likely experience as he gets acclimated to the
                                 country is known as what?
                                  A. Sapir-Whorf hypothesis
                                  B. Time dimension
                                  C. Ethnocentrism
                                  D. Culture shock
                                 D. Culture shock is the typical disorientation a person feels when visiting a
                                 foreign country. A is incorrect. The Sapir-Whorf hypothesis is a theory that
                                 believes an individual can understand a culture by understanding its language.
                                 B is incorrect because time dimension is the local culture's general practice for
                                 respecting time and punctuality. C is incorrect because ethnocentrism is a
                                 person's belief that his or her own culture is the best and that all other
                                 cultures should be measured against it.

                   20. You are the project manager for an information technology project. It has
                       come to your attention that a technical problem has stopped the project work.
                       How should you proceed?
                       A. Measure the project performance to date, and account for the cost of the
                          technical problem.
                       B. Rebaseline the project performance to account for the technical problem.




                                                                                                                                         PART II
                       C. Work with the project team to develop alternative solutions to the
                          technical problem.
                       D. Outsource the technical problem to a vendor.
                       C. When problems arise that stop project tasks, the project manager should
                       work with the team to uncover viable alternative solutions. A and B do
                       nothing to find a solution to the problem, so they are incorrect. D is incorrect
                       because the solution for the problem has not necessarily been addressed. The
                       end result of C, to find an alternative solution, may be D, but outsourcing the
                       problem to a vendor should not be the first choice in this scenario.

                                                                                                                                   A
                   Projects are full of plans, reports, and other documents. Having a clear understanding
                   of each of the document types and why they may or may not be needed in a project can
                   help you, the Project Management Professional (PMP) or Certified Associate in Project
                   Management (CAPM) candidate, to answer exam questions correctly. The following is
                   a list of project management elements:

                   Activity attributes The activity characteristics such as the activity codes, predecessor
                   and successor activities, leads and lags, resource requirements, dates, constraints, and
                   assumptions.
                   Activity cost estimate supporting detail This is the collection of documents that de-
                   tail how the project's cost estimate was created.

                        * The scope of the work that the estimate is based on
                        * The basis for the estimate
                        * Documentation of the assumptions used in the estimate creation
                        * Documentation of the constraints used in the estimate creation
                        * The range of possible estimates, such as the +/- percentage or dollar amount

                   Activity duration estimate An estimate of the likely time it will take to complete the
                   project, a phase, or individual activities within the project.
                   Activity list   The collection of schedule activities.
                   Affinity diagram A tool that helps the project team sort ideas and data. This simple
                   tool clusters similar ideas; useful to use after a brainstorming session.
                   Analogous estimate An estimate based on a previous similar project to predict the
                   current project's time or cost expectations.
                   Assumption log All assumptions identified in the project are documented, and the
                   status of each as an assumption is monitored. Assumptions need to be tested to deter-
                   mine risk likelihood.

                        Backlog Narratives about the product requirements that need to be completed. These
                        are often prioritized, numbered, and scheduled for creation based on time, budget, and
                        stakeholder demand.
                        Bar charts A histogram that typically depicts the project activities and their associated
                        start and end dates. This is also known as a Gantt chart.
                        Bill of materials (BOM) Defines the materials and products needed to create the
                        items defined in the corresponding work breakdown structure (WBS). The BOM is ar-
                        ranged in sync with the hierarchy of the deliverables in the WBS.
                        Business case A business case is often needed for the project charter to justify the
                        project's existence. Business cases document the financial reasoning for the project and
                        the end result of a feasibility study.
                        Cause-and-effect diagrams Also known as Ishikawa diagrams and fishbone diagrams.
                        These illustrate how potential problems within a project may contribute to failure or
                        errors within the project.
                        Change log This document records all changes that happen during the project. It's
                        useful for scope verification, quality control, and tracking changes.
                        Change management plan A project management plan that defines how the project
                        will manage changes.
                        Change requests A documented request to change the project's scope is managed
                        through the project's integrated change control process.
                        Checksheets Checklists that are used as part of requirements gathering, task execu-
                        tion, quality control, and other aspects of the project to ensure that a task or process is
                        completed accurately.
                        Claim A documented disagreement between the buyer and the seller. Claims are of-
                        ten settled through negotiations, mediation, or in the courts, depending on the terms
                        of the contract.
                        Communications management plan This subsidiary plan defines who needs what
                        information, when the information is needed, the frequency of the communication,
                        and the accepted modalities for the communication needs.
                        Configuration management plan A project management plan that defines the con-
                        figurable items and the formal process for how these items are allowed to be changed.
                        Contingency plan Part of the monitor and control risk process includes the option of
                        executing a contingency plan to respond to worst-case scenarios with risk impact.
                        Contract A legal relationship between the buyer and the seller that describes the work
                        to be completed, the fee for performing the work, a schedule for completing the work,
                        and acceptance criteria to deem the contract complete. If a project is being completed by
                        one organization for another organization, there is typically a contractual relationship
                        between the seller and the customer. Contracts may be inputs for the project charter.

                   Contract management plan A plan that is used for significant purchases. This plan
                   directs the acquisition and adherence of both the buyer and the seller to the terms of
                   the contract.
                   Contract statement of work This document defines the products and services that are
                   being procured to satisfy portions of the project scope statement.
                   Control charts This quality control tool illustrates the stability of a process and al-
                   lows the project management team to determine if the process may have trends and
                   predictability.
                   Cost baseline A time-phased budget that tracks the planned project expenses against
                   the actual project expenses. This document is used to measure, monitor, and control
                   project costs in conjunction with the cost management plan.

                   Cost management plan A project management subsidiary plan that defines the struc-
                   ture for estimating, budgeting, and controlling project costs.
                   Cost plus fee or cost plus percentage of costs A contract in which the buyer pays the
                   seller a fee for the contract work or deliverable plus an additional fee based on the per-
                   centage of the total costs for the goods or services provided.
                   Cost plus fixed fee A contract in which the buyer pays the seller the costs of the materials
                   and/or labor to complete the contract work or deliverable, plus a predetermined fee.
                   Cost plus incentive fee A contract in which the buyer pays the seller the costs of the
                   materials and labor plus an incentive bonus for reaching objectives set by the buyer.
                   Incentives are typically based on reaching schedule objectives.
                   Decision tree A diagram that identifies and evaluates each available outcome of a
                   decision and the decision's implication, consideration of each choice, and the value of
                   each decision.
                   Defect repair requests Requests to repair defects within the project deliverables.
                   Fishbone diagrams Also known as cause-and-effect diagrams and Ishikawa diagrams.
                   These illustrate how potential problems within a project may contribute to failure or
                   errors within the project.
                   Fixed-price or lump-sum contract A contract that defines the total price for the work

                   (stakeholders) that have influence over project decisions.
                   Formal acceptance documentation A document that formally records that the proj-
                   ect customer and/or sponsor has accepted the project deliverables.
                   Gantt chart A bar chart that shows scheduling information and relationships among
                   tasks. Tasks are represented by nodes. The length of the node combined with the calen-
                   dar shows the duration of the activity.

                        are often used as inputs and references for current projects. Current project documenta-
                        tion and lessons learned documentation become historical information for future proj-
                        ects within an organization.
                        Human resource plan This project management plan defines how the project is
                        staffed and how the project team will be defined, managed, and controlled. This plan
                        also includes the staffing management plan.
                        Independent estimate Also known as a third-party estimate and a should-cost esti-
                        mate, this document serves as a means for evaluating estimates provided by potential
                        vendors to complete the work the contract calls for. An independent estimate is often
                        created by a third party for the performing organization for a fee.
                        Influence diagram A chart that shows the relationships between and among causal
                        factors, events, situations, and other project conditions.
                        Invitation for bid A document inviting a prospective vendor to bid on the contents
                        of the contract statement of work. This is a price-based decision model.
                        Ishikawa diagrams Also known as cause-and-effect diagrams and fishbone diagrams.
                        These illustrate how potential problems within a project may contribute to failure or
                        errors within the project.
                        Lessons learned documentation The results of quality control and other types of
                        lessons learned are documented and become part of organizational process assets. Les-
                        sons learned documentation is created throughout the project's life cycle.
                        Milestone chart A chart that depicts the promised milestone completion and the ac-
                        tual milestone completion dates.
                        Milestone list The documented collection of the project milestones and their attri-
                        butes, deadlines, and requirements. The milestone list is part of the overall project
                        management plan.
                        Nondisclosure agreement (NDA) A procurement document that requires the vendor
                        to not disclose information about the contract to anyone within or outside of the per-
                        forming organization.
                        Organizational breakdown structure There can be two versions of this document.
                        First, there's the decomposition of the project's hierarchy of organizations, depart-
                        ments, and disciplines related to the work packages in the WBS. This document helps
                        the project management team determine which disciplines or departments are respon-
                        sible for which work packages as identified in the WBS. Second, this could depict the
                        organization's departments, teams, functional departments, and business units.
                        Organizational charts A visual representation of the hierarchy of an organization
                        depicting all of the positions and reporting structures of the organization's members.

                   Parametric estimate An estimate based on a parameter, such as a cost per metric ton
                   or number of hours to complete a repetitive activity.
                   Pareto chart A histogram that shows the categories of failure within a project. A Pa-
                   reto chart ranks the failures from largest to smallest, which then allows the project
                   management team to attack the largest problems within the project. Pareto charts are
                   based on Pareto's Law, which states that 80 percent of the problems are related to 20
                   percent of the causes.
                   Performance reports The project's communications management plan defines the
                   expectations and frequency of the project performance reports. Performance reports
                   update the necessary stakeholders on the status and progress information, and may
                   include bar charts, S-curves, histograms, and tables. These reports provide documenta-
                   tion about the project and project team's overall performance during the project execu-




                                                                                                                                              PART III
                   tion. Performance can measure work results, time, cost, scope, quality, and other specif-
                   ics within the project.
                   PMBOK Guide A book published by the Project Management Institute (PMI) that
                   serves as a guide to the project management body of knowledge. It is generally accepted
                   in the project management discipline as providing good practices for most projects,
                   most of the time.
                   Probability and impact matrix Demonstrates through either a cardinal or an ordinal
                   scale the probability, impact, and risk score of each identified risk event. The process is
                   a result of risk analysis.
                   Process improvement plan This project management subsidiary plan instructs the
                   project management team on how to identify and react to any non-value-added activi-
                   ties and waste that may exist or creep into the project.
                   Procurement management plan This subsidiary plan of the overall project manage-
                   ment plan defines the processes and policies for choosing, selecting, and working with
                   a vendor on the project. The plan defines the contracts that should be used, the stan-
                   dard procurement documents, and the conditions to work with (and sometimes man-
                   age) the client-vendor relationship.
                   Product scope The features and functions of the product, service, or result that a proj-
                   ect may bring about.
                   Product scope description This document defines the product, service, or condition
                   that the project promises to create. As the project moves through planning, the product
                   scope description becomes more detailed.
                   Project calendar The time when project work is allowed to happen within the project.
                   Project charter The document that authorizes the project or project phase. It identi-
                   fies the business needs and the new product, service, or result the project will bring
                   about in the organization.
                   Project closure documents The documentation of the project's completion, closure,
                   and transfer of the project deliverables to other parties within the organization or to the

                        Project management plan This document defines all of the accepted project manage-
                        ment processes for the current project, including how the project will be initiated,
                        planned, executed, monitored, controlled, and closed. The project management plan is
                        comprised of the following subsidiary plans:

                             * Scope baseline

                        Project notebook The project team may elect to keep their individual project records
                        in a project notebook. The project notebooks then become part of the organizational
                        process assets.
                        Project organization chart A chart that shows the interrelationship of the project
                        manager, the project sponsor, the project team, and possibly stakeholders.
                        Project presentations Formal communication often happens in the form of project pre-
                        sentations. These presentations then become part of the organizational process assets.
                        Project records All of the project documentation and communication should be kept
                        and managed by the project management team. These project records become part of
                        the organizational process assets.
                        Project reports Project reports vary by organization, but generally include informa-
                        tion on the project's status, lessons learned, issue logs, and project closure. Project re-
                        ports become part of the organizational process assets.

                   project work.
                   Project scope management plan This is a subsidiary plan of the overall project plan.
                   It defines how the project scope will be defined, documented, verified, managed, and
                   controlled. This plan also defines how the project's WBS will be defined, maintained,
                   and approved. The scope validation process is also documented within the project
                   scope management plan. Finally, this plan defines the scope change control process the
                   project will adhere to.
                   Project scope statement This document defines the scope of the project and the work
                   required to deliver the project scope. The project scope statement provides several piec-

                        * Approval requirements

                   Project statement of work The project statement of work, often just called a SOW,
                   defines the products or processes that the project will provide. This document is an
                   input to the project charter.
                   Proposal A response to a Request for Proposal (RFP), which often includes project ap-
                   proaches, ideas, and suggestions to complete the procured work, in addition to a price.

                        the responsibilities for each within the project. In a RACI chart, the activities of respon-
                        sible, accountable, consult, and inform are used (hence, the acronym RACI).
                        Requirements management plan This project management plan defines how re-
                        quirements will be identified, documented, and managed during the project.
                        Requirements traceability matrix A table that identifies each requirement at its ori-
                        gin and traces the requirement throughout the project.
                        Request for Proposal (RFP) A request from the buyer to potential vendors to provide
                        a price, approaches, and ideas on how to complete the proposed work to be procured.
                        Request for Quote (RFQ) A document inviting a prospective vendor to bid on the

                        able for the project's use. The resource calendar identifies if a resource is idle, on vaca-
                        tion, or being utilized on the current project or another one within the organization.
                        Responsibility assignment matrix (RAM) Illustrates the connection between the
                        project work and the project team members who will complete the project work.
                        Risk breakdown structure (RBS) The project risks are depicted in a hierarchy of risk

                        Risk management plan This defines how the risk management activities within the
                        project will occur. A risk management plan is a subsidiary plan of the overall project
                        management plan. The risk management plan includes:

                             * Methodology
                             * Roles and responsibilities
                             * Budgeting

                        * Risk categories
                        * Definitions of risk probability and impact
                        * Updated risk categories

                   Risk register A component of project management planning that documents the out-
                   come of all risk management activities. The risk register includes:

                        * List of identified risks
                        * List of potential responses
                        * Root causes of risk
                        * Risk prioritization




                                                                                                                                               PART III
                        * Probabilistic analysis
                        * Risk trends

                   Risk-related contractual agreements Should the planned response to a risk event use
                   transference, a contractual agreement is often demanded.
                   Run charts    Similar to a control chart, these charts show measured trends over time.
                   Scatter diagram A quality control diagram that shows the relationship between two
                   variables within a project.
                   Schedule activities The work package is decomposed into the tasks needed to cre-
                   ate the work package deliverable. The collection of schedule activities may also be
                   called the activity list.
                   Schedule baseline A baseline depicting the expected start and completion dates of
                   project activities, dates for the milestones, and finish dates for the entire project or proj-
                   ect phase.
                   Schedule comparison bar charts A bar chart that depicts the discrepancies between
                   the current activity status and the estimated activity status. This is often referred to as a
                   tracking Gantt chart.
                   Schedule network templates An organization that repeats the same type of projects
                   may elect to use a schedule network template. These templates are prepopulated with
                   activities and their preferred sequence. Often, schedule network templates are based on
                   previous similar projects and are adapted for the current project.
                   Scope baseline The project's scope baseline comprises the project's scope statement,
                   the WBS, and the WBS dictionary.
                   Staffing management plan The project management subsidiary plan that defines
                   when and how staffing needs will be fulfilled in the project's life cycle. The plan defines,
                   at a minimum, the process of staff acquisition, the timetable for resource utilization,

                        source compliance, and safety issues for the project team members.
                        Stakeholder register      A directory of the project stakeholders and their characteristics.
                        Strategic plan An organization's strategic plan is considered when a project is being
                        chartered. All projects within an organization should support the organization's strate-
                        gic plan.
                        Subnetwork template When a project includes repetitive work, such as the creation
                        of identical floors within a skyscraper, the network diagram may use a subnetwork tem-
                        plate to illustrate the repetition in the project.
                        Summary budget Project charters often refer to a summary budget, which may ad-
                        dress the predetermined budget allotted for a project or a rough order of magnitude
                        estimate based on the preliminary project scope statement.
                        Summary milestone schedule A schedule of when the project management team can
                        expect the milestones within the project to be reached. This schedule is part of the proj-
                        ect charter.
                        Teaming agreement A contract that defines the limited relationship between two or
                        more organizations in their attempt to seize an opportunity. When the opportunity is
                        done, the contractual relationship defines how the teaming agreement may end.
                        Text-oriented responsibility formats When roles and responsibilities need more
                        documentation than a RACI or RAM chart can provide, a text-oriented version is used.
                        These may also be known as position descriptions or role-responsibility-authority
                        forms.
                        Three-point estimate An estimate based on the average of the optimistic, most likely,
                        and pessimistic time estimates.
                        Time and materials contract A simple contract type in which the buyer pays the
                        seller for the time and materials to deliver the product or service the contract calls for.
                        This contract type should have a not-to-exceed clause to cap the contract's total costs.
                        Tree diagram A hierarchical chart that shows the relationship of parent-child objects.
                        Technically, the WBS can be a tree diagram.
                        WBS dictionary This is a companion document to the WBS and details each item in
                        it. Every entry in the WBS dictionary includes its related code of account identifier, re-
                        sponsible organization, schedule, quality requirements, and technical references, and
                        may include charge numbers, related activities, and a cost estimate.
                        WBS template A WBS from a previous similar project or the organization's method-
                        ology that has been adapted and modified to map to the current project's deliverables.
                        Work breakdown structure (WBS) A document that visualizes the deliverables that
                        comprise the project scope. The WBS uses a code of accounts to number and identify
                        the elements within the decomposition. The smallest item within the WBS is called the
                        work package.

                     Passing the CAPM and the
                     PMP Exam                                                                                                    B
                   Obviously, you want to pass your Project Management Professional (PMP) or Certified
                   Associate in Project Management (CAPM) exam on the first attempt. Why bother sit-
                   ting for an exam if you know you're not prepared? In this appendix, you'll find the de-
                   tails you must know to pass the exam. These facts won't be everything you need to
                   know to pass the PMP or CAPM exam, but you can bet you won't pass the exam if you
                   don't know the critical information contained in this appendix.



                   Tips to Pass the Exam
                   For starters, don't think of this process as preparing to take an exam--think of it as
                   "preparing to pass an exam." Anyone can prepare to take an exam: just show up. Pre-
                   paring to pass the PMP and the CAPM exam requires project management experience,
                   diligence, and a commitment to study.

                   Days Before the Exam
                   In the days leading up to your scheduled exam, here are some basics you should do to
                   prepare yourself for success:

                       * Get some moderate exercise. Find time to go for a jog, lift weights, take a swim,
                         or do whatever workout routine works best for you.
                        * Eat smart and healthy. If you eat healthy food, you'll feel good and feel better
                          about yourself. Be certain to drink plenty of water, and don't overdo the
                          caffeine.
                        * Get your sleep. A well-rested brain is a sharp brain. You don't want to sit for
                          your exam feeling tired, sluggish, and worn out.
                        * Time your study sessions. Don't overdo your study sessions--long, crash-study
                          sessions aren't that profitable. In addition, try to study at the same time every
                          day, at the time your exam is scheduled.

                        Create Your Own Answer Key
                        If you could take one page of notes into the exam, what information would you like on
                        this one-page document? Of course, you absolutely cannot take any notes or reference
                        materials into the exam area. However, if you can create and memorize one sheet of
                        notes, you absolutely may re-create this once you're seated in the exam area.
                            Practice creating a reference sheet so you can immediately, and legally, re-create this
                        document once your exam has begun. You'll be supplied with several sheets of blank
                        paper and a couple of pencils. Once your exam process begins, re-create your reference
                        sheet. The following are key pieces of information you'd be wise to include on your
                        reference sheet (you'll find all of this key information in this appendix):

                             * Activities within each process group
                             * Estimating formulas
                             * Communication formula
                             * Normal distribution values
                             * Earned value management formulas
                             * Project management theories

                        Testing Tips
                        The questions on the PMP and CAPM exams aren't always direct and easy; they may
                        offer a few red herrings, and some people have reported that they found taking the
                        exam like reading War and Peace. But there are some practical, exam-passing tips. For
                        starters, you may face questions that state, "All of the following are correct options,
                        except for which one?" The question wants you to find the incorrect option or the op-
                        tion that would not be appropriate for the scenario described. You're looking for the
                        answer that doesn't fit with the others listed. Be sure to understand what the question
                        is asking for. It's easy to focus on the scenario presented in a question and then see a
                        suitable option for that scenario in the answer. However, if the question is asking you
                        to identify an option that is not suitable, then you just missed the question. Carefully
                        read the question to understand what is expected for an answer.
                            Here's a tip that can work with many of the questions: Identify what the question
                        wants for an answer, and then look for an option that doesn't belong with the other
                        possible answers. In other words, find the answer that doesn't fit with the other three
                        options. Find the "odd man out." Here's an example:

                                 EVM is used during the ____________________.

                                 C. Closing activities of the project
                                 D. Entire project

                                                                                 Appendix B: Passing the CAPM and the PMP Exam

                                                                                                                                567
                       Notice how options A, B, and C are exclusive? If you choose A, the controlling
                   phase, it implies that earned value management (EVM) is not used anywhere else in the
                   project. The odd man out here is D, the entire project; it's considered the "odd" choice
                   because, by itself, it is not an actual process group. Of course, this tip won't work with
                   every question--but it's handy to keep in mind.
                       For some answer choices, it may seem like two of the four options are both possible
                   correct answers. However, because you may choose only one answer, you must discern
                   which one is the best choice. Within the question, there will usually be some hint de-
                   scribing the progress of the project, the requirements of the stakeholders, or some oth-
                   er clue that can help you determine which answer is the best one for the question.

                   Answer Every Question--Once




                                                                                                                                              PART III
                   The PMP exam has 200 questions, while the CAPM exam has 150 questions. You need
                   to answer every question. Do not leave any question blank, even if you don't know the
                   answer to the question. A blank answer is a wrong answer. As you move through the
                   exam and you find questions that stump you, use the "mark question" option in
                   the exam software, choose an answer you suspect may be correct, and then move on.
                   When you have answered all of the questions, you are given the option to review your
                   marked answers.
                        Some questions in the exam may prompt your memory to come up with answers
                   to questions you have marked for review. However, resist the temptation to review
                   those questions you've already answered with confidence and haven't marked. More
                   often than not, your first instinct is the correct choice. When you completed the exams
                   at the end of each chapter, did you change correct answers to wrong answers? If you did
                   it in practice, you'll likely do it on the actual exam.

                   Use the Process of Elimination
                   When you're stumped on a question, use the process of elimination. For each question,
                   there'll be four choices. On your scratch paper, write down "ABCD." If you can safely
                   rule out "A," cross it out of the ABCD you've written on your paper. Now focus on
                   which of the other answers won't work. If you determine that "C" won't work, cross it
                   off your list. Now you've got a 50-50 chance of finding the correct choice.
                       If you cannot determine which answer is best, "B" or "D" in this instance, here's the
                   best approach:

                        1. Choose an answer in the exam (no blank answers, remember).
                        2. Mark the question in the exam software for later review.
                        3. Circle the "ABCD" on your scratch paper, jot any relevant notes, and then
                           write the question number next to the notes.
                        4. During the review, or from a later question, you may realize which choice is
                           the better of the two answers. Return to the question and confirm that the best
                           answer is selected.

                        Everything You Must Know
                        As promised, this section covers all of the information you must know going into the
                        exam. It's highly recommended that you create a method to recall this information.
                        Here goes.

                        The 47 Project Management Processes
                        You'll need to know the 47 project management processes and what each process accom-
                        plishes in the project. Here's a quick rundown of each process group and their processes:

                        * Direct and manage project work
                        * Perform quality assurance




                                                                                                                                             PART III

                        Earned Value Management Formulas
                        For EVM formulas, the following five rules should be remembered:

                             1. Always start with EV.
                             2. Variance means subtraction.
                             3. Index means division.
                             4. Less than 1 is bad in an index, greater than 1 is good (with the exception
                                of TCPI).
                             5. Negative is bad in a variance; positive is good.

                            The formulas for earned value analysis can be calculated manually or through proj-
                        ect management software during your projects. For the exam, you'll want to memorize
                        these formulas. Table A-1 shows a summary of all the formulas, as well as a sample,

                   Organizational Structures
                   Organizational structures are relevant to the project manager's authority. A project
                   manager has authority from weakest to highest in the following order:

                        * Functional
                        * Weak matrix
                        * Balanced matrix
                        * Strong matrix
                        * Projectized

                   Work Breakdown Structure (WBS) Facts
                   The WBS is the big picture of the project deliverables. It is not the activities that will




                                                                                                                                               PART III
                   create the project, but the components that the project will create. The WBS helps the
                   project team and the project manager create accurate cost and time estimates. It also
                   helps the project team and the project manager create an accurate activity list. The WBS
                   is an input to five project management activities:

                        * Define activities
                        * Estimate costs
                        * Determine budget
                        * Identify risks
                        * Perform qualitative risk analysis

                   Project Scope Facts
                   Projects are temporary endeavors to create a unique product or service. They are se-
                   lected by one of two methods:

                        * Benefit measurement methods            These include scoring models, benefit/cost
                          ratios, and economic models.
                        * Constrained optimization models These include mathematical models
                          based on linear, integer, and dynamic programming. (You probably won't see
                          constrained optimization on the CAPM exam.)

                       The project scope defines all of the required work, and only the required work, to
                   complete the project. Scope management is the process of ensuring that the project work
                   is within scope and protecting the project from scope creep. The scope baseline, which
                   includes the WBS and the WBS dictionary, is the baseline for all future project decisions
                   because it justifies the business need of the project. There are two types of scope:

                        * Product scope       Defines the attributes of the product or service the project is
                          creating
                        * Project scope       Defines the required work of the project to create the product

                           Scope validation is the process completed at the end of each phase and of each
                        project to confirm that the project has met the requirements. It leads to formal accep-
                        tance of the project deliverable.

                        Project Time Facts
                        Time can be a project constraint. Effective time management is the scheduling and sequenc-
                        ing of activities in the best order to ensure that the project completes successfully and in a
                        reasonable amount of time. These are some key terms related to time management:

                             * Lag     Waiting between activities.
                             * Lead      Activities come closer together and even overlap.
                             * Free float The amount of time an activity can be delayed without delaying
                               the next scheduled activity's early start date.
                             * Total float The amount of time an activity can be delayed without delaying
                               the project's finish date.
                             * Float     Sometimes called slack--a perfectly acceptable synonym.
                             * Duration May be abbreviated as "du." For example, du=8d means the
                               duration is eight days. Duration is the amount of work periods required to
                               complete an estimated activity.

                            There are three types of dependencies between activities:

                             * Mandatory        This hard logic requires a specific sequence between activities.
                             * Discretionary       This soft logic prefers a sequence between activities.
                             * External Due to conditions outside of the project, such as those created by
                               vendors, the sequence must happen in a given order.

                           There are three types of precedence between activities that you should know for the
                        exam:

                             * Finish to start (FS)      The predecessor activity must finish before the successor
                               activity can start.
                             * Finish to finish (FF) The predecessor activity must finish before the
                               successor activity can finish.
                             * Start to start (SS)      The predecessor activity must start before the successor
                               activity can start.

                        Project Cost Facts
                        There are several methods of providing project estimates:

                             * Bottom-up Project costs start at zero, each component in the WBS is
                               estimated for costs, and then the "grand total" is calculated. This method takes
                               the longest to complete, but provides the most accurate estimate.

                                                                                Appendix B: Passing the CAPM and the PMP Exam

                                                                                                                               573
                        * Analogous Project costs are based on a similar project. This is a form of
                          expert judgment, but it is also a top-down estimating approach, so it is less
                          accurate than a bottom-up estimate.
                        * Parametric modeling Price is based on cost per unit. Examples include cost
                          per metric ton, cost per yard, and cost per hour.

                      There are four types of costs attributed to a project:

                       * Variable costs The costs are dependent on other variables. For example, the
                         cost of a food-catered event depends on how many people register to attend
                         the event.
                        * Fixed costs The cost remains constant throughout the project. For example,
                          a rented piece of equipment has the same fee each month even if it is used




                                                                                                                                             PART III
                          more in some months than in others.
                        * Direct costs The cost is directly attributed to an individual project and
                          cannot be shared with other projects (for example, airfare to attend project
                          meetings, hotel expenses, and leased equipment that is used only on the
                          current project).
                        * Indirect costs These are the costs of doing business. Examples include rent,
                          phone, and utilities.

                   Quality Management Facts
                   The cost of quality is the money spent investing in training, in meeting requirements
                   for safety and other laws and regulations, and in taking steps to ensure quality accep-
                   tance. You might see the cost of quality as the cost of conformance. The cost of noncon-
                   formance, sometimes called the cost of poor quality, is the cost associated with rework,
                   downtime, lost sales, and waste of materials.
                       Some common quality management charts and methods include the following:

                       * Ishikawa diagrams (also called fishbone or cause-and-effect diagrams) are
                         used to find causes and effects that contribute to a problem.
                        * Flowcharts show the relationship between components and the flow of a
                          process through a system.
                        * Pareto diagrams identify project problems and their frequencies. These are
                          based on the 80/20 rule: 80 percent of project problems stem from 20 percent
                          of the work.
                        * Control charts plot out the result of samplings to determine if projects are "in
                          control" or "out of control."
                        * Just-in-time ordering reduces the cost of inventory, but requires additional
                          quality because materials would not be readily available if mistakes occurred.

                        Human Resource Facts
                        There are several human resource theories that the CAPM and PMP candidate should
                        be familiar with on the exams. They include the following:

                             * Maslow's Hierarchy of Needs There are five layers of needs for all humans:
                               physiological, safety, social needs (such as love and friendship), esteem, and
                               the crowning jewel, self-actualization.
                             * Herzberg's Theory of Motivation There are two catalysts for workers:
                               hygiene agents and motivating agents.
                                * Hygiene agents These do nothing to motivate, but their absence
                                  demotivates workers. Hygiene agents are the expectations all workers have:
                                  job security, a paycheck, clean and safe working conditions, a sense of
                                  belonging, civil working relationships, and other basic attributes associated
                                  with employment.
                                * Motivating agents These are the elements that motivate people to excel.
                                  They include responsibility, appreciation of work, recognition, opportunity
                                  to excel, education, and other opportunities associated with work besides
                                  financial rewards.
                             * McGregor's Theory of X and Y This theory states that "X" people are lazy,
                               don't want to work, and need to be micromanaged. "Y" people are self-led,
                               motivated, and can accomplish things on their own.
                             * Ouchi's Theory Z This theory holds that workers are motivated by a sense of
                               commitment, opportunity, and advancement. People will work if they are
                               challenged and motivated. Think participative management.
                             * McClelland's Theory of Needs Also known as the Three Needs Theory,
                               because there are just three needs for each individual: need for achievement,
                               need for affiliation, or the need for power.
                             * Vroom's Expectancy Theory People will behave based on what they expect
                               as a result of their behavior. In other words, people will work in relation to
                               the expected reward.

                        Communication Facts
                        Communicating is the most important skill for the project manager. With that in mind,
                        here are some key facts on communications:

                             * Communication channels formula: N(N - 1)/2. N represents the number of
                               stakeholders. For example, if you have ten stakeholders, the formula would
                               read 10(10 - 1)/2, or 45 communication channels. Pay special attention
                               to questions wanting to know how many additional communication
                               channels you have based on added stakeholders. For example, if you have 25
                               stakeholders on your project and have recently added five team members, how
                               many additional communication channels do you now have? You'll have to




16-appB.indd 574                                                                                                                7/10/2013 2:03:33 AM

                                                                                   Appendix B: Passing the CAPM and the PMP Exam

                                                                                                                                  575
                           calculate the original number of communication channels: 25(25 - 1)/2 =
                           300 and then calculate the new number with the added team members: 30(30
                           - 1)/2 = 435 and, finally, subtract the difference between the two: 435 - 300 =
                           135, which is the number of additional communication channels.
                        * Fifty-five percent of communication is nonverbal; an additional 30 percent is
                          paralingual.
                        * Effective listening is the ability to watch the speaker's body language, interpret
                          paralingual clues, and decipher facial expressions. Following the message,
                          effective listening has the listener asking questions to achieve clarity and
                          offering feedback.
                        * Active listening requires receivers of the message to offer cues, such as
                          nodding the head to indicate that they are listening. It also requires receivers




                                                                                                                                                PART III
                          to repeat the message, ask questions, and continue the discussion if
                          clarification is needed.
                        * Communication can be hindered by trendy phrases, jargon, and extremely
                          pessimistic comments. In addition, other communication barriers include
                          noise, hostility, cultural differences, and technical interruptions. Noise is
                          defined as anything that interferes with the transmission and/or the receipt of
                          a communication.

                   Risk Management Facts
                   Risks are unplanned events that can have positive or negative effects on the projects.
                   Most risks are seen as threats to the project's success--but not all risks are bad. For ex-
                   ample, let's say there is a 20 percent probability that a project will realize a discount in
                   shipping, which will save the project $15,000. If this risk happens, the project will save
                   money; if the risk doesn't happen, the project will have to spend the $15,000. Risks
                   should be identified as early as possible in the planning process. A person's willingness
                   to accept risk is the utility function (also called the utility theory or risk tolerance level).
                   The Delphi Technique can be used to build consensus on project risks.
                       The only output of the risk planning process is the risk management plan. There are
                   two broad types of risks:

                        * Business risk The loss of time and finances (where a downside and upside
                          exist). Business risk is often referred to as speculative risk.
                        * Pure risk The loss of life, injury, and theft (where only a downside exists).
                          Pure risk is often referred to as insurable risk.

                       Negative risks can be responded to using one of four methods:

                        * Avoidance Avoid the risk by planning a different technique to remove the
                          risk from the project.
                        * Mitigation      Reduce the probability or impact of the risk.

                             * Transference The risk is not eliminated, but the responsibility and
                               ownership of the risk is transferred to another party (for example, through
                               insurance).
                             * Acceptance The risk's probability or impact may be small enough that the
                               risk can be accepted, or the project team is not capable of mitigating the
                               probability of a risk, such as a hurricane.

                            Positive risks can also be responded to using one of four methods:

                             * Exploiting The organization can take advantage of the benefits a positive
                               risk will create.
                             * Sharing A project or organization can partner with another entity through
                               joint ventures or teaming agreements to share a positive risk event.
                             * Enhancing The project manager tries to make the positive risk event happen
                               in the project by enhancing the conditions for the positive risk event to come
                               true and increasing the positive impact should the risk event come true.
                             * Acceptance       The project manager can also accept positive risks.

                            Risks are ranked and scored to assess their probability and impact on the project:

                             * Qualitative analysis       This approach qualifies the risks for further analysis.
                             * Quantitative analysis This method assigns numeric values to probability
                               and impact. This approach calculates a risk factor (or exposure) in dollars or
                               time.
                             * Cardinal scale       A numeric ranking.
                             * Ordinal scale       A word ranking (high, medium, low).

                        Procurement Facts
                        A statement of work (SOW) is provided to the potential sellers so they can create ac-
                        curate bids, quotes, and proposals for the buyer. A bidder conference may be held so
                        sellers can query the buyer on the product or service to be procured.
                            A contract is a formal agreement, preferably written, between a buyer and seller. To
                        be valid, a contract must have:

                             * An offer
                             * Acceptance
                             * Consideration
                             * A legal purpose
                             * Capacity to enter into a contract

                            On the CAPM exam, procurement questions are usually from the buyer's point of
                        view. All requirements the seller is to complete should be clearly written in the contract.

                                                                                 Appendix B: Passing the CAPM and the PMP Exam

                                                                                                                                577
                   Requirements of both parties must be met, or legal proceedings may follow. Contract
                   types include the following:

                        * Cost-reimbursable contracts require the buyer to assume the risk of cost
                          overruns.
                        * Fixed-price contracts require the seller to assume the risk of cost overruns.
                        * Time and materials contracts are good for smaller assignments, but can impose
                          cost overrun risks to the buyer if the contract between the buyer and seller does
                          not include a not-to-exceed clause. This clause, commonly called an NTE clause,
                          puts a cap on the maximum amount for the contract time and materials.
                        * A purchase order is a unilateral form of contract. It is an example of a fixed
                          price contract.




                                                                                                                                              PART III
                        * A letter of intent is not a contract, but shows the intent of the buyer to
                          purchase from a specific seller.

                   Stakeholder Management Facts
                   Stakeholder management used to be tucked into project communications, but it's so
                   important that it's now its own knowledge area in the PMBOK Guide. Stakeholder
                   management is still closely related to communications management, but it's more than
                   just communicating with stakeholders. You'll complete four processes as part of stake-
                   holder management:

                        * Identify stakeholders     Part of project initiation.
                        * Plan stakeholder management Part of the planning process group (obviously).
                        * Manage stakeholder engagement            This is an executing process group.
                        * Control stakeholder engagement           Part of the monitoring and controlling
                          process group.

                       Stakeholder identification is one of the first processes you'll do in a project. You
                   need to identify the stakeholders to ensure you're including all of the right people in the
                   project planning. Once you've identified a stakeholder, you'll record their information
                   in the stakeholder register. There's a three-step approach to stakeholder management:

                        * Identify stakeholders as early as possible in the project.
                        * Identify the project impact and support of each stakeholder.
                        * Plan how to influence the stakeholders.

                      You'll need to know about the stakeholder classification models for your PMI ex-
                   amination. These are grids to plot out stakeholder power, influence, and interest in the
                   project. Here are four common models:

                        * Power/interest grid     How much power/interest do the stakeholders have?
                        * Power/influence grid How much power/influence do the stakeholders have?

                             * Influence/impact grid How much influence (involvement of decisions) and
                               impact on project change do the stakeholders have?
                             * Salience model Classifies stakeholders based on power, urgency, and
                               legitimacy for the project.


                        A Letter to You
                        My goal for you is to pass your exam. As I teach my PMP Boot Camp for different orga-
                        nizations around the globe, I'm struck by one similarity among the most excited course
                        participants: These people want to pass their exam. Sure, project management is not the
                        most exciting topic, but the individuals are excited about passing their exam. I hope
                        you feel the same way. I believe that your odds of passing the PMP or the CAPM are like
                        most things in life; you're going to get out of it only what you put into it. I challenge
                        you to become excited, happy, and eager to pass the exam.
                            Here are ten final tips for passing your PMP or CAPM examination:

                             * Prepare to pass the exam, not just take it.
                             * If you haven't done so already, schedule your exam. Having a deadline makes
                               that exam even more of a reality.
                             * If you haven't done so already, create a clutter-free area for studying.
                             * Study in regular intervals right up to the day before your examination.
                             * Repetition is the mother of learning. If you don't know the formula, repeat it
                               and repeat it. And then repeat it again.
                             * Create your own flashcards from the terms and glossary in this book.
                             * Always answer the exam questions according to how the Project Management
                               Institute (PMI) expects something done, not how you'd do it at your organization.
                             * Practice creating the one page of notes you'll create at the start of
                               your exam.
                             * Create a significant reward for yourself as an incentive to pass the exam.
                             * Make a commitment to pass.

                            If you're stumped on something I've written in this book, or if you'd like to share
                        your PMP or CAPM success story, drop me a line at cs@instructing.com. Finally, I won't
                        wish you good luck on your PMP or CAPM exam--luck is for the ill-prepared. If you
                        follow the strategies I've outlined in this book and apply yourself, I am certain you'll
                        pass the exam.

                            All my best,
                            Joseph Phillips, PMP, Project+, CTT+

                    8/80 Rule A planning heuristic for creating the WBS and the associated activity list.
                    This rule states the work package in a WBS must take no more than 80 hours of labor
                    to create and no fewer than 8 hours of labor to create.
                    Abusive manner Treating others with conduct that may result in harm, fear, humilia-
                    tion, manipulation, or exploitation. For example, berating a project team member be-
                    cause they've taken longer than expected to complete a project assignment may be
                    considered humiliation.
                    Acceptance A risk response appropriate for both positive and negative risks, but often
                    used for smaller risks within a project.
                    Acknowledgment The receiver signals that the message has been received; an ac-
                    knowledgment shows receipt of the message, but not necessarily agreement with the
                    message.
                    Active listening The receiver confirms that the message is being received through
                    feedback, questions, prompts for clarity, and other signs of confirmation.
                    Active observation The observer interacts with the worker to ask questions and un-
                    derstand each step of the work being completed. In some instances, the observer could
                    serve as an assistant in doing the work.
                    Activity list The primary output of breaking down the WBS work packages.
                    Activity network diagrams These are diagrams, such as the project network diagram,
                    to show the flow of the project work.
                    Actual cost (AC)   The actual amount of monies the project has spent to date.
                    Adaptive life cycle A project life cycle with iterations of planning and executing; proj-
                    ect change happens often, but is managed tightly, and the project stakeholders are high-
                    ly involved in the project. This approach is also known as the agile project management
                    methodology.
                    Adjourning Once the project is done, either the team moves on to other assignments
                    as a unit, or the project team is disbanded and individual team members go on to
                    other work.
                    Affinity diagram A breakdown of ideas, solutions, causes, and project components
                    that groups them together with other similar ideas.
                    Alternative dispute resolution When there is an issue or claim that must be settled
                    before the contract can be closed, the parties involved in the issue or claim will try to
                    reach a settlement through mediation or arbitration.

                         Alternative identification A scope definition process of finding alternative solutions
                         for the project customer while considering the customer's satisfaction, the cost of the
                         solution, and how the customer may use the product in operations.
                         Analogous estimating A somewhat unreliable estimating approach that relies on his-
                         torical information to predict what current activity durations should be. Analogous
                         estimating is more reliable, however, than team member recollections. Analogous esti-
                         mating is also known as top-down estimating and is a form of expert judgment.
                         Application areas The areas of expertise, industry, or function where a project is
                         centered. Examples of application areas include architecture, IT, health care, or
                         manufacturing.
                         Assumption log An assumption is something that is believed to be true or false, but
                         it has not yet been proven to be true or false. Assumptions that prove wrong can be-
                         come risks for the project. All identified project assumptions are recorded in the as-
                         sumption log for testing and analysis, and the outcomes are recorded.
                         Assumption A belief that may or may not be true within a project. Weather is an ex-
                         ample of an assumption in construction projects.
                         Authority power Project management team members may have authority over other
                         project team members, have the ability to make decisions, and even sign approvals
                         for project work and purchases.
                         Avoidance     A risk response to avoid the risk.
                         Balanced matrix structure An organization where organizational resources are
                         pooled into one project team, but the functional managers and the project managers
                         share the project power.
                         Benchmarking       Comparing any two similar entities to measure their performance.
                         Benefit/cost ratio (BCR) models This is an example of a benefits comparison model.
                         It examines the benefit-to-cost ratio.
                         Bid From seller to buyer. Price is the determining factor in the decision-making process.
                         Bidders conference A meeting of all the project's potential vendors to clarify the con-
                         tract statement of work and the details of the contracted work.
                         Bottom-up estimating An estimating approach that starts from zero, accounts for
                         each component of the WBS, and arrives at a sum for the project. It is completed with
                         the project team and can be one of the most time-consuming and most reliable meth-
                         ods to predict project costs.
                         Brainstorming This approach encourages participants to generate as many ideas as
                         possible about the project requirements. No idea is judged or dismissed during the
                         brainstorming session.
                         Budget estimate This estimate is somewhat broad and is used early in the planning
                         processes and also in top-down estimates. The range of variance for the estimate can be
                         from -10 percent to +25 percent.

                                                                                                                                 585
                    Business risks These risks may have negative or positive outcomes. Examples include
                    using a less experienced worker to complete a task, allowing phases or activities to over-
                    lap, or forgoing the expense of formal training for on-the-job education.
                    Cardinal scales A ranking approach to identify the probability and impact by using a
                    numerical value, from .01 (very low) to 1.0 (certain).
                    Cause-and-effect diagrams Diagrams that show the relation between the variables
                    within a process and how those relations may contribute to a problem. The diagrams
                    can help organize both the process and team opinions, as well as generate discussion
                    on finding a solution to ensure quality.
                    Certified Associate in Project Management (CAPM) A person who has slightly less
                    project management experience than a PMP, but who has qualified for and then passed
                    the CAPM examination.
                    Change control board (CCB) A committee that evaluates the worthiness of a pro-
                    posed change and either approves or rejects the proposed change.
                    Change control system (CCS) The change control system communicates the process
                    for controlling changes to the project deliverables. This system works with the configu-
                    ration management system and seeks to control and document proposed or requested
                    changes to the project's product.
                    Change log All changes that enter into a project are recorded in the change log. The
                    characteristics of the change, such as the time, cost, risk, and scope details, are also
                    recorded.
                    Change management plan This plan details the project procedures for entertaining
                    change requests: how change requests are managed, documented, approved, or declined.
                    Change request A documented request to add to or remove from the project scope. A
                    change request may be initiated to change an organizational process asset, such as a
                    template or a form.
                    Checklist A simple approach to ensure that work is completed according to policy.
                    Checklists, also known as checksheets, can be used in execution, risk management,
                    quality management, and scope validation.
                    Choice of media The best modality to use when communicating that is relevant to
                    the information being communicated.
                    Claims These are disagreements between the buyer and the seller, usually centering
                    on a change, who did the change, and even whether a change has occurred. Claims are
                    also called disputes and appeals, and are monitored and controlled through the project
                    in accordance with the contract terms.
                    Closing process group The project management process group that contains the
                    activities to close out a project or project phase and project contracts.

                         Closure processes This final process group of the project management life cycle is
                         responsible for closing the project phase or project. This is where project documenta-
                         tion is archived and project contracts are also closed.
                         Code of accounts A hierarchical numbering system for each item in the WBS. The
                         PMBOK is a good example of a code of accounts, as each chapter and its subheadings
                         follow a logical numbering scheme. For example, PMBOK 5.3.3.2 identifies an exact
                         paragraph in the PMBOK.
                         Coercive power The project manager has the authority to discipline the project team
                         members. This is also known as penalty power.
                         Collective bargaining agreement constraints Contracts and agreements with unions
                         or other employee groups may serve as constraints on the project.
                         Commercial database A cost-estimating approach that uses a database, typically soft-
                         ware driven, to create the cost estimate for a project.
                         Communication assumptions Anything that the project management team believes
                         to be true but hasn't proven to be true. For example, the project management team may
                         assume that all of the project team can be reached via cell phone, but parts of the world,
                         as of this writing, don't have a cell signal.
                         Communication barrier         Anything that prohibits communication from occurring.
                         Communication channels formula N(N - 1)/2, where N represents the number of
                         identified stakeholders. This formula reveals the total number of communication chan-
                         nels within a project.
                         Communication constraints Anything that limits the project management team's
                         options. When it comes to communication constraints, geographical locales, incom-
                         patible communications software, and even limited communications technology can
                         constrain the project team.
                         Communications management plan A project management subsidiary plan that de-
                         fines the stakeholders who need specific information, the person who will supply the
                         information, the schedule for the information to be supplied, and the approved modal-
                         ity to provide the information.
                         Competency This attribute defines what talents, skills, and capacities are needed to
                         complete the project work.
                         Composite structure An organization that creates a blend of the functional, matrix,
                         and projectized structures.
                         Compromising This approach requires that both parties give up something.
                         Confidentiality A project manager should keep certain aspects of a project confiden-
                         tial; consider contract negotiations, human resource issues, and trade secrets of the
                         organization.
                         Configuration identification This includes the labeling of the components, how
                         changes are made to the product, and the accountability of the changes.

                                                                                                                                587
                    Configuration management plan This plan is an input to the control scope process.
                    It defines how changes to the features and functions of the project deliverable, the
                    product scope, may enter the project.
                    Configuration management system This system defines how stakeholders are al-
                    lowed to submit change requests for the project's product, the conditions for approving
                    a change request, and how approved change requests are validated in the project scope.
                    Configuration management also documents the characteristics and functions of the
                    project's products and any changes to a product's characteristics.
                    Configuration status accounting The organization of the product materials, details,
                    and prior product documentation.
                    Configuration verification and auditing The scope validation and completeness au-
                    diting of project or phase deliverables to ensure that they are in alignment with the
                    project plan.
                    Conflict of interest A situation where a project manager may have two competing
                    duties of loyalty. For example, purchasing software from a relative may benefit the rela-
                    tive, but it may do harm to the performing organization.
                    Constraint A condition, rule, or procedure that restricts a project manager's options.
                    A project deadline is an example of a constraint.
                    Context diagram These diagrams show the relationship between elements of an en-
                    vironment. For example, a context diagram would illustrate the networks, servers, work-
                    stations, and people that interact with the elements of the environment.
                    Contingency reserve A contingency allowance for risk events. Contingency allow-
                    ances are used to respond to risk events.
                    Contract A contract is a formal agreement between the buyer and the seller. Contracts
                    can be oral or written--though written is preferred.
                    Contract change control system This defines the procedures for how the contract
                    may be changed. The process for changing the contract includes the forms; document-
                    ed communications; tracking; conditions within the project, business, or marketplace
                    that justify the needed change; dispute resolution procedures; and the procedures for
                    getting the changes approved within the performing organization.
                    Contract closure The formal verification of the contract completeness by the vendor
                    and the performing organization.
                    Contract statement of work (CSOW) This document requires that the buyer fully
                    describe the work to be completed and/or the product to be supplied. The SOW be-
                    comes part of the contract between the buyer and the seller.
                    Control account A WBS entry that considers the time, cost, and scope measurements for
                    that deliverable within the WBS. The estimated performance is compared against the ac-
                    tual performance to measure overall performance for the deliverables within that control
                    account. The specifics of a control account are documented in a control account plan.

                         Control chart      A quality control chart that maps the performance of project work
                         over time.
                         Control threshold A predetermined range of acceptable variances, such as +/-10 per-
                         cent off schedule. Should the variance exceed the threshold, then project control pro-
                         cesses and corrective actions will be enacted.
                         Corrective action A corrective action brings project work back into alignment
                         with the project plan. A corrective action may also address a process that is produc-
                         ing errors.
                         Cost aggregation Costs are parallel to each WBS work package. The costs of each
                         work package are aggregated to their corresponding control accounts. Each control ac-
                         count then is aggregated to the sum of the project costs.
                         Cost baseline A time-phased exposure of when the project monies are to be spent in
                         relation to cumulative values of the work completed in the project. It is an aggregation
                         of the project deliverables and their associated costs. The difference between the cost
                         estimates and the actual cost of the project identifies the cost variance.
                         Cost-benefit analysis A process to study the trade-offs between costs and the benefits
                         realized from those costs.
                         Cost budgeting The cost aggregation achieved by assigning specific dollar amounts
                         for each of the scheduled activities or, more likely, for each of the work packages in the
                         WBS. Cost budgeting applies the cost estimates over time.
                         Cost change control system A system that examines any changes associated with
                         scope changes, the cost of materials, and the cost of any other resources, and the associ-
                         ated impact on the overall project cost.
                         Cost management plan This plan details how the project costs will be planned for,
                         estimated, budgeted, and then monitored and controlled.
                         Cost of conformance This is the cost associated with the monies spent to attain the
                         expected level of quality. This is also known as failure costs.
                         Cost of nonconformance to quality This is the cost associated with not satisfying the
                         quality expectations. This is a component of the cost of quality.
                         Cost of poor quality The monies spent to recover from not adhering to the expected
                         level of quality. Examples may include rework, defect repair, loss of life or limb because
                         safety precautions were not taken, loss of sales, and loss of customers. This is also
                         known as the cost of nonconformance to quality.
                         Cost of quality The monies spent to attain the expected level of quality within a proj-
                         ect. Examples include training, testing, and safety precautions.
                         Cost performance index (CPI) Measures the project based on its financial perfor-
                         mance. The formula is CPI = EV/AC.

                    Cost plus fixed fee contract A contract that requires the buyer to pay for the cost of
                    the goods and services procured plus a fixed fee for the contracted work. The buyer as-
                    sumes the risk of a cost overrun.
                    Cost plus incentive fee A contract type that requires the buyer to pay a cost for the
                    procured work, plus an incentive fee, or a bonus, for the work if terms and conditions
                    are met.
                    Cost plus percentage of costs A contract that requires the buyer to pay for the costs
                    of the goods and services procured, plus a percentage of the costs. The buyer assumes
                    all of the risks for cost overruns.
                    Cost reporting system     A system to record the actual costs of the project activities.
                    Cost variance (CV) The difference of the earned value amount and the cumulative
                    actual costs of the project. The formula is CV = EV - AC.
                    Crashing A schedule compression approach that adds more resources to activities on
                    the critical path to complete the project earlier. When crashing a project, costs are add-
                    ed, as the associated labor and sometimes resources such as faster equipment cause
                    costs to increase.
                    Critical chain method A network analysis approach where the deadlines associated
                    with individual tasks are removed and the only date that matters is the promised due
                    date of the project deliverable. CCM works to modify the project schedule based on
                    the availability of project resources rather than on the pure sequence of events, as in the
                    critical path method.
                    Critical path The path in the project network diagram that cannot be delayed, or the
                    project completion date will be late. There can be more than one critical path. Activities
                    in the critical path have no float.
                    Cultural and social environment Defines how a project affects people and how those
                    people may affect the project. Cultural and social environments include the economic,
                    educational, ethical, religious, demographic, and ethnic composition of the people af-
                    fected by the project.
                    Culture shock The initial reaction a person experiences when in a foreign environment.
                    Customer/user     The person(s) who will pay for and use the project's deliverables.
                    Data precision The consideration of the risk ranking scores that takes into account
                    any bias, the accuracy of the data submitted, and the reliability of the nature of the data
                    submitted.
                    Decision tree A method to determine which of two or more decisions is the best one.
                    The model examines the cost and benefits of each decision's outcome and weighs the
                    probability of success for each of the decisions.
                    Decoder    The device that decodes a message as it is being received.
                    Defect repair   The activity to repair a defect within the project.

                         Definitive estimate This estimate type is one of the most accurate. It's used late in the
                         planning processes and is associated with bottom-up estimating. You need the WBS in
                         order to create the definitive estimate. The range of variance for the estimate can be
                         from -5 percent to +10 percent.
                         Deliverable A product, service, or result created by a project. Projects can have mul-
                         tiple deliverables.
                         Delphi Technique An anonymous method of querying experts about various factors,
                         such as requirements, estimates and risks within a project, phase, or component of a
                         project. The results of the survey are analyzed by a third party, organized, and then cir-
                         culated to the experts. Because the surveys are anonymous, participants are more likely
                         to be honest with their requirements, opinions, and statements. The project manager
                         organizes these comments and inputs and then sends them back to the participants for
                         another round of anonymous input. There can be several rounds of anonymous discus-
                         sion with the Delphi Technique, without fear of backlash or offending other partici-
                         pants in the process.
                         Deming's PDCA cycle Standard project management is based on Deming's plan-do-
                         check-act cycle, which describes the logical progression of project management duties.
                         Design of experiments An approach that relies on statistical scenarios to determine
                         what variables within a project will result in the best outcome.
                         Dictatorship     A decision method where only one individual makes the decision for
                         the group.
                         Direct costs These are costs incurred by the project in order for the project to exist.
                         Examples include equipment needed to complete the project work, salaries of the proj-
                         ect team, and other expenses tied directly to the project's existence.
                         Discretionary dependencies These dependencies are the preferred order of activities.
                         Project managers should use these relationships at their discretion and should docu-
                         ment the logic behind the decision. Discretionary dependencies allow activities to hap-

                         Duty of loyalty A project manager's responsibility to be loyal to another person, or-
                         ganization, or vendor. For example, a project manager has a duty of loyalty to promote
                         the best interests of an employer rather than the best interests of a vendor.

                         Earned value (EV) Earned value is the physical work completed to date and the au-
                         thorized budget for that work. It is the percentage of the BAC that represents the actual
                         work completed in the project.

                    Effective listening The receiver is involved in the listening experience by paying atten-
                    tion to visual cues from the speaker and paralingual characteristics, and by asking rel-
                    evant questions.
                    Encoder    The device that encodes the message being sent.
                    Enhancing A risk response that attempts to enhance the conditions to ensure that a
                    positive risk event will likely happen.
                    Enterprise environmental factors Any external or internal organizational factors that
                    can affect project success. Enterprise environmental factors include the culture, organi-
                    zational structure, resources, commercial databases the project will use, market condi-
                    tions, and your project management software.
                    Estimate at completion (EAC) These forecasting formulas predict the likely com-
                    pleted costs of the project based on current scenarios within the project. Three varia-
                    tions of this formula are based on conditions the project may be experiencing.
                    Estimate to complete (ETC) An earned value management formula that predicts how
                    much funding the project will require to be completed.
                    Ethics Describes the personal, cultural, and organizational interpretation of right and
                    wrong; project managers are to operate ethically and fairly.
                    Ethnocentrism Happens when individuals measure and compare a foreigner's ac-
                    tions against their own local culture. The locals typically believe their own culture is
                    superior to the foreigner's culture.
                    Executing process group The project management process group that provides the
                    activities to carry out the project management plan to complete the project work.
                    Expectancy Theory This theory states that people will behave based on what they
                    expect as a result of their behavior. In other words, people will work in relation to the
                    expected reward.
                    Expected monetary value (EMV) The monetary value of a risk exposure based on the
                    risk's probability and impact in the risk matrix. This approach is typically used in quan-
                    titative risk analysis because it quantifies the risk exposure.
                    Expert power The project manager's authority comes both from experience with the
                    technology the project focuses on and from expertise in managing projects.
                    Exploit A risk response that takes advantage of the positive risks within a project.
                    External dependencies As the name implies, these are dependencies outside of the
                    project's control. Examples include the delivery of equipment from a vendor, the deliver-
                    able of another project, or the decision of a committee, lawsuit, or expected new law.
                    External QA Assurance provided to the external customers of the project.
                    External risks These risks are outside of the project, but directly affect it--for exam-
                    ple, legal issues, labor issues, a shift in project priorities, or weather. "Force majeure"

                         risks call for disaster recovery rather than project management. These are risks caused
                         by earthquakes, tornados, floods, civil unrest, and other disasters.
                         Fast tracking A schedule compression method that changes the relationship of ac-
                         tivities. With fast tracking, activities that would normally be done in sequence are al-
                         lowed to be done in parallel or with some overlap. Fast tracking can be accomplished
                         by changing the relation of activities from FS to SS or even FF or by adding lead time to
                         downstream activities. However, fast tracking does add risk to the project.
                         Feedback The sender confirms that the receiver understands the message by directly
                         asking for a response, questions for clarification, or other confirmation.
                         Finish-to-finish An activity relationship type that requires the current activity be fin-
                         ished before its successor can finish.
                         Finish-to-start An activity relationship type that requires the current activity be fin-
                         ished before its successor can start.
                         Fixed costs Costs that remain constant throughout the life of the project (the cost of
                         a piece of rented equipment for the project, the cost of a consultant brought on to the
                         project, and so on).
                         Fixed-price contracts Also known as firm fixed-price and lump-sum contracts, these
                         are agreements that define a total price for the product the seller is to provide.
                         Fixed-price with economic price adjustments A fixed-price contract with a special
                         allowance for price changes based on economic reasons such as inflation or the cost of
                         raw materials.
                         Flowchart A diagram illustrating how components within a system are related. Flow-
                         charts show the relation between components, as well as help the project team deter-
                         mine where quality issues may be present and, once done, plan accordingly. System
                         or process flowcharts show the relationship between components and how the overall
                         process works. These are useful for identifying risks between system components.
                         Focus groups A moderator-led requirements collection method to elicit requirements
                         from stakeholders.
                         Force majeure An "act of God" that may have a negative impact on the project; con-
                         sider fire, hurricanes, tornados, and earthquakes.
                         Forcing power      The person with the power makes the decision.
                         Formal power The project manager has been assigned the role of project manager by
                         senior management and is in charge of the project.
                         Forming The project team meets and learns about their roles and responsibilities on
                         the project. Little interaction among the project team happens in this stage because the
                         team is learning about the project and project manager.
                         Fragnet A representation of a project network diagram that is often used for out-
                         sourced portions of a project, repetitive work within a project, or a subproject. Also
                         called a subnet.

                    Free float This is the total time a single activity can be delayed without affecting the
                    early start of its immediately following successor activities.
                    Functional analysis This is the study of the functions within a system, project, or,
                    what's more likely in the project scope statement, the product the project will be creat-
                    ing. Functional analysis studies the goals of the product, how the product will be used,
                    and the expectations the customer has of the product once it leaves the project and
                    moves into operations. Functional analysis may also consider the cost of the product in
                    operations, which is known as life cycle costing.
                    Functional structure An organization that is divided into functions, and each em-
                    ployee has one clear functional manager. Each department acts independently of the
                    other departments. A project manager in this structure has little to no power and may
                    function as a project coordinator, project expeditor, or project administrator.
                    Funding limit Most projects have a determined budget in relation to the project
                    scope. There may be a qualifier on this budget, such as plus or minus 10 percent based
                    on the type of cost estimate created.
                    Funding limit reconciliation An organization's approach to managing cash flow
                    against the project deliverables based on a schedule, milestone accomplishment, or
                    data constraints.
                    Future value A benefit comparison model to determine a future value of money. The
                    formula to calculate future value is FV = PV(1 + I)n, where PV is present value, I is the
                    given interest rate, and n is the number of periods.
                    General management skills These include the application of accounting, procure-
                    ment, sales and marketing, contracting, manufacturing, logistics, strategic planning, hu-
                    man resource management, standards and regulations, and information technology.
                    A Guide to the Project Management Body of Knowledge (PMBOK) A PMI publication that
                    defines widely accepted project management practices. The CAPM and the PMP exam
                    are based on this book.
                    Hard logic Logic that describes activities that must happen in a particular order. For
                    example, the dirt must be excavated before the foundation can be built. The foundation
                    must be in place before the framing can begin. This is also referred to as mandatory
                    dependencies.
                    Herzberg's Theory of Motivation Frederick Herzberg's theory of the motivating
                    agents and hygiene agents that affect a person's willingness to excel in his career.
                    Hierarchical organizational chart A chart showing the relationship between superior
                    and subordinate employees, groups, disciplines, and even departments.
                    Human resource plan This plan defines how project team members will be brought
                    onto the project team, managed, and released from the project team. It also defines
                    team training, safety issues, roles and responsibilities, and how the project's reward and
                    recognition system will operate. Chapter 9 defines the human resource plan in detail.

                         Inappropriate compensation The project manager is to avoid inappropriate com-
                         pensation, such as bribes. The project manager is to act in the best interest of the project
                         and the organization.
                         Independent estimates These estimates are often referred to as "should cost" esti-
                         mates. They are created by the performing organization or outside experts to predict
                         what the cost of the procured product should be.
                         Indirect costs Costs that are representative of more than one project (for example,
                         utilities for the performing organization, access to a training room, project manage-
                         ment software license, and so on).
                         Influence diagrams An influence diagram charts out a decision problem. It identifies
                         all of the elements, variables, decisions, and objectives and also how each factor may
                         influence another.
                         Influence/impact grid Stakeholders are mapped on a grid based on their influence
                         over the project in relation to their influence over the project execution.
                         Influencers Persons who can positively or negatively influence a project's ongoing
                         activities and/or the project's likelihood of success.
                         Information presentation tools A software package that allows the project manage-
                         ment team to present the project's health through graphics, spreadsheets, and text.
                         (Think of Microsoft Project.)
                         Information retrieval system A system to quickly and effectively store, archive, and
                         access project information.
                         Initial project organization The project scope statement identifies the project team
                         and the key stakeholders. In some organizations, especially on larger projects, the
                         team organization and structure are also documented.
                         Initiating process group The project management process group that allows a project
                         to be chartered and authorized.
                         Integrated change control A process to consider and control the impact of a pro-
                         posed change on the project's knowledge areas.
                         Interactive communications This is the most common and most effective approach
                         to communication. It's where two or more people exchange information. Meetings,
                         videoconferences, phone conferences, even ad-hoc conversations are all examples of
                         interactive communications--the participants are actively communicating with one
                         another to ensure that all participants receive the correct message and conclusions.
                         Internal dependencies Internal relationships to the project or the organization. For
                         example, the project team must create the software as part of the project's deliverable
                         before the software can be tested for quality control.

                    non-collocated issues that affect a project's ability to progress.
                    Interpersonal interfaces This organizational interface considers the formal and
                    informal reporting relationships that may exist among the project team members.
                    The interpersonal interface also considers the job descriptions of the project team
                    members, existing reporting structures between supervisors and subordinates, and
                    existing relationships, if any, that may affect the project work. This interface also
                    considers any cultural or language differences among the project team that may need
                    to be addressed.
                    Interpersonal skills   The ability to interact, lead, motivate, and manage people.
                    Interrelationship diagraphs Used for complex solutions where the causes and effects
                    of problems and benefits are intertwined with one another.
                    Interviews A requirements collection method used to elicit requirements from stake-
                    holders in a one-on-one conversation.
                    Invitation for Bid (IFB) From buyer to seller. Requests the seller to provide a price for
                    the procured product or service.
                    Iron Triangle of Project Management A triangle with the characteristics of time, cost,
                    and scope. Time, cost, and scope each constitute one side of the triangle; if any side of
                    the Iron Triangle is not in balance with the other sides, the project will suffer. The Iron
                    Triangle of Project Management is also known as the Triple Constraints of Project Man-
                    agement because all projects are constrained by time, cost, and scope.
                    Ishikawa diagrams These cause-and-effect diagrams are also called fishbone dia-
                    grams and are used to find the root cause of factors that are causing risks within the
                    project.
                    ISO The abbreviation for the International Organization for Standardization. ISO is
                    Greek for "equal," while "International Organization for Standardization" in a differ-
                    ent language would be abbreviated differently. The organization elected to use "ISO"
                    for all languages.
                    Issue log A logbook of the issues the project team has identified and dates as to when
                    the issues must be resolved by. The issue log may also include team members or stake-
                    holders who are responsible for finding a solution to the identified issues. All identified
                    issues are documented in the issue log, along with an issue owner and a deadline to
                    resolve the issue. The outcome of the issue is also recorded.
                    Kill point The review of a phase to determine if it accomplished its requirements. A
                    kill point signals an opportunity to kill the project if it should not continue.
                    Known unknown An event that will likely happen within the project, but when it
                    will happen and to what degree is unknown. These events, such as delays, are usually
                    risk related.

                         Lag time     Positive time, or waiting time, that moves two or more activities further
                         apart.
                         Late finish The latest a project activity can finish. Used in the backward pass proce-
                         dure to discover the critical path and the project float.
                         Late start The latest a project activity can begin. Used in the backward pass procedure
                         to discover the critical path and the project float.
                         Leading stakeholder status The stakeholder is aware of your project, they want the
                         project to succeed, and they're leading the charge to make certain the project outcome
                         is positive.
                         Lead time Negative time that allows two or more activities to overlap where ordinar-
                         ily these activities would be sequential.
                         Learning curve An approach that assumes the cost per unit decreases the more units
                         workers complete, because workers learn as they complete the required work.
                         Lessons learned This is documentation of what did and did not work in the project
                         implementation. Lessons learned documentation is created throughout the project by
                         the entire project team. When lessons learned sessions are completed, they're available
                         to be used and applied by the entire organization. They are now part of the organiza-
                         tional process assets.
                         Letter contract A letter contract allows the vendor to begin working on the project
                         immediately. It is often used as a stopgap solution.
                         Letter of intent A letter of intent is not a contract, but a letter stating that the buyer is
                         intending to create a contractual relationship with the seller.
                         Logistical interfaces The logistics of the team locale, time zones, geographical bound-
                         aries, and travel requirements within a project.
                         Low-priority risk watch list      Low-priority risks are identified and assigned to a watch
                         list for periodic monitoring.
                         Majority A group decision method where more than 50 percent of the group must be
                         in agreement.
                         Make-or-buy decision A process in which the project management team determines
                         the cost-effectiveness, benefits, and feasibility of making a product or buying it from a
                         vendor.
                         Management reserve A percentage of the project duration to combat Parkinson's
                         Law. When project activities become late, their lateness is subtracted from the manage-
                         ment reserve. This can be a financial amount, not just time, to pay for the associated
                         labor expenses.
                         Manage project team The project manager must, according to enterprise environ-
                         mental factors, manage the project team to ensure that they are completing their work
                         assignments with quality and according to plan.

                    Manage stakeholder engagement This process is based on what the stakeholders ex-
                    pect from the project and on project communications from the project manager.
                    Mandatory dependencies These dependencies are the natural order of activities. For
                    example, you can't begin building your house until your foundation is in place. These
                    relationships are called hard logic.
                    Maslow's Hierarchy of Needs Abraham Maslow's theory of the five needs all humans
                    have and work toward.
                    Mathematical model A project selection method to determine the likelihood of suc-
                    cess. These models include linear programming, nonlinear programming, dynamic
                    programming, integer programming, and multi-objective programming.
                    Matrix diagrams A data analysis table that shows the strength between variables and
                    relationships in the matrix.
                    McClelland's Theory of Needs David McClelland developed this theory, which states
                    that our needs are acquired and developed by our experiences over time. All people are,
                    according to this theory, driven by one of three needs: achievement, affiliation, or power.
                    McGregor's Theory of X and Y Douglas McGregor's theory that states management
                    views workers in the Y category as competent and self-led and workers in the X catego-
                    ry as incompetent and needing to be micromanaged.
                    Medium The device or technology that transports a message.
                    Milestone Milestones are timeless events in the project's progress that represent ac-
                    complishment in the project. Projects usually create milestones as the result of com-
                    pleting phases within the project.
                    Milestone list This list details the project milestones and their attributes. It is used for
                    several areas of project planning, but also helps determine how quickly the project may
                    be achieving its objectives.
                    Mind mapping This approach maps ideas to show the relationship among require-
                    ments and the differences between requirements. The map can be reviewed to identify
                    new solutions or to rank the identified requirements.
                    Mitigation A risk response effort to reduce the probability and/or impact of an identi-
                    fied risk in the project.
                    Monitoring and controlling process group The project management process group
                    oversees, measures, and tracks project performance.
                    Monte Carlo analysis A project simulation approach named after the world-famous
                    gambling district in Monaco. This predicts how scenarios may work out, given any
                    number of variables. The process doesn't actually churn out a specific answer, but a
                    range of possible answers. When Monte Carlo analysis is applied to a schedule, it can
                    examine, for example, the optimistic completion date, the pessimistic completion date,
                    and the most likely completion date for each activity in the project and then predict a
                    mean for the project schedule.

                         Monte Carlo technique A simulation technique that got its name from the casinos of
                         Monte Carlo, Monaco. The simulation is completed using a computer software pro-
                         gram that can simulate a project, using values for all possible variables, to predict the
                         most likely model.
                         Multicriteria Decision Analysis A method to rate potential project team members
                         based on criteria such as education, experience, skills, knowledge, and more.
                         Murder boards These are committees that ask every conceivable negative question
                         about the proposed project. Their goals are to expose the project's strengths and weak-
                         nesses, and to kill the project if it's deemed unworthy for the organization to commit
                         to. Also known as project steering committees or project selection committees.
                         Negative stakeholders Stakeholders that are opposed to the project's existence. These
                         stakeholders do not want the project to succeed because they do not see or agree with
                         the project's benefits that the project may bring about for the organization.
                         Net present value      Evaluates the monies returned on a project for each period the
                         project lasts.
                         Neutral stakeholders Stakeholders that are not affected by the project's success or
                         failure. Examples may include inspectors, procurement officers, and some end users.
                         Neutral stakeholder status The stakeholder is aware of your project and doesn't care
                         if the project succeeds or fails.
                         Noise    Anything that interferes with or disrupts a message.
                         Nominal group technique As with brainstorming, participants are encouraged to gen-
                         erate as many ideas as possible, but the suggested ideas are ranked by a voting process.
                         Nonverbal Facial expressions, hand gestures, and body language are nonverbal cues
                         that contribute to a message. Approximately 55 percent of communication is nonverbal.
                         Norming Project team members go about getting the project work, begin to rely on
                         one another, and generally complete their project assignments.
                         Oligopoly A market condition where the market is so tight that the actions of one
                         vendor affect the actions of all the others.
                         Opportunity cost The total cost of the opportunity that is refused to realize an op-
                         posing opportunity.
                         Ordinal scales A ranking approach that identifies and ranks the risks from very high
                         to very unlikely or to some other value.
                         Organization chart Traditional chart that depicts how the organization is broken
                         down by department and disciplines. This chart is sometimes called the organizational
                         breakdown structure (OBS) and is arranged by departments, units, or teams.
                         Organizational interfaces The project management team needs to identify which de-
                         partments are going to be involved in the project.

                    Organizational process assets The methodology an organization uses to perform its
                    business, as well as the guidelines, procedures, and knowledge bases, such as the lessons
                    learned documentation from past projects and any relevant historical information.
                    Organizational risks The performing organization can contribute to the project's
                    risks through unreasonable cost, time, and scope expectations; poor project prioritiza-
                    tion; inadequate funding or the disruption of funding; and competition with other
                    projects for internal resources.
                    Organizational structure constraint The structure of the organization has a direct
                    correlation to the amount of power a project manager has within a project.
                    Ouchi's Theory Z William Ouchi's theory is based on the participative management
                    style of the Japanese. This theory states that workers are motivated by a sense of com-
                    mitment, opportunity, and advancement.
                    Paralingual The pitch, tone, and inflections in the sender's voice affecting the mes-
                    sage being sent.
                    Parametric estimate A quantitatively based duration estimate that uses mathematical
                    formulas to predict how long an activity will take based on the quantities of work to be
                    completed. This approach may also use a parametric model to extrapolate the costs for
                    a project (for example, cost per hour and cost per unit). It can include variables and
                    points based on conditions.
                    Pareto diagram A histogram that illustrates categories of failure within a project.
                    Parkinson's Law A theory that states: "Work expands so as to fill the time available
                    for its completion." It is considered with time estimating, because bloated or padded
                    activity estimates will fill the amount of time allotted to the activity.
                    Passive observation The observer records information about the work being com-
                    pleted without interrupting the process; sometimes called the invisible observer.
                    Payback period An estimate to predict how long it will take a project to pay back an
                    organization for the project's investment of capital.
                    Performance report A report that depicts how well a project is performing. Often, the
                    performance report is based on earned value management and may include cost or

                    Performing If a project team can reach the performing stage of team development,
                    they trust one another, work well together, and issues and problems get resolved quick-
                    ly and effectively.
                    Performing organization The organization whose employees or members are most
                    directly involved in the project work.
                    Phase The logical division of a project based on the work or deliverable completed
                    within that phase. Common examples include the phases within construction, software
                    development, or manufacturing.

                         ments. A phase-end review is also called a phase exit, a phase gate, and a kill point.
                         Phase exit The review of a phase to determine if it accomplished its requirements.
                         This is also known as a phase gate.

                         work.
                         Planned value (PV) Planned value is the work scheduled and the budget authorized
                         to accomplish that work. It is the percentage of the BAC that reflects where the project
                         should be at this point in time.
                         Planning package A WBS entry located below a control account and above the work
                         packages. A planning package signifies that there is more planning that needs to be
                         completed for this specific deliverable.
                         Planning process group The project management process group that creates the

                         Plurality A group-decision method where the largest part of the group makes the
                         decision even if it's not more than 50 percent of the total. (Consider three or four fac-
                         tions within the stakeholders.)
                         PMI Code of Ethics and Professional Conduct A PMI document that defines the

                         project team members and the stakeholders.
                         Positive stakeholders Stakeholders that want the project to succeed. Positive stake-
                         holders are often the people that have the most to gain from the project's success and/
                         or the most to lose if the project fails.
                         Power/influence grid Stakeholders are mapped on a grid based on their power and
                         influence over the project.
                         Power/interest grid Stakeholders are mapped on a grid based on their power over the

                                                                                                                                 601
                    Predictive life cycle A predictive life cycle, also called a plan-driven or waterfall ap-
                    proach, is a life cycle that "predicts" the work that will happen in each phase of the
                    project.
                    Present value A benefit comparison model to determine the present value of a future
                    amount of money. The formula to calculate present value is PV = FV / (1 + I)n, where
                    FV is future value, I is the given interest rate, and n is the number of periods.
                    Preventive action A risk-related action that avoids risk within the project. A work-
                    around to a problem within your project is an example of a preventive action.
                    Prioritization matrices A table to rank and score project decisions and alternatives to
                    determine the best solution for the project.
                    Privity The contractual relationship between the buyer and the seller is often consid-
                    ered confidential and secret.
                    Probability and impact matrix A matrix that ranks the probability of a risk event oc-
                    curring and its impact on the project if the event does happen; used in qualitative and
                    quantitative risk analyses.
                    Problem solving This approach confronts the problem head-on and is the preferred
                    method of conflict resolution. This is also known as confronting.
                    Process A set of integrated activities to create a product, result, or service. Project
                    management processes allow the project to move toward completion.
                    Process decision program chart (PDPC) Helps the project team define all of the
                    steps to get from the current state to a desired goal. It facilitates a conversation about
                    what must be completed to reach the goal.
                    Process improvement plan A project management subsidiary plan that aims to im-
                    prove the project, not just the end result of the project. It strives to identify and elimi-
                    nate waste and non-value-added activities.
                    Procurement management plan The procurement management plan controls how
                    the project will be allowed to contract goods and services.
                    Procurement planning A process to identify which parts of the project warrant pro-
                    curement from a vendor by the buyer.
                    Product acceptance criteria This project scope statement component works with the
                    project requirements, but focuses specifically on the product and what the conditions
                    and processes are for formal acceptance of the product.
                    Product breakdown A scope definition technique that breaks down a product into a
                    hierarchical structure, much like a WBS breaks down a project scope.
                    Product life cycle The life cycle of the product a project creates. For example, a project
                    can create a piece of software; the software then has its own life cycle until it becomes
                    defunct.

                         Product process A process that is unique to the type of work creating the product of
                         the project. Product processes can also be unique to the performing organization of the
                         project.
                         Product scope Defines the product or service that will come about as a result of com-
                         pleting the project.
                         Product scope description This is a narrative on what the project is creating as a de-
                         liverable for the project customer.
                         Profile analysis meeting A profile analysis meeting examines each of the roles in
                         the project and documents that role's interests, concerns, influence, knowledge about the
                         project, and the attitude that role will likely have toward the project.
                         Program A collection of related projects working in unison toward a common
                         deliverable.
                         Progressive elaboration The process of gathering project details in steady, uniform
                         steps. This process uses deductive reasoning, logic, and a series of information-gathering
                         techniques to identify details about a project, product, or solution.
                         Project A temporary endeavor to create a unique product, service, or result. The end
                         result of a project is also called a deliverable.
                         Project assumptions A project assumption is anything that is held to be true but not
                         proven to be true.
                         Project boundaries A project boundary clearly states what is included with the proj-
                         ect and what's excluded from the project. This helps to eliminate assumptions between
                         the project management team and the project customer.
                         Project calendar     The calendar that documents when the project work can occur.
                         Project charter This document authorizes the project. It defines the initial require-
                         ments of the project stakeholders. The project charter is endorsed by an entity outside
                         of the project boundaries.
                         Project constraints A constraint is anything that limits the project manager's options.
                         Consider a predetermined budget, deadline, resources, or materials the project man-
                         ager must use within the project--these are all examples of project constraints.
                         Project deliverable     The output of the project.
                         Project environment The location and culture of the environment where the project
                         work will reside. The project environment includes the social, economic, and environ-
                         mental variables the project must work with or around.
                         Project float This is the total time the project can be delayed without passing the
                         customer-expected completion date.
                         Project life cycle The collection of phases from the start of a project to its completion.

                    organizational structure, but it is most common in matrix and projectized structures.
                    Project management plan The documented approach of how a project will be
                    planned, executed, monitored and controlled, and then closed. This document is a col-

                    ment experience and has qualified for and then passed the PMP examination.
                    Project management risks These risks deal with faults in the management of the
                    project: the unsuccessful allocation of time, resources, and scheduling; unacceptable
                    work results; and poor project management.
                    Project management system The defined set of rules, policies, and procedures that a
                    project manager follows and utilizes to complete the project.
                    Project network diagram A diagram that visualizes the flow of the project activities
                    and their relationships to other project activities.
                    Project objectives These are the measurable goals that determine a project's accept-
                    ability to the project customer and the overall success of the project. Objectives often
                    include the cost, schedule, technical requirements, and quality demands.
                    Project portfolio management The management and selection of projects that sup-
                    port an organization's vision and mission. It is the balance of project priority, risk, re-
                    ward, and return on investment. This is a senior management process.
                    Project presentations Presentations are useful in providing information to custom-

                    and conditions.
                    Project requirements These are the demands set by the customer, regulations, or the
                    performing organization that must exist for the project deliverables to be acceptable.
                    Requirements are often prioritized in a number of ways, from "must have" to "should
                    have" to "would like to have."
                    Project scope management plan This project management subsidiary plan controls
                    how the scope will be defined, how the project scope statement will be created, how the
                    WBS will be created, how scope validation will proceed, and how the project scope will
                    be controlled throughout the project.

                         Proposal A document the seller provides to the buyer. The proposal includes more
                         than just a fee for the proposed work; it also includes information on the vendor's
                         skills, the vendor's reputation, and ideas on how the vendor can complete the con-
                         tracted work for the buyer.
                         Prototype A model of the finished deliverable that allows the stakeholder to see how
                         the final project deliverable may operate.
                         Pull communications The central repository of information allows stakeholders
                         to pull the information from the central source when they want--this is an example of
                         pull communication. Pull communication means that the audience retrieves the infor-
                         mation as they desire rather than the information being sent, or pushed, to them.
                         Purchase order (PO) A purchase order is a form of a unilateral contract that the buyer
                         provides to the vendor showing that the purchase has been approved by the buyer's
                         organization.
                         Pure risks These risks have only a negative outcome. Examples include loss of life or
                         limb, fire, theft, natural disasters, and the like.
                         Push communications If you created a report about your project and you sent it to
                         five specific stakeholders, that would be an example of push communications. Push
                         communications means that the sender pushes the same message to multiple people.
                         Think of memos, faxes, press releases, broadcast e-mails: These are all pushed from one
                         source to multiple recipients.
                         Qualitative risk analysis This approach "qualifies" the risks that have been identified
                         in the project. Specifically, qualitative risk analysis examines and prioritizes risks based
                         on their probability of occurring and their impact on the project should they occur.
                         Quality According to ASQ, the degree to which a set of inherent characteristics fulfills
                         requirements.

                                                                                                                                  605
                    Quality assurance A management process that defines the quality system or quality
                    policy that a project must adhere to. QA aims to plan quality into the project rather
                    than to inspect quality into a deliverable.
                    Quality baseline Documents the quality objectives for the project, including the met-
                    rics for stakeholder acceptance of the project deliverable.
                    Quality control An inspection-driven process that measures work results to confirm
                    that the project is meeting the relevant quality standards.
                    Quality management plan This plan defines what quality means for the project, how
                    the project will achieve quality, and how the project will map to organizational proce-
                    dures pertaining to quality.
                    Quality metrics The operational definitions that specify the measurements within a
                    project and the expected targets for quality and performance.
                    Quality planning The process of first determining which quality standards are rele-
                    vant to your project and then finding out the best methods of adhering to those quality
                    standards.
                    Quantitative risk analysis This approach attempts to numerically assess the proba-
                    bility and impact of the identified risks. It also creates an overall risk score for the proj-
                    ect. This method is more in-depth than qualitative risk analysis and relies on several
                    different tools to accomplish its goal.
                    Quotation From seller to buyer. Price is the determining factor in the decision-
                    making process.
                    RACI chart A RACI chart is a matrix chart that only uses the activities of responsible,
                    accountable, consult, and inform.
                    RAG rating An ordinal scale that uses red, amber, and green (RAG) to capture the
                    probability, impact, and risk score.
                    Receiver   The person who receives the message.
                    Referent The project team personally knows the project manager. Referent can also
                    mean that the project manager refers to the person who assigned him the position.
                    Refinement An update to the work breakdown structure.
                    Regression analysis This is a statistical approach to predicting what future values
                    may be, based on historical values. Regression analysis creates quantitative predictions
                    based on variables within one value to predict variables in another. This form of esti-
                    mating relies solely on pure statistical math to reveal relationships between variables
                    and to predict future values.
                    Reporting system A reporting system is usually a software program that can cap-
                    ture, store, and provide data analysis on the project. A good reporting tool allows the
                    project manager to take project information, such as percentage of work complete,
                    run the data through some earned value analysis, and then create reports to share
                    with the stakeholders.

                         Request for Proposal (RFP) From buyer to seller. Requests the seller to provide a
                         proposal to complete the procured work or to provide the procured product.
                         Request for Quote (RFQ) From buyer to seller. Requests the seller to provide a price
                         for the procured product or service.
                         Requirements documentation This documentation of what the stakeholders expect-
                         ed in the project defines all of the requirements that must be present for the work to be
                         accepted by the stakeholders.
                         Requirements management plan This subsidiary plan defines how changes to the
                         project requirements will be permitted, how requirements will be tracked, and how
                         changes to the requirements will be approved.
                         Requirements traceability matrix (RTM) This is a table that maps the requirements
                         throughout the project all the way to their completion.
                         Reserve analysis Cost reserves are for unknown unknowns within a project. The con-
                         tingency reserve is part of the project cost baseline, and is included as part of the project
                         budget.
                         Residual risks     Risks that are expected to remain after a risk response.
                         Resistant stakeholder status The stakeholder is aware of your project, but they aren't
                         keen to the changes your project will create
                         Resource breakdown structure (RBS) This is a hierarchical breakdown of the project
                         resources by category and resource type. For example, you could have a category of
                         equipment, a category of human resources, and a category of materials. Within each
                         category, you could identify the types of equipment your project will use, the types of
                         human resources, and the types of materials.
                         Resource calendar The calendar that documents which project resources are avail-
                         able for the project work and when they are available.
                         Resource-leveling heuristic A method to flatten the schedule when resources are
                         overallocated. Resource leveling can be applied using different methods to accomplish
                         different goals. One of the most common methods is to ensure that workers are not
                         overextended on activities.
                         Responsibility     A responsibility is the work that a role performs.
                         Responsibility assignment matrix (RAM) A RAM chart shows the correlation be-
                         tween project team members and the work they've been assigned to complete.
                         Reward     The project manager has the authority to reward the project team.
                         Risk A project risk is an uncertain event or condition that can have a positive or nega-
                         tive effect on the project.
                         Risk identification The systematic process of combing through the project, the proj-
                         ect plan, the work breakdown structure, and all supporting documentation to identify
                         as many risks that may affect the project as possible.

                    Risk management plan A project management subsidiary plan that defines how risks
                    will be identified, analyzed, responded to, and monitored within the project. The plan also
                    defines the iterative risk management process that the project is expected to adhere to.
                    Risk management planning The agreed-upon approach to the management of the
                    project risk processes.
                    Risk owners The individuals or entities that are responsible for monitoring and re-
                    sponding to an identified risk within the project.
                    Risk register The risk register is a centralized database consisting of the outcome of
                    all the other risk management processes, such as the outcome of risk identification,
                    qualitative analysis, and quantitative analysis.
                    Risk-related contractual agreements When the project management team decides to
                    use transference to respond to a risk, a risk-related contractual agreement is created
                    between the buyer and the seller.
                    Risk response audit An audit to test the validity of the established risk responses.
                    Risk response plan This subsidiary plan defines the risk responses that are to be used
                    in the project for both positive and negative risks.
                    Risk responsibilities    The level of ownership an individual or entity has over a proj-
                    ect risk.
                    Risk score The calculated score based on each risk's probability and impact. The ap-
                    proach can be used in both qualitative and quantitative risk matrixes.
                    Role This person is responsible for a specific portion of the project. Roles are usually
                    tied to job titles, such as network engineer, mechanical engineer, and electrician.
                    Rolling wave planning The imminent work is planned in detail, while the work in
                    the future is planned at a high level. This is a form of progressive elaboration.
                    Root cause identification Root cause identification aims to find out why a risk event
                    may be occurring, the causal factors for the risk events, and then, eventually, how the
                    events can be mitigated or eliminated.
                    Rough order of magnitude This rough estimate is used during the initiating pro-
                    cesses and in top-down estimates. The range of variance for the estimate can be from
                    -25 percent to +75 percent.
                    Rule of Seven A component of a control chart that illustrates the results of seven
                    measurements on one side of the mean, which is considered "out of control" in the
                    project.
                    Run chart A quality control tool that shows the results of inspection in the order in
                    which they've occurred. The goal of a run chart is first to demonstrate the results of a
                    process over time and then to use trend analysis to predict when certain trends may
                    reemerge.

                         Salience model Groups of stakeholders are mapped on a grid where their power, ur-
                         gency, and legitimacy are in relation to one another.
                         Sapir-Whorf hypothesis A theory that suggests there's a link between the language a
                         person (or culture) speaks and how that person or culture behaves in the world.
                         Scatter diagram A quality control tool that tracks the relationship between two vari-
                         ables. The two variables are considered related the closer they track against a diagonal
                         line.
                         Schedule baseline The expected timeline of the project. The difference between
                         the planned schedule and the experience schedule reveals schedule variances within the
                         project.
                         Schedule management plan A subsidiary plan in the project management plan. It
                         defines how the project schedule will be created, estimated, controlled, and managed.
                         Schedule milestones The project customer may have specific dates when phases of the
                         project should be completed. These milestones are often treated as project constraints.
                         Schedule performance index (SPI) Measures the project based on its schedule per-
                         formance. The formula is SPI = EV/PV.
                         Schedule variance (SV) The difference between the earned value and the planned
                         value. The formula is SV = EV - PV.
                         Scope baseline The scope baseline is a combination of three project documents: the
                         project scope statement, the work breakdown structure, and the WBS dictionary. The
                         creation of the project deliverable will be measured against the scope baseline to show
                         any variances from what was expected and what the project team has created.
                         Scope creep     Undocumented, unapproved changes to the project scope.
                         Scope validation The formal inspection of the project deliverables, which leads to
                         project acceptance.
                         Scoring models These models use a common set of values for all of the projects up
                         for selection. For example, values can be profitability, complexity, customer demand,
                         and so on.
                         Screening system      A tool that filters or screens out vendors that don't qualify for the
                         contract.
                         Secondary risks      New risks that are created as a result of a risk response.
                         Seller rating systems These are used by organizations to rate prior experience with
                         each vendor they have worked with in the past. The seller rating system can track per-
                         formance, quality ratings, delivery, and even contract compliance.
                         Sender The person who is sending the message.

                    Sensitivity analysis A quantitative risk analysis tool that examines each risk to deter-
                    mine which one has the largest impact on the project's success.
                    Sharing    A risk response that shares the advantages of a positive risk within a project.
                    Single source Many vendors can provide what your project needs to purchase, but
                    you prefer to work with a specific vendor.
                    Smoothing This approach smooths out the conflict by minimizing the perceived size
                    of the problem. It is a temporary solution, but can calm team relations and boisterous
                    discussions.
                    Soft logic The order of the activities doesn't necessarily have to happen in a specific
                    order. For example, you could install the light fixtures first, then the carpet, and then paint
                    the room. The project manager could use soft logic to change the order of the activities if
                    so desired. This is also known as discretionary dependency or preferential logic.
                    Sole source Only one vendor can provide what your project needs to purchase. Ex-
                    amples include a specific consultant, specialized service, or unique type of material.
                    Staffing management plan This is a subsidiary plan of the human resource manage-
                    ment plan. It specifically addresses how the human resource requirements will be met
                    in the project. It can address internal staffing, procurement of resources, or negotiations
                    with other projects for shared resources.
                    Stakeholder A person or group that is affected by the project or that may affect the
                    group. Stakeholders can be positive, negative, neutral in their attitude toward the proj-
                    ect success.
                    Stakeholder analysis Stakeholder analysis is a process that considers and ranks proj-
                    ect stakeholders based on their influence, interests, and expectations of the project. This
                    process uses a systematic approach to identify all of the project stakeholders, ranking
                    the stakeholders by varying factors, and then addressing stakeholders' needs, require-
                    ments, and expectations.
                    Stakeholder classification models Grids that rank their stakeholders influence in
                    relation to their interest in the project. There are several types of these models that are
                    used as part of stakeholder analysis. The most common models are the power/interest
                    grid, the power/influence grid, the influence/impact grid, and the salience model.
                    Stakeholder engagement The project manager and the project team aims to keep the
                    project stakeholders engaged and involved in the project to ensure that decisions, ap-
                    provals, and communications are maintained as defined in the stakeholder manage-
                    ment plan and the stakeholder management strategy.
                    Stakeholder identification Stakeholder identification is the process of ensuring that
                    all of the stakeholders have been identified as early as possible in the project. Stake-
                    holder identification ensures that all of the stakeholders are identified and represented,
                    and their needs, expectations, and concerns are addressed.

                         Stakeholder management Stakeholder management is a project management knowl-
                         edge area that focuses on four activities: identifying the project stakeholder, planning
                         on how to manage the stakeholders, managing the stakeholders, and controlling the
                         stakeholder engagement.
                         Stakeholder management plan The stakeholder management plan helps the project
                         manager and the project team define a strategy for managing the project stakeholders.
                         It helps to establish stakeholder engagement at the launch of the project, over the proj-
                         ect life cycle, and how to improve upon the level of engagement identified.
                         Stakeholder management planning Stakeholder management planning is the pro-
                         cess of creating a strategy to manage the stakeholders in the project. It's the analysis of
                         what the stakeholders want the project to do, how the stakeholders' wants align with
                         that of other stakeholders, and the prioritization of the stakeholders within the project.
                         Stakeholder notifications Notices to the stakeholders about resolved issues, ap-
                         proved changes, and the overall health of the project.
                         Stakeholder register The stakeholder register documents all of the stakeholders' in-
                         formation, positions, concerns, interests, and attitudes toward the project. The stake-
                         holder register should be updated as new stakeholders are identified or as stakeholders
                         leave the project.
                         Start-to-finish An activity relationship that requires an activity to start so that its suc-
                         cessor can finish. This is the most unusual of all the activity relationship types.
                         Start-to-start An activity relationship type that requires the current activity to start
                         before its successor can start.
                         Statistical sampling A process of choosing a percentage of results at random. For ex-
                         ample, a project creating a medical device may have 20 percent of all units randomly
                         selected to check for quality.
                         Status review meeting A regularly scheduled meeting to discuss the status of the proj-
                         ect and its progress toward completing the project scope statement.
                         Storming The project team struggles for project positions, leadership, and project
                         direction. The project team can become hostile toward the project leader, challenge
                         ideas, and try to establish and claim positions about the project work. The amount of
                         debate and fury can vary depending on if the project team is willing to work together,
                         the nature of the project, and the control of the project manager.
                         Strong matrix structure An organization where organizational resources are pooled
                         into one project team, but the functional managers have less project power than the
                         project manager.
                         Subnet A representation of a project network diagram that is often used for out-
                         sourced portions of projects, repetitive work within a project, or a subproject. Also
                         called a fragnet.

                    Subprojects A smaller project managed within a larger, parent project. Subprojects
                    are often contracted work whose deliverable allows the larger project to progress.
                    Sunk costs    Monies that have already been invested in a project.
                    Supportive stakeholder status The stakeholder is aware of your project, is happy
                    about the project, and hopes that your project is successful
                    SWOT analysis SWOT analysis is the process of examining the project from the per-
                    spective of each characteristic: strengths, weaknesses, opportunities, and threats.
                    System or process flowcharts Flowcharts that illustrate the flow of a process through
                    a system, such as a project change request through the change control system, or work
                    authorization through a quality control process.
                    Systems analysis A scope definition approach that studies and analyzes a system, its
                    components, and the relationship of the components within the system.
                    Systems engineering This project scope statement-creation process studies how a sys-
                    tem should work, designs and creates a system model, and then enacts the working sys-
                    tem based on the project's goals and the customer's expectations. Systems engineering
                    aims to balance the time and cost of the project in relation to the scope of the project.
                    Technical interfaces The project team identifies the disciplines and specialties that
                    the project will require to complete the project scope statement. The technical inter-
                    faces are the resources that will be doing the project work.
                    Technical, quality, or performance risks Technical risks are associated with new, un-
                    proven, or complex technologies being used on the project. Changes to the technology
                    during the project implementation can also be a risk. Quality risks are the levels set for
                    expectations of impractical quality and performance.
                    Template A previous project or a methodology that can be adapted for the current
                    project.
                    Three-point estimate An estimating technique for each activity that requires optimis-
                    tic, most likely, and pessimistic estimates to be created. Based on these three estimates,
                    an average can be created to predict how long the activity should take.
                    Time and materials contract A contract type in which the buyer pays for the time and
                    materials for the procured work. This is a simple contract, usually for smaller procure-
                    ment conditions. These contract types may contain a not-to-exceed clause, or the buyer
                    assumes the risk for cost overruns.
                    Time reporting system A system to record the actual time to complete project activities.
                    To-Complete Performance Index A formula to forecast the likelihood of a project to
                    achieve its goals based on what's happening in the project right now. There are two dif-
                    ferent flavors for the TCPI, depending on what you want to accomplish. If you want to
                    see if your project can meet the budget at completion, you'll use this formula: TCPI =
                    (BAC - EV)/(BAC - AC). If you want to see if your project can meet the newly created

                         estimate at completion, you'll use this version of the formula: TCPI = (BAC - EV)/(EAC
                         - AC).
                         Total float This is the total time an activity can be delayed without delaying project
                         completion.
                         Transference A risk response that transfers the ownership of the risk to another party.
                         Insurance, licensed contractors, or other project teams are good examples of transfer-
                         ence. A fee and contractual relationships are typically involved with the transference of
                         a risk.
                         Tree diagram Tree diagrams show hierarchies and decomposition of a solution, an or-
                         ganization, or a project team. The WBS and an org chart are examples of tree diagrams.
                         Trend analysis     The science of using past results to predict future performance.
                         Triple Constraints of Project Management Also known as the Iron Triangle. This
                         theory posits that time, cost, and scope are three constraints that every project has.
                         Unanimity      A group decision method where everyone must be in agreement.
                         Unaware stakeholder status The stakeholder doesn't know about the project, nor
                         how it might affect the stakeholder.
                         Value analysis As with value engineering, this approach examines the functions of
                         the project's product in relation to the cost of the features and functions. This is where,
                         to some extent, the grade of the product is in relationship to the cost of the product.
                         Value engineering This approach to project scope statement creation attempts to find
                         the correct level of quality in relation to a reasonable budget for the project deliverable
                         while still achieving an acceptable level of performance from the product.
                         Variable costs Costs that change based on the conditions applied in the project (the
                         number of meeting participants, the supply of and demand for materials, and so on).
                         Variance The difference between what was expected and what was experienced.
                         Variance at completion (VAC) A forecasting formula that predicts how much of a
                         variance the project will likely have based on current conditions within the project. The
                         formula is VAC = BAC - EAC.
                         WBS dictionary A WBS companion document that defines all of the characteristics of
                         each element within the WBS.
                         WBS template A prepopulated WBS for repetitive projects. Previous projects' WBSs
                         are often used as templates for current similar projects.
                         Weak matrix structure An organization where organizational resources are pooled
                         into one project team, but the functional managers have more project power than the
                         project manager.
                         Weighting system This takes out the personal preferences of the decision maker in
                         the organization to ensure that the best seller is awarded the contract. Weights are as-
                         signed to the values of the proposals, and each proposal is scored.
