Preface

Based on our experience in helping people to prepare for the Project
Management Professional (PMP(R)) Exam, we know that you will have questions,
such as "What topics are covered on the exam?" and "What are the questions
like?" Not surprisingly, some of the most sought-after study aids are practice test
questions and simulated exams, which are helpful in two ways.
   First, taking practice tests increase your knowledge of the kinds of questions,
phrases, terminology, and sentence construction that you will encounter on the
real exam; and second, taking practice tests provides an opportunity for highly
concentrated study by exposing you to a breadth of project management content
generally not found in a single reference source.
   We developed this specialty publication with one simple goal in mind--
that is, to help you study for and pass the PMP(R) certification exam. Because
the Project Management Institute (PMI(R)) does not sell past exams for
prospective certification purposes, the best option is to develop practice test
questions that are as representative as possible. And that is exactly what we
have done.
   This guide contains 40 practice multiple-choice questions for each of the
ten knowledge areas in PMI's A Guide to the Project Management Body of
Knowledge (PMBOK(R)) Guide Sixth Edition, We have also included a 200-question
representative practice test that is in the book in addition to simulated exams
based on this practice exam. The simulated exams are four hours, and a clock
shows the amount of time you have remaining to complete the exam. At the end,
you will see your score by process group and also according to our proprietary
algorithm. Our algorithm shows whether you were Above Target, Target, Below
Target, or Needs Improvement in each of the five process groups: Initiating,
Planning, Executing, Monitoring and Controlling, and Closing.
   As we have done in our other PMP(R) Exam Practice Test & Study Guide books,
we have included a plainly written rationale for each correct answer along with a
supporting reference list. Each answer also contains a reference to the PMI(R) PMP
Examination Content Outline, 2015. Other references are provided at the end of
this book.




                                                                                 vii
viii    Preface


           Earning the PMP(R) certification is a prestigious accomplishment but studying
        for it should not be difficult if you use the tools available.
           Good luck on the exam! We hope you are the next PMP.

                                                         Dr. Ginger Levin, PMP, PgMP

Online Practice Test

To access this practice test, please contact pmpsimulatedexam@ittoday.info. The
online test is four hours and has a clock that shows how much time you have
left in the four hours. Once you have answered all of the questions or the time
ends, you will be scored by domain and also through our proprietary algorithm
that assesses your strengths and weaknesses to identify the areas in which you
require further study.

Introduction

The PMP(R) exam contains 200 questions, of which 25 questions will not be
included in the pass/fail determination. These "pretest" items, as PMI(R) calls them,
will be randomly placed throughout the exam to gather statistical information
on their performance to determine their use for future exams. The questions on
the exam are distributed following process group in the PMI PMP Examination
Content Outline (ECO)--April 2015.

   13% or 26 questions relate to Initiating the Project
   24% or 48 questions relate to Planning the Project
   31% or 62 questions relate to Executing the Project
   25% or 50 questions relate to Monitoring and Controlling the Project
   7% or 14 questions relate to Closing the Project

   For the practice test in this book, we provide all 200 questions as if they
were real questions, and the percentages above are applied to the 200 questions.
There are no pretest questions in our practice exam. We also have linked each
question to a specific task in one of the domains in the ECO especially since
some of the questions on the PMP exam are based on the tasks in the ECO, and
some tasks are not covered in the A Guide to the Project Management Body of
Knowledge (PMBOK(R) Guide) Sixth Edition.
   There also are not a certain number of the scored 175 questions that you
must answer correctly. PMI(R) explains in its PMP Credential Handbook. It a score
based on proficiency levels in the answers in each of the five process groups
or domains. This approach means that you will learn whether you were Above
Target, Target, Below Target, or Needs Improvement in each process group.
   We do not know the algorithm PMI(R) uses to establish the proficiency levels.
Our simulated exam, therefore, scores each question equally, which means you
will learn the number of questions you answer correctly in each of the five
process groups. Obviously, your goal is to be Above Target, and it also is our
goal. In our on-line simulated exam, we have designed our own proprietary
algorithm, so you will see your score by domain in the four areas.
   To use the study guide effectively, work on one section at a time. It does not
matter which one you choose first. Then answer the 40 practice questions by

                                                                                  xvii

           knowledge area, recording your answers on the sheet provided. Finally, compare
           your answers with those in the answer key. The rationales provided should
           clarify any misconceptions you may have had, and the process group or domain
           designations will give you an understanding of the types of questions you might
           see on the exam that relate to those process groups.
              After you have finished answering the questions that follow each section, it is
           time to take the completely rewritten on-line test and the 200-question practice
           test in the book that has the number of questions by domain or process group in
           the ECO. Note your answers on the sheet provided, compare your answers to the
           answer key, and use the Study Matrix in the Appendix to determine what areas
           you need to study further.
              To access the on-line test please contact pmpsimulatedexam@ittoday.info.
           The on-line test has a clock that ticks down and shows you how much time you
           have left in the four hours for the exam. You can take the on-line test as often as
           you wish and see the questions in a different order.
              Our suggestion is to score at least 80% of the questions in our practice test
           and on-line test correctly before you take the PMP(R) exam.
              We also suggest that when you go to the testing center, you go with a
           completely positive attitude. By this time, you have done your very best to master
           the project management concepts you will see on the exam.

Practice Questions
   INSTRUCTIONS: Note the most suitable answer for each multiple-choice
   question in the appropriate space on the answer sheet.

 1. You work for a software development company that has followed the water-
    fall development model for more than 20 years. Lately, a number of custom-
    ers have complained that your company is taking too long to complete its
    projects. You attended a class on agile development methods and believe
    that if the company used the agile approach, it could provide products to cli-
    ents in a shorter time period. However, it would be a major culture change
    to switch from the waterfall methodology to the agile approach and to train
    staff members in this new approach. You mentioned this idea to the director
    of the PMO, and although she liked the idea, she would need approval from
    the company's portfolio review board to move forward with it. She sug-
    gested that you document this idea in a--
   a.   Business need description
   b.   Product scope description
   c.   Project charter
   d.   Business case

 2. You are managing a large project with 20 key internal stakeholders, eight
    contractors, and six team leaders. You must devote attention to effective
    integrated change control. This means you are concerned primarily with--
   a. Reviewing, approving, and managing changes
   b. Maintaining baseline integrity, integrating product and project scope, and
      coordinating change across knowledge areas
   c. Integrating deliverables from different functional specialties on the project
   d. Establishing a change control board that oversees the overall project
      changes
                                                                                  1
2    PMP(R) Exam Preparation: Test Questions, Practice Test, and Simulated Exam


           3. You plan to hold a series of meetings as you execute the project plan. While
              different attendees will attend each meeting, a best practice to follow is to:
              a. Group stakeholders into categories to determine which ones should
                 attend each meeting
              b. Ensure the attendees have a defined role
              c. Be sensitive to the fact that stakeholders often have very different
                 objectives and invite them to determine the meeting's agenda
              d. Recognize that roles and responsibilities may overlap so focus on holding
                 meetings primarily for decision making

           4. You are the project manager in charge of developing a new shipping
              container for Globus Ocean Transport, which needs to withstand winds
              of 90 knots and swells of 30 meters. In determining the dimension of the
              container and the materials to be used in its fabrication, you convene a
              group of knowledgeable professionals to gather initial requirements, which
              will be included in the--
              a.   Project charter
              b.   Bill of materials
              c.   WBS
              d.   Project Statement of Work

           5. You have assembled a core team to develop the project management plan
              for the next generation of fatigue fighting drugs. The science is complex,
              and the extended team of researchers, clinicians, and patients for trials
              exceeds 500 people. In your plan you will be including a number of
              components, one of which is the life cycle. Of the following which is the
              most appropriate life cycle to select
              a.   Predictive
              b.   Iterative
              c.   Incremental
              d.   Hybrid

           6. When you established the change control board for your avionics project,
              you established specific procedures to govern its operation. The procedures
              require all approved changes to baselines to be reflected in the--
              a.   Performance measurement baseline
              b.   Change management plan
              c.   Quality assurance plan
              d.   Project management plan
                                                       Project Integration Management    3


 7. You are beginning a new project staffed with a virtual team located across
    five countries. To help avoid conflict in work priorities among your team
    members and their functional managers, you ask the project sponsor to
    issue a--
   a. Memo to team members informing them that they work for you now
   b. Project charter
   c. Memo to the functional managers informing them that you have authority
      to direct their employees
   d. Human resource management plan

 8. The benefit of Manage Project Knowledge is to--
   a.   Leverage prior organizational knowledge
   b.   Prepare a lessons-learned register
   c.   Create new knowledge to achieve project objectives
   d.   Contribute to organizational learning

 9. Interpersonal and team skills are used throughout project management.
    Your company is embarking on a project to completely eliminate defects
    in its products. You are the project manager for this project, and you are
    developing your project charter. To assist you, which of the following
    interpersonal and team skills do you plan to use--
   a.   Surveys
   b.   Brainstorming
   c.   Meeting management
   d.   Focus groups

10. The Direct and Manage Project Work process truly is important in project
    management. It affects many other key processes and uses inputs from
    others. Working with your team at its kickoff meeting, you explain the key
    benefit of this process is to--
   a.   Implement approved changes
   b.   Provide overall management of the project work
   c.   Lead and perform activities in the project management plan
   d.   Perform activities to accomplish project objectives

          11. You are managing a project in an organization characterized by rigid
              rules and policies and strict supervisory controls. Your project, sponsored
              by your CEO who is new to the company, is to make the organization
              less bureaucratic and more participative. You are developing your project
              management plan. Given the organization as it now is set up, as you prepare
              your plan, you can use which of the following organizational process
              assets--
              a.   Guidelines and criteria
              b.   Project management body of knowledge for your industry
              c.   Organizational structure and culture
              d.   The existing infrastructure

          12. You are fairly new to managing a project but have been a team member for
              many years. You are pleased you were selected to manage your company's
              2022 model line of hybrid vehicles. You are now planning your project and
              have been preparing the subsidiary plans as well. You realize some project
              documents also are required to help manage your project. An example of
              one that you believe will be especial helpful is the--
              a.   Business case

          13. You work for a telecommunications company, and when developing a
              project management plan for a new project, you found that you must tailor
              some company processes because the product is so different than those
              products typically produced by your company. Even so, you will consider as
              you prepare your project management plan--
              a.   Standard policies, processes, and procedures
              b.   Stakeholder risk tolerances
              c.   Expert judgment
              d.   Structure of your company

          14. You are implementing a project management methodology for your
              company that requires you to establish a change control board. Which one
              of the following statements best describes a change control board?
              a.   Recommended for use on all (large and small) projects
              b.   Used to review, approve, or defer change requests
              c.   Managed by the project manager, who also serves as its secretary
              d.   Reviews configuration management activity

15. An automated tool, project records, performance indicators, data bases, and
    financials are examples of items in--
   a.   Organizational process assets
   b.   Project management information systems
   c.   Project management planning approaches
   d.   The tools and techniques for project plan development

16. You realize that projects represent change, and on your projects, you always
    seem to have a number of change requests to consider. In your current
    project to manage the safety of the nation's cheese products and the testing
    methods used, you decided to prepare a formal change management plan.
    An often-overlooked type of change request is--
   a.   Adding new subject matter experts to your team
   b.   Updates
   c.   Work performance information
   d.   Enhancing the reviews performed by your project's governance board

17. You have been directed to establish a change control system for your
    company, but you must convince your colleagues to use it. To be effective,
    the change control system must include--
   a. Procedures that define how project documents may be changed
   b. Specific change requests expected on the project and plans to respond to
      each one
   c. Performance reports that forecast project changes
   d. A description of the functional and physical characteristics of an item or
      system

18. You are working on the next generation of software for mobile phones for
    your telecommunications company. While time to market is critical, you
    know from your work on other projects that management reviews can be
    helpful and plan to use them on your project. You are documenting them as
    part of your--
   a.   Governance plan
   b.   Change management plan
   c.   Performance reviews
   d.   Project management plan

          19. Your cost control specialist has developed a budget plan using cost / benefit
              analysis for your project to add a second surgical center to the Children's
              Hospital. As you analyze cash flow requirements, you notice that cash flow
              activity is high. Your business case, which was approved, showed the need
              for financial resources would be great so you decided to prepare a benefit
              realization plan for your executives, team, and stakeholders. The purpose of
              this plan in conjunction with the project management plan is to--
              a.   Provide the basis to measure success
              b.   Show key roles and responsibilities
              c.   Address options for opportunities
              d.   Describe the business value resulting from the project

          20. You are project manager for a systems integration effort and need to procure
              the hardware and software components from external sources. Your project
              is complex as you will have over 20 contractors involved. Your project team
              is experienced, and you will be working to continually demonstrate the
              project's benefits to the management team. You have found many do not
              read the detailed plans you prepare so you decided to--
              a. Use visual management tools
              b. Prepare a balanced scorecard
              c. Set key performance indictors in your charter and provide weekly reports
                 to focus on your progress
              d. Enable greater access to your project management information system

          21. Because your project is slated to last five years, you believe rolling wave
              planning is appropriate. It provides information about the work to be
              done--
              a.   Throughout all project phases
              b.   For successful completion of the current project phase
              c.   For successful completion of the current and subsequent project phases
              d.   In the next project phase

          22. Variance analysis is used throughout project management and is a useful
              tool and technique. Assume you decide to use it as you make decisions as
              to how to best monitor and control the work on your project. It is helpful
              because--
              a.   It   can serve as a basis to reject requested changes
              b.   It   can identify the reasons for a deviation
              c.   It   helps determine the type of corrective actions to use
              d.   It   provides an integrated perspective
                                                         Project Integration Management    7


23. You are managing a project to introduce a new product to the marketplace
    that is expected to have a very long life. In this situation, the concept of
    being temporary, which is part of the definition of a project,--
   a.   Does not apply because the project will have a lasting result
   b.   Does not apply to the product to be created
   c.   Recognizes that the project team will outlive the actual project
   d.   Does not apply because the project will not be short in duration

24. When closing a project, it is a best practice to--
   a.   Update the project documents
   b.   Prepare a sustainment plan for the project's benefits
   c.   Measure product scope against the project management plan
   d.   Review the project management plan

25. Many components of the project management plan are outputs of other
    processes. However, some other components are equally important and
    are prepared as part of the Develop Project Management Plan process. An
    example is the--
   a.   Performance management baseline
   b.   Scope baseline
   c.   Resource breakdown structure
   d.   Lessons learned register

26. You are responsible for a project management training curriculum that
    is offered throughout the organization. In this situation, your intangible
    deliverables are--

          27. Working on your project management training curricula project, you
              decided it would be beneficial to you to become an active member of the
              Project Management Institute as part of the objectives of your project is to
              ensure it is aligned with PMI(R)'s best practices. To complement PMI(R)'s Work
              Breakdown Structure Practice Standard, you learned PMI(R) was requesting
              volunteers to participate in development of a similar standard on the Scope
              Statement. You volunteered, and now the Standard is issued. This is an
              example of:
              a.   Improving your own competency as a project manager
              b.   Corrective action
              c.   Preventive action
              d.   A requirement for you to immediately update your project management
                   plan

          28. Ideally, a project manager should be selected and assigned at which point in
              the project life cycle?
              a.   During the initiating processes
              b.   During the project planning process
              c.   At the end of the concept phase of the project life cycle
              d.   Prior to the beginning of the development phase of the project life cycle

          29. Assume your seven-year project to build the next generation of airplanes
              that can fly anywhere in the world for 24 hours is complete. You now are
              closing the program. You have decided to use which of the following tools
              and techniques to assist you in this final process--
              a.   Regression analysis
              b.   Document updates
              c.   Benefit management plan
              d.   Issue log

          30. As you are working on your telecommunications project, even though you
              are using agile methods, you realize you are preparing an extensive amount
              of data and information. You regularly share data with your project team.
              Your last team meeting focused on the number of change requests and also
              the start and finish dates of activities in your schedule. They are examples
              of--
              a.   Key performance indicators
              b.   Work performance reports
              c.   Work performance data
              d.   Work performance information

31. Assume your program management plan has been approved, and you are
    now managing the work to be done to complete the project successfully.
    You realize your work is affected by the area in which you work, which is
    in pork safety and is affected by possible new regulations and tariffs in your
    country, which may limit your possible exports. You therefore are using
    your--
   a.   Requirements traceability matrix
   b.   Project charter
   c.   Resource breakdown structure
   d.   Geographic distribution of facilities

32. Assume your project to redesign your headquarters so it has state-of-the-art
    technology is complete, and you are in the closing phase. You decided to
    hold some meetings in order to--
   a. Confirm the deliverables have been accepted
   b. Transition your work to ongoing operations in your organization for
      maintenance
   c. Update project documents
   d. Prepare the final report

33. You are a personnel management specialist recently assigned to a project
    team working on a team-based reward and recognition system. The other
    team members also work in the human resources department. The project
    charter should be issued by--
   a.   The project manager
   b.   The client
   c.   A sponsor
   d.   A member of the PMO who has jurisdiction over human resources

34. Your project is proceeding according to schedule. You have just learned that
    a new regulatory requirement will cause a change in one of the project's
    performance specifications. This change request has been approved. You
    have had a number of change requests, such as this one, plus issues to
    handle. A key difference between the two is that--
   a. Issues involve all risks, while change requests are used for many actions
   b. Issues are found when work is being performed, but change requests can
      be submitted to modify documents, deliverables, or baselines
   c. Change requests and the actions taken to handle them become part of
      the issue log
   d. Issues are unexpected and handled by the project manager, while change
      requests are handled by a configuration management board

        35. Different types of project processes are used on projects. Some processes
            are used once at predetermined times, some are performed periodically on
            the project, and others are performed continuously. An example of the latter
            is--
            a.   Acquire resources
            b.   The project charter
            c.   Conduct procurements
            d.   Monitoring and controlling

        36. Assume your company is a leader in the market in production of cereal
            products. It has been in this market for over 50 years. You are the project
            manager for a new product that is a derivative from the company's core
            product. As you determine a life cycle for this project, you believe you
            should follow one that is--
            a.   Incremental
            b.   Predictive
            c.   Iterative
            d.   Adaptive

        37. Assume your project consisted of producing a new generation of cell phones
            that could access the internet from anyplace at any time. However, you
            learned today that your company acquired a competitor, and the competitor
            has a comparable product that is being manufactured. You were then told to
            terminate your project. In this situation you should--
            a.   Notify all stakeholders
            b.   Update the closure documents
            c.   Conduct an immediate review of the work packages
            d.   Provide performance evaluations of your team even though you worked
                 in a weak matrix

        38. On your project you want to avoid bureaucracy, so you adopt an informal
            approach to change control. The main problem with this approach is--
            a. There is no "paper trail" of change activity
            b. Regular disagreements between the project manager and the functional
               manager will occur
            c. There are misunderstandings regarding what was agreed upon by
               stakeholders
            d. There is a lack of sound cost estimating to assess the change's impact

39. Your project to establish a knowledge transfer process and a knowledge
    repository is complete. You performed a number of pilot tests, and people
    in your company are pleased with the results. You are receiving a promotion
    to become the company's first Chief Knowledge Officer once the project
    officially is closed. In doing so, you are following the company's activities for
    administrative closure, one of which is--
   a.   Measuring customer satisfaction
   b.   Measuring the project's benefits
   c.   Evaluating the change requests
   d.   Conducting quality control measurements

40. All projects involve some extent of change because they involve work that is
    unique in some fashion. Therefore, it is important that a project management
    plan includes a--
   a. Description of the change request process
   b. Configuration management plan
   c. Methodology for preventive action to avoid the need for excessive
      changes
   d. A work authorization system

Answer Key
 1. d. Business case
       The business case is used to provide the necessary information to
       determine whether a project is worth its investment. It is used to
       justify the project and typically contains business needs, analysis of
       the situation, identifying options for consideration about the business
       problem or opportunity, an evaluation, and a recommendation, which
       describes the plan to measure the benefits the project will deliver.

 2. a. Reviewing, approving, and managing changes
       Performing integrated change control consists of coordinating and
       managing changes across the project and communicating the decisions
       that are made. It involves managing changes to deliverables, documents,
       and the project management plan. Changes are considered in an
       integrated way and address risks that may arise from the change. It
       is performed throughout the project, and the change requests may
       impact product scope and project scope. Any stakeholder may request a
       change, and the extent of change control is determined by the project's
       complexity, contract requirements, and the environment in which
       the work is done. Once baselines are set, changes follow this formal
       process. [Monitoring and Controlling]

 3. b. Ensure the attendees have a defined role
       Meetings are a tool and technique used in Direct and Manage Project
       Work. Meetings may include kick-offs, technical, sprint or iteration,
       Scrum daily standups, steering group, decision making, project updates,
       or retrospective ones. If a meeting has too many participants, it will not
       be effective. Each attendee then should have an active role to be invited
       to each meeting. [Executing]

            4. a. Project charter
                   The project charter documents the project purpose; measurable
                   objectives/success criteria; high-level requirements; overall risk;
                   summary milestone schedule; preapproved financial resources; project
                   exit criteria; assigned project manager, responsibility, and authority
                   level; and the name and authority of the person who authorizes the
                   charter. It is the document used to formally authorize the project.

            5. d. Hybrid
                   Life cycles are series of phases projects go through from the start to
                   completion. This situation with the complexities and the 500-people
                   involved make the hybrid life cycle the preferred style to use. In a
                   hybrid life cycle, it combines predictive and adaptive. With predictive
                   in this case, scope, time, and cost are determined early, and in adaptive
                   with the defined scope are ones that are agile or change driven. With
                   over 500 people involved, changes will be numerous, and, in this
                   situation, regulatory approval also is required. Other life cycles are
                   iterative and incremental. [Planning]

            6. d. Project management plan
                   All baselines are part of the project management plan. During
                   monitoring and controlling, if there are changes because of the need
                   to take corrective or preventive action, they are reflected in the project
                   management plan. A change request is prepared, and it follows the
                   change control process to update the project management plan. Project
                   documents that are updated are the cost forecasts, issue log, lessons
                   learned register, risk register, and schedule forecasts. [Monitoring and

 7. b. Project charter
       Although the project charter cannot stop conflicts from arising, it can
       provide a framework to help resolve them, because it describes the
       project manager's authority to apply organizational resources to project
       activities. In addition, it documents the purpose of the project; project
       objectives; high-level requirements; high-level description of the project;
       overall project risks; summary milestones; preapproved financial
       resources; key stakeholder list; project approval requirements; project
       exit criteria; and the name and authority of the sponsor. [Initiating]

8. a. Leverage prior organizational knowledge
       In the Manage Project Knowledge process, its benefits are to leverage
       prior organizational knowledge to produce or improve the project
       outcomes, and to ensure knowledge created by the project is used
       to support organizational operations and future projects or phases.

 9. c. Meeting management
       Meeting management is an example of interpersonal and team skills
       used in developing the project charter. It involves preparing an agenda,
       ensuring a representative from each stakeholder group is invited,
       and preparing and sending follow-up notes and action items. Other
       interpersonal and team skills used are conflict management and
       facilitation. [Initiating]

10. b. Provide overall management of the project work
       While all of the answers apply to the Direct and Manage Project Work
       process, the key benefit is that it involves providing overall management
       of the work of the project and deliverables to improve the probability of
       project success. In this question, the key words were "the key benefit".
       Had the question instead asked about the purpose of the project,
       answer c would have been the correct choice. [Executing]

          11. a. Guidelines and criteria
                   While you are managing a different type of project, the organization
                   has managed projects before and therefore may have as part of
                   its organizational process assets a project management template,
                   which sets forth guidelines and criteria to tailor the organization's
                   processes to satisfy specific needs of the project. In addition, project
                   closure guidance or requirements, such as the product validation and
                   acceptance criteria, may be part of organizational process assets for use
                   in the template for the project management plan. [Planning]

          12. d. Assumptions log
                   The assumptions log is used to record all assumptions and constraints
                   in the project life cycle. Assumptions are factors in the planning process
                   considered to be true, real, or certain even if proof or demonstration
                   is not available. This log is an output from the Develop Project Charter
                   process. It includes high-level and operational assumptions in the
                   business case as well as lower-level and task assumptions that are
                   generated during the project such as specifications, estimates, the
                   schedule, or risks. It is one of the project documents used during the
                   project along with the project management plan and its subsidiary
                   plans. [Initiating and Planning]

          13. a. Standard policies, processes, and procedures
                   Standard policies, processes, and procedures are an organizational
                   process asset to consider as the project management plan is developed.
                   They are one of several organizational process assets that can influence
                   the preparation of the preparation of the project management plan.

14. b. Used to review, approve, or defer change requests
       Change control meetings are held on some projects with a change
       control board. This board reviews the change requests and approves,
       rejects, or defers them. The meeting assesses the impact of the
       change. It also may discuss alternatives to consider. Then the decision
       is communicated to the request owner or group. This board may
       review configuration items, but it is not mandatory. Configuration
       management may be handled by a different board. Regardless, roles
       and responsibilities need to be defined and agreed upon by appropriate
       stakeholders and are part of the change management plan. [Monitoring
       and Controlling]

15. b. Project management information systems
       The items listed are part of these systems, a tool and technique in both
       processes. In Direct and Manage Project Work, it is a tool and technique
       providing access to information technology software tools, such as
       scheduling software tools, work authorization systems, configuration
       management systems, information collection and distribution systems,
       and interfaces to other systems in the organization. It may include
       automated gathering and reporting on key performance indicators. In
       Manage Program Knowledge, the PMIS also is a tool and technique
       and often includes a document management system. In Monitor and
       Control Project Work, it also includes scheduling, cost; and resourcing
       tools, performance indicators, data bases, project records, and financial
       information. [Executing and Monitoring and Controlling]

16. b. Updates
       Change requests may include corrective actions, preventive actions,
       defect repairs, or updates. Updates are changes to formally controlled
       project documents or plans to reflect modified or additional ideas or
       content. [Executing]

           17. a. Procedures that define how project documents may be changed
                   A change control system is set of procedures that describes how
                   modifications to the project deliverables and documentation are
                   managed and controlled. Changes may be requested by any stakeholder
                   involved with the project. Change requests may lead to different types
                   of action and may or may not impact the project's baselines. It is
                   necessary to identify changes, document them into a change request,
                   decide on the change, and verify the approved changes are registered,
                   assessed, approved, tracked, and their results are communicated to
                   stakeholders. They may be initiated from inside or outside of the project
                   and may be optional or legally mandated. [Monitoring and Controlling]

          18. d. Project management plan
                   The project management plan describes how the project will be
                   executed, monitored and controlled, and closed. It integrates and
                   consolidates subsidiary plans and baselines and other information such
                   as project documents needed to manage the project. It also contains
                   other items including information on management reviews to determine
                   if progress is as planned or if preventative or corrective action is
                   needed. [Planning]

          19. d. Describe the business value resulting from the project
                   The project benefits management plan documents how and when the
                   project benefits will be delivered and the methods to measure the
                   benefits. Benefits are outcomes of actions, behaviors, products, services,
                   or results that provide value to the organization and the project's
                   intended beneficiaries. In developing this plan, it uses the data in the
                   business case, and the cost/benefit analysis in the two documents
                   shows the estimate of the costs compared to the value of the benefits
                   the project will realize. This benefit management plan along with
                   the project management plan describe how the business value of the
                   project is part of the organization's ongoing operations. It includes the
                   metrics to use to verify the business case and the project's success.

20. a. Use visual management tools
        Visual management tools increasingly are used in project integration
        management rather than written plans and other documents. The
        purpose is to capture and oversee those aspects of the project considered
        critical. When key project elements are visible to the entire team and to
        management, they provide a real-time overview of the project's status,
        facilitate knowledge transfer, and empower team members and other
        stakeholder to help identify and resolve issues. [Planning]

21. c. For successful completion of the current and subsequent project phases
        Rolling wave planning provides progressive detailing of the work to be
        accomplished throughout the life of the project, indicating that planning
        and documentation are iterative and ongoing processes. Through this
        approach, where a more general and high-level plan is available, more
        detailed planning is executed for appropriate time windows as new
        work activities are to begin, and resources are to be assigned. The
        work in the near term then is planned in detail, while future work is
        planned at a higher level. It is especially useful on longer projects. As
        an example, in decomposing your work breakdown structure (WBS),
        it may not be possible on large and long projects, and you may need
        to wait until the project is further along until the complete WBS is
        finished; rolling wave planning then is used. In defining activities, it is
        also a tool and technique to plan the near-term activities with the work
        to be done in the future and planned at a high level. It has similarities
        to a scaled agile framework. [Planning]

22. d. It provides an integrated perspective
        The purpose of variance analysis is to review the differences for
        variances between planned and actual performance. It is used
        throughout project management. In Monitoring and Controlling Project
        Work, it is used to review the variances from an integrated perspective.
        To do so cost, time, and resource variances are used in relation to
        one another. It enables an opportunity to have an overall view of
        the variance on the project such that the project manager then can
        determine the appropriate preventive or corrective actions to be taken.

          23. b. Does not apply to the product to be created
                   A project is completed when its objectives have been achieved
                   by producing deliverables, or when they are recognized as being
                   unachievable, and the project is terminated, or when the need for the
                   project no longer exists. Thus, the concept of temporary applies to the
                   project life cycle--not the product life cycle. Further, temporary does
                   not necessarily mean the project's duration is short as it refers to the
                   project's engagement and its longevity. It recognizes projects have a
                   definite beginning and an end. It also does not typically apply to the
                   product, service, or result as some projects are undertaken to create
                   a lasting outcome with social, economic, material, or environmental
                   impacts that far outlive the project. A national monument is an example
                   of a deliverable that may last for centuries. [Planning]

          24. d. Review the project management plan
                   In closing the project, it is necessary to ensure that the project work
                   is completed, and the project has met its objectives. To ensure this
                   is done, the project manager reviews the project management plan.

          25. a. Performance measurement baseline
                   The performance measurement baseline is an example of an additional
                   component prepared in this process. It integrates the scope, schedule,
                   and cost plan to compare the project work against project execution to
                   measure and integrate performance. Other components are a change
                   management plan, a configuration management plan, the project life
                   cycle, the development approach, and management reviews. The scope
                   baseline is one of three baselines with the other two time and cost.
                   Answers c and d are other documents prepared, which are not part of

26. a. Employees who can apply the training effectively
        Most deliverables are tangible, such as buildings or roads, but intangible
        deliverables also can be provided and may be even more important.
        Deliverables are any unique or verifiable product, result, or capability to
        perform a service required to complete a process, phase, of the project.
        Deliverables can include components of the project management plan.
        The output of a process often results in an input to another process
        or a deliverable. Deliverables are outputs of the Direct and Manage
        Project Work process. It is recommended that change control be applied
        to the first version of a deliverable, and multiple versions or editions
        of the deliverable then are controlled and supported by configuration
        management. [Executing]

27. b. Corrective action
        When you volunteered, you signed a confidentiality statement, so
        you could not disclose what was under way on this activity. Now the
        Standard has been issued, and to stay in alignment with PMI(R)'s best
        practices, you need to issue a change request based on corrective action
        to realign the performance of the work of your project with your project
        management plan. [Executing]

28. a. During the initiating processes
        When the project manager is selected and assigned to the project during
        initiation, several of the usual start-up tasks for a project are simplified.
        If assigned early, the project manager can participate in development
        of the project charter. Some project managers are involved even earlier
        in evaluation and analysis activities. When early involvement is done,
        the project manager can consult with executives and business leaders
        on ideas to advance organizational objectives, improve organizational
        performance, or in meeting customer needs. This early involvement
        enables the project manager to assist business analysts, help develop
        the business case, help realize business benefits from the project, and
        participate in some aspects of portfolio management. [Initiating]

                 Regression analysis is a tool and technique in Close Project or Phase
                 under data analysis. It analyzes the interrelationships between
                 different project variables that contributed to the project's outcomes to
                 improve performance on future projects. Other data analysis tools and
                 techniques are document analysis, trend analysis, and variance analysis.

        30. c. Work performance data
                 Work performance data are the raw observations and measurements
                 identified during activities performed to carry out the work of the
                 project. Other examples are the reported percent of work physically
                 completed, quality and technical performance measures, actual
                 costs, and actual durations. It is important to note that the PMBOK(R)
                 recognizes that the terms data and information are used interchangeably
                 in practice, which can lead to confusion among stakeholders. It has
                 therefore set up a classification system of work performance data,
                 work performance information, and work performance reports. Work
                 performance information is performance data collected in various
                 controlling processes, and work performance reports are physical or
                 electronic representation of work performance information compiled in
                 project documents. [Executing]

                 to the deliverables that satisfy them and helps to focus on the outcome
                 of the project. It helps ensure each requirement has business value
                 since it is linked to the business and organizational objectives.

32. a. Confirm the deliverables have been accepted
       Meetings are a tool and technique in Close Project Phase. They are used
       to confirm the deliverables have been accepted and to validate the exit
       criteria have been met, and to formalize contract completion. They also
       are used to evaluate stakeholder satisfaction, to gather lessons learned,
       to transfer knowledge, and to celebrate success. [Closing]

33. c. A sponsor
       The project charter should be issued by a project initiator or sponsor
       who formally authorizes the project and provides the project manager
       with the authority to apply organizational resources to project activities.
       The sponsor may be a person or a group and is accountable for
       enabling success, providing resources and support for the project. The
       project charter should not be issued by the project manager, although,
       the project manager can assist in its development. [Initiating]

       PMI(R) PMP Examination Content Outline, 2015, Initiating, 5, Task 6

34. b. Issues are found when work is being performed, but change requests
       can be submitted to modify documents, deliverables, or baselines
       Issues and change requests are tools and techniques used in Direct and
       Manage Project Work. Issues can occur during the project's life cycle, as
       the project manager faces problems, gaps, inconsistencies, and conflicts,
       and an issue log is used to record and track them. Change requests are
       used to modify any document, deliverable, or baseline. Change requests
       are submitted, which can modify policies, procedures, project or
       product scope, project cost or budget, the project's schedule, or project
       results. They are processed for review and disposition in the Integrated
       Change Control Process. They may include corrective or preventive
       action, defect repair, or updates. [Executing]

          35. d. Monitoring and controlling
                   Monitoring and controlling is an example of a phase that is performed
                   continuously during the project. Many of the processes in it are
                   performed from the start of the project until it is closed. The charter is
                   an example of the output of the Initiating process, which is performed
                   once. Acquiring resources are performed when resources are needed,
                   similar to conducting procurements. [Monitoring and Controlling]

                   Controlling, 9, Task 1

          36. b. Predictive
                   A predictive life cycle is recommended when the project's scope, time,
                   and cost to deliver it are determined in the project life cycle as early as
                   possible. Any changes to its scope are monitored carefully. A predictive
                   life cycle may be called a waterfall life cycle. [Planning]
                   PMI(R), PMBOK(R) Guide, 2017, 19
                   PMI(R) PMP Examination Content Outline, 2015, Planning, 7, Task 11

          37. b. Update the closure documents
                   Even though the project was terminated early, it is the project manager's
                   responsibility to update the project closure documents. The purpose
                   is to indicate why the project was terminated and formalize, if
                   appropriate, any finished or unfinished deliverables to others. [Closing]

          38. a. There is no "paper trail" of change activity
                   An informal approach means there is a lack of documentation as to
                   the change process and activities. The benefit of the Perform Integrated
                   Change Control process is it allows for documented changes to be
                   considered in an integrated way, and in doing so, it addresses overall
                   project risk, which may arise without considering the overall project
                   objectives or plans. [Monitoring and Controlling]

39. a. Measuring customer satisfaction
       The administrative closure procedures involve a number of activities,
       one of which is to measure stakeholder satisfaction. The other
       administrative activities involve: activities and actions needed to satisfy
       completion or exit criteria for the project; activities related to completing
       contractual agreements applicable to the project; activities necessary to
       collect project records, audit successes or failures, manage knowledge
       sharing and transfer, identify lessons learned, and archive information
       for future use; actions or activities to transfer the result of the project
       to operations; and collecting suggestions for improving policies and
       procedures for the organization and sending them to the responsible
       unit. [Closing]

40. b. Configuration management plan
       A configuration management plan is part of a project management
       plan. It describes how information and items of the project and which
       items will be recorded and updated. The purpose is to ensure the
       product, service, or result of the project are consistent and/or operative.

Project Scope Management


Practice Questions
   INSTRUCTIONS: Note the most suitable answer for each multiple-choice
   question in the appropriate space on the answer sheet.


 1. Progressive elaboration of product characteristics on your project must be
    coordinated carefully with the--
   a.   Project scope definition
   b.   Project stakeholders
   c.   Scope change control system
   d.   Customer's strategic plan

 2. You are examining multiple scope change requests on a project you were
    asked to take over because the previous project manager decided to resign.
    To assess the degree to which the project scope will change, you need to
    compare the requests to which project document?
   a.   Preliminary scope statement
   b.   WBS
   c.   Change management plan
   d.   Scope management plan




                                                                                 29
30  PMP(R) Exam Preparation: Test Questions, Practice Test, and Simulated Exam


          3. You and your project team recognize the importance of project scope
             management to a project's overall success; therefore, you include only the
             work required for successful completion of the project. The first step in the
             Project Scope Management process is to--
             a. Clearly distinguish between project scope and product scope
             b. Prepare a scope management plan
             c. Define and document your stakeholders' needs to meet the project's
                objectives
             d. Prepare your requirements documentation

          4. An example of an organizational process asset that could affect how project
             scope is to be managed is--
             a.   Personnel administration
             b.   Marketplace conditions
             c.   Historical information
             d.   Organizational culture

          5. You are managing a complex project for a new method of heating and air
             conditioning in vehicles. You will use both solar and wind technologies in this
             project to reduce energy costs. Therefore, you must ensure that the work of
             your project will result in delivering the project's specified scope, which means
             that you should measure completion of the product scope against the--
             a.   Scope management plan
             b.   Business requirements
             c.   Solution requirements
             d.   Requirements management plan

          6. A key tool and technique used in Define Scope is--
             a.   Templates, forms, and standards
             b.   Decomposition
             c.   Multi-criteria decision analysis
             d.   Project management methodology

          7. Each organization is unique and has different ways to define its products,
             services, and results. You are working on your project to develop a new
             product using disruptive technologies to reduce traffic in your city. You
             are working to define your project's scope, and you have a large team plus
             interested stakeholders. A tool and technique that may be helpful is--
             a.   Sensitivity analysis
             b.   Decision trees
             c.   Facilitation
             d.   Lateral thinking
                                                          Project Scope Management    31


 8. Assume you and your team prepared your project's scope statement, and it
    was approved by your sponsor and your governance committee. However,
    you also need to update some project documents as an output of the Define
    Scope process. One example is--
   a.   Value engineering
   b.   Assumptions log
   c.   WBS Dictionary
   d.   Change log

 9. The document to evaluate whether requests for changes or additional work
    are contained within or outside the project's exclusion is provided by the--
   a.   Project management plan
   b.   Project scope statement
   c.   Project scope management plan
   d.   WBS dictionary

10. Rather than use a WBS, your team developed a bill of materials to define
    the project's work components. A customer review of this document
    uncovered that a scope change was needed, because a deliverable had not
    been defined, and it led to the need to write a change request. This is an
    example of a change request that is required because it is the result of--
   a.   An external event
   b.   A change to the scope baseline
   c.   A value-adding change
   d.   An error or omission in defining the scope of the project

11. Collecting requirements is critical in project scope management, but all the
    requirements may not be used as the project scope is defined. Assume once
    you defined your project's scope, you then began to develop your work
    breakdown structure. As you worked on it, you found it useful to review the--
   a.   Scope management plan
   b.   Requirements documentation
   c.   Requirements management plan
   d.   Requirements traceability matrix

12. Assume you are preparing the scope statement for your project. In it, you
    are describing the project's deliverables, assumptions, and constraints. You
    also want to include--
   a.   Project exclusions
   b.   The business need
   c.   Stakeholder expectations
   d.   Project management methodology
32      PMP(R) Exam Preparation: Test Questions, Practice Test, and Simulated Exam


          13. Assume you are working to collect the requirements for your project. As you
              do so, you realize your project's success is due to--
              a. Active stakeholder involvement
              b. Linking the requirements you collect to the requirement management
                 plan
              c. Conducting facilitated workshops with stakeholders
              d. Preparing a requirements document template that you and your team can
                 use throughout the Collect Requirements process

          14. You want to structure your project so that each project team member has a
              discrete work package to perform. The work package is a--
              a.   Work defined at the lowest level of the WBS
              b.   Task with a unique identifier
              c.   Required level of reporting
              d.   Task that can be assigned to more than one organizational unit

          15. Quality function deployment is one approach for collecting requirements.
              Assume that you have studied the work of numerous quality experts, such
              as Deming, Juran, and Crosby, and your organization has a policy that states
              the importance of quality as the key constraint of all project constraints. You
              and your team have decided to use quality function deployment on your
              new project to manufacture turbines that use alternative fuels. The first step
              you should use is to--
              a.   Determine the voice of the customer
              b.   Build the house of quality
              c.   Address the functional requirements and how best to meet them
              d.   Hold a focus group of prequalified stakeholders

          16. On the WBS, you have decided to structure it by phases of your project. In
              this approach--
              a.   Deliverables are at the third level
              b.   Subcomponents are at the first level
              c.   Major deliverables are at the second level
              d.   Project organizational units are at the third level
                                                           Project Scope Management    33


17. Change is inevitable on projects. The number of interested stakeholders,
    technology, the difficulty in obtaining resources, and the difficulty in
    motivating people to be on the team are just a few changes that may occur
    on projects. Projects also cause changes in the development of a new
    product, service, or result. The project manager wants to minimize changes
    on the project. Uncontrolled changes are often referred to as--
   a.   Rework
   b.   Scope creep
   c.   Configuration items
   d.   Emergency changes

18. You are going to be using a number of contractors on your project to
    produce a car that uses natural gas as its fuel supply since your country has
    an abundance of it available. You are working on preparing your WBS for
    this project as you have completed the scope statement. In your WBS, the
    most effective approach to use is to--
   a.   Link the WBS to the bill of materials
   b.   Integrate subcomponents
   c.   Use your organization's template
   d.   Focus on major deliverables

19. In Control Scope it is important to determine the cause of any unacceptable
    variance relative to the scope baseline. This can be done through--
   a.   Root-cause analysis
   b.   Control charts
   c.   Inspections
   d.   Data analysis

20. To assist your software development team in collecting requirements from
    potential users and to ensure that agreement about the stakeholders' needs
    exists early in the project, you decide to use an interpersonal and team
    skill. Numerous techniques are available, but you and your team choose a
    voting process to rank the most useful ideas for further prioritization. This
    approach is known as--
   a.   Brainstorming
   b.   Nominal group technique
   c.   Delphi technique
   d.   Affinity diagram

          21. You have been appointed project manager for a new project in your
              organization and must prepare a project management plan. You decide
              to prepare a WBS to show the magnitude and complexity of the work
              involved. No WBS templates are available to help you. To prepare the WBS,
              your first step should be to--
             a.   Determine the cost and duration estimates for each project deliverable
             b.   Identify and analyze the deliverables and related work
             c.   Identify the components of each project deliverable
             d.   Determine the key tasks to be performed

          22. You want to avoid scope creep on your project and are working hard to
              do so. Your sponsor has asked for regular reports as to how the project is
              performing according to the scope baseline. You decide to use--
             a.   Variance analysis
             b.   Inspection and peer review results
             c.   Work performance information
             d.   The impact analysis results of proposed change requests

          23. You are leading a project team to identify potential new products for your
              organization. One idea was rejected by management because it would not fit
              with the organization's core competencies. You now have a project to make
              your organization one that is comfortable with using disruptive technologies,
              which was approved. Now you are working on your scope statement and as
              you do so, it is helpful to consider--
             a.   The assumption log
             b.   Project life cycle definition
             c.   Marketplace conditions
             d.   Development approach

          24. Validate scope--
             a. Improves cost and schedule accuracy, particularly on projects using
                innovative techniques or technology
             b. Is the last activity performed on a project before handoff to the customer
             c. Documents the characteristics of the product, service, or result that the
                project was undertaken to create
             d. Differs from Perform Quality Control in that Validate Scope is concerned
                with the acceptance--not the correctness--of the deliverables
                                                            Project Scope Management    35


25. Although you and your team are actively working to control the scope of
    your project, change is inevitable on projects. You have had some change
    requests from your sponsor, team members, and other stakeholders. You
    have processed these change requests. This means you also need to update
    which of the following documents?
   a.   Scope management plan
   b.   Requirements traceability matrix
   c.   WBS
   d.   Scope statement

26. One approach that can be used to detect the impact of any change from the
    scope baseline on the project objectives is--
   a.   Requirements traceability matrix
   b.   Review of formal and informal scope control processes and guidelines
   c.   A formal configuration management plan
   d.   Well-documented requirements

27. Throughout the project, you are focusing on the Monitoring and Controlling
    process, which include Control Scope. You have processed some
    change requests and now also need to update some parts of the project
    management plan, one of which is the--
   a.   Requirements management plan
   b.   Lessons-learned register
   c.   Cost baseline
   d.   Requirements documents

28. Validate Scope is performed throughout the project. However, there are
    several outputs from the Validate Scope process, one of which is--
   a.   Inspection reports
   b.   Voting results
   c.   Work performance data
   d.   Deliverables that have not been formally accepted

29. Your project is now under way, and you are working with your team to
    prepare your requirements management plan. One component of this plan
    you want to include is--
   a. Metrics to use
   b. A set of procedures by which project scope and product scope may be
      changed
   c. Requirements traceability matrix
   d. Requirements documentation
36    PMP(R) Exam Preparation: Test Questions, Practice Test, and Simulated Exam


          30. You are the project manager on a systems engineering project designed to
              last six years and to develop the next-generation corvette for use in military
              operations. You and your team recognize that requirements may change
              as new technologies, especially in sonar systems, are developed. You are
              concerned that these new technologies may lead to changes in the scope of
              your product, which then will affect the scope of your project. Therefore to
              help you, you should prepare a--
              a.   Requirements traceability matrix
              b.   Requirements prioritization process
              c.   Configuration management system
              d.   Requirements management plan

          31. Your customer signed off on the requirements document and scope
              statement of your video game project last month. Today she stated she
              would like to make it an interactive game that can be played on a television,
              smart phone. and on a computer. This represents a requested scope change
              that at a minimum--
              a. Should be reviewed according to the Perform Integrated Change Control
                 process
              b. Results in a change to all project baselines
              c. Requires adjustments to cost, time, quality, and other objectives
              d. Results in a lesson learned

          32. While the Validate Scope process has some similarities with the Control
              Quality process, a key benefit of Validate Scope is--
              a.   It   formalizes acceptance of the project's deliverables
              b.   It   decreases the number of change requests
              c.   It   brings objectivity to the acceptance process
              d.   It   reduces the need for product reviews

          33. Modifications may be needed to the WBS and WBS dictionary because of
              approved change requests, which shows that--
              a.   Replanning is an output of Control Scope
              b.   Scope creep is common on projects
              c.   Rebaselining will be necessary
              d.   Updates are needed to the scope baseline
                                                           Project Scope Management    37


34. You and your team are documenting requirements on your project to control
    fatigue as people need to work more hours to keep up with the competition.
    You decided to set up categories for the requirements on your project.
    Temporary capabilities are an example of--
   a.   Stakeholder requirements
   b.   Transition requirements
   c.   Project requirements
   d.   Business requirements

35. You are working to collect the requirements for your project to eliminate
    the possibility of later scope creep. You have a variety of tools and
    techniques you can use. Assume you want to obtain early feedback on
    the requirements, and you have decided the most appropriate tool and

Answer Key
 1. a. Project scope definition
       Progressive elaboration of a project's specification must be coordinated
       carefully with scope definition. It elaborates the characteristics of the
       product, service, or result as defined in the charter and requirements
       documents. The scope statement, the major output of the Define Scope
       process, describes the project's scope, major deliverables, and constraints.
       This means it includes both project and product scope. [Planning]
       PMI(R), PMBOK(R) Guide, 2017, 154
       PMI(R) PMP Examination Content Outline, 2015, Planning, 6, Task 2

 2. b. WBS
       The WBS, along with the approved scope statement and the WBS
       dictionary, defines the project's scope baseline, which provides the basis
       for any changes that may occur on the project. Formal change control
       procedures should be used if the scope baseline requires change. It is a
       component of the project management plan. [Planning]
       PMI(R), PMBOK(R) Guide, 2017, 161
       PMI(R) PMP Examination Content Outline, 2015, Planning, 6, Task 2

 3. b. Prepare a scope management plan
       The work involved in the six Project Scope Management processes
       begins by preparing a scope management plan, which is a subsidiary
       plan for the project management plan. It documents how project scope
       will be defined, developed, monitored, controlled, and validated and
       describes the Project Scope Management processes from collecting
       requirements to control and provides guidance as to how scope will be
       managed throughout the project. [Planning]
       PMI(R), PMBOK(R) Guide, 2017, 131
       PMI(R) PMP Examination Content Outline, 2015, Planning, 6, Task 2

 4. c. Historical information
       Organizational process assets that can influence Plan Scope
       Management include formal and informal policies, procedures, and
       guidelines impacting project scope management. The lessons-learned
       repository is another example of an organizational process asset. The
       other answers are examples of enterprise environmental factors to
       consider. [Planning]

         5. c. Requirements management plan
                 Completion of the project scope is measured against the project
                 management plan, and completion of the product scope is measured
                 against the requirements. The requirements documents are an output
                 from the Collect Requirements process, and requirements may be
                 further classified in terms of business requirements, stakeholder
                 requirements, solution requirements, transition and readiness
                 requirements, project requirements, and quality requirements. Solution
                 requirements are further classified into technical requirements, which
                 are functional requirements related to the product, and nonfunctional
                 requirements, which describe the environmental conditions needed for
                 the product to be effective. [Planning]

         6. c. Multi-criteria decision analysis
                 The key purpose of the Define Scope process is to prepare the project
                 scope statement. In doing so, a number of tools and techniques can
                 be used, one of which is multi-criteria analysis, part of the decision
                 analysis tool and technique. It is a technique that uses a decision
                 matrix. The decision matrix provides a systematic analytical approach
                 to establish criteria, and it may include requirements, schedule, budget,
                 and resources. The purpose is to help refine the product and project
                 scope. [Planning]
                 PMI(R), PMBOK(R) Guide, 2017, 153
                 PMI(R) PMP Examination Content Outline, 2015, Planning, 6, Task 2

          7. c. Facilitation
                 It is easy to overlook the need for interpersonal and team skills
                 especially in processes such as Define Scope. The key words in
                 this question are a large team and interested stakeholders. In the
                 Define Scope process, an interpersonal and team skill that is used is
                 facilitation. It is used in workshops and working sessions with key
                 stakeholders, and each stakeholder may have different expectations
                 or areas of expertise, which can be beneficial. Facilitation then can
                 help obtain a cross functional and common understanding among the
                 stakeholders concerning project deliverables and any project or product
                 boundaries. [Planning]

8. b. Assumptions log
       The assumptions log is both an input to the Define Scope process
       and an output from it as a project document to update. As an input,
       it is a project document developed in Integration Management that
       identifies both assumptions and constraints about the project product,
       environment, stakeholders, and other factors that may influence
       product and project scope. As the scope statement is prepared,
       these assumptions and constraints are reviewed, and after the scope
       statement is finalized and approved, this log is an example of other
       project documents to update as ideas about assumptions and constraints
       may have changed during this process. Additional assumptions and
       constraints may be identified, and others originally identified may no
       longer be ones that will affect the product or project. [Planning]
       PMI(R), PMBOK(R) Guide, 2017, 165
       PMI(R) PMP Examination Content Outline, 2015, Planning, 6, Task 2

 9. b. Project scope statement
       Sections of the project's scope statement include the product scope
       description, deliverables, acceptance criteria, and project exclusions.
       Project exclusions identify generally what is excluded from the project,
       and states explicitly what is excluded from the project to help manage
       stakeholder expectations and to reduce scope creep. [Planning]
       PMI(R), PMBOK(R) Guide, 2017, 154
       PMI(R) PMP Examination Content Outline, 2015, Planning, 6, Task 2

10. b. A change to the scope baseline
       The scope baseline consists of the scope statement, the WBS, and
       the WBS Dictionary. Since a Bill of Materials was used instead of a
       WBS, a change request is required since a Bill of Materials provides
       a hierarchical view of the physical assemblies, subassemblies, and
       components needed to build a manufactured product. The WBS instead
       is a deliverable-oriented grouping of project components used to define
       the total scope of the project, providing a structured vision of what has
       to be delivered. The purpose of the Control Scope process is to monitor
       the project's status and that of the product and manage changes to the
       scope baseline. Its benefit is the scope baseline then is maintained
       during the project. Using a bill of materials where a WBS would be
       more appropriate may result in an ill-defined scope and subsequent
       change requests. [Monitoring and Controlling]

        11. b. Requirements documentation
                 In preparing the WBS, it is helpful to review two project documents,
                 one is the requirements documentation as the detailed requirements
                 define how individual requirements meet the project's business need.
                 The other document to review is the project scope statement. [Planning]
                 PMI(R), PMBOK(R) Guide, 2017, 157
                 PMI(R) PMP Examination Content Outline, 2015, Planning, 6, Task 2

        12. a. Project exclusions
                 The purpose of the scope statement is to describe the project scope,
                 deliverables, assumptions, and constraints, and it documents the entire
                 project and product scope. It also provides a common understanding
                 among stakeholders. In addition, it contains project exclusions or what
                 is excluded from the project. They are included to state explicitly what
                 is out of scope for the project, which then helps to manage stakeholder
                 expectations and to reduce scope creep. [Planning]
                 PMI(R), PMBOK(R) Guide, 2017, 154

        13. a. Active stakeholder involvement
                 Collecting requirements involves determining, documenting, and
                 managing stakeholder needs and requirements to meet the project's
                 objectives. As you work to collect requirements, active stakeholder
                 involvement is critical to overall success in the discovery and
                 decomposition of needs into both project and product requirements. It
                 also involves taking care in determining, documenting, and managing
                 requirements of the project's product, service, or result. [Planning]

        14. a. Work defined at the lowest level of the WBS
                 A work package is the work defined at the lowest level of the WBS. It is
                 used to estimate and manage the cost and duration of the work defined
                 at this level. [Planning]

15. a. Determine the voice of the customer
        Facilitation is a tool and technique in Collect Requirements. These are
        focused sessions with stakeholders to define product requirements.
        If conducted appropriately, they can quickly define functional
        requirements and reconcile stakeholder differences in an interactive
        way. Quality function development is an example of a facilitation
        technique as it is used to help determine critical characteristics for
        new product development. It begins by collecting customer needs and
        is also known as the voice of the customer. The next step is to sort
        these needs and prioritize them, so goals can be set to achieve them.

16. a. Deliverables are at the third level
        The WBS includes all work needed to be done to complete the project.
        The WBS structure can be set up using different approaches. If a phase
        approach is used, the phases of the project life cycle are shown at the
        second level of decomposition with product and project deliverables at
        the third level. [Planning]

        PMI(R) PMP Examination Content Outline, 2015, Planning, 6, Task 2

17. b. Scope creep
        Project scope creep is typically the result of uncontrolled changes in
        product or project scope without adjustments to time, cost, or resources.
        Scope control works to control the impact of any project scope changes,
        manage actual changes when they occur, and it is integrated with other
        control processes. Scope control then ensures all requested changes and
        recommended corrective or preventive actions are processed through
        the Perform Integrated Change Control process. [Monitoring and
        Controlling]

        18. b. Integrate subcomponents
                 The key words in this question are a number of contractors. This means
                 the WBS is developed by integrating subcomponents that are developed
                 from outside of the project team, such as the use of contractors. The
                 contractor or seller then develops its WBS from the supporting contract
                 WBS as part of the contracted work. The various subcomponents are
                 then incorporated to form the project's WBS. [Planning]

        19. d. Data analysis
                 Data analysis is the tool and technique for Control Scope. It consists
                 of variance analysis and trend analysis. Variance analysis compares
                 the baseline to the actual results and whether the variance is within
                 the accepted threshold. Its purpose is to see whether corrective
                 or preventive action is needed. Trend analysis evaluates project
                 performance over time to assess if performance is improving or is
                 deteriorating. [Monitoring and Controlling]

                 Controlling, 9, Task 1

        20. b. Nominal group technique
                 The nominal group technique enhances brainstorming with a voting
                 process, which is used to rank the most useful ideas for further
                 brainstorming or for prioritization. It is an interpersonal and team skill
                 as a tool and technique in Collect Requirements. In this approach,
                 people who are participating receive a question or problem, and each
                 person in silence generates and writes down his or her ideas. Next, the
                 moderator writes down the ideas and records them typically on a flip
                 chart. The people involved then discuss each recoded idea until they
                 understand it. Finally, people vote privately to prioritize the ideas and
                 may use a scale such as one to five, where one has the lowest interest,
                 and a five has the highest interest. Voting follows and may take several
                 rounds to reduce the number of ideas and focus on the ones with the
                 highest votes. After each round, the moderator tallies the votes, and the
                 ideas with the highest scores are selected. [Planning]

21. b. Identify and analyze the deliverables and related work
       Identifying and analyzing the deliverables and related work is the
       first step in the decomposition of a project, a tool and technique in
       the Create WBS process. Decomposition divides and subdivides the
       scope and deliverables into smaller parts that are more manageable.
       The deliverables should be defined in terms of how the project will be
       organized. For example, the major project deliverables may be used as
       the second level. Once the deliverables and related work are identified,
       the other steps in decomposition are to structure and organize the
       related work, decompose upper WBS levels into lower-level detailed
       components, develop and assign identification codes to the WBS
       components, and verify the degree of decomposition of the deliverable
       is appropriate. [Planning]

22. c. Work performance information
       Work performance information is an output of the Control Scope
       process. It includes correlated and contextualized information on how
       the project scope is performing against the scope baseline. It may
       include categories of changes received, identified scope variances and
       their causes, the impact on schedule or cost, and a forecast of future
       scope performance. [Monitoring and Controlling]

23. a. The assumption log
       Assumptions are factors that for planning purposes are considered to be
       true, real, or certain without proof or demonstration. They are listed in
       a separate log, which is one of the project documents that is an input
       to Define Scope. This log contains both assumptions and constraints
       concerning the product, project environment, and other factors that
       may influence the scope of the product or the project. This log is used

         24. d. Differs from Perform Quality Control in that Validate Scope is concerned
                with the acceptance--not the correctness--of the deliverables
                  Documentation that the customer or the sponsor has accepted
                  completed deliverables is an output of Validate Scope. Acceptance
                  criteria are formally signed off and approved by the customer or
                  sponsor. The formal documentation also is received from the customer
                  or sponsor acknowledging formal stakeholder acceptance of the
                  deliverables of the project. [Monitoring and Controlling]

          25. b. Requirements traceability matrix
                  Updates to project documents is an output of the Control Scope
                  process. One of these documents is the requirements traceability
                  matrix. It may need updates to reflect changes in requirements
                  documents. [Monitoring and Controlling]

         26. a. Requirements traceability matrix
                  It is an input to the Control Scope process as it helps to detect the
                  impact of any change or deviation from the scope baseline to the
                  project objectives. It also may provide the status of any requirements
                  being considered. [Monitoring and Controlling]

27. c. Cost baseline
       The cost baseline is included in the project management plan. It may
       need updates as part of the Control Scope process. Changes in the
       cost baseline are incorporated if there are approved scope changes, as
       in this question. Changes also may be needed to the cost baseline if
       there are changes in resources or cost estimates, both of which may be
       necessary from the scope changes. It some cases while controlling the
       scope, the cost variances that result may be so severe that a revised cost
       baseline is needed for a realistic basis for performance measurement.

28. d. Deliverables that have not been formally accepted
       In the Validate Scope process, change requests are an output. They
       include documentation of the completed deliverables that have not
       been documented and the reasons why they were not accepted. These
       deliverables then may be ones that require a change request for defect
       repair. The change requests are processed through the Integrated
       Change Control process. [Monitoring and Controlling]

29. a. Metrics to use
       The requirements management plan defines how requirements will be
       analyzed, documented, and managed. It includes among other items
       the metrics to be used and the rationale for using each of them. Some
       organizations refer to this plan as a business analysis plan. [Planning]

        30. a. Requirements traceability matrix
                 The requirements traceability matrix is an output of the Collect
                 Requirements process. It is a grid that links requirements from
                 their origin to the deliverables that satisfy them. It helps ensure the
                 requirements add business value and are not just nice to have features
                 as each requirement is linked to the business and project objectives. It
                 also tracks the requirements throughout the project life cycle. [Planning]

        31. a. Should be reviewed according to the Perform Integrated Change Control
               process
                 A requested change is an output from the Control Scope process. Such a
                 change should be handled according to the Perform Integrated Change
                 Control process and may result in an update to the scope baseline and
                 schedule baselines or other components of the project management
                 plan. [Monitoring and Controlling]

        32. c. It brings objectivity to the acceptance process
                 There are two key benefits of the Validate Scope process. One is that
                 it brings objectivity to the acceptance process. It also increases the
                 probability of final product, service, or result acceptance as it validates
                 each deliverable. It is performed throughout the project as needed.
                 Its purpose is one of the other possible answers in that it formalizes
                 acceptance of the completed project deliverables. [Monitoring and

33. d. Updates are needed to the scope baseline
       If the approved change requests have an effect on the project scope,
       the WBS, and the WBS dictionary, and the scope statement need to
       be revised ad reissued to reflect the approved changes following the
       Perform Integrated Change Control process. The schedule baseline
       also may require revision plus some other components of the project
       management plan. [Monitoring and Controlling]

34. b. Transition requirements
       There are a number of different ways to categorize requirements. This
       question is an example of transition and readiness requirements. They
       are temporary capabilities needed to transition from the current or as is
       stated to the desired future state. Examples include data conversion and
       training requirements. [Planning]

       PMI(R) PMP Examination Content Outline, 2015, Planning, 7, Task 11

35. b. Prototypes
       Prototypes are useful to obtain early feedback on requirements. They
       provide a model of the expected product before it is built. Then,
       stakeholders can experiment with the model for the final product
       instead of discussing abstract requirements for it. This approach
       supports progressive elaboration with iterative cycles of mock-ups, user
       experiments, feedback, and prototype revision. [Planning]

36. b. Epics are decomposed into user stories
       A WBS is prepared using agile with the difference being that epics are
       decomposed into user stories. An epic is a large amount of work with a
       common objective with examples a customer request or a feature. It serves
       to define user needs. Specific details then are the purpose of user stories.

           37. a. Is a critical component of the scope baseline
                   The project scope statement, along with the WBS, planning package,
                   and WBS dictionary, is a key input to Control Scope. They form the
                   scope baseline, which is compared to actual results to determine if a
                   change, corrective action, or preventive action is needed. [Monitoring

          38. c. Progressively elaborates characteristics
                   The project scope statement describes the deliverables and the
                   work required to create them. It contains both product and project
                   scope. It also provides a common understanding of the scope among
                   stakeholders. The product scope statement is a key component as it
                   expands on the level of detail in the project charter. They are both
                   progressively elaborated during the project. [Planning]

          39. a. To depict product scope
                   It is a tool and technique in Collect Requirements and is an example of
                   a scope model. The context diagram visually depicts the product scope
                   as it shows a business system (process, equipment, or computer, etc.) and
                   how people and other systems (actors) interact with it. The diagram shows
                   inputs to the business system, the people providing the inputs, outputs
                   from the business system, and people receiving the output. [Planning]

          40. b. WBS dictionary
                   The WBS dictionary typically includes a code of accounts identifier,
                   a description of work, assumptions and constraints, responsible
                   organization, a list of schedule milestones, associated schedule activities,
                   required resources, cost estimates, quality requirements, acceptance
                   criteria, technical references, and any additional information. It provides
                   detailed deliverable, activity, and scheduling information about each
                   component in the overall WBS dictionary of each project's scope
                   baseline. [Planning]

           5. Your company, which operates one of the region's largest chemical
              processing plants, has been convicted of illegally dumping toxic substances
              into the local river. The court has mandated that the required cleanup
              activities be completed by February 15. This date is an example of--
              a.   A key event
              b.   A milestone
              c.   A discretionary dependency
              d.   An external dependency

           6. You are managing a construction project for a new city water system. The
              contract requires you to use special titanium piping equipment that is
              guaranteed not to corrode. The titanium pipe must be resting in the ground
              a total of 10 days before connectors can be installed. In this example, the
              10-day period is defined as--
              a.   Lag
              b.   Lead
              c.   Float
              d.   Slack

            7. You are working to control your schedule. You have a number of tools
               and techniques you can use and may need to use several of them for
               effectiveness. You decide you want to track work remaining to be done so
               you will use--
              a.   Iteration burndown charts
              b.   Milestone charts
              c.   Applied schedule reserves
              d.   Calculation of multiple work package durations

 8. You are planning to conduct the team-building portion of your new project
    management training curriculum out-of-doors in the local park. You are
    limited to scheduling the course at certain times of the year, and the best
    time for the course to begin is mid-July. You are using the precedence
    diagramming method for your schedule. In it, you can show relationships
    between tasks in four ways, and the most common is--
   a.   Finish-to-start
   b.   Finish-to-finish
   c.   Start-to-start
   d.   Start-to-finish

 9. Project schedule development is an iterative process. If the start and finish
    dates are not realistic, the project probably will not finish as planned. You
    are working with your team to define how to monitor any schedule changes.
    You documented your decisions in which of the following?
   a.   Schedule change control procedures
   b.   Schedule management plan
   c.   Schedule risk plan
   d.   Service-level agreement

10. If, when developing your project schedule, you want to define a distribution
    of probable results for each schedule activity and use that distribution
    to calculate another distribution of probable results for the total project,
    the most common technique to use is--
   a.   What-if scenario analysis
   b.   Monte Carlo analysis
   c.   Linear programming
   d.   Concurrent engineering

11. Your lead engineer estimates that a work package will most likely require 50
    weeks to complete. It could be completed in 40 weeks if all goes well, but
    it could take 180 weeks in the worst case. What is the expected duration of
    the work package?
   a.   45 weeks
   b.   70 weeks
   c.   90 weeks
   d.   140 weeks

          12. Your customer wants the project to be completed six months earlier than
              planned. You believe you can meet this target by overlapping project
              activities. The approach you plan to use is known as--
              a.   Critical chain
              b.   Fast tracking
              c.   Resource leveling
              d.   Crashing

          13. Activity A has a duration of three days and begins on the morning of
              Monday the 4th. The successor activity, B, has a finish-to-start relationship
              with A. The finish-to-start relationship has three days of lag, and activity B
              has a duration of four days. Sunday is a non-workday. Such data can help to
              determine--
              a.   The total duration of both activities is 8 days
              b.   Calendar time between the start of A to the finish of B is 11 days
              c.   The finish date of B is Wednesday the 13th
              d.   Calendar time between the start of A to the finish of B is 14 days

          14. You can use various estimating approaches to determine activity durations.
              When you have a limited amount of information available about your
              project, especially when in the early phases, the best approach to use is--
              a.   Bottom-up estimating
              b.   Analogous estimating
              c.   Reserve analysis
              d.   Parametric analysis

          15. "I cannot test the software until I code the software." This expression
              describes which of the following dependencies?
              a.   Internal
              b.   Rational
              c.   Preferential
              d.   Mandatory or hard

          16. Working with your team to provide the basis for measuring and reporting
              schedule progress, you agree to consider the--
              a.   Schedule data
              b.   Network diagram
              c.   Schedule baseline

17. Your project schedule was approved. Management has now mandated
    that the project be completed as soon as possible. However, you do not
    think it is possible given resource constraints. In order to convince your
    management of your need for additional resources, you decide to use--
   a.   Resource manipulation
   b.   Resource breakdown structure
   c.   Critical chain scheduling
   d.   Resource leveling

18. Review the following network diagram and table. Of the various activities,
    which ones would you crash and in what order?

Answer Key
 1. d. 15
    The total duration for the path B-C-D-E-I is 15. The duration of any
    other path in the network is less than 15. You calculate the critical path
    in this question through the critical path method. You are doing so to
    estimate the minimum project duration and the amount of schedule
    flexibility in the network paths. To do so, determine the early start,
    early finish, late start, and late finish for all the activities by performing
    a forward and backward pass. The critical path represents the longest
    path in the network, which determines the shortest possible project
    duration. The early and late start and finish dates are not the schedule
    but show the time period when the activity could be executed. The
    critical path method calculates the amount of scheduling flexibility on
    logical network paths. The critical path method critical path normally
    is one that has zero total float on the critical path; note the word
    "normally". Activities on the critical path then are critical path activities.
     In the PMBOK, recognize the way PMI(R) has elected to show
    the critical path. PMI adds a day to the forward path as in Task B, it
    starts with a six and should be a five; the same is the case with Task
    C. It should start with a 5. The same is how the backward path is
    displayed. If you develop schedules as has just been described, it is the
    correct way to do so and is shown in the examples in these questions.
    However, for the purpose of the PMP exam, recognize the PMBOK
    approach may be used. [Planning]

                   Float is often called slack. The critical path activities have zero float.
                   Positive total float is caused if the backward path is calculated from a
                   schedule constraint that is later than the early finish date calculated by
                   the forward path. Negative total float is caused if a constraint on the late
                   date is violated by duration and logic. Once the total float for a network
                   path has been calculated then the free float, or the amount of time an
                   activity can be delayed without delaying the early start of a successor or
                   violating a schedule constraint, can be determined.

         5. b. A milestone
                 A milestone is a significant point or event in the project. Milestones
                 may be required by the project sponsor, customer, or other external
                 factors, such as those required by contract, for the completion of certain
                 deliverables. They are similar to schedule activities, with the same
                 structure and objectives, but they have zero duration as they represent
                 a moment in time. A milestone list is an output of Define Activities.

         6. a. Lag
                 For example, in a finish-to-start dependency with a 20-day lag, the
                 successor activity cannot start until 20 days after the predecessor has
                 finished. A lag is the amount of time that a successor activity will be
                 delayed with respect to a predecessor activity. The project management
                 team determines those dependencies that may require a lead or a lag
                 to best define the logical relationship. Keep in mind that leads [the
                 amount of time a successor activity can be advanced with respect to
                 a predecessor activity] and lags should not replace schedule logic, and
                 their use should be documented. [Planning]

          7. a. Iteration burndown charts
                 In Control Schedule, there are a number of tools and techniques you
                 can use. Iteration burndown charts are an approach as part of the data
                 analysis techniques to consider. These charts are useful to track the
                 work that remains to be completed in the iteration backlog to evaluate
                 the variance to an ideal burndown, which is based on work remaining
                 from iteration planning. In agile, release planning may be done, and
                 it determines the number of iterations or sprints in the release. This
                 approach enables the product owner and team to determine how much
                 needs to be developed, and the time it will take. Using the burndown
                 chart enables the likely variances at completion and actions to take
                 during the iteration. A trend line can be calculated to forecast the
                 completion of remaining work. [Monitoring and Controlling]

8. a. Finish-to-start
       While many schedules use all four approaches, especially on complex
       projects, the most common approach is finish to start. In it a successor
       activity cannot start until a predecessor activity has finished. The start-
       to-finish approach is rarely used, but you should recognize it could be
       used in case you have an exam question about it. [Planning]

 9. b. Schedule management plan
       The schedule management plan is part of the overall project
       management plan. Whether it is formal or informal, highly detailed or
       broadly framed, it is based on specific project needs. It is the output of
       the Plan Schedule Management process. It Includes appropriate control
       thresholds. It establishes criteria and activities to develop, maintain, and
       control the schedule. [Planning]

10. b. Monte Carlo analysis
       Simulation is a data analysis tool and technique in Develop Schedule. It
       involves calculating multiple work package durations with different sets
       of assumption, constraints, risks, issues, or scenario using probability
       distributions and other representations of uncertainty. It shows a
       probability distribution for the project of achieving a certain target date
       or project finish date. [Planning]

                 Use of the three-point estimates [optimistic, most likely, and pessimistic]
                 is a tool and technique used in Estimate Activity Duration. The
                 optimistic estimate is based on the duration of the activity given the
                 resources and their productivity, realistic estimates of their availability
                 for the activity, dependencies on other participants, and interruptions.
                 The optimistic estimate is the duration based on analysis of the best-
                 case scenario for the activity. The pessimistic estimate in contrast is the
                 duration based on the worst-case scenario for the activity. Depending
                 on the distribution of values in the range of the three estimates, the
                 expected duration can be calculated. A commonly-used formula is
                 the triangular distribution especially if there is insufficient historical
                 information or judgmental data. Using three-point estimates with an
                 assumed distribution provide an expected duration and clarify the range
                 of uncertainty around the expected duration. [Planning]

        12. b. Fast tracking
                 Fast tracking is a way to accelerate the project schedule. It is a schedule
                 compression tool and technique in the Develop Schedule process in
                 which activities or phases normally done in sequence are performed
                 in parallel for part of their duration. However, it may result in rework
                 and increased risk. Consider it for activities that can be overlapped to
                 shorten the project schedule. It only works effectively when activities
                 can be overlapped to shorten the project duration on the critical path.
                 Using leads in case of schedule acceleration may increase coordination
                 efforts between the activities concerned. It may increase the project's
                 costs and risks to quality. [Planning]

13. b. Calendar time between the start of A to the finish of B is 11 days
        The duration of A, which is three, is added to the duration of B, which
        is four, for a total of seven. The three days between the activities is
        lag and not duration. The lag is a constraint and must be taken into
        account as part of the network calculations, but it does not consume
        resources. The total time by the calendar is 11 days as counted from the
        morning of Monday the 4th. The lag occurs over Thursday, Friday, and
        Saturday. Sunday is a non-work day, so activity B does not start until
        Monday the 11th. Therefore, the calendar time is 11 days, and activity
        B ends on Thursday the 14th. In the Sequence Activities and Develop
        Schedule processes, leads and lags are a tool and technique [Planning]
        PMI(R), PMBOK(R) Guide, 2017, 192-193, 214
        PMI(R) PMP Examination Content Outline, 2015, Planning, 6, Task 4

14. b. Analogous estimating
        Analogous estimating is a tool and technique in Estimate Activity
        Durations. Although limitations exist with all estimating approach,
        analogous estimating is often used when there is a limited amount of
        information for the project. It uses historical information from a similar
        activity or a project. It uses data from a previous but similar project
        such as duration, budget, size, weight, and complexity to estimate
        the same data or measure for a future project. It is considered as a
        gross value estimating approach, which often is adjusted for known
        differences in project complexity. [Planning]

15. d. Mandatory or hard
        Mandatory dependencies may be required contractually or may be
        inherent in the nature of the project work. Dependency determination
        and integration is a tool and technique in the Sequence Activity process.
        They describe a relationship in which the successor activity cannot be
        started because of physical constraints until the predecessor activity
        has been finished. For example, software cannot be tested until it has
        been developed (or coded). They may be called hard logic or hard
        dependencies; however, technical dependencies may not be mandatory.
        This distinction is important to remember. The project team determines
        the dependencies that are mandatory as it sequences the activities.
        However, these dependencies should not be confused with assigning
        constraints in the scheduling tool. [Planning]

          16. c. Schedule baseline
                   The schedule baseline is a key input to the Control Schedule process.
                   It is compared with actual results to determine if a change requires
                   corrective or preventive action. [Monitoring and Controlling]

          17. d. Resource leveling
                   While resource leveling will often result in a project duration that
                   is longer than the preliminary schedule as the original critical path
                   probably will change and increase, it can also be used to get a schedule
                   back on track by reassigning activities from noncritical to critical
                   path activities. It is a resource optimization technique in the Develop
                   Schedule process. Start and finish dates are adjusted based on resource
                   constraints, and the goal is to balance demand with the available supply
                   of resources. It is used when scarce or critically required resources are
                   only available at certain times or in limited quantities, are over allocated
                   if the resource is assigned to two activities at the same time, or to keep
                   resource use at a constant level. [Planning]

          18. d. C, A, F, and G
                   First, it is necessary to determine the critical path, which is A, C, F, and
                   G. To determine the lowest weekly crashing cost, start with C at $1,500
                   per week. The next activity is A, followed by F and G. Understand how
                   to crash a schedule in case you have a question on it in your exam. It
                   is a schedule compression technique in the Develop Schedule process.
                   The purpose is to shorten the schedule for the least incremental cost
                   by adding resources. Examples are to approve overtime, add additional
                   resources, or pay to expedite delivery of activities on the critical path.
                   It only works for activities on the critical path and does not always
                   provide a viable alternative. The latter means it can result in increased
                   risk and/or cost. [Planning]

19. b. Discretionary dependency
        This situation is an example of a discretionary dependency. It is a
        dependency determination and integration tool and technique in the
        Sequence Activity process. These dependencies may be called preferred
        logic or soft logic They are established based on knowledge of best
        practices in an application area or in an unusual aspect of the project
        where a specific sequence may be desired. They often are used in
        construction, and the order is not mandatory, but if the activities are
        performed in a sequential order, the overall risk is reduced. As a project
        manager, you should document these dependencies as they can create
        arbitrary total float and can limit later scheduling options. The project
        team makes the decision as to which dependencies are discretionary.

20. c. The final output is described as activities
        In the Create WBS process, the work package is defined as the lowest
        level of the WBS to then estimate and manage cost and duration. In the
        Define Activities process, the final output is described as activities. It
        is a tool and technique in both processes as it divides and subdivides
        the project scope and deliverables into smaller, more manageable parts.
        Activities represent the effort to create the work package in Create WBS.
        The best approach is to involve team members in decomposition in
        both processes. [Planning]

21. b. Every activity is connected to at least one predecessor and at least one
       successor
        The Sequence Activity process involves identifying and documenting
        relationships among the project activities. Every activity is connected to
        at least one predecessor or successor except the first and last. Logical
        relationships are set up to create a realistic project schedule. Some leads
        and lags may be used. The purpose of the Sequence Activity process
        is to convert the activity list into a diagram, which is the first step in
        establishing the schedule baseline. [Planning]

          22. a. Project is running behind the monetary value of the work it planned to
                 accomplish
                   The SPI represents how much of the originally scheduled work has
                   been accomplished at a given period in time, thus providing the
                   project team with insight as to whether the project is on schedule. It
                   is a measure of schedule efficiency and is calculated by EV/PV. A SPI
                   of 1 means the project is on schedule, and the work that has been
                   done to date is exactly the same as the work that was planned. Other
                   values show how much costs are over or under [as in this example] the
                   budgeted amount for the work planned. [Monitoring and Controlling]

          23. b. There can be multiple predecessors for some tasks.
                   The main output in Sequence Activities is a project network diagram
                   of the logical relationships or dependencies in the schedule activities.
                   A summary narrative can accompany the diagram. You also may have
                   multiple predecessors for a task or activity, which is known as path
                   convergence. Activities with multiple successors are known as path
                   divergence. In both of these situations, these activities or tasks are at
                   greater risk. [Planning]
                   PMI(R), PMBOK(R) Guide, 2017, 194

          24. a. The cost and time slope for each critical activity that can be expedited
                   Slope = (Crash cost - Normal cost)/(Crash time - Normal time). This
                   calculation shows the cost per day of crashing the project. The slope
                   is negative to indicate that as the time required for a project or task
                   decreases, the cost increases. If the costs and times are the same
                   regardless of whether they are crashed or normal, the activity cannot be
                   expedited. Crashing only works well for those activities on the critical
                   path, may not produce a viable alternative, and may result in increased
                   risk or cost. It is important to know how it is done in case you might
                   see an exam question about how to do it. [Planning]

25. a. Project management plan
       The project management plan is the key input to Define Activities. It
       includes the project's components, and it also includes the schedule
       management plan and the scope baseline. The schedule management
       plan defines the schedule methodology; waves if rolling wave planning
       is done; and the necessary level of detail for the project. The scope
       baseline shows the WBS, scope statement, and WBS dictionary. It also
       contains deliverables, constraints, and assumptions as documented in
       the scope statement. [Planning]

26. a. Scheduled start or completion of major deliverables and key external
       interfaces
       Milestones are singular points in time, such as the start or completion
       of a significant activity or group of activities. Milestone charts are an
       output of the Develop Schedule process, and while they are similar to
       bar charts, their focus is only on the scheduled start or completion of
       major deliverables and key external influences. [Planning]

27. a. Variance analysis
       Performance of variance analysis during Control Schedule is a tool and
       technique that can be used. It focuses on variance analysis in planned
       versus actual start and finish dates, planned versus actual durations, and
       variances in float. Float variance is an essential planning component
       for evaluating project time performance. It determines the cause and
       degree of variance relative to the schedule baseline, estimates the
       implications of the variances for future work to complete the project,
       and helps decide if corrective or preventive action is needed. It may not
       be needed on some activities not on the critical path, but an activity
       on the critical path may need immediate attention. [Monitoring and
       Controlling]

          28. a. Total float for the activity is nine days.
                   Total float or slack is computed by subtracting the early start date
                   from the late start date, or 19 - 10 = 9. To compute the early finish
                   date given a duration of 4, we would start counting the activity on the
                   morning of the 10th; therefore, the activity would be completed at the
                   end of day 13, not 14 (10, 11, 12, 13). If we started the activity on its late
                   start date on the morning of the 19th, we would finish at the end of day
                   22, not 25. Insufficient information is provided to determine whether
                   this activity can be completed in 2 days if the resources are doubled.

          29. a. Activity attributes
                   Identifying activity attributes is helpful for further selection and sorting
                   of planned activities. They are used for schedule development, for
                   report formatting purposes, and for selecting, ordering, and sorting
                   planned schedule activities in various ways in reports. They extend the
                   definition of activities by identifying multiple components associated
                   with each activity. They include an activity identifier that is unique, the
                   WBS identification number, and activity label or name. Once they are
                   finished, they may include activity predecessors and successors, logical
                   relationships, leads and lags, resource requirements, imposed dates,
                   constraints and assumptions. They can be used to determine where the
                   work has to be performed, the project calendar, the person responsible,
                   and the type of activity involved. [Planning]

          30. a. It maintains the schedule baseline
                   In Control Schedule the benefit is it maintains the schedule baseline
                   throughout the project. The purpose of the Control Schedule process is
                   to update the schedule and manage any changes to the baseline.

31. d. It can help identify schedule risks
        In Control Schedule, the critical path method is a tool and technique
        to use. It compares progress along the critical path to help determine
        schedule status. Any variance on the critical path has an impact on the
        project's end date. Also, evaluating progress of the critical path activities
        on a near critical path can help identify schedule risk. [Monitoring and
        Controlling]

32. b. Free float
        Free float is defined as the amount of time an activity can be delayed
        without delaying the early start of any immediately succeeding activities
        or violating a schedule constraint. It is important to know the difference
        between zero total float, positive total float, negative total float, and
        free float and be able to recognize examples of all four types of float.

33. d. Product roadmap
        When using agile release planning, it provides a high-level summary
        timeline of the release schedule, which tends to be three to six
        months. It is based on the product roadmap and the product vison
        for the project's execution. It also determines the number of iterations
        or sprints in the release and enables the product owner and team to
        decide how much needs to be developed and how long it will take to
        have a reasonable product based on business goals, dependencies, and
        any impediments. [Planning]

         34. a. Describe any unusual sequencing in the network
                  A summary narrative can accompany the schedule network diagram
                  and describe the basic approach used to sequence the activities in the
                  network. This narrative also should describe any unusual sequences in
                  the network. The project schedule network diagrams are an output of
                  the Sequence Activities process. The project schedule network diagram
                  is a graphic representation of the logical relationships or dependencies
                  among the project schedule activities. [Planning]

          35. c. Staff motivation
                  The Estimate Activity durations process determines the number of work
                  periods needed to complete the activity using the resource calendars. It
                  is difficult to do especially considering the nature of the work involved
                  and any constraints. You also need to consider staff motivation as the
                  project manager must be aware of the Student Syndrome, which is
                  procrastination. Many people, especially if they are not working full
                  time on the project, may tend to apply themselves at the last minute
                  possible before the deadline. Parkinson's Law also may apply where
                  work expands to fill the time available for completion. [Planning]

         36. b. Reserve analysis
                  In estimating activity resources, reserve analysis is a data analysis tool
                  and technique. In it, the amount of contingency and management
                  reserves required are determined, which fits the situation in the
                  question. Contingency reserves may be called schedule reserves for
                  schedule uncertainty. Contingency reserves are the estimated duration
                  within the schedule baseline used for any schedule-related risks. They
                  may be associated with the percent of the estimated duration or a fixed
                  number of work periods. Any use of contingency reserves should be
                  documented as should management reserves. Management reserves
                  are a specified amount of the project budget withheld for management
                  control purposes. They are used for any unknown-unknowns.

37. b. 68.26 percent
       First, compute the standard deviation:

           P -O          36 - 6
       =            or          = 5 days
             6             6

       Next, compute three-point expected time:

       P + 4( ML ) + O        36 + 4(21) + 6
                         or                  = 21 days
              6                     6

       Finally, determine range of outcomes using 1:

       21 - 5 = 16 days, and 21 + 5 = 26 days

       Simply defined, 1 is the amount on either side of the mean of a
       normal distribution that will contain approximately 68.26 percent of the
       population. Duration estimates based on three-point estimates with an
       assumed distribution provide an expected duration and clarify the range
       of uncertainty around the expected duration. [Planning]

38. c. A resource calendar
       Project and resource calendars identify periods when work is allowed.
       Project calendars affect all resources. Resource calendars affect a
       specific resource or a resource category, such as a labor contract that
       requires certain workers to work on certain days of the week. The
       resource calendar identifies the working days and shifts that each
       specific resource is available and is used to estimate resource use.
       The resource calendars specify when and how long identified project
       resources will be available during the project, and this information
       may be at the activity or project level. This knowledge includes
       considerations of resource experience and/or skill level and where
       the resources are located and when they may be available. Resource
       calendars are an input to Estimate Activity Durations. [Planning]

        39. d. Kanban system
                 The Kanban system is also known as on-demand scheduling. It is based
                 on the theory of constraints and pull-based scheduling concepts from
                 lean manufacturing as described in the question. The idea is to limit the
                 team's work in progress to balance demand against the team's delivery
                 throughout. It does not rely on a previously developed schedule but
                 instead pulls work from a backlog or intermediate queue of work to be
                 done immediately when resources become available. It often is used for
                 projects that evolve from the product requirements incrementally or as
                 in the question where takes may be similar in size and scope. [Planning]

        40. c. Provide the ability to show performance for a specified time period for
               trend analysis
                 Because schedule performance index (SPI) and cost performance index
                 (CPI) are expressed as ratios, they can be used to show performance
                 for a specific time period or trends over a long-time horizon. The
                 SPI measures schedule efficiency as EV/PV and measures how
                 efficiently the project team is using its time. If it is less than 1, less
                 work was completed than planned; greater than 1 shows more work
                 was completed than was planned. It is important to also analyze
                 performance on the critical path to determine if the project will finish
                 ahead of or behind finish dates. [Monitoring and Controlling]

              c.   500
              d.   -$500

           4. What is the EAC for this project, and what does it represent?
              a. $12,500; the   revised estimate for total project cost (based on performance
                 thus far)
              b. $10,000; the   revised estimate for total project cost (based on performance
                 thus far)
              c. $12,500; the   original project budget
              d. $10,000; the   original project budget

           5. You have now prepared your cost management plan so now you are
              preparing your project's cost estimate. You decided to use analogous
              estimating. Analogous estimating--
              a.   Supports top-down estimating
              b.   Calculates costs based on project parameters
              c.   Produces higher levels of accuracy
              d.   Indicates a range of estimates

           6. While cost estimates are the main output of the Estimate Costs process, not
              to be overlooked is--
              a.   Updates to the cost management plan
              b.   Assumptions log
              c.   Updates to the project schedule
              d.   Cost baseline

           7. You must consider direct costs, indirect costs, overhead costs, and general
              and administrative costs during cost estimating. An example of an indirect
              cost is--
              a.   Salary of the project manager
              b.   Subcontractor expenses
              c.   Materials used by the project
              d.   Electricity
                                                             Project Cost Management    83


 8. If the cost variance is the same as the schedule variance and both numbers
    are greater than zero, then--
   a.   The cost variance is due to the schedule variance
   b.   The variance is favorable to the project
   c.   The schedule variance can be easily corrected
   d.   Labor rates have escalated since the project began

 9. You are responsible for preparing a cost estimate for a large World Bank
    project. You decide to prepare a bottom-up estimate because your estimate
    needs to be as accurate as possible. Your first step is to--
   a. Locate a computerized tool to assist in the process
   b. Use the cost estimate from a previous project to help you prepare this
      estimate
   c. Identify and estimate the cost for each work package or activity
   d. Consult with subject matter experts and use their suggestions as the basis
      for your estimate

10. Management has grown weary of the many surprises, mostly negative, that
    occur on your projects. In an effort to provide stakeholders with an effective
    performance metric, you will use the to-complete performance index (TCPI).
    Its purpose is to--
   a. Determine the schedule and cost performance needed to complete the
      remaining work within management's financial goal for the project
   b. Determine the cost performance needed to complete the remaining
      resources to meet management's financial goal
   c. Predict final project costs
   d. Predict final project schedule and costs

11. If operations on a work package were estimated to cost $1,500 and finish
    today but, instead, have cost $1,350 and are only two-thirds complete, the
    cost variance is--
   a.   $150
   b.   -$150
   c.   -$350
   d.   -$500

          12. When you review cost performance data on your project, different responses
              will be required depending on the degree of variance or control thresholds
              from the baseline. For example, a variance of 10 percent might not
              require immediate action, whereas a variance of 100 percent will require
              investigation. A description of how you plan to manage cost variances
              should be included in the--
             a.   Cost management plan
             b.   Change management plan
             c.   Performance measurement plan
             d.   Variance management plan

          13. As of the fourth month on the Acme project, cumulative planned
              expenditures were $100,000. Actual expenditures totaled $120,000. How is
              the Acme project doing?
             a.   It is ahead of schedule.
             b.   It is in trouble because of a cost overrun.
             c.   It will finish within the original budget.
             d.   The information is insufficient to make an assessment.

          14. On your project, you need to assign costs to the time period in which they
              are incurred. To do this, you should--
             a.   Identify the project components so that costs can be allocated
             b.   Use the project schedule as an input to determine the budget
             c.   Prepare a detailed and accurate cost estimate
             d.   Prepare a cost performance plan

          15. You have a number of costs to track and manage because your project is
              technically very complex. They include direct costs and indirect (overhead)
              costs. You have found that managing overhead costs is particularly difficult
              because they--
             a.   Are handled on a project-by-project basis
             b.   Represent only direct labor costs
             c.   Represent only equipment and materials needed for the project
             d.   Can be included in the activities or at higher levels

          16. If you want to calculate the ETC based on the assumption that work is
              proceeding as planned, the remaining work can be calculated by which of
              the following formulas?
             a.   ETC = BAC - EV
             b.   ETC = (BAC - EV)/CPI
             c.   ETC = AC + EAC
             d.   ETC = EAC - AC
                                                           Project Cost Management    85


17. You receive a frantic phone call from your vice president who says she is
    going to meet with a prospective client in 15 minutes to discuss a large and
    complex project. She asks you how much the project will cost. You quickly
    think of some similar past projects, factor in a few unknowns, and give her
    a number. You provided which of the following type of estimate--
   a.   Definitive
   b.   Budget
   c.   Rough-order-of-magnitude
   d.   Detailed

18. Your approved cost baseline has changed because of a major scope change
    on your project. Your next step should be to--
   a.   Estimate the magnitude of the scope change
   b.   Issue a change request
   c.   Document lessons learned
   d.   Execute the approved scope change

19. You have set aside a certain portion of your project for contingency and
    management reserves. You want to use these reserves to cover the costs of
    risk responses or other contingencies. On your project, you have had some
    opportunities that resulted, which means you should--
   a. Add these opportunities to your reserves for later risk responses
   b. Use value analysis
   c. Remove them from the contingency fund but maintain the management
      reserves
   d. Use value engineering

20. There are many useful EVM metrics, but the most critical is--
   a.   CPI
   b.   EAC
   c.   TCPI
   d.   VAC

21. The approved, integrated scope-schedule-cost plan for project work is--
   a.   Project budget baseline
   b.   Performance measurement baseline
   c.   Level-of-effort control accounts
   d.   Expressed in the To Complete Performance Index

          22. It is expensive to lease office space in cities around the world. Office space
              can cost approximately USD $150 per square foot in Tampa, Florida. And it
              can cost approximately 50,000 per square meter in Tokyo. These "averages"
              can help a person to determine how much it will cost to lease office space
              in these cities based on the amount of space leased. These estimates are
              examples of--
             a.   Variance analysis
             b.   Parametric estimating
             c.   Bottom-up estimating
             d.   Reserve analysis

          23. Your project manager has requested that you provide him with a forecast of
              project costs for the next 12 months. He needs this information to determine
              if the budget should be increased or decreased on this major construction
              project. In addition to the usual information sources, which of the following
              should you also consider?
             a.   Cost estimates from similar projects
             b.   WBS
             c.   Project schedule
             d.   Costs that have been authorized and incurred

          24. There are a number of different earned value management rules of
              performance measurement that can be established as part of the cost
              management plan. One of them is the--
             a.   Control account
             b.   Formulas to determine the ETC
             c.   Risk thresholds
             d.   Activity attributes

          25. Which of the following calculations CANNOT be used to determine EAC?
             a.   EAC = ETC - AC
             b.   EAC = BAC/CPI
             c.   EAC = AC + (BAC - EV)
             d.   EAC = AC + (BAC - EV)/(CPI x SPI)
                                                             Project Cost Management    87


26. Typically, the statement "no one likes to estimate, because they know their
    estimate will be proven incorrect" is true. However, you have been given
    the challenge of estimating the costs for your nuclear reactor project. You
    are considering a variety of items as you incorporate the cost of financing,
    which is in the--
   a.   Schedule
   b.   Financial management plan
   c.   The amount of indirect costs
   d.   The benefit delivery plan

27. By reviewing cumulative cost curves, the project manager can monitor--
   a.   EAC
   b.   PV, EV, and AC
   c.   CVs and SVs
   d.   CPI and SPI

28. Control accounts--
   a.   Are charge accounts for personnel time management
   b.   Summarize project costs at level 2 of the WBS
   c.   Identify and track management reserves
   d.   Represent the basic level at which project performance is measured and
        reported

29. Assume you are holding performance review meetings on your project to
    assess schedule activity and work packages over-running or under-running
    the budget and to determine any estimated funds needed to complete work
    in progress. You also are using earned value. You are preparing reports for
    your stakeholders as they want regular cost forecasts. This means they are
    interested in--
   a.   The Estimate at Completion
   b.   CPI and SPI
   c.   To Complete Performance Index
   d.   Variance analysis

30. Overall cost estimates must be allocated to individual activities to establish
    the cost performance baseline. In an ideal situation, a project manager
    would prefer to prepare estimates--
   a. Before the budget is complete
   b. After the budget is approved by management
   c. Using a parametric estimating technique and model specific for that
      project type
   d. Using a bottom-up estimating technique
88    PMP(R) Exam Preparation: Test Questions, Practice Test, and Simulated Exam


          31. One way to engage team members to improve estimate accuracy is to--
              a.   Hold a focus group
              b.   Use vendor bid analysis
              c.   Use decision making
              d.   Use a Delphi technique

          32. Assume you have used reserve analysis as a tool and technique in Control
              Costs. However, during your project risk identification and subsequent
              analysis of the identified risks was ongoing. In fact you had a risk expert on
              your team. This means you may need to--
              a.   Use management reserve
              b.   Rebaseline your cost estimate
              c.   Perform an assumptions analysis
              d.   Request additional contingency reserves for your budget

          33. Increased attention to return on investment (ROI) now requires you to
              re-estimate the costs for your project. When you looked at how costs were
              first estimated, you realized an order-of-magnitude estimate was prepared,
              which was never refined. Therefore, now you are estimating costs from the
              beginning. As you are preparing a new smart TV along with an automated
              home as the products of your project, you realize market conditions should
              be reviewed because--
              a. A competitor may be working on the same product
              b. Global supply and demand conditions can influence resource costs
              c. Resource cost data are available in your company's knowledge transfer
                 system
              d. Expert judgment can assist in determining when costs exceed profit

          34. A revised cost baseline may be required in cost control when--
              a. CVs are severe, and a realistic measure of performance is needed
              b. Updated cost estimates are prepared and distributed to stakeholders
              c. Corrective action must be taken to bring expected future performance in
                 line with the project plan
              d. EAC shows that additional funds are needed to complete the project even
                 if a scope change is not needed
                                                           Project Cost Management    89


35. As project manager, you identified a number of acceptable tolerances as
    part of your earned value management system. During execution, some
    "unacceptable" variances occurred. After each "unacceptable" variance
    occurred, a best practice is to--
   a.   Update the budget
   b.   Prepare a revised cost estimate
   c.   Adjust the project plan
   d.   Document lessons learned

36. Assume that the project cost estimates have been prepared for each activity
    and the basis of these estimates has been determined. Now, as the project
    manager for your nutrition awareness program in your hospital, you are
    preparing your budget. Because you have estimates for more than 1,200
    separate activities, you have decided to first--
   a. Aggregate these estimates by work packages
   b. Aggregate these estimates by control accounts to facilitate the use of
      earned value management
   c. Use the results of previous projects to predict total costs
   d. Set your cost performance baseline

37. Assume you are using earned value on your project, and as of today, your
    cumulative CPI is below the baseline. This means--
   a. All future work will need to be performed immediately with the range of
      the TCPI.
   b. The ETC work will be performed at an efficiency rate that considers both
      the schedule and performance indices.
   c. What the project has experienced to date is expected to continue.
   d. The budget should be rebaselined.

38. Assume it has become obvious on your project that the budget at completion
    is no longer viable. This means as the project manager, you should--
   a. Recommend to your managers that the project be terminated
   b. Perform an analysis of the remaining tasks on the critical path and take
      corrective or preventive action as required
   c. Determine the relationship of physical performance to costs spent to
      show performance for a specified time period for trend analysis
   d. Consider the forecasted EAC
90      PMP(R) Exam Preparation: Test Questions, Practice Test, and Simulated Exam


          39. Assume that your actual costs are $800; your planned value is $1,200; and
              your earned value is $1,000. Based on these data, what can be determined
              regarding your schedule variance?
             a. At +$200, the situation is favorable as physical progress is being
                accomplished ahead of your plan.
             b. At -$200, the physical progress is being accomplished at a slower rate
                than is planned, indicating an unfavorable situation.
             c. At +$400, the situation is favorable as physical progress is being
                accomplished at a lower cost than was forecasted.
             d. At -$200, you have a behind-schedule condition, and your critical path
                has slipped.

          40. The CPI on your project is 0.84. This means that you should--
             a. Place emphasis on improving the timeliness of the physical progress
             b. Reassess the life-cycle costs of your product, including the length of the
                life-cycle phase
             c. Recognize that your original estimates were fundamentally flawed, and
                your project is in an atypical situation
             d. Place emphasis on improving the productivity by which work was being
                performed

Answer Key

 1. d. -$200; the project is behind schedule
       SV is calculated as EV - PV (in this case, $2,000 - $2,200). It is the
       amount by which the project is ahead or behind the planned delivery
       date at a given point of time. If it is positive, it shows the project is
       ahead of schedule; if it is neutral, it is on schedule. In this example,
       there is a negative variance means that the work completed is less
       than what was planned for at that point in the project, and it is behind
       schedule. [Monitoring and Controlling]

       Controlling, 9, Task 1

 2. b. 0.80; actual costs have exceeded planned costs
       CPI is calculated as EV/AC (in this case, $2,000/$2,500). EV measures the
       budgeted dollar value of the work that has actually been accomplished,
       whereas AC measures the actual cost of getting that work done. If the
       two numbers are the same, work on the project is being accomplished
       for exactly the budgeted amount of money (and the ratio will be equal
       to 1.0). If actual costs exceed budgeted costs (as in this example), AC
       will be larger than EV, and the ratio will be less than 1.0. CPI is also
       an index of efficiency. In this example, an index of 0.80 (or 80 percent)
       means that for every dollar spent on the project only 80 cents worth
       of work is actually accomplished. At this time, the project is over the
       planned costs. [Monitoring and Controlling]

       Controlling, 9, Task 1

 3. d. -$500
       CV is calculated as EV - AC (in this case, $2,000 - $2,500). A negative
       CV means that accomplishing work on the project is costing more than
       was budgeted. CV measures the amount of budget surplus or deficit at a
       point in time, and if it is positive, it is under the planned costs; neutral
       means it is on the planned costs. [Monitoring and Controlling]

           4. a. $12,500; the revised estimate for total project cost (based on perfor-
                 mance thus far)
                   EAC is calculated as BAC/CPI (in this case, $10,000/0.80). It is now
                   known that the project will cost more than the original estimate of
                   $10,000. The project has been getting only 80 cents worth of work
                   done for every dollar spent (CPI), and this information has been used to
                   forecast total project costs. This approach assumes that performance for
                   the remainder of the project will also be based on a CPI of 0.80. The
                   EAC is the expected total cost of completing all work expressed as the
                   sum of the actual cost and the estimate to complete (ETC). Recognize
                   there are three common ways to calculate the EAC based on different
                   assumptions and learn when to use each method. [Monitoring and

           5. a. Supports top-down estimating
                   A frequently used method of Estimate Costs, the analogous technique
                   relies on experience and knowledge gained to predict future events.
                   This technique provides planners with some idea of the magnitude of
                   project costs but generally not within 10%. It is considered as a gross
                   value estimating technique, and it is generally less costly and less time
                   consuming than other techniques but also is generally less accurate.
                   Sometimes it is adjusted for project complexities. It is more reliable when
                   the previous projects are similar in fact, and when the project team
                   members doing the estimating have the needed expertise. [Planning]

           6. b. Assumptions log
                   The Estimate Costs process includes updates to three project documents
                   as an output of this process. One is the assumptions log as during
                   this project, new assumptions may be made, new constraints may be
                   identified, and existing constraints or assumptions may be reviewed
                   and changed; therefore, the assumptions log is updated with this new
                   information. Other documents to update are the lessons learned register
                   and the risk register. [Planning]

7. d. Electricity
       Direct costs are incurred for the exclusive benefit of a project (for
       example, salary of the project manager, materials used by the project,
       and subcontractor expenses). Indirect costs, also called overhead costs,
       are allocated to a project by its performing organization as a cost of
       doing business. These costs cannot be traced to a specific project
       and are accumulated and allocated equitably over multiple projects
       (for example, security guards, fringe benefits, and electricity). Other
       examples of costs to estimate are cost of financing including any
       interest if needed, inflation allowance, exchange rates, or a contingency
       reserve. Costs are estimated for all resources to be charged to the
       project. [Planning]

8. b. The variance is favorable to the project
       A positive schedule variance indicates that the project is ahead of
       schedule. A positive cost variance indicates that the project has incurred
       less cost than estimated for the work accomplished; therefore, the
       project is under budget and ahead of schedule. The CV is calculated
       as EV-AC, and the SV is calculated as the EV-PV. [Monitoring and
       Controlling]

9. c. Identify and estimate the cost for each work package or activity
       Bottom-up estimating is a method of estimating a component of work.
       It is derived by first estimating the cost of the individual work packages
       or activities to the greatest level of specified detail. Then this detailed
       cost is summarized or 'rolled-up' to higher levels for reporting and
       tracking. The cost and accuracy are influenced by the size and other
       attributes of the activity or the work package. It is a tool and technique
       in the Estimate Costs process. [Planning]

          10. b. Determine the cost performance needed to complete the remaining
                 resources to meet management's financial goal
                  The TCPI takes the value of work remaining and divides it by the
                  value of funds remaining to obtain the cost performance factor needed
                  to complete all remaining work according to a financial goal set by
                  management. There are two methods to calculate the TCPI, and you
                  should be familiar with each one and when it should be used. In this
                  example, the TCPI is calculated by (BAC-EV)/(BAC-AC). If it is greater
                  than one, it is harder to complete; if it is 1, it is the same to complete,
                  and less than one means it is easier to complete. It thus measures the
                  cost performance that must be achieved with the remaining resources
                  to meet a specified management goal and is expressed as a ratio of
                  the cost to finish the outstanding work to the available budget. If it is
                  obvious the BAC is no longer viable, the project manager then considers
                  the forecasted EAC. Once approved, the EAC may replace the BAC in
                  the formula. [Monitoring and Controlling]

          11. c. -$350
                  CV is calculated by EV - AC, or $1,500(2/3) - $1,350 = -$350. It is
                  used to determine the amount of budget deficit (as in this example) or
                  surplus at any given point in time. In this example, the project is over
                  the planned cost; a positive value indicates it is under the planned
                  costs, while a neutral value shows it on the planned costs. [Monitoring

         12. a. Cost management plan
                  The management and control of costs focuses on control thresholds
                  or variance thresholds. Certain variances are acceptable, and others,
                  usually those falling outside a particular range, are unacceptable. They
                  are typically expressed as percentage deviations from the baseline plan.
                  The actions taken by the project manager for variances are described
                  in the cost management plan, which is the output of the Plan Cost
                  Management Plan process. [Planning]

13. d. The information is insufficient to make an assessment.
        The information provided tells us that, as of the fourth month, more
        money has been spent than was planned. However, we need to know
        how much work has been completed to determine how the project
        is performing. In earned value terms, we are missing the EV or the
        measure of work expressed in terms of the budget authorized for the
        work. It is the budget associated for the work that has been completed.
        The objective is to establish progress measurement criteria for each
        WBS component to measure work in progress. EV then is monitored
        incrementally to determine current status and cumulatively to determine
        the long-term performance trends. [Monitoring and Controlling]

14. b. Use the project schedule as an input to determine the budget
        Accurate project performance measurement depends on accurate cost
        and schedule information. The project schedule includes planned start
        and finish dates for all activities, milestones, and work packages. and
        control accounts. This information is used to aggregate costs to the
        calendar period for which the costs are planned to be incurred. The
        project schedule is an input under project documents in the Determine
        Budget process. [Planning]

15. d. Can be included in the activities or at higher levels
        Overhead or indirect costs include costs such as rent, insurance, or
        heating, which pertain to the project as a whole. These costs may be
        included in the activities or at a higher level if they are part of the
        project's cost estimate. The amount of overhead to be added to the
        project is frequently decided by the performing organization and may
        be beyond the control of the project manager. [Planning]

        16. d. ETC = EAC - AC
                 The ETC is the expected cost to finish the remaining work. This
                 formula is used if the work is performing as planned. Otherwise you
                 may need to re-estimate the remaining work from the bottom up using
                 the formula of ETC = Re-estimate. [Monitoring and Controlling]

        17. c. Rough-order-of-magnitude
                 A rough-order-of-magnitude estimate has an accuracy range of -25% to
                 75% and is made without detailed data. These estimates are when the
                 project is in the initiation stage, but the cost estimates should be reviewed
                 and refined during the project to reflect additional detail as the accuracy
                 of the estimates will increase. Later in the project, for example definitive
                 estimates can narrow the range of accuracy to -5% to +10%. [Planning]

        18. b. Issue a change request
                 Change requests are an output of the Control Costs process. Before a
                 revised cost baseline leading to a budget update can be prepared, it is
                 necessary to issue a change request. These change requests then are
                 reviewed and processed through the Perform Integrated Change Control
                 process. Change requests are an output of the Control Costs process
                 and may be needed to other components in the project management
                 plan. [Monitoring and Controlling]

        19. a. Add these opportunities to your reserves for later risk responses
                 Reserve analysis is a tool and technique in the Control Costs
                 process. Reserve analysis is used to monitor and control the status of
                 contingency and management reserves for the project to see if they are
                 still needed or if additional funds are required. However, the question
                 notes opportunities, which tend to result in cost savings. When this is
                 the case, funds may be added to the contingency reserve amount or
                 taken from the project as a margin/profit. [Monitoring and Controlling]

20. a. CPI
       The CPI has been proven to be an accurate and reliable forecasting
       tool. It is a measure of the cost efficiency of budgeted resources and
       is considered to be the most critical earned value measurement metric
       and measures the cost efficiency for the work completed. Its indices
       are useful for providing a basis to estimate project cost and schedule
       outcomes. [Monitoring and Controlling]

21. b. Performance measurement baseline
       The performance measurement baseline is the approved plan for the
       project work, which is used to compare actual project execution. From
       it, deviations are measured for management control. It integrates scope,
       schedule, and cost parameters. It is an output of the Control Costs
       process as changes to it are incorporated in response to approved
       changes in scope, schedule performance, or cost control. If these
       variances are so severe, then a change request is used to revise the
       performance measurement baseline, so it is more realistic. [Monitoring

22. b. Parametric estimating
       Parametric estimating involves using statistical relationships between
       historical data and other variables, such as square footage as in this
       example, to calculate a cost estimate for project work. This approach
       can produce higher levels of accuracy depending on the sophistication
       and underlying data in the model. Parametric estimates may be used for
       the entire project or for parts of it in conjunction with other estimating
       techniques. [Planning]

          23. d. Costs that have been authorized and incurred
                   These costs are part of work performance data about project progress.
                   Work performance data are an input to the Control Costs process. In
                   addition, these data include costs that have been invoiced and paid. If
                   it is determined that the budget requires an update, knowledge about
                   the actual costs spent to date is required, and any budget changes are
                   approved according to the Perform Integrated Change Control process.

                   measurement of control accounts will be performed; (2) establish the
                   EV measurement techniques; and (3) state specific tracking methods
                   and EV equations for calculating the EAC forecasts to provide a validity

                   EAC is the expected total cost of completing all work expressed as the
                   sum of the actual cost to date and the estimate at completion. There
                   are four methods to compute it based on different assumptions. If the
                   CPI is expected to be the same for the remainder of the project use
                   EAC = BAC/CPI or answer b. If the initial plan no longer is valid, use
                   EAC = AC + Bottom-up ETC or answer c. If both the CPI and the SPI

26. a. Schedule
       The project schedule is an input to the Estimate Costs process as part
       of project documents. The schedule is significant as it includes the type,
       quantity, and amount of time the team and physical resources will be
       used on the project. The duration estimates effect cost estimates when
       resources are charged one unit of time and when there are seasonal
       fluctuations in costs. It also provides useful information for projects
       that incorporate the cost of financing including any interest charged.

       the cost management plan. Control accounts also are used as the WBS
       component to link to the project's cost accounting system as stated

                   Cost forecasts are an output of the Control Costs process. Either
                   a calculated Estimate at Completion or a bottom-up EAC value is

          30. a. Before the budget is complete
                   Often project cost estimates are prepared after budgetary approval is
                   provided. However, activity cost estimates should be prepared before
                   the budget is complete. Cost estimates are a project document that are
                   an input to the Determine Budget process. These cost estimates are
                   for each activity within a work package that are aggregated for a cost
                   estimate for the work package. [Planning]

          31. c. Use decision making
                   In Estimate Costs, one tool and technique is decision making. In it,
                   voting is used as an assessment process with multiple alternatives with
                   an expected outcome in the form of future actions. These techniques
                   help engage team members to improve estimating accuracy and to
                   promote commitment to the emerging estimates. [Planning]

          32. d. Request additional contingency reserves for your budget
                   Reserve analysis monitors the status of contingency and management
                   reserves to see if they are still needed or if additional reserves need
                   to be requested. The reserves may be used as planned to cover
                   risk response costs or for other contingencies. In this situation risk
                   identification and analysis are ongoing, and they may indicate a need to
                   request additional reserves. [Monitoring and Controlling]

33. b. Global supply and demand conditions can influence resource costs
       Market conditions, along with published commercial information, and
       exchange rates and inflation are enterprise environmental factors,
       an input to Estimate Costs. Market conditions describe the products,
       services, and results available in the market and who provides them
       along with any terms and conditions. As well, regional and global
       supply and demand conditions can greatly influence resource costs,
       assisting in the estimating process. [Planning]

       PMI(R) PMP Examination Content Outline, 2015, Planning, 6, Task 3

34. a. CVs are severe, and a realistic measure of performance is needed
       After the CVs exceed certain ranges, the original project budget may
       be questioned and changed as a result of new information. Changes to
       the cost baseline are incorporated in response to approved changes in
       scope, activity resources, or cost estimates. [Monitoring and Controlling]

35. d. Document lessons learned
       Lessons learned but not documented are "lessons lost." The lessons
       learned register will help current project members, as well as people
       on future projects, make better decisions. Accordingly, the reasons for
       the variance, the rationale supporting the corrective action, and other
       related informationmust be documented. Further, the techniques that
       were effective in maintaining the budget, variance analysis, earned
       value analysis, forecasts, and corrective actions to respond to cost
       variance are documented. [Monitoring and Controlling]

        36. a. Aggregate these estimates by work packages
                 Cost estimates are a project document, which is an input to the
                 Determine Budget process. As the budget is determined, the cost
                 estimates for the activities should be aggregated by the work packages
                 in the WBS. Ultimately, the cost baseline is developed, which is an
                 approved version of the time-based budget excluding any management
                 reserves, and it summarizes the approved budgets for the schedule
                 activities. [Planning]
                 PMI(R), PMBOK(R) Guide, 2017, 250, 254

        37. a. All future work will need to be performed immediately with the range
               of the TCPI.
                 The TCPI is a measure of cost performance that is required to be
                 achieved with the remaining resources to meet a specified management
                 goal. It is expressed as the ratio of the cost to finish the remaining
                 work to the remaining budget. If the cumulative CPI falls below the
                 baseline, future project work will need to be performed immediately
                 within the range of the TCPI to stay within the authorized budget at
                 completion. Whether this performance level is achievable is a judgment
                 call based on considerations such as risk, time remaining, and technical
                 performance [Monitoring and Controlling]

        38. d. Consider the forecasted EAC
                 Forecasting is part of trend analysis, which is a tool and technique
                 in Control Costs. In this situation, use of the forecasted EAC is
                 recommended as it involves making projections of conditions and
                 events in the future of the project based on current performance
                 information and other knowledge that is available. Forecasts are
                 generated, updated, and reissued based on work performance data
                 provided as the project is executed. EACs are typically based on the
                 actual costs for work completed plus an estimate of the remaining
                 work. [Monitoring and Controlling]

39. b. At -$200, the physical progress is being accomplished at a slower rate
       than is planned, indicating an unfavorable situation.
       Schedule variance is calculated: EV - PV or $1,000 - $1,200 = -$200.
       Because the SV is negative, physical progress is being accomplished at a
       slower rate than planned. It is a useful metric as it can indicate when a
       project is falling behind or is ahead of its baseline schedule. Ultimately,
       it equals zero when the project is complete because all the planned
       values have been earned. It should be used along with monitoring the
       critical path. [Monitoring and Controlling]

       Controlling, 9, Task 1

40. d. Place emphasis on improving the productivity by which work was
       being performed
       CPI = EV/AC and measures the efficiency of the physical progress
       accomplished compared to the baseline. A CPI of 0.84 means that
       for every dollar spent, you are only receiving 84 cents of progress.
       Therefore, you should focus on improving the productivity by which
       work is being performed as now it represents a cost overrun for the
       project. The CPI is considered the most critical earned value metric.

        14. Project quality management was once thought to include only inspection or
            quality control. In recent years, the concept of project quality management
            has broadened. Failure to meet quality requirements can lead to--
            a. Employee attrition
            b. Quality Assurance having complete responsibility
            c. Customers requiring a documented and registered quality assurance
               system
            d. Unstable processes

        15. Assume your organization is a start-up company, and you are trying to
            explain the importance of project quality management to the management
            team, which has not worked in this area before. You held an orientation
            session for them as to its importance. Then, you prepared your quality
            management plan and asked the management team to review it before it
            was completed and distributed to stakeholders. The purpose of their review
            was to--
            a.   Have a sharper focus on the project's value proposition
            b.   Ensure the team can provide needed quality metrics
            c.   Determine the project's sufficient degree of accuracy and precision

        16. Your quality assurance department recently performed a quality audit of
            your project and identified a number of findings and recommendations.
            One recommendation seems critical and should be implemented because it
            affects successful delivery of the product to your customer. Your next step
            should be to--
            a. Call a meeting of your project team to see who is responsible for the
               problem
            b. Reassign the team member who had responsibility for oversight of the
               problem
            c. Perform product rework immediately
            d. Issue a change request to implement accepted audit recommendations

        17. One way to monitor cost and schedule variances, volume, frequency of
            scope changes, and other results to determine if the project management
            processes are in control is to use control charts. Assume you are working
            on a project that implements a repetitive process as the result is used many
            times after the process is designed and tested in telecommunications. Since
            it is repetitive, the control limits are
            a.   Seven consecutive plot points above the mean
            b.   Ways to identify which factors have the greatest influence
            c.   +/- 3 s around a process mean set at 0 s
            d.   Seven consecutive plot points below the mean

Answer Key
 1. a. Ensure confidence that the project will satisfy relevant quality standards
        Manage Quality, the broader term than quality assurance, increases
        project effectiveness and efficiency or project activities so better results
        are achieved and performance increases to enhance stakeholder
        satisfaction. It implements the planned and systematic acts and
        processes in the project's quality management plan. It builds confidence
        that future output progress will be completed in a way to meet
        specified requirements and specifications. Manage Quality should be
        performed throughout the project. [Executing]

 2. c. Plan Quality Management
        Benchmarking involves comparing actual or planned practices to those
        practices or quality standards of comparable projects to identify best
        practices, to note ideas for improvement, and to provide a way to
        measure performance. Benchmarking may be done by the performing
        organization or external to it or can be within the same application
        area. It enables analogies from projects in different application areas to
        be made. It is a tool and technique in the data gathering category of
        Plan Quality Management. [Planning]
        PMI(R), PMBOK(R) Guide, 2017, 281
        PMI(R) PMP Examination Content Outline, 2015, Planning, 5, Task 8

 3. d. Find errors, defects, bugs, or other nonconformance problems
        Testing is a tool and technique used in Control Quality. Early testing
        helps identify nonconformance problems and reduces the cost of
        fixing them. The intent of testing is the answer to this question. The
        type, amount, and extent of testing is in the quality management plan
        and depends on the nature of the project. Tests can be performed
        throughout the project if desired. [Monitoring and Controlling]

           4. d. Helps manage requirements the quality management plan will reference
                   The requirements management plan is a project document used as an
                   input to Plan Quality Management. It provides the approach to identify,
                   analyze, and manage the requirements the quality management plan
                   and the quality metrics will reference. [Planning]

                   PMI(R) PMP Examination Content Outline, 2015, Planning, 6, Task 8

           5. c. Design for X
                   Design for X is a set of technical guidelines to use during product
                   design to optimize a specific aspect of the design. It can control and
                   hopefully improve the product's final characteristics. The 'X' means
                   different aspects of product development that include reliability,
                   deployment, assembly, manufacturing, cost, service, capability, safety,
                   and quality. [Executing]
                   PMI(R), PMBOK(R) Guide, 2017, 295
                   PMI(R) PMP Examination Content Outline, 2015, Executing, 8, Task 3

           6. a. Conduct a design of experiments
                   Manage Quality is the work of everyone on the project. While the
                   project manager and team may use the Quality Assurance Department
                   to assist in this process, activities such as failure analysis, design of
                   experiments, and quality improvement are stressed. This situation in
                   this question is an example of designing an experiment. By analyzing
                   the data, it can help provide the optimal conditions for the product or
                   process, highlight the factors that influence the results, and reveal the
                   presence of interactions and synergy among the factors. [Executing]

           7. d. Can organize facts to help solve quality problems
                   Check sheets are a tool and technique in Control Quality. They are
                   useful to organize facts to facilitate collecting relevant data about a
                   quality problem. Their use increases in value for gathering attribute
                   data while performing inspections to identify defects. An example is
                   the frequencies or consequences of defects collected. [Monitoring and
                   Controlling]

8. a. Cultural concerns
       Enterprise environmental factors are an input to Plan Quality
       Management, one of which is cultural perceptions that may influence
       expectations about quality. Other enterprise environmental factors
       are: government agency regulations; rules, standards, and guidelines
       specific to the application area of the project; geography, organizational
       structure, marketplace conditions; and working or operating conditions
       of the project or its deliverables that may affect product quality.

       PMI(R), PMBOK(R) Guide, 2017, 280
       PMI(R) PMP Examination Content Outline, 2015, Planning, 6, Task 8

 9. b. Focus on conformance
       Attribute sampling determines whether a result does or does not
       conform. The project team ideally should have a working knowledge of
       some aspects of statistical sampling, one of which is attribute sampling.
       They also should know about the difference between prevention
       and inspection, variable sampling, and tolerances. [Monitoring and
       Controlling]

       PMI(R) PMP Examination Content Outline, 2015, Monitoring and
       Controlling, 9, Task 3

10. c. Prevention costs
       Prevention costs include any expenditures directed toward ensuring
       that quality is achieved the first time. They include costs related to poor
       quality in products, deliverables, services, or the entire project. The
       objective is to focus on cost of conformance and spend money during
       the project to avoid failures. They are part of the cost of quality, a tool
       and technique in Plan Quality Management. The cost of conformance
       includes these prevention costs and appraisal costs. [Planning]

          11. d. Verify their timely implementation
                   Approved change requests are an input to Control Quality. As part of
                   the Perform Integrated Change Control process, a change log update
                   shows some changes are approved, while others are rejected or
                   deferred. The approved change requests may include modifications such
                   as defect repairs, revised work methods, and a revised schedule. Their
                   timely implementation should be verified, confirmed for completeness,
                   retested, and certified as correct. [Monitoring and Controlling]
                   PMI(R), PMBOK(R) Guide, 2017, 301

                   Controlling, 9, Task 3

          12. c. Review the scope baseline
                   The scope baseline is part of the project management plan and is
                   an input to Plan Quality Management. It contains the WBS and the
                   deliverables documented in the scope statement to determine which
                   quality standards and objectives are needed for the project and the
                   project deliverables and processes that will require quality review. The
                   scope statement also includes the acceptance criteria for the project's
                   deliverables. This definition of the acceptance criteria may influence
                   quality costs, but by satisfying the acceptance criteria shows stakeholder
                   needs are met. [Planning]
                   PMI(R), PMBOK(R) Guide, 2017, 279

          13. b. Tests and inspections
                   Test and inspection planning is a tool and technique in Plan Quality
                   Management. By using it, the project manager and the team determine
                   how to test or insect the product, deliverable, or service to meet
                   stakeholder expectations and the goals of product performance and
                   reliability. Tests and inspections can include alpha and beta tests in a
                   software project, strength tests in a construction project, inspection in
                   manufacturing, and field tests and nondestructive tests in engineering.

14. a. Employee attrition
       Failure to meet quality requirements can result in serious negative
       consequences. One example is employee attrition as many people
       may not be needed if quality requirements are not met. Also in this
       category are overworking the project team, leading to decreased profits
       and increased levels of project risks, errors, or rework. [Monitoring and
       Controlling]

       Controlling, 9, Task 3

15. a. Have a sharper focus on the project's value proposition
       The content, style, and level of detail of a quality management plan
       depend on the project. It should be reviewed early in the project
       to ensue later decisions are made with accurate information. By
       having a review, its benefits are a sharper focus on the project's value
       proposition, of interest to executive management, cost reductions, and
       fewer schedule overruns as a result of rework. [Planning]

       PMI(R) PMP Examination Content Outline, 2015, Planning, 6, Task 8

16. d. Issue a change request to implement accepted audit recommendations
       The information obtained from a quality audit can be used to improve
       quality systems and performance. The subsequent effort to correct any
       deficiencies should result in a reduced cost of quality and an increase
       in sponsor or customer satisfaction. In most cases, quality audits also
       can confirm implementing approved change requests such as updates,
       corrective or preventive actions, and defect repairs. Change requests to
       implement recommendations from the quality audits are an output of
       the Manage Quality process. [Executing]

        17. c. +/- 3 s around a process mean set at 0 s
                 Control charts are a data representation tool and technique used in
                 Control Quality The key words in this question are "repetitive process",
                 which means the control limits are set at +/- 3 s around a process
                 mean set at 0 s. The control charts are used to determine whether or
                 not a process is stable or has predictable performance. Upper and lower
                 limits are set based on requirements, and they reflect the maximum
                 or minimum values allowed. These control limits are not specification
                 limits. They are determined statistically. and the project manager and
                 others can use the statistically calculated control limits to identify the
                 points where corrective action is required. [Monitoring and Controlling]

        18. b. Logical data models
                 In Plan Quality Management, logical data models are an example of a
                 data representation tool and technique. A logical data model consists
                 of a visual representation of an organization's data. Such a model is
                 described in business language, so it can be used independently of
                 specific technology. The logical data model also is useful as it can show
                 where data integrity or other quality issues may arise. The key word in
                 this question is visually. [Planning]

        19. d. Using cost/benefit analysis
                 Cost/benefit analysis is a data analysis tool and technique in
                 Plan Quality Management. It is financial analysis tool, but here In
                 Plan Quality Management, its purpose is to estimate strength and
                 weaknesses of various alternatives in terms of benefits provided. This
                 analysis helps the project manager evaluate if the planned quality
                 activities will be effective. The benefits if quality requirements are met
                 include less rework, lower costs, higher productivity, increased customer
                 satisfaction and increased profits. This analysis for each quality activity
                 compares the cost of quality to the expected benefits. [Planning]

20. b. Multicriteria decision analysis
        The key words in this question are quality metrics. In the Plan Quality
        Management process, decision making is a tool and technique. Multi-
        criteria decision analysis tools, such as a prioritization matrix, are used
        to identify key issues and suitable alternatives to be prioritized as a
        set of decisions to implement. The criteria are analyzed and may be
        weighted to obtain a mathematical score for each alternative. Then,
        alternatives are ranked by their specific score. In this process, it helps
        prioritize quality metrics. [Planning]

        PMI(R) PMP Examination Content Outline, 2015, Planning, 6, Task 8

21. a. Manage Quality process
        Audits are a tool and technique in the Manage Quality process. Manage
        Quality translates the quality management plan into activities that
        incorporate the organization's quality polices into the project. Audits
        then are used to see if the project activities comply with organizational
        and project quality policies, processes, and procedures. They may
        be done by people external to the organization or by internal staff
        members. [Executing]

22. c. Use the organization's quality policies
        In preparing your project's quality management plan, organizational
        processes assets should be considered. One of them, which is the key
        to this question, is the organizational quality management system,
        which includes policies, procedures, and guidance, among other
        things. The quality policy is the overall intentions and direction of
        the organization with regard to quality, as formally expressed by top
        management. [Planning]

          23. b. Shows the strength of relationships between factors, causes, and
                 objectives
                   Matrix diagrams are an example of a data representation tool and
                   technique used in Plan Quality Management. They show the strengths
                   of relationships among different factors, causes, and objectives that are
                   displayed in the rows and columns in the matrix. The project manager
                   then determines how many factors to be compared to determine the
                   specific shape of the matrix diagram. The diagram helps identify the
                   key quality metrics important for project success. Quality metrics are an
                   output of this process. [Planning]

          24. a. Mind mapping
                   Mind mapping is a data representation tool and technique used in
                   Plan Quality Management. It is a diagrammatic method in which
                   one can visualize organizing information. In quality, a mind map is
                   created around a single quality concept, which is drawn as an image
                   in the center of a blank page - usually in landscape. Then, associated
                   represented ideas such as images, words, and parts of words are
                   added. This technique often results in a quick way to gather quality
                   requirements, constraints, dependencies, and relationships. [Planning]

          25. b. Quality metrics as an input to Manage Quality
                   These examples of metrics describe a project or product attribute and
                   how the Control Quality process will verify compliance. In the Manage
                   Quality process, these metrics are used as a basis for test scenarios for
                   the project and its deliverables and as a basis for areas of improvement.

26. b. Work performance information in Control Quality
       In the Control Quality process, work performance information is an
       output. It is the information about project requirements fulfillment as
       shown in the answer to the question. Other examples are causes for
       rejection, needed rework, corrective action recommendations, lists of
       verified deliverables, status of quality metrics, and the need for process
       adjustments. [Monitoring and Controlling]

       Controlling, 9, Task 3

27. a. As stated in the quality management plan
       One Control Quality output results in quality control measurements. They
       are the documented results of the activities in Control Quality. They should
       be captured in the format specified in the quality management plan since
       this plan states planned quality control and quality management activities
       for the project, among other things [Monitoring and Controlling]

       Controlling, 9, Task 3

28. b. Using Six Sigma
       In the Manage Quality process, one tool and technique is quality
       measurement methods. Quality improvements often occur based on
       recommendations from quality control, findings from quality audits, or
       problem solving. Plan-do-check-act and Six Sigma are two common
       quality improvement tools used to analyze and evaluate improvement
       opportunities. [Executing]

29. c. Quality reports
       Quality reports can be graphical, narrative, or quantitative. They serve to
       provide the information to be used by other processes and departments
       to take corrective actions to achieve quality expectations. Information
       in these reports may include any quality management issues escalated
       by the project team; recommendations for improvement in the project,
       processes, and product requirements; recommendations for corrective
       action, and summary findings from Control Quality. [Executing]

          30. a. Standards and regulations are an input to Plan Quality Management
                   During the Plan Quality Management process, the project management
                   team should consider enterprise environmental factors especially when
                   relevant to a specific application area such as standards and regulations in
                   this question with the needed building codes. Other examples are rules and
                   guidelines, geographic distribution, the organizational structure, marketplace
                   conditions, working or operating conditions, and cultural perceptions that
                   may influence quality expectations. These are conditions outside of the
                   control of the project manager and his or her team. [Planning]
                   PMI(R), PMBOK(R) Guide, 2017, 280

          31. a. Cause-and-effect diagrams
                   Cause-and-effect diagrams, also called Ishikawa diagrams or fishbone
                   diagrams, are used to illustrate how various causes and sub causes
                   interact to create a special effect. It is named for its developer, Kaoru
                   Ishikawa. These diagrams break down the causes of a problem
                   statement into distinct branches. The objective is to identify the main
                   or root cause of the problem. They are a data representation tool and
                   technique in Manage Quality. [Executing]

          32. b. Review the requirements traceability matrix
                   The requirements traceability matrix is a project document that is an
                   input to Plan Quality Management. It is helpful because it shows the
                   links from product requirements to deliverables, and it helps ensure
                   each requirement is tested. It also provides an overview of the tests
                   needed to verify the requirements. [Planning]
                   PMI(R), PMBOK(R) Guide, 2017, 280

          33. d. Use root cause analysis
                   Root cause analysis is a data analysis tool and technique in Manage
                   Quality. Its purpose is to serve as an analytical approach to determine
                   the basic underlying reason that causes a defect, variance, or risk. A
                   single root cause may underlie more than one variance, defect, or
                   risk. It also can be used to identify the root causes of a problem and
                   then solving them. Once all root causes of a problem are resolved, the
                   problem then does not exist. [Executing]

34. c. A checklist
       Checklists are a data gathering tool and technique used in Manage
       Quality. They are a structured tool used to verify a set of steps has
       been performed or to see if requirements are satisfied. They may
       be basic or complex based on the project requirements. Quality
       checklists also incorporate the acceptance criteria in the scope baseline.

35. b. Flowchart
       A flowchart is a data representation technique used in Plan Quality
       Management and also in Manage Quality. In Plan Quality Management,
       they are also called process maps as noted in the question. They show
       the activities, decision points, branching loops, parallel paths, and the
       overall order of processing by mapping the organizational details of
       procedures that exist within a horizontal chain known as SIPOC or
       supplier, input, process, outputs, and customers model. [Planning]

36. b. Quality management plan
       The quality management plan describes how policies, procedures, and
       guidelines will be implemented to achieve the quality objectives. It
       also includes quality standards, roles and responsibilities, deliverables
       and requirements that need review, planned quality control and quality
       management activities, quality tests, and procedures relevant to the
       project. [Planning]

37. b. Implement specific design guidelines
       The Manage Quality process is important for many reasons. Using
       planned systematic acts and processes, it designs a mature and optimal
       product. It does so by implementing specific design guidelines. They
       address the specific aspects of the product. [Executing]

          38. d. Identify the problem
                   The first and most important is to identify the problem as a gap to be
                   closed or as an objective to be achieved. Causes then are found by
                   looking at the problem statement and asking why until a root cause
                   has been identified for which action can be taken or the reasonable
                   possibilities on the diagram have been exhausted. [Executing]

          39. d. Scatter diagram
                   Scatter diagrams are a data representation tool and technique in
                   Manage Quality. The scatter diagram is a graph used to show the
                   relationship between two variables. For example, they can show a
                   relationship between any element of a process, environment, or activity
                   on one axis and a quality defect on the other axis. [Executing]

          40. a. Verified deliverables
                   An output of Control Quality is verified deliverables. A goal of this
                   process is to determine the correctness of deliverables. Verified
                   deliverables then are an input to the Validate Scope process for
                   formalized acceptance. However, it is important to note that any change
                   requests or improvements related to the deliverables means they then
                   may be changed, inspected, and reviewed. [Monitoring and Controlling]

 1. You have been assigned as project manager on what could be a "bet the
    company" project. You realize that to be successful you need to exercise
    maximum control over project resources. You are both a manager and a
    leader in resource management. This means you must--
   a.   Focus on emotional intelligence
   b.   Model professional and ethical behavior
   c.   Select the team resources with the needed competencies
   d.   Recognize and promote diversity

 2. As the project manager, it is your goal to build a high-performing team. On
    your project, four of your nine team members know one another, but five
    are new to you and the rest of the team. As you work in team building, your
    objective is to--
   a.   Provide recognition and rewards
   b.   Reach consensus on team issues
   c.   Help team members work together effectively
   d.   Try to solve team political problems




                                                                               131

           3. Assume you are managing a large construction project to use solar power
              for electricity in a different country in a location that lacks easy access to
              transportation facilities. You must make sure all the equipment and other
              needed materials are available when you need them. Given the geographical
              location, it is a difficult task. Much of the construction equipment also is
              leased. As a result you need to--
              a.   Use a lean approach
              b.   Use variance analysis
              c.   Use agreements
              d.   Emphasize marketplace conditions

           4. You are leading a team to reorganize your IT department, so it is more
              customer oriented. Your team has 10 people. While your team members
              have competencies in IT, they are not in the department to promote
              objectivity. In your resource plan, you have a section on recognition to state
              when recognition and rewards will be given to members of your team. As
              you put this plan into practice, you should consider--
              a. Compatibility between the rewards you give and those in the team
                 members' functional group
              b. Whether the team charter is followed
              c. Team motivation

              d.   Colocation

           6. You are managing a virtual team. The project has been under way
              for several months, and you believe your team members do not view
              themselves as a team or a unified group. To help rectify this situation, you
              should--
              a. Ensure that every member of the project team uses the same type of
                 e-mail system
              b. Enhance the use of technology
              c. Enhance communications planning
              d. Establish discussion forums

 7. Major difficulties arise when multiple projects need to be managed in the
    functional organizational structure because of--
   a. The level of authority of the project manager
   b. Conflicts over the relative priorities of different projects in competition for
      limited resources
   c. Project team members who are focused on their functional specialty
      rather than on the project
   d. The need for the project manager to use interpersonal skills to resolve
      conflicts informally

 8. Leadership is embedded in the job of the project manager and really in the
    job of every team member. Assume you are project manager with a team
    of two people who will work full-time on the project, and six people who
    will support the project on a part-time basis. All team members know one
    another and have worked together in the past. Leadership on this team is
    especially important--
   a.   In the planning phase
   b.   At the beginning of the project
   c.   During the execution phase
   d.   When phase gate and performance reviews are held

 9. Your organization is characterized by hierarchical organizational structures
    with rigid rules and policies and strict supervisory controls. Individual
    team members are not expected to engage in problem solving or use
    creative approaches to plan and execute work; management has these
    responsibilities. Your organization is characterized by which one of the
    following theories?
   a.   Ouchi's Theory
   b.   McGregor's Theory X
   c.   Maslow's self-esteem level
   d.   Vroom's Expectancy Theory

10. As you prepare your resource management plan, you need to provide
    guidance and determine the skills and capacity required to complete the
    activities in the project. This should be documented in the--
   a.   Roles and responsibilities section
   b.   Staffing management plan
   c.   Staff acquisition section
   d.   Competencies section

              c.   Enhanced interpersonal skills
              d.   Improved team work

          12. The team members on your project have been complaining that they do not
              have any sense of identity as a team because they are located in different
              areas of the building. To remedy this situation, you developed a project logo
              and had it printed on T-shirts to promote the project, but this action has not
              worked. Your next step is to--
              a.   Initiate a newsletter
              b.   Establish a project vision
              c.   Establish a team charter
              d.   Encourage problem solving

          13. You are managing a team of 120 internal members and four contractors.
              Given the size of this team, you want to document each team member's
              assignments. You can use a--
              a.   Resource breakdown structure
              b.   RACI chart
              c.   Team calendar

15. You are managing a design and construction project for the next-generation
    of drones. Your organization has been the leader in the drone business
    since it began, which means you are fortunate as your executive realize they
    would only increase in capabilities and popularity and acquired needed
    resources in house rather than rely on contractors to preserve intellectual
    property. On your project, you find you are in a dilemma as you need a
    specific type of crane from another department. If you do not get the crane
    when you need it, your project's schedule will slip dramatically. The best
    approach you can use in this situation is--
   a.   Problem solving
   b.   Political skills
   c.   Referent power
   d.   Lease the crane

16. You have been a project manager for seven years. You now are managing
    the construction of a new facility that must comply with the government's
    newly issued environmental standards. You want to ensure that your team
    members are able to select methods to complete various activities on the
    project without needing to involve you in each situation. As you prepare
    your resource management plan, you should document this information in
    which of the following--

   b.   Authority section
   c.   Resource breakdown structure
   d.   Staffing management plan

17. It is important on all projects to determine when and how human resources
    will be met. Assume that you are managing a project to assess methods for
    streamlining the regulatory approval process for new medical devices in
    your government agency. Because the agency has undergone downsizing
    during the past three years, subject matter experts are in short supply.
    You must determine whether the needed subject matter experts can be
    acquired from inside the agency or whether you must use contractors. This
    information should be documented in the--
   a.   Make-or-buy decisions in the procurement management plan
   b.   Contracts management plan
   c.   Staffing management plan
   d.   Resource management plan

          18. Conflicts are inevitable on projects, but if actually managed effectively, at
              times conflicts can help the team arrive at a better solution. One of the
              challenges a project manager faces is--
             a. Determining sources of conflict early and having proactive solutions to
                manage them
             b. Recognizing stakeholders will have conflicting interests but use a
                collaborative approach to resolve each conflict
             c. Resolve it in a timely way
             d. Managing conflict when it occurs

          19. As project manager, you are primarily responsible for implementing the
              project management plan by authorizing the execution of project activities.
              Because you do not work in a projectized organization, you do not have
              direct access to human resource administrative activities. Therefore, you
              need to--
             a. Outsource these functions
             b. Include a human resource representative in your RAM chart
             c. Ensure that your team is sufficiently aware of administrative requirements
                to ensure compliance
             d. Have a representative from human resources sign off on the team charter

          20. Constant bickering, absenteeism, and substandard performance have
              characterized the behavior of certain members of your team. You have
              planned an off-site retreat for the team to engage in a variety of activities.
              Your primary objective for investing time and money in this event is because
              your team--
             a.   Is in the storming stage
             b.   Has too many issues to solve
             c.   Both individual and team performance are lagging
             d.   Is in the forming stage

          21. Two team members on your project often disagree. You need a conflict
              resolution method that provides a long-term resolution. You decide to use
              which one of the following approaches?
             a.   Confronting
             b.   Accommodating
             c.   Collaborating
             d.   Smoothing

22. Assume you are working to prepare your resource management plan for
    your automotive company. You are going to design and then manufacture
    state-of-the-art vehicles of various types to surpass your competitors who are
    focused on self-autonomous vehicles. As you prepare your plan, one area to
    consider is--
   a.   The organizational structure of your company
   b.   Your scope statement
   c.   Talent management
   d.   Reporting requirements

23. As a project manager, you believe in using a "personal touch" to further
    team development. One approach that has proven effective toward this goal
    is--
   a.   Creating a team name
   b.   Providing flexible work time
   c.   Improving feelings of trust and agreement
   d.   Using conversations with team members

24. Your project has been under way for some time with only a few direct
    reports. However, it then is your responsibility to--
   a. Facilitate an atmosphere conducive to success
   b. Focus on ensuring team member strengths are known and assign them to
      roles to enable the project to be completed as soon as possible
   c. Develop a recovery plan as a contingency to help complete the project
   d. Provide individual and team assessments

25. You are the project manager for a two-year project that is now beginning its
    second year. The mix of team members has changed, and there is confusion
    as to roles and responsibilities. In addition, several of the completed work
    packages have not received the required sign-offs, and three work packages
    are five weeks behind schedule. To gain control of this project, you need
    to--
   a. Rebaseline your original resource plan with current resource
      requirements
   b. Change to a projectized organizational structure for maximum control
      over resource assignments
   c. Work with your team to prepare a responsibility assignment matrix
   d. Create a new division of labor by assigning technical leads to the most
      critical activities

          26. You are the project manager to develop a new medical implant device. You
              were selected to manage this project since you are an expert in medical
              implant devices. However, you strive to seek opinions from others. Now you
              are estimating the resources you will need for this project. You consulted
              with an estimating expert in the company and decided the best approach is
              to use--
              a.   Analogous estimating
              b.   Parametric estimating
              c.   Expert judgment
              d.   Meetings

          27. Having estimated the resources you need for your new medical implant
              project, the next challenge is to acquire them. Resources seem to always be
              scarce in the company. Additionally, you also work in a matrix environment,
              so you have limited direct control over resource selection. Your best
              approach is to--
              a. Build on the meetings you held with the key people and use
                 communications skills
              b. Build on the meetings you held with the key people and use influencing
                 skills
              c. Review resource calendars and then use resource leveling
              d. Meet with peers to seek their opinions as to what they would do

          28. Assume although you did your best in negotiating and influencing others
              to release resources to you for your medical implant project, you were not
              successful. You now are concerned your project, even though it had a strong
              business case and was approved by the portfolio group, that you now have
              another constraint to consider, which is--
              a.   Pre-assignment of staff to the project
              b.   Economic factors
              c.   Use of outsourcing
              d.   Team member training requirements

          29. Decision making often is used as a tool and technique in Acquire Project
              Team. One approach is multi-criteria decision tool. An example of a
              selection criterion to consider is--
              a.   Competency
              b.   Motivation
              c.   Attitude
              d.   Trust

30. Assume your team of five people to develop a data base to assess testing
    methods for listeria in ice cream has worked together before. You expect
    that this team will be a high-performing team from the beginning, but you
    find two team members seem to disagree as to the vison of the project. You
    meet with these two people and find one of them really dislikes being on
    the project. You decide to ask your sponsor if this person can be reassigned,
    and another person added to the team. The sponsor agrees. This means--
   a. Initial establishment of roles and responsibilities change so the new
      person assumes the previous team member's work
   b. Your team is in the forming stage
   c. You should conduct an off-site team-building retreat
   d. You should meet with each team member and establish specific perfor-
      mance goals

31. Your organization is adopting a project-based approach to business, which
    has been difficult. Although project teams have been created, they are little
    more than a collection of functional and technical experts who focus on
    their specialties. You are managing the company's most important project.
    As you begin this project, you must place a high priority on--
   a.   Guiding resource selection
   b.   Identifying the resources needed to finish the project on time
   c.   Determining the best way to communicate status to the CEO
   d.   Establishing firm project requirements

32. Your company just learned it won a competitive proposal from your
    government to design a better safety system for food products in your
    country since there are not enough resources to inspect the imported food.
    You were listed in your company's proposal as the project manager since
    you have your PMP. You now are establishing your project team. You should
    consider--
   a.   Schedule baseline
   b.   Pre-assignments
   c.   Resource calendars
   d.   Problem solving

          33. Now that your project to develop the next generation prostate cancer drug is
              under way, you have gotten to know your team members and the skills and
              competencies they have. You now are in a position to assess their strengths
              and any areas of improvement. You decided one approach to use with more
              junior level team members was--
              a.   Mentoring
              b.   Team performance assessments
              c.   Motivation
              d.   Communications technology

          34. Work performance reports are especially helpful in the Manage Team
              process because--
              a. They assess team performance to take corrective or preventive action as
                 needed
              b. They assist in determining future team resource requirements
              c. They assess the degree of the project manager's authority
              d. They document and monitor who is responsible for resolving key issues
                 and when resolution is needed

          35. Although most organizations conduct individual work performance reviews
              and appraisals, most of our work is done through teams. You decided since
              you have the luxury of a team of six people who are full-time to conduct an
              individual assessment but to concentrate on a team performance assessment.
              An example of an indicator you plan to use is--
              a.   Build trust
              b.   Share information
              c.   Open communications
              d.   Problem solving

          36. You are working to estimate the activity resources you need for your new
              passenger train that your company will develop, own, and operate. It is to
              be able to travel at the speed of light, be quiet, and to be luxurious with no
              breakdowns in service. The goal is to test its appeal along a busy interstate
              highway system with stops only in three major cities. As you do so, you
              determined it would be helpful in addition to determining the needed
              resources to prepare a(n)--
              a.   RACI
              b.   RAM
              c.   RBS
              d.   OBS

37. A key benefit of the Plan Resource Management process is to determine the
    project organization chart. Therefore, an important first step is to--
   a.   Create the WBS and let it determine the project organizational structure
   b.   Review the project management plan
   c.   Review the project charter
   d.   Develop a project schedule, including a top-down flowchart, and identify
        the functional areas to perform each task

38. Assume you decide to prepare a role-responsibility-authority form as you
    work on your project resource management plan. This form--
   a.   Provides a visual representation of resource allocation
   b.   Provides detailed descriptions of team member responsibilities
   c.   Sets priorities as to when scarce resources should be scheduled
   d.   Shows whether the team is collocated or virtual

39. Assume you are estimating the activity resources you will need to make
    dirigibles a safe and fast way to travel. For this project, you will need a
    number of specialists as well as generalists to communicate externally as
    to the value of using a dirigible and its safety record. You also will need
    materials and equipment. As you work to estimate the resources, you believe
    it would be useful to consider--
   a.   Resource calendars
   b.   Parametric estimates
   c.   Team preferences
   d.   Resource requirements

40. Determining the method and the timing of releasing team members should
    be included in the--
   a.   Staff acquisition plan
   b.   Resource management plan
   c.   Staffing management plan
   d.   Project training plan

Answer Key

 1. b. Model professional and ethical behavior
       The project manager is both the leader and manager of the project
       team. The project manager invests effort in acquiring team members,
       managing them, motivating them to do their best work, and
       empowering the team. The best approach is to have a participative team
       atmosphere from the start. One key area of influence for the project
       manager is to be aware of and ascribe to professional and ethical
       behavior and encourage the team to do the same. If the organization
       lacks its own code of conduct, PMI's is one to follow. [Planning]
       PMI(R), PMBOK(R) Guide, 2017,
       PMI(R) PMP Examination Content Outline, 2015, Planning, 6, Task 5

 2. c. Help team members work together effectively
       Team building is an interpersonal and team skill in the Develop Project
       Team process. It involves conducting activities that enhance the team's
       social relations and foster a collaborative and cooperative working
       relationship. Team building may consist of five minutes on an agenda
       of a status meeting to an off-site facilitated event. The objective of team
       building is the answer to this question. Although team building is a
       necessity in the early stage of a project, it is not a one-time activity and
       is done continuously during the project [Executing]

       PMI(R) PMP Examination Content Outline, 2015, Executing, 8, Task 2

 3. c. Use agreements
       Agreements and contracts are common in construction projects.
       Agreements are an input to the Control Resources process. These
       agreements are the basis for all resources external to the organization
       as they define when new, unplanned resources are required or when
       issues arise with current resources. They also define the terms and
       conditions and describe how long the resources will be required and
       how to release them when they are no longer needed. The key words
       in the question are leased resources. As the project manager, it is your
       responsibility to follow the terms in the lease and return the resources
       as quickly as possible, so the lease does not continue too long or is
       forgotten. [Monitoring and Controlling]

         4. d. Cultural differences
                 People from different cultures may react in different ways from your
                 culture in term of recognition and rewards. The purpose of recognition
                 and rewards is rewarding desirable behavior. For rewards to be desired,
                 they should satisfy a need the team member values. Reward decisions
                 are made throughout the project both formally and informally. They
                 are a tool and technique in the Develop Project Team process since it
                 involves recognizing and rewarding desirable behavior. [Executing]

         5. d. Colocation
                 Colocation is the placement of or many or all of the most active team
                 members in the same physical location to enhance their ability to
                 perform as a team. It can be temporary, such as in a critical time for
                 the project, or permanent. It may have a team meeting room, a location
                 for project information, and other conveniences. It enhances increased
                 communication and a sense of community among the team members. It
                 is a tool and technique in the Develop Project Team process. [Executing]

         6. b. Enhance the use of technology
                 Although virtual teams have been used for decades, now they are the
                 norm and not the exception. They enable greater access to experts, and
                 if managed correctly and with team members in different geographic
                 areas throughout the world, a 24-hour project can be managed. While it
                 can be difficult to create an on-line environment for the team to share
                 project files, see conversation threads for issues to be resolve, and keep
                 a team calendar, the project manager can use technology to create a
                 sense of belonging to the team among its members. [Executing]

7. b. Conflicts over the relative priorities of different projects in competition
      for limited resources
       When a finite group of resources must be distributed across multiple
       projects, conflicts in work assignments will occur. Other sources of
       conflicts are scheduling and personal work styles. Conflict management
       is a tool and technique in the Manage Project Team process. Successful
       conflict management results in greater productivity and more positive
       working relationships. The success of project managers in managing
       project teams often depends on their ability to resolve conflicts since
       conflict is inevitable in the project environment. [Executing]

       PMI(R) PMP Examination Content Outline, 2015, Executing, 8, Task 2

8. c. During the execution phase
       The Manage Team process emphasizes leadership as an interpersonal team
       skill. It is important throughout the project. However, in Manage Project
       Team process, it focuses on communicating the vision of the project
       and then motivating and inspiring others to achieve high performance,
       ensuring success. Successful projects require strong leadership skills.
       Leadership involves wide-ranging skills, abilities, and actions, and different
       leadership styles are needed for each project or team. [Executing]
       PMI(R), PMBOK(R) Guide, 2017, 350
       PMI(R) PMP Examination Content Outline, 2015, Executing, 8, Task 2

9. b. McGregor's Theory X
       McGregor observed two types of managers and classified them by
       their perceptions of workers. Theory X managers thought that workers
       were lazy, needed to be watched and supervised closely, and were
       irresponsible. Theory Y managers thought that, given the correct
       conditions, workers could be trusted to seek responsibility and work
       hard at their jobs. Ideally, the Theory X approach is not followed, but
       instead a flexible leadership style is used that adapts to the changes
       in the team's maturity throughout the project life cycle. Organizational
       theory is a tool and technique in Plan Resource Management. It
       provides information as to how people, teams, and organizational units
       behave. Effective use of the techniques by the leaders in this area can
       shorten the amount of time, cost, and effort to create the Plan Resource
       Management process and its outputs. Many of the leaders in this area
       will recommend a flexible leadership style that can adapt easily to the
       constant changes faced by project manager. The organization's culture
       and structure are other important considerations. [Planning]

          10. a. Roles and responsibilities section
                  The roles and responsibilities section of this plan states the role or the
                  function to be assumed or assigned to someone on the project; the
                  authority to apply project resources, make decisions, sign approvals, accept
                  deliverables, and influence others to execute the work; the responsibilities
                  or assigned duties and work for project team members to complete
                  project activities; and competencies or the skill or capacity to complete
                  project activities. If team members lack the required competencies, overall
                  performance may be jeopardized. If there are mismatches then other
                  strategies are needed such as training, reassignment, hiring someone else,
                  schedule changes, or scope changes. [Planning]

          11. a. Enhanced project performance
                  The purpose of the Develop Team process is enhanced project
                  performance. It is accomplished by improving competencies, team
                  member interaction, and the overall team environment. The other
                  answers are benefits of this process. [Executing]

         12. c. Establish a team charter
                  The team charter is an output of Plan Resource Management. Its purpose
                  is to state team values, agreements, and operating guidelines. It also can
                  contain communication strategies, decision-making criteria and processes
                  to follow, describe a process to resolve conflicts, and provide meeting
                  guidelines. The best approach is to have the team prepare the charter and
                  have each team member sign it to indicate agreement with it and to show
                  commitment to it. It should be evaluated periodically to see if it is working
                  as expected, and if not, it should be changed and updated. [Planning]

         13. d. Team directory
                  The project team directory is part of project team assignments, an
                  output from the Acquire Project Team process. The team directory
                  incudes names, which can be part of the project management plan such
                  as in the project organization and schedule. [Executing]

14. b. Chart
       All of the answers are a type of chart that can be used. Also included in
       this category of data representation as a tool and technique is the work
       breakdown structure and text-oriented formats. Most project managers
       use a hierarchical, matrix, or text-based format. Some use all methods. A
       hierarchical method, for example, is useful for high--level roles, while a
       text-based format is helpful to document detailed responsibilities. [Planning]

15. a. Problem solving
       In the Control Resources process, problem solving is a tool and
       technique to use in this type of situation as in this question. It uses
       a set of tools the project manager can use to solve problems that
       can arise in this process. Steps in problem solving are to: identify
       the problem, define it, investigate, analyze it, solve it, and check the
       solution. [Monitoring and Controlling]

16. b. Authority section
       Authority refers to the right to apply project resources, make decisions,
       accept deliverables, sign approvals, and influence others to want to
       do the project work. Examples include selecting methods to complete
       activities, quality acceptance criteria, and responding to variances in the
       project. The individual authority of each team member should match
       their individual responsibilities; when this is done it is easier for the
       team members to do their work. This is documented in the authority
       section in the resource management plan. [Planning]
       PMI(R), PMBOK(R) Guide, 2017, 318
       PMI(R) PMP Examination Content Outline, 2015, Planning, 6, Task 5

17. d. Resource management plan
       The resource management plan is the key output of Plan Resource
       Management. It provides guidance as to how resources should be
       acquired, categorized, allocated, managed, and controlled. While it
       has a number of sections, the one that is pertinent to this question is
       acquiring resources in which guidance as to how to acquire team and
       physical resources is provided. [Planning]

          18. c. Resolve it in a timely way
                  In the Develop Project Team process, interpersonal and team skills are
                  a tool and technique. Within this category is conflict management. It
                  is necessary when there are conflicts that the project manager resolves
                  them as quickly as possible. While there are a variety of approaches to
                  use, the quicker it is resolved and communicated to the affected people,
                  the less likely it is to spread and become a larger conflict affecting more
                  people. [Executing]

          19. b. Include a human resource representative in your RAM chart
                  As you prepare your resource management plan, charts are a tool
                  and technique to use. In this situation, using a variant of the resource
                  assignment matrix, you can use a RACI (responsible, accountable,
                  consult, and inform) chart and show various activities and who is
                  responsible in each category in the four areas. In it, a human resources
                  representative can be shown as someone to consult in certain situations.
                  The assigned resources in this chart can be people or groups. [Planning]

         20. a. Is in the storming stage
                  Team development leads to improved team performance, which
                  ultimately results in improved project performance. According to the
                  model developed by Bruce Tuckman, your team is one that is in the
                  storming stage, and you believe this off-site event can help them pass
                  through it quickly, so they can reach the norming stage. Storming is
                  when the team begins to address the work of the project, has technical
                  decisions to make, and needs to follow the project management
                  approach. It is easy for the team to be one that is counterproductive
                  in this stage if they are not collaborative or open to different ideas.

21. c. Collaborating
       Collaborating or problem solving is an effective technique for managing
       conflict when a project is too important to be compromised. It involves
       incorporating multiple insights and viewpoints from people with
       different perspectives and offers a good opportunity to learn from
       others. It provides a long-term resolution. It requires a cooperative
       attitude and open dialogue that typically leads to consensus and
       commitment. [Executing]

22. a. The organizational structure of your company
       Enterprise environmental factors can influence the Develop Resource
       Management process. The organizational structure of the performing
       organization determines whether the project manager's role is a strong
       one (as in a strong matrix) or a weak one (as in a weak matrix). Other
       examples of enterprise environmental factors are the organization's
       culture, geographic dispersion of team members, existing human
       resources competencies and availability, and marketplace conditions.

23. c. Improving feelings of trust and agreement
       Developing a project team improves people skills, technical
       competencies, and the overall team environment and project
       performance. Improving feelings of trust and agreement among team
       members can raise morale, lessen conflicts, and increase team work.

          24. d. Provide individual and team assessments
                   As a tool and technique in the Develop Team process, individual
                   and team assessments are used to give the project manager and the
                   team insight into areas of strength and areas in need of improvement.
                   They can help the project manager assess team member preferences,
                   aspirations, how they process and organize information, make
                   decisions, and interact with people. Tools such as attitude surveys,
                   structured interviews, ability tests, and focus groups can be used. By
                   using these types of tools, the objective is to improve understanding,
                   trust, commitment, and communications among the team, which can
                   facilitate a more productive team for the remainder of the project.

          25. c. Work with your team to prepare a responsibility assignment matrix
                   The responsibility assignment matrix (RAM) defines project roles and
                   responsibilities in terms of work packages and activities. On large
                   projects, a high-level RAM can define responsibilities of a project
                   team, group, or unit for each WBS component. Lower-level RAMs are
                   used in the team to show roles, responsibilities, and levels of authority
                   for specific activities. The matrix shows all activities associated with
                   one person, and all people associated with an activity. It is a tool
                   and technique in data representation in Plan Resource Management.

          26. d. Meetings
                   The key words in the question is the project manager seeks opinions
                   of others. Of the various estimating approaches available in the four
                   answers, meetings are the perfect choice. By using meetings, the project
                   manager can hold meetings with functional managers, the project
                   sponsor, selected stakeholders, and others in the organization. The
                   objective is to estimate needed resources per activity, level of effort,
                   skills required, and the materials needed. [Planning]

27. b. Build on the meetings you held with the key people and use
       influencing skills
       Resources are scarce in most organizations. The best approach to
       follow is to effectively negotiate and influence others who are in a
       position to provide the resources needed for the team and the project.
       If the resources cannot be acquired and if external procurement is not
       available, the project is in trouble from the start and may need to be put
       on hold until resources can be provided. [Executing]

28. b. Economic factors
       During the process of Acquire Resources, the project manager may
       be required to assign alternative resources. Examples of constraints
       are economic factors or previous assignments to other projects. The
       project manager then may need to assign people who perhaps have
       different competencies or costs, provided there is no violation of legal,
       regulatory, mandatory, or other specific criteria. [Executing]

29. c. Attitude
       Attitude is used to determine one's ability to work with others as
       a cohesive team. Other selection criteria for team resources are
       experience, knowledge, skills, and international factors. A multi-criteria
       approach is useful as the criteria are developed and used to rate or
       score potential resources, such as those internal to the organization
       or external to it. The criteria also can be weighted according to their
       importance, and values can be changed for different types of resources.

          30. b. Your team is in the forming stage
                   Even if team members have worked together previously, it cannot be
                   assumed they will immediately be a high-performing team. According
                   to the Tuchman team development model, all teams have a forming
                   stage in which the team meets and learns about the project and their
                   formal roles and responsibilities. At this time, team members are
                   independent and not as open in this phase. This model further goes on
                   to the storming stage, norming stage, performing stage, and adjourning
                   stage. However, even if the team is in the norming or performing stage,
                   if a team member leaves and/or a new person joins, the team will
                   revert back to the forming stage. [Executing]

          31. a. Guiding resource selection
                   The purpose of the Acquire Resources process is to obtain team
                   members, facilities, equipment, supplies, and any other resources
                   needed to do the work. The benefit of this process is the answer to
                   the question as well as assigning them to activities. Resources can be
                   internal or external to the organization. The project manager and the
                   team may or may not have a direct control over resource selection
                   because of collective bargaining as an example. Other examples are use
                   of contractor personnel, a matrix environment, reporting relationships,
                   or other reasons. [Executing]

          32. b. Pre-assignments
                   Pre-assignments are a tool and technique in the Acquire Resources
                   process. While you were listed in the proposal in this question as the
                   project manager, in acquiring team resources, or physical resources,
                   other resources also may have been listed in the proposal as well. Pre-
                   assignment also includes resources identified in the Develop Project
                   Charter process or in other processes before the resource management
                   plan was completed. [Planning]

33. a. Mentoring
       Mentoring is useful as a training approach in which a person on
       the team is paired with someone with more experience, hopefully
       from elsewhere in the organization. The objective is to work one-on-
       one to address issues the mentee may have and determine possible
       approaches to resolve them or to address other areas of concern. For
       it to be effective, a mentoring plan should be prepared, time needs to
       be set aside for mentoring sessions, the mentor should receive training
       in how to approach it, and the mentee must want to do it. While it is
       useful with junior-level employees with a more seasoned person in
       the organization, it also can be used in reverse. For example, assume
       a senior-level team member is having problems adapting to a new
       enterprise resource planning software system, he or she could be
       mentored by a more junior-level person who may have been involved
       in its design and implementation. Mentoring is not coaching, as
       coaching is an approach that is directing, while mentoring is something
       one may express an interest in pursuing. Answer b is an output of this
       process. [Executing]

34. b. They assist in determining future team requirements
       Work performance reports are an input in the Manage Team process.
       These reports are physical or electronic representations used to
       determine decisions, actions, or awareness. In the Manage Team
       process, they also include results from schedule, cost, and quality
       control and scope validation. The information from the performance
       reports and any forecasts are used to determine future resource
       requirements, along with rewards and recognition. They also may be
       used to update the resource management plan. [Executing]

          35. b. Share information
                   Team performance assessments are an output of the Develop Team
                   process. The objective is to assess the project team's effectiveness. By
                   doing so, effective team development strategies and activities should
                   increase the team's performance, which then increases the potential to
                   meet the project objectives. Indicators such as sharing information can
                   be used to change from a knowledge is power approach to a knowing
                   sharing is power approach and shows the team members are working
                   together to not have duplicative work under way. If information and
                   experiences are shared openly, it can help team members improve
                   project performance. These team assessments also assist the project
                   manager in identifying specific training activities or changes to improve
                   team performance and to identify any resources needed to achieve and
                   implement the assessment recommendations. [Executing]

          36. c. RBS
                   While the WBS shows how project deliverables are broken down
                   into work packages to show high-level areas of responsibility, the
                   organizational breakdown structure (OBS) is arranged according to the
                   organization's departments, units, or teams with the work packages
                   listed under each one as appropriate. The resource breakdown structure
                   (RBS) is a hierarchical list of resources related by category and resource
                   type used to facilitate and control the work of the project. Each
                   descending lower level represents an increasing detailed description of
                   the resource unit that is small enough to be used in conjunction with
                   the WBS to enable the work to be planned, monitored, and controlled.
                   It contains all resources, not solely people. Examples of categories
                   are labor, materials, equipment, and supplies. Resource types include
                   skill level, grade level, and required certifications. In the Estimate
                   Activity Resources process, it is used to acquire and monitor resources.

37. c. Review the project charter
       The first input in the Plan Resource Management plan process is
       to review the project charter as it describes the high-level project
       description and requirements. It also identifies the key list of
       stakeholders, summary milestones, and preapproved financial resources,
       which may influence project resource management. In preparing the
       resource plan, it is useful to determine and identify an approach where
       you can ensure sufficient resources are available for the project in the
       planning phase to complete the project. Resources are scarce, and
       project managers often compete for them. The signed charter gives
       the project manager the authority to assign resources to the project
       and also has the available financial resources. This means the project
       is important in terms of the overall project portfolio as it has been
       chartered. The benefit of this processes is it identifies the approach and
       level of management of the project needed for managing the resources
       considering the project's size and complexity. [Planning]

38. b. Provides detailed descriptions of team member responsibilities
       In preparing the resource management plan, data representation is
       a tool and technique to use. Various charts are part of this tool and
       technique to document and communicate team member roles and
       responsibilities. While many consider the RAM or RACI charts, not
       to be overlooked is a text-oriented format, which may be a position
       description or a role-responsibility-authority form. These documents
       provide information such as responsibilities, authority, competencies,
       and qualifications. They may be in an outline form and often then are
       templates for future projects. [Planning]

          39. a. Resource calendars
                  Resource calendars are an input to the Estimate Activity Resources
                  process. They are useful since they identify the working days, shifts,
                  start and end times of normal business hours, weekends, and public
                  holidays when each resource is available. Information on the resources,
                  including more than just people, are available during a planned activity
                  period is used to estimate resource use. These calendars also show
                  how long the team and physical resources will be available. Information
                  about resource use may be at the activity or project level. The calendars
                  can include items such as resource experience, skill level, and
                  geographic locations. [Planning]

         40. b. Resource management plan
                  The resource management plan is the key output of Plan Resource
                  Management. This plan provides guidance on categorizing project
                  resources, allocating them, managing them, and releasing them. While
                  there are several sections in this plan, one specifically addresses project
                  team resource management. It is here guidance on how project team
                  resources should be defined, staffed, managed, and eventually released.

Answer Key
 1. b. Enables an effective and efficient information flow between the project
       team and its stakeholders
       The answer is the key benefit of the Manage Communications process.
       In addition, the Manage Communications process involves collection,
       creation, distribution, storage, retrieval, management, monitoring, and
       disposition of information about the project. [Executing]
       PMI(R), PMBOK(R) Guide, 2017, 379
       PMI(R) PMP Examination Content Outline, 2015, Executing, 8, Task 6

 2. a. Methods that will be used to convey information
       These methods or technologies can include memos, e-mails, press
       releases, and social media. They are one of several items to include
       in this plan. This plan, an output of the Plan Communications
       Management process, describes how project communications will be
       planned, structured, implemented, and monitored. [Planning]
       PMI(R), PMBOK(R) Guide, 2017, 377
       PMI(R) PMP Examination Content Outline, 2015, Planning, 6, Task 6

 3. b. Using effective communications planning
       Cultural awareness recognizes the differences between people,
       groups, and organizations. The project manager and team adapt
       the communications strategy to these differences. The objective is
       to minimize any misunderstandings and miscommunications from
       cultural differences within the project's stakeholders. By being aware
       of the cultural differences and having sensitivity to them, the project
       manager can use this information to effectively plan communications
       for the project. Further, it is useful to include a glossary of common
       terminology in the communications management plan. [Planning]
       PMI(R), PMBOK(R) Guide, 2017, 376-377
       PMI(R) PMP Examination Content Outline, 2015, Planning, 6, Task 6

 4. b. Stakeholder register
       The stakeholder register and the requirements documentation are
       two project documents that are an input to the Plan Communications
       Management process. The stakeholder register contains identification
       information, assessment information, and stakeholder classification. It is
       used to help plan communications activities with stakeholders. [Planning]

           5. b. Sender-receiver model
                   Communications models are a tool and technique in Plan
                   Communications Management. In the sender-receiver model,
                   communications are a process with two parties - the sender and
                   receiver. Its purpose is to ensure the message is delivered rather than
                   focusing on whether it was understood. It has three steps. First, the
                   message is encoded into symbols, which can include test, sound,
                   or another medium. Second, the message is transmitted through a
                   communication channel. Third, the data are decoded or translated by
                   the receiver to a form that is useful. The key words in this question are
                   the person is new project manager so he or she would probably use
                   this simpler approach. [Planning]
                   PMI(R), PMBOK(R) Guide, 2017, 371
                   PMI(R) PMP Examination Content Outline, 2017, Planning, 6, Task 6

           6. c. Remove barriers that affect comprehension
                   Active listening is one of the interpersonal and team skills used in
                   Manage Communications. While the tendency is to work to improve
                   one's presentation skills, less attention is given to improving one's
                   listening skills. With active listening the focus is on acknowledging,
                   clarifying, and confirming information and to understand and then
                   remove any barriers to communications. It Is necessary to remove these
                   barriers as they may affect comprehension. It also means being engaged
                   with the speaker and summarizing conversations for an attentive
                   information exchange. [Executing]
                   PMI(R), PMBOK(R) Guide, 2017, 363, 366
                   PMI(R) PMP Examination Content Outline, 2015, Executing, 8, Task 6

            7. a. Formal communication
                   Formal communication provides direction and control for project
                   team members and other employees. They consist of regular and ad
                   hoc meetings, meeting agendas, minutes, stakeholder presentations,
                   and briefings. Formal communications are examples of organizational
                   process assets used in Communications Management.

8. a. Horizontal
       Communication activities have many potential dimensions to consider
       in exchanging information between the sender and the receiver.
       Horizontal communication occurs between or among peers of the
       project manager or the team, that is, across, rather than up and down,
       the organization. [Executing]
       PMI(R), PMBOK(R) Guide, 2017, 361
       PMI(R) PMP Examination Content Outline, 2015, Executing, 8, Task 6

 9. b. Providing background information
       Presentations are held regularly on projects to update and communicate
       project information and to respond to requests from stakeholders
       for the information. They are a communication skill used in Manage
       Communications. In this situation the project manager has been
       conducting these types of presentations regularly. Even so, he or she
       should begin with a brief overview of background information about
       the project since some of the stakeholders who are attending have
       multiple projects in which they are involved to some degree. This
       background information can be used to support decision making. The
       presentation can serve as a progress report to stakeholders, can provide
       general information about the project and its objectives such that the
       project may raise the profile of the work under way, and can provide
       specific information to increase understanding and support of the
       project's objectives. [Executing]
       PMI(R), PMBOK(R) Guide, 2017, 384
       PMI(R) PMP Examination Content Outline, 2015, Executing, 8, Task 6

10. b. Performing communications planning early
       On most projects, communications planning should be performed very
       early such as during stakeholder identification and when the project
       management plan is prepared. This approach then allows appropriate
       resources, such as time and budget, to be allocated to communications
       activities. The results of Plan Communications Management should be
       reviewed regularly and updated as needed. The goal is to ensure the
       communications management plan recognizes the diverse stakeholders
       involved with the project as the stakeholder community often changes.
       It also can be reviewed at the beginning of a new project phase.

          11. d. Determine the emotional state
                   The key words in this question is that technical information is being
                   transmitted to team members in different countries. This means the
                   cross-cultural communications model is useful to ensure the meaning of
                   the message is understood. People from different cultures communicate
                   in different ways. The cross-cultural communications model emphasizes
                   the idea that the message and how it is sent are influenced by the
                   sender's current emotional state. Knowledge transfer, background,
                   personality, and biases can influence how the message is received and
                   interpreted. [Planning]
                   PMI(R), PMBOK(R) Guide, 2017, 373
                   PMI(R) PMP Examination Content Outline, 2015, Planning, 6, Task 6

          12. d. Increased conflict
                   Barriers to communication lead to a poor flow of information.
                   Accordingly, messages are misinterpreted by recipients, thereby
                   creating different perceptions, understanding, and frames of reference.
                   Left unchecked, poor communication increases conflict among
                   project stakeholders, which causes the other problems listed to arise.
                   Then, the project manager must work actively to resolve conflicts so
                   disruptive impacts are prevented. Conflict management is included as
                   a tool and technique under interpersonal and team skills in Manage
                   Communications. [Executing]
                   PMI(R), PMBOK(R) Guide, 2017, 386

          13. a. Each side may misinterpret what the other side has said
                   Effective communication is the key to successful negotiation, a key
                   communication skill that the project manager and the team should
                   enhance. Misunderstanding is the most common communication
                   problem. A project manager should listen actively, acknowledge what is
                   being said, and speak for a purpose. It is essential to listen attentively
                   and communicate articulately. Negotiation is necessary to achieve
                   mutually acceptable agreements between both parties and to reduce
                   approval or delays in decision making. Negotiation is an integral part
                   of project management and if done well increases the probability of
                   project success. [Executing]

14. a. Interactive communications
       The types of communications are a tool and technique in Plan
       Communications Management. While there are several approaches
       to use, the key words in this question are real time. Interactive
       communication involves exchanging information in real time between
       two or more parties. It uses meetings, phone calls, instant messages,
       social media, and video conferencing. [Planning]
       PMI(R), PMBOK(R) Guide, 2017, 374
       PMI(R) PMP Examination Content Outline, 2015, Planning, 6, Task 6

15. a. Stakeholder register
       In the Plan Communications Management process the two documents
       that may be updated are the project schedule and the stakeholder
       register. The stakeholder register is an input to this process but may be
       changed as the communications management plan is prepared based
       on communications requirements analysis. The stakeholder register then
       is updated to reflect planned communications to project stakeholders.

       PMI(R), PMBOK(R) Guide, 2017, 378
       PMI(R) PMP Examination Content Outline, 2015, Planning, 6, Task 6

16. b. Responsibilities
       Among other things, the communications management plan should
       identify the person responsible for communicating the information and
       the person responsible for authorizing the release of any confidential
       information. [Planning]
       PMI(R), PMBOK(R) Guide, 2017, 377
       PMI(R) PMP Examination Content Outline, 2015, Planning, 6, Task 6

17. b. Negotiations
       Negotiation if done well increases the probability of project success and
       involves conferring with others of shared or opposed interests with a
       view toward compromise. In Manage Communications, it is useful to
       receive feedback concerning one's negotiating skills. Other examples
       where feedback is useful are coaching and mentoring. Feedback
       involves reactions to communications, a deliverable, or a situation. It
       supports interaction between the project manager, the team, and other
       stakeholders. [Executing]

          18. c. Ensuring an optimal information flow among all communication
                 participants
                   While Monitor Communications confirm the communication needs of
                   project stakeholders are met, the key benefit is to ensure an optimal
                   information flow among all communication participants at any moment
                   in time. This process determines if the planned communications
                   artifacts and activities have had the desired effect of increasing or
                   maintaining stakeholder support for the project. This process is
                   performed throughout the project. This process can trigger the iteration
                   of the Plan Communications Management and Manage Communications
                   processes to improve communications effectiveness by possibly
                   amending the communications management plan. [Monitoring and

          19. a. Provides the project's history
                   The issue log is a project document that is an input to Monitor
                   Communications. It is helpful because it provides the project history,
                   serves as a record of stakeholder engagement issues, and describes how
                   these issues were resolved. [Monitoring and Controlling]

          20. c. Provide information at an appropriate level for each stakeholder
                   Project reporting is a tool and technique in Manage Communications.
                   It involves collecting and distributing project information. These
                   reports range from simple status reports to more elaborate reports. The
                   emphasis is to ensure reports are adapted to provide the information
                   in a format and at the right level of detail for each stakeholder. Reports
                   may be prepared on a regular or an exception basis. In Manage
                   Communications ad hoc reports, presentations, and other project
                   communications are made available. [Executing]

21. c. Part of your project management information system
       The PMIS is a tool and technique in Manage Communications. It
       ensures stakeholders can easily retrieve needed information in a timely
       way. Project information is managed and distributed in three ways,
       one of which is social media management. Social media consists of
       websites, web publishing, blogs, and applications. The purpose is to
       engage with stakeholders and also provide the opportunity to form
       online communities. [Executing]

22. a. You need to determine your stakeholders' information needs.
       Communications is considered one of the single most powerful
       indicators of project success or failure. Communications requirements
       analysis is a tool and technique in Plan Communications Management.
       By analyzing communications requirements, you can determine the
       information needs of your stakeholders. By doing this analysis, it then
       leads to the ability to combine the type and format of information
       needs and an analysis of the value of the information. A number
       different sources can be used as you analyze communications
       requirements. [Planning]

23. a. Aware of the communication styles of the other parties
       A communication styles assessment is an interpersonal and team skill,
       which is a tool and technique in Plan Communications Management.
       This assessment is helpful to assess the communication styles and
       identify the preferred method, format, and content stakeholders prefer
       for planned communications. This assessment often is used when some
       stakeholders have been identified as ones who are not supporters of
       the project, and it may follow a stakeholder engagement assessment.

        24. b. Issue log
                 Monitor Communications often entails the need to update project
                 documents, including the issue log. This log may require updates as
                 new issues may be raised. Other project documents that may require
                 updates are the lessons learned register and the stakeholder register.

        25. a. Determine the appropriate writing style
                 In Manage Communications, it goes further than distributing relevant
                 information as its objective is to ensure the information being
                 communicated has been gathered and received by the intended people.
                 It also provides the opportunity for stakeholders to make requests for
                 further information. While there are a variety of methods to distribute
                 information, written communication is used frequently. It is easy for
                 the receiver to misinterpret it, but the objective is for the receiver to
                 understand it and use it as desired. Writing style then is a consideration
                 and involves the use of active voice or passive voice, sentence structure,
                 and word choice. [Executing]

        26. b. Escalation processes
                 Numerous items, including escalation processes, are part of the
                 communications management plan. Business issues may arise that
                 cannot be resolved at a lower staff level. During such a time, an
                 escalation process is required, and it should show time frames and the
                 names of people in the management chain who will work to resolve
                 these issues. [Planning]

27. b. The urgency of the need for information
        Communications technology is a tool and technique in Plan
        Communications. The methods used to convey information to
        stakeholders will vary. Conversations, meetings, written documents, data
        bases, social media, and web sites are used, among others. Determining
        the urgency of the need for information will affect the choice of
        technology. The urgency, frequency, and format will vary from project
        to project as there is no one approach that can be used. It even can
        vary within different phases of the project. [Panning]
        PMI(R), PMBOK(R) Guide, 2017, 370
        PMI(R) PMP Examination Content Outline, 2015, Planning, 6, Task 6

28. a. Meeting with the client at the start of the project to discuss the types of
       reports to prepare
        The communications management plan is prepared during Plan
        Communications Management. The plan should include a description
        of the information to be distributed such as format, content, level of
        detail, as well as conventions and definitions to be used. It also can
        include templates and guidelines for meetings and e-mails. In preparing
        this plan, and especially in this scenario in the question, meetings are
        a useful tool and technique. They can be used, among other things,
        to determine the most appropriate way to update and communicate
        project information and to respond to stakeholders. By having client
        representatives as part of such meetings, the problems in this scenario
        may have been prevented. [Planning]

29. c. Knowledge repositories
        Knowledge repositories, along with Intranet sites, e-learning,
        and lessons learned data bases, are examples of methods of pull
        communications. Pull communications are a type of communication
        method as a tool and technique in Plan Communications Management.
        They are used for large volumes of information or for large audiences
        and require recipients to access communication content at their own
        discretion, recognizing the need to have security provisions in place as
        needed. [Planning]

         30. d. Determine the communications requirements
                  The project team must conduct an analysis of stakeholder
                  communications requirements to ensure that stakeholders are receiving
                  the information required to participate in the project. For example,
                  stakeholders typically require performance reports for information
                  purposes. Such information requirements should be included in the
                  communications management plan. Conducting a communications
                  requirements analysis to determine the stakeholders' information needs
                  is a tool and technique in the Plan Communications process. The
                  other answers are considerations as you conduct the communications
                  requirements analysis. [Planning]
                  PMI(R), PMBOK(R) Guide, 2017, 369-370
                  PMI(R) PMP Examination Content Outline, 2015, Planning, 5, Task 6

          31. c. Monitor communications
                  Work performance information, an output of Monitor Communications,
                  provides information as to how project communications were
                  performed by comparing the communications that were used against
                  those that were planned. It considers feedback on communications to
                  assess effectiveness. [Monitoring and Controlling]

                  Controlling, 9, Task 1

         32. d. Circulating them to stakeholders as defined in the communications
                management plan
                  Work performance reports are distributed to stakeholders through
                  processes in the communications management plan. They can include
                  status and progress reports. They can contain earned value data, trends
                  and forecasts, reserve burndown charts, defect histograms, contract
                  data, and risk summaries. These reports are an input to Manage
                  Communications. [Executing]

33. c. Manage Communications
       Planned and ad hoc reports and presentations are a useful
       organizational process asset to update from Manage Communications.
       The other group of organizational process assets to update are project
       records, such as correspondence, memos, meeting minutes, and other
       documents used on the project. [Executing]
       PMI(R), PMBOK(R) Guide, 2017, 388
       PMI(R) PMP Examination Content Outline, 2015, Executing, 8, Task 6

34. c. Nonverbal
       Communications skills include nonverbal communications. Examples
       are body language, as it transmits messages through gestures, tone
       of voice, and facial expressions. Mirroring and eye contact also are
       important in this category. The project manager and the team members
       should be aware as to how their use of nonverbal communications is
       noted by others. [Executing]
       PMI(R), PMBOK(R) Guide, 2017, 384
       PMI(R) PMP Examination Content Outline, 2015, Executing, 8, Task 6

35. a. Project management plan
       As an output of the Monitor Communications process, there may be
       changes to the communications management plan to update it to
       make it more effective. Also, there may be changes to the stakeholder
       engagement plan to reflect their actual situation, communications needs,
       and their importance. Changes to these plans then trigger changes to
       the project management plan. These changes follow the organization's
       change control process. [Monitoring and Controlling]

       PMI(R) PMP Examination Content Outline, 2015, Monitoring and
       Controlling, 9, Task 2

36. c. Hold meetings
       Meetings are a tool and technique in Monitor Communications. They
       can be face to face or online and in different locations and may
       include not only the project team but also suppliers, vendors, and other
       stakeholders. It is important to hold these meetings for decision making,
       to respond to requests from stakeholders, and to have discussions with
       suppliers, vendors, and other stakeholders. [Monitoring and Controlling]

          37. b. Review distributed information
                   Work performance data are an input in Monitor Communications.
                   These data organize and summarize the types and quantities of
                   communications. [Monitoring and Controlling]
                   PMI(R), PMBOK(R) Guide, 2017, 390

                   Controlling, 9, Task 1

          38. a. The project's organizational culture has an effect on the project's
                 communications requirements.
                   Enterprise environmental factors undoubtedly will influence the
                   project's success and must be considered because communication must
                   be adapted to the project environment. They are an input to the Plan
                   Communications Management Plan process. The organization's culture,
                   political climate, and governance framework are examples of enterprise
                   environmental factors to consider. [Planning]
                   PMI(R), PMBOK(R) Guide, 2017

          39. b. Social media policies
                   Sensitivity and confidentiality of information is part of communications
                   technology, an input to Plan Communications. It is necessary to
                   consider if the information is sensitive or confidential and whether
                   additional security measures are needed. Also, with the increase in
                   social media, employees must ensure appropriate behavior, security,
                   and the protection of proprietary information are followed. [Planning]

          40. b. Push communications are preferred.
                   Communication methods are an input to Plan Communications
                   Management. When push communications are used, information is sent
                   directly to specific recipients who want to receive it. This approach
                   shows the information is distributed, but it does not show it was
                   actually received or was understood. It includes letters, memos, reports,
                   emails, faxes, voice mails, blogs, and press releases. [Planning]

Practice Questions
   INSTRUCTIONS: Note the most suitable answer for each multiple-choice
   question in the appropriate space on the answer sheet.
 1. As the project manager, you have the option of proposing one of three systems
    to a client: a full-feature system that not only satisfies the minimum requirements
    but also offers numerous special functions (the "Mercedes"); a system that meets
    the client's minimum requirements (the "Smart Car"); and a system that satisfies
    the minimum requirements plus has a few extra features (the "Toyota"). The
    on-time records and associated profits and losses are depicted on the below
    decision tree. What is the expected monetary value of the "Toyota" system?

           4. Projects are particularly susceptible to risk because--
             a. People assume there will be problems
             b. There is uncertainty in all projects
             c. Project management tools are generally unavailable at the project team
                level
             d. There are never enough resources to do the job

           5. As project manager, you have assembled the team to prepare a risk
              management plan for your project. It is to describe how risk management
              will be handled on your project. Within this plan, there is a--

             b.   WBS
             c.   RBS
             d.   CCB

           6. You are working on identifying possible risks to your project to develop a
              nutritional supplement. You want to develop a comprehensive list of risks
              that can be addressed later through qualitative and quantitative risk analysis.
              A data gathering technique used to identify risks is--
             a.   Documentation reviews
             b.   Probability and impact analysis
             c.   Prompt lists

 7. Assume you have prepared your risk management plan, identified possible
    risks, analyzed them, and determined possible responses if they occur. Now
    it is time to Implement Risk Responses. The benefit of this process is to--
   a. Present a sequence of decision choices to decision makers
   b. Ensure agreed-upon risk response are executed as planned
   c. Ensure actions to implement risks are only taken from people who are
      on the team
   d. Help take into account the attitudes of the decision makers toward risk

 8. You are working Monitor Risks on your manufacturing project. You are
    fortunate to have a subject matter expert available with a specialty in risk
    management to assist you and your team. As you work to monitor these
    risks, you want to make sure your team and stakeholders are aware of--
   a.   Any unplanned response to a negative risk event
   b.   A plan of action to follow when something unexpected occurs
   c.   The level of overall project risk
   d.   A proactive, planned method of responding to risks

          11. A project health check identified a risk that your project would not be
              completed on time. You and your team are working to prevent this from
              occurring as you work to Implement Risk Responses. You and your team
              know risk management is continuous on projects, and new risks will
              occur. When they do occur analysis is needed, and a response strategy is
              determined. Your goal is to see if the strategy is executed. As you do so,
              you should use--
             a.   Negotiations
             b.   Influencing skills
             c.   Schedule network diagram and duration estimates
             d.   Probability/impact risk rating matrix

          12. You are developing radio frequency (RF) technology that will improve
              overnight package delivery to one hour. You realize that the duration, cost,
              and resource requirements for a number of activities are uncertain. You want
              a model to represent individual project risk and other sources of uncertainty.

          13. You are determining the most effective risk response to a risk one of
              your team members identified. After analyzing it and including a risk
              management expert in the analysis process, it is evident it is a risk where
              the threat is such that it is outside of your authority as the project manager
              to determine a response. In this situation, you need to--
             a. Focus on changing the project management plan to eliminate the threat
             b. Escalate it to the next highest level
             c. Solicit the advice by the head of the Enterprise Project Management

    to a medium or high risk given changes that the project may encounter.
    Therefore, you plan to--
   a.   Consider the threat level
   b.   Hold meetings
   c.   Set up a watch list
   d.   Review work performance information

Answer Key

 1. b. $44,000

                 EMVToyota = ($50,000 x 90% ) + (-$10,000 x 10% )
                          = $45,000 + (-$1,000)
                          = $44,000
       Expected monetary value analysis (EVM) is a statistical concept that
       calculates the average outcome when the future scenarios may not
       happen, considered analysis under uncertainty. The EVM opportunities
       are generally evaluated as positive values, as in this example, while
       threats are expressed as negative values. They are used in decision tree
       analysis, which is a tool and technique in quantitative risk analysis. The
       purpose is to support selecting the best of several alternative courses
       of action. The decision tree shows branches that represent different
       decisions or events. Each one has costs and related individual project
       risks. The end points of the branches show the outcome from following
       a path, which is either positive or negative. [Planning]

 2. c. Accept
       Risk exists on every project, and it is unrealistic to think it can be
       eliminated completely. There are certain risks that simply must be
       accepted because we cannot control whether or not they will occur
       (for example, an earthquake). Acceptance is a strategy for dealing with
       risk that can be used for both threats and opportunities. Using it, the
       project team decides to acknowledge the risk and not take any action.
       It is appropriate for low-priority threats or opportunities or if it is not
       possible or cost effective to address a threat opportunity in another
       way. [Planning]

         3. c. Perform Qualitative Risk Analysis
                 Risks that may happen in the near-term need urgent attention. Risk
                 urgency is part of many considerations in assessments of other risk
                 parameters, a data analysis tool and technique in Perform Qualitative
                 Risk Analysis. In assessing other parameters, the project team considers
                 other characteristics of risk, such as urgency, in addition to probability
                 or impact as the team prioritizes individual project risks for additional
                 analysis or action. The purpose of the risk urgency assessment is to
                 identify those risks that have a high likelihood of happening sooner
                 rather than later. It assesses the time when a response to the risk is
                 implemented to be effective. High urgency is shown by a short period
                 of time. [Planning]

         4. b. There is uncertainty in all projects
                 Every project has uncertainty associated with it because a project
                 by its definition is a temporary endeavor undertaken to create a
                 unique product, service, or result. Projects have varying degrees of
                 complexity. As projects work to deliver benefits, they also are working
                 with constraints and assumptions as they respond to expectations
                 of stakeholders that may conflict and change. The goal is to identify
                 and manage risks that are not covered in other project management
                 processes. If risks are not managed, they may cause the project to
                 deviate from the plan and fail to meet their objective. Effective risk
                 management contributes to successful projects. [Planning]

         5. c. RBS
                 The risk breakdown structure (RBS) is a way to group individual
                 project risks. It is a hierarchically organized depiction of potential
                 sources of risk. It helps the team consider a number of sources where
                 project risks may arise. It is useful in categorizing and identifying risks.
                 Different RBS structures are appropriate for different types of projects,
                 or the organization can use a previously prepared framework that can
                 be a simple list of categories, or it may be structured into a RBS. It is
                 described in the risk categories section of the risk management plan.

6. d. Brainstorming
       Brainstorming is a frequently used data gathering technique for
       identifying risk. It enables the project team to develop a list of potential
       risks relatively quickly. Project team members, often with invited
       experts, possibly under the direction of a facilitator, participate in
       the session. Traditional brainstorming sessions are free form, or other
       approaches may be used. Categories of risks, such as in a RBS, can
       be used as a framework. The identified risks should be described as
       brainstorming may result in ideas that may not be completely formed. It
       is part of several data gathering approaches as data gathering is a tool
       and technique in Identify Risks. [Planning]

7. b. Ensure agreed-upon risk response are executed as planned
       The purpose of the Implement Risk Response process is to implement
       agreed-upon risk responses. The key benefit is it ensures these
       responses are executed as planned such that it addresses overall project
       risk exposure, minimizes individual potential threats, and maximizes
       project opportunities. [Executing]

8. c. The level of overall project risk
       The Monitor Risk process involves monitoring the agreed-upon risk
       management plans, tracking and identifying new risks, and evaluating
       the effectiveness of risk responses throughout project. You want your
       team and other stakeholders to be aware of the current level of risk
       exposure and to recognize project work that should be continuously
       monitored for new risks, outdated risks, and changes in the level of
       overall project risk. The level of overall project risk is important to see
       if it has changed. [Monitoring and Controlling]

           9. d. Monte Carlo analysis
                  A project simulation uses a model that translates the specified detailed
                  uncertainties into their potential outcomes on project objectives and is a
                  data analysis tool and technique in Perform Quantitative Risk Analysis,
                  Simulations are typically performed using Monte Carlo analysis in which
                  a project model is computed many times. The input values for cost risk
                  simulation use project cost estimates, and for simulations of schedule
                  risks, the network diagram and duration estimates are used. [Planning]

          10. b. 13 percent

                      Probability (starting activity 4 on day 6) = (0.5)3
                                                                 = 0.125 or 13%

                  Such an approach helps to prioritize risks for further quantitative
                  analysis and to plan risk responses based on their risk rating. The rating
                  is based on the assessed probability and impact for each individual
                  risk and the impact on one or more project objectives. It uses the
                  definitions of probability and impact from the risk management plan.
                  The probability and impact matrix is a data analysis tool and technique
                  in the Perform Qualitative Risk Analysis process. [Planning]

          11. b. Influencing skills
                  In the Implement Risk Responses process, interpersonal skills are
                  a tool and technique. Within it, influencing is suggested. Some risk
                  response actions may be owned by a stakeholder who is not part of the
                  project team. These stakeholders tend to have competing demands for
                  their time, and the same applies to project team member working on
                  more than one project and working in a matrix structure. The project
                  manager or the person responsible for the project's risk management
                  activities then uses influencing to encourage risk owners to take action.

12. a. Use a probability distribution
        Representations of uncertainty is a tool and technique in quantitative
        risk analysis. With the types of uncertainties described in the question,
        the range of possible values is represented in a model as a probability
        distribution. The most common forms are triangular, normal, lognormal,
        beta, uniform, or discrete. Individual risks may be covered by the
        distribution. The best one to use should reflect the range of possible
        results for the activity. [Planning]
        PMI(R), PMBOK(R) Guide, 2017, 432
        PMI(R) PMP Examination Content Outline, 2015, Planning, 6, Task 10

13. b. Escalate it to the next highest level
        Escalate is a risk response strategy for both threats and opportunities. In
        this question, it is a threat as it is outside of the scope of this project or
        as in the question outside the scope of the project manager's authority.
        An escalated risk is managed at the program level, the portfolio level,
        or in another part of the organization; not at a project level. The project
        manager determines whom to notify and provide details of the work
        done thus far. Usually, threats are escalated to the level that is involved
        with the affected project objective for resolution if the threat would
        occur. These threats may be listed in the project's risk register, but the
        team is no longer involved with this risk. [Planning]

14. d. 56 percent
        The likelihood is determined by multiplying the probability of event
        1 by the probability of event 2. While probability investigates the
        likelihood that a specific risk will occur, impact investigates the
        possible effect on the project's objective such as schedule, quality, or
        performance. A probability and impact grid is a data representation
        tool and technique in Perform Qualitative Risk Analysis. The grid maps
        the probabilities of each risk occurrence and its impact on project
        objectives should the risk occur. The matrix can be set up to show
        individual risks by priority groups. The risks then can be prioritized
        further for additional analysis and to determine a specific response. Risk
        probabilities and impact are rated according to definitions in the risk
        management plan. [Planning]

          15. a. Identifies project assumptions
                   Project assumptions, which should be enumerated in the project scope
                   statement, are areas of uncertainty, and as such are potential causes
                   of project risk. Uncertainty of assumptions is evaluated as potential
                   causes of project risk and include project assumptions and constraints.
                   The scope statement, the WBS, and the WBS Dictionary are part of
                   the scope baseline, part of the project management plan, an input to
                   Identify Risks. [Planning]

          16. b. Hold meetings
                   Meetings are a tool and technique in Control Risks. They may be formal
                   or informal but should be used to document risk response effectiveness
                   considering both overall project risk and identified individual project
                   risks. New risks may be identified, including secondary risks in the
                   meeting. Lessons learned for this project and other projects in the
                   organization may be identified. [Monitoring and Controlling]

                   Controlling, 9, Task 4

          17. a. Risks for which the accept response is selected
                   Risk response strategies should be selected for both individual project
                   risks plus the overall project risk. The accept strategy is used when
                   no proactive risk strategy is available for overall project risk, and the
                   organization decides to continue the project even if the overall risk
                   is outside of the agreed-upon threshold. Acceptance can be active
                   or passive. If an active acceptance strategy is selected, an overall
                   contingency reserve for the project including time, money, or resources
                   is set aside should it be necessary to use it if the risk exceeds its
                   thresholds. [Planning]

18. b. Sensitivity analysis
        Sensitivity analysis, as a quantitative risk analysis data analysis tool
        and technique, helps to determine which risks or other sources of
        uncertainty have the most potential impact on the project's outcomes.
        It examines the extent to which the variations in the project's objectives
        correlate with variations in the quantitative risk analysis model. A
        tornado diagram often is used to show the calculated correlation
        coefficient for each element in the model that can affect the project
        outcomes. [Planning]
        PMI(R), PMBOK(R) Guide, 2017, 434
        PMI(R) PMP Examination Content Outline, 2015, Planning, 6, Task 10

19. d. $900,000

        E MV = ($2M x 60%) + (-$1.5M x 20%) = ($1.2M) + (-$300,000)
           = $900,000

        As another example of a quantitative risk analysis and modeling
        technique, EMV is a statistical concept in decision tree analysis that
        calculates the average outcome when the future includes scenarios that
        may or may not happen. This is an example of an opportunity with
        a positive value. Its use requires a risk-neutral assumption, and it is
        calculated by multiplying the value of each possible outcome by the
        probability of occurrence and adding the products together. [Planning]

20. a. Contingent response
        The contingent response strategy is designed for use if certain events
        occur, as in this question - a typhoon. This response plan is only
        executed under pre-defined conditions when there is time to use
        it, such as a warning that a typhoon is coming. Other examples to
        consider are if a key milestone was missed or if using it results in a
        higher priority with a seller. Risk responses using this technique may be
        called contingency plans or fallback plans. [Planning]

          21. d. Forecast potential deviation of the project at completion from cost and
                 schedule targets
                   Earned value is used for monitoring overall project performance against
                   a baseline plan. Outcomes from the analysis may forecast potential
                   deviation of the project at completion from its cost and schedule targets.
                   Deviations from the baseline plan also may indicate the potential
                   impact of threats or opportunities. It is a part of earned value data, an
                   input to Monitor Risks in work performance reports. [Monitoring and
                   Controlling]

          22. b. Assign a relative value to the impact on project objectives if the risk in
                 question occurs
                   You can develop relative or numeric, well-defined scales using agreed-
                   upon definitions by the stakeholders. When using a numeric scale, each
                   level of impact has a specific number assigned to it. Each risk then is
                   rated on its probability and impact on an objective if it does occur.
                   Evaluation of each risk's importance and priority is typically done by
                   using a look-up table or a probability and impact matrix. This matrix
                   specifies conditions of probability and impact that lead to ratings of risk
                   such as low, moderate, or high priority. Descriptive terms or numeric
                   value can be used. [Planning]
                   PMI(R), PMBOK(R) Guide, 2017, 407-408

          23. b. Product of the probability and impact of the risk
                   Using a probability and impact matrix, the project manager and
                   the team can rate a risk separately for an objective, and they can
                   develop ways to determine the overall rating for each risk. Threats
                   and opportunities can be shown in the same matrix. The risk score
                   provides a convenient way to compare risks because comparing impacts
                   or probabilities alone is meaningless. It helps guide risk responses.

24. c. Modify contingency reserves
        The purpose of the Monitor Risks process is to implement the agreed-
        upon risk responses, track risks, identify and analyze existing risks, and
        evaluate the effectiveness of project risk management. Although this
        process uses tools and techniques, this answer, among others, is an
        example as to how the Monitor Project Risks process uses performance
        information from execution. It may be necessary to determine whether
        the contingency reserves for cost or schedule need modification.

25. d. Supports the selection of the best approach of several alternatives
        Decision tree analysis is a tool and technique in Perform Quantitative
        As a graphical way to bring together information, decision tree analysis
        quantifies the likelihood of failure or opportunities and places a value
        on each decision. In the decision tree, alternative branches are shown.
        They represent different decisions or events, each one having different
        costs and individual risks. The end point in the analysis represents the
        preferred outcome. It is evaluated through expected monetary value
        analysis. [Planning]

        PMI(R) PMP Examination Content Outline, 2015, Planning, 6, Task 10

26. b. Potential risk response
        The risk register is prepared in the Identify Risks process as an
        output. It is a document in which the results of risk analysis and risk
        response planning are recorded, and as they are conducted it contains
        the outcomes of the other risk management processes. The identified
        risks are described in as much detail as is reasonable. They may use
        structured risk statements to distinguish risks from their causes and
        effects. Each risk in the register has an identification number and is
        described in as much detail as possible. Risk owners may be included.
        Potential risk responses also may be identified during the Identify Risks
        process, and if this is the case they will be confirmed in the Plan Risk
        Responses process. [Planning]

        27. b. Checklists
                 Checklists are a tool and a technique in the Identify Risks process.
                 Often, they are used as a reminder and include risks encountered
                 on similar, previous projects based on historical information and
                 knowledge. They are effective in capturing lessons learned by listing
                 specific risks that may have occurred on other projects and may be
                 relevant for this project. Generic risk checklists also are available.
                 However, while it is easy to prepare a checklist and simple to use, it is
                 impossible to make sure it covers all items relative to the project, and
                 some items on it may not apply to the project. It should be reviewed
                 occasionally during the project to update it with new information and
                 to remove any obsolete data from it. [Planning]
                 PMI(R), PMBOK(R) Guide, 2017, 414

        28. d. Reducing the probability and/or impact of an adverse risk event to an
               acceptable threshold
                 It is often more effective to take early action to reduce probability and/
                 or impact of a risk occurring on a project rather than attempting to
                 repair the damage after the risk has occurred. Examples of mitigation
                 or enhancement strategies include adopting less complex processes,
                 conducting more tests, or choosing a more stable supplier. Other
                 examples are replacing the project, changing its scope, modifying its
                 priority, and adjusting delivery times. It is a risk response strategy for
                 overall project risks. [Planning]

        29. c. Business case
                 Each project should have a business case that is used to determine
                 whether the project should be initiated. It lists the objectives and
                 reasons the project should be done and helps measure success at the
                 end of the project against these objectives. One section of the business
                 case is an analysis of the situation. This section identifies any known
                 risks at the time the business case is prepared. Decision makers, since
                 resources are scarce and not all proposed projects can be pursued, can
                 review these risks a part of the decision-making process. [Planning]

30. c. Schedule baseline and cost baseline
       The cost and schedule baselines of a project are two areas significantly
       affected by risk occurrences. Information on these two areas, because
       of their quantitative nature, provides excellent input to the Perform
       Quantitative Risk Analysis process to help determine overall impact
       and to provide guidelines on establishing and managing risks. Both
       baselines are the starting point where the effect of individual risks can
       be evaluated. [Planning]

31. c. Define how best to conduct risk management activities
       Meetings are a tool and technique in the Plan Risk Management
       process. Typical attendees are the project manager, selected team
       members, key stakeholders, anyone in the organization with authority
       to manage the risk management planning and execution activities [such
       as a member of a PMO with expertise in this area or a member of the
       core team with this expertise], and others as needed. Customers, sellers,
       and regulators external to the organization may be invited. In these
       meetings, the risk management plan may be developed, and plans
       for conducting risk management activities are defined, which later are
       part of the risk management plan. The risk management plan may be
       prepared in a kick-off meeting or in a separate meeting. [Planning]

32. b. Duration estimates
       While a number of plans and project documents should be reviewed
       in the Identify Risk process, of the possible answers, only duration
       estimates are listed. They should be reviewed since they are quantitative
       assessments of project durations. While they often are expressed as
       a range, they can indicate the degree of risk associated with these
       estimates. A structured review of the duration estimates may indicate
       the current estimates could be flawed and may pose a risk to the
       project. [Planning]

          33. b. Considers the effectiveness of the risk management process
                   The purpose of the risk audit is the answer to this question. The
                   project manager has the responsibility to see that they are performed
                   frequently or as described in the risk management plan. They may be
                   done during a project team meeting, as part of a risk review meeting,
                   or as a separate risk audit meeting. Before a risk audit is conducted, the
                   project manager should determine its format and clarify its objectives.

          34. a. Data quality assessment
                   Perform Qualitative Risk Analysis requires accurate and unbiased data.
                   The use of low-quality data may result in a qualitative risk analysis
                   that is of little use to the project manager regarding understanding of
                   the risk, data available about the risk, data quality, and data reliability
                   and integrity. Often, the collection of risk information is difficult and
                   consumes more time and resources than planned. It may be done
                   through a questionnaire that measures stakeholder perceptions of
                   various characteristics, such as completeness, objectivity, relevancy, and
                   timeliness. Then, a weighted average of data quality characteristics can
                   be prepared for an overall score. A risk data quality assessment is one
                   of the data analysis tools and techniques in this process. [Planning]

          35. b. Exploit
                   Although it might have a negative connotation, exploitation is a strategy
                   used for risks with positive impacts where the organization wants to
                   ensure that the opportunity is realized. This strategy seeks to eliminate
                   uncertainty with a particular upside risk by ensuring the opportunity
                   happens. Other examples, in addition to that in the question, are
                   using new technology or upgrading technology to reduce the cost and
                   duration required to realize the project's objectives. [Planning]

36. d. Use decision making
        Decision-making techniques are often used to select a risk response
        strategy. They also can help prioritize strategies to consider. Multi-
        criteria decision analysis can be used to provide a systematic approach
        for establishing criteria, evaluating and ranking alternatives, and making
        a selection. Some criteria to consider are cost, the effectiveness of the
        response in changing conditions, resources, time constraints, the level
        of impact if the risk occurs, and possible secondary risks. [Planning]
        PMI(R), PMBOK(R) Guide, 2017, 446
        PMI(R) PMP Examination Content Outline, 2015, Planning, 6, Task 10

37. a. Conduct an alternatives analysis
        Another tool and technique in Plan Risk Responses is data analysis.
        These techniques can help to select a preferred risk response strategy.
        One is to conduct an alternatives analysis. This analysis is a simple
        comparison of the requirements and characteristics of alternative risk
        response actions. It is used to make a decision about which strategy is
        the most appropriate to use. [Planning]
        PMI(R), PMBOK(R) Guide, 2017, 446
        PMI(R) PMP Examination Content Outline, 2015, Planning, 6, Task 10

38. c. A risk that impacts strategic goals
        The situation in this question shows time to market is essential and
        must be shortened; otherwise the risk will have a negative impact on
        the company's strategic goals. Therefore, the strategic impact of the
        risk is high. Even though fast tracking can result in risks, the approach
        also can be monitored for effective results. In the Perform Qualitative
        Risk Analysis process, assessment of other risk parameters is a data
        analysis tool and technique in which other characteristics in addition to
        probability and impact are considered. [Planning]

        39. a. Use interviews
                 Data gathering techniques are a tool and technique in Plan Risk
                 Responses. Within it, interviews are suggested. By using interviews,
                 developing responses to individual and overall project risks can be
                 done. The interview can be structured or semi-structured. In using
                 interviews, the interviewer needs to be unbiased and promote an
                 atmosphere of trust with the interviewee. Confidentiality should
                 be pointed out before the interview begins so the interviewee
                 then provides honest and unbiased suggestions for decisions. Key
                 stakeholders and members of the project team, including the sponsor
                 and perhaps customer representatives, may be interviewed. [Planning]

        40. d. Avoidance
                 Risk avoidance involves eliminating the threat entirely or protecting
                 it from its impact. It may involve changing some parts of the project
                 management plan or the entire plan. The project manager may isolate
                 the project's objectives from the risk's impact or change the objective in
                 jeopardy, reducing the probability of its occurrence to zero. [Planning]

Practice Questions
   INSTRUCTIONS: Note the most suitable answer for each multiple-choice
   question in the appropriate space on the answer sheet.


 1. Assume you are working on a complex project. In fact, it is the most
    complex project in your organization, so the CEO is interested in it and
    asks questions about its progress in staff meetings. On this project, you are
    outsourcing a lot of this work. This means you should--
   a.   Award firm-fixed projects
   b.   Hold weekly meetings with each contractor to assess progress personally
   c.   Manage these multiple contracts in sequence
   d.   Have a full-time contract specialist and set up a projectized structure

 2. You have decided to contract for services as resources are scarce in your
    company. These services may range from junior-level staff to senior-level
    staff to people with specialized expertise to those who are generalists.
    Another term for contracting for service is a--
   a.   T&M
   b.   RTM
   c.   TOR
   d.   CPAF




                                                                                209

          3. Contract type selection is dependent on the degree of risk or uncertainty
             facing the project manager. From the perspective of the buyer, the preferred
             contract type in a low-risk situation is--
             a.   Firm-fixed-price
             b.   Fixed-price-incentive
             c.   Cost-plus-fixed fee
             d.   Cost-plus-incentive fee

          4. The buyer has negotiated a cost-plus-incentive fee contract with the seller.
             The contract has a target cost of $300,000, a target fee of $40,000, a share
             ratio of 80/20, a maximum fee of $60,000, and a minimum fee of $10,000. If
             the seller has actual costs of $380,000, how much fee will the buyer pay?
             a.   $104,000
             b.   $56,000
             c.   $30,000
             d.   $24,000

          5. Assume you are managing a project and have decided to outsource about
             40% of the work. You expect to award three contracts for certain work
             packages in the WBS. The benefit of this Conduct Procurements process is
             that it--
             a.   Determines the type of contract to award
             b.   Selects a qualified seller and implements a legal agreement for delivery
             c.   Enables a detailed review of the make-or-buy decisions
             d.   Avoids the need for additional change requests

          6. You are monitoring and controlling the three contracts on your project. You
             find that two of the sellers' performance is above average, but the third
             seller is failing to deliver as planned, and when this seller does deliver, the
             costs are higher than planned. You decide this seller's performance is not
             going to improve. Your best course of action is to--
             a. Meet with your procurement department to see if there is a seller on the
                qualified seller list that can provide similar services
             b. Meet with the other two sellers separately to see if one of them can do
                this work
             c. Issue a change request
             d. Terminate the contract

 7. You issued a RFP, and when the proposals were received, there were
    expected differences in the price and managerial approach sections. What
    was surprising was the range of different technical approaches that were
    offered. You then decided to--
   a.   Perform a review of the SOW
   b.   Assess if the sellers misunderstood the SOW
   c.   Evaluate the proposals
   d.   Determine if the wrong contract type was chosen

 8. You are a contractor for a state agency. Your company bid on a high-value
    project with a firm-fixed price contract for a water resource management
    project for your state. Before the agency selected a seller, its project manager
    decided to--
   a.   Ensure there is senior management approval before the contract award
   b.   Use an expert with negotiation skills
   c.   Escalate the decision to your procurement department
   d.   Add in the terms and conditions a clause to use arbitration before issuing
        a change order

 9. You are working to prepare your procurement management plan. You are
    planning to determine the type of contract to issue, but first you want to see
    possible costs as your University is updating its software used by students
    and faculty. You decide to--
   a.   Obtain legal advice
   b.   Assess marketplace conditions
   c.   Advertise the opportunity
   d.   Determine the bid type to use

10. You are awarding a contract to help develop a new feature in the 12th
    generation phone. You feel this feature will enable your company to outpace
    the competition. Since you want to outdistance the competition, you want
    the contractor to have the best and brightest people on its staff. As you
    select source selection criteria, you should include--
   a.   Specific relevant experience
   b.   Overall life-cycle costs
   c.   Intellectual property rights
   d.   Warranties

          11. You are working to determine the type of contact for your data warehousing
              project and you want to have a number of sellers bid on this opportunity
              However, the project is not located in a desirable area and is it is in a
              remote part of your country. You decide to gauge interest and decide to--
             a.   Use advertising in trade journals
             b.   Set measurable performance indicators
             c.   Award a contract to a systems integration contractor and expand its scope
             d.   Issue an Request for Information

          12. A number of administrative activities are important in procurement

              each year from baggage that falls from overhead bins. You performed a
              make-or-buy analysis and decided to outsource an improved bin design and
              manufacture. The project team needs to develop a list of qualified sources.
              As a general rule, which method would the project team find especially
              helpful--
             a.   Advertising
             b.   Internet
             c.   Trade catalogs
             d.   Relevant local associations

          14. You are working to monitor and control your three contacts on your
              program. Your company is certified by the Software Engineering Institute's
              Capability Maturity Model for Integration, which means your three contactors
              also hold this certification. Of the following tools and techniques to use, you
              select--
             a.   Contract document for the contract being closed

   c. Solicit proposals from sellers using an RFP to determine whether you
      should outsource the project
   d. Review your procurement department's qualified-seller lists and send an
      RFP to selected sellers

16. Your company decided to award a contract for project management services
    on a pharmaceutical research project. Because your company is new to

        20. During the course of working with a seller that no one had worked with
            previously and is working on site with your team, in preparing the contract
            you specified that inspections and audits can be conducted. You decided to
            hire an outside person, considered to be an expert in project management
            to conduct an audit. In doing so, it is important to ensure that--
           a. The audit can include the company's management personnel
           b. The audit should be completely quickly, so you can process change
              requests as needed for recommendations
           c. The auditor focuses on completed work, not work in progress
           d. The auditor has credibility

25. You have decided to award a contract to a seller that has provided quality
    services to your company frequently in the past. Your current project,
    although somewhat different from previous projects, is similar to other work
    the seller has performed. In this situation, to minimize your risk you should
    award what type of contract?
   a.   Fixed price with economic price adjustment
   b.   Fixed-price-incentive
   c.   Firm-fixed-price
   d.   Cost-plus-award-fee

26. As project manager, you need a relatively fast and informal method
    addressing disagreements with contractors. One such method is to submit
    the issue in question to an impartial third party for resolution. This process
    is known as--
   a.   Alternative dispute resolution
   b.   Problem processing
   c.   Steering resolution
   d.   Mediation litigation

27. Work performance data often are used in Control Procurements to show--
   a.   Whether quality standards are being met
   b.   If approved change requests are being implemented
   c.   Current or potential problems
   d.   If seller invoices have been paid

28. In the Plan Procurement Management process, potential sellers are evaluated
    especially if the buyer wants to exercise some degree of influence or control
    over acquisition decisions. This means thought also should be given to--
   a.   Cost estimates developed by potential sellers
   b.   The scope baseline
   c.   How well sellers implement corrective actions as needed
   d.   Responsibility to acquire professional licenses
216    PMP(R) Exam Preparation: Test Questions, Practice Test, and Simulated Exam

            a target price of $230,000. The buyer also has negotiated a ceiling price of
            $270,000 and a share ratio of 70/30. If the seller completes the contract with
            actual costs of $170,000, how much profit will the buyer pay the seller?
           a.   $21,000

           c.   Overall project management plan
           d.   Specifications

        31. Sellers of course want to be paid once they have delivered what they
            promised in the agreement. This means payment information is--
           a.   Managed by contracting officer's technical representative responsibility
           b.   Stated in the procurement documentation
           c.   Performed by the accounts payable system
           d.   Managed by the procurement department

        32. Assume before you award a contract, you and your team are striving to
            identify areas that may have more risk. You decide to--
           a.   Use an independent estimator
           b.   Evaluate past performance
           c.   Review the risk management plan
           d.   Review the source selection criteria

        33. Assume in your project, you need to use a contractor. But you and the seller
            have a prior agreement in place. This means together you can prepare a
            procurement statement of work. It is an example of--
           a.   Core capabilities of the organization
           b.   Organizational process assets
           c.   Mutual development of contract clauses

                                                   Project Procurement Management    217


34. You work for an aerospace and defense contractor, and you plan to
    outsource 75% of the work as you develop the next generation passenger
    jet. Because so much outsourcing will be used, you decide to use a systems
    integration contractor who will integrate and oversee the work of the other
    contractors. In this situation, you plan to use a--
   a.   Fixed-price with economic price adjustment contract
   b.   Cost-plus-award-fee contract
   c.   Cost-price-incentive-fee-contract
   d.   Sole source agreement

35. Although you finished your procurement management plan, you and your
    team decided since the project is so complex that you would be outsourcing
    about 50% of the work to be done on your new drug to cure macular
    degeneration. Given the large procurement, you decided it would be helpful
    to--
   a.   Use partnering with the selected sellers
   b.   Have an independent estimate
   c.   Establish a procurement change control system
   d.   Structure each resulting agreement to minimize claims

Answer Key
 1. c. Manage these multiple contracts in sequence
       Complex projects often involve contractors and subcontractors. While
       they may be managed in sequence, they also may be managed
       simultaneously. In such cases, each contract life cycle may begin
       and end during any phase of the project life cycle. They buyer-seller
       relationship may exist at many levels on any project, and between
       organizations internal or external to the acquiring organization.

       Controlling, 9, Task 7

 2. c. TOR
       The TOR means terms of reference and is another term that can be
       used to contract for services. It is similar to a procurement statement of
       work and describes the tasks the contractor will perform, standards the
       contractor will fulfill, data to submit for approval, services the contractor
       will provide, and the schedule for the initial submission and the review
       and approval time needed. [Planning]

 3. a. Firm-fixed-price
       Buyers prefer the firm-fixed-price contract because it places more
       risk on the seller. Although the seller bears the greatest degree of
       risk, it also has the maximum potential for profit. Because the seller
       receives an agreed-upon amount regardless of its costs, it is motivated
       to decrease costs by efficient production. It is the most commonly
       used contract as the price for goods is set at the beginning and is not
       changed unless the scope of work changes. Types of contracts are an
       input to the Plan Procurement Management process. [Planning]

           4. d. $24,000
                   Comparing actual costs with the target cost shows an $80,000 overrun.
                   The overrun is shared 80/20 (with the buyer's share always listed
                   first). In this case 20% of $80,000 is $16,000, the seller's share, which
                   is deducted from the $40,000 target fee. The remaining $24,000 is the
                   fee paid to the seller. In this type of contract, the seller is reimbursed
                   for all allowable costs for performing the contract work and receives a
                   predetermined incentive fee based on achieving certain performance
                   objectives set forth in the contract. If the final costs are less than or
                   greater than the original estimated costs, then the buyer and seller share
                   costs based on a predetermined cost sharing formula, such as the 80/20
                   split over/under target costs based on the seller's actual performance.

           5. b. Selects a qualified seller and implements a legal agreement for delivery
                   The Conduct Procurements process purpose is to obtain seller
                   responses, select a seller, and award contracts. During the process,
                   the team receives bids or proposals and will apply previously defined
                   selection criteria to select the sellers qualified to perform the work. The
                   benefit of this process is the answer to this question.

           6. c. Issue a change request
                   It is obvious this contract will need to be terminated, and termination
                   clauses are in the procurement management plan. However, before
                   terminating the contract, you will need to issue a change request, an
                   output of this process. Requested but unresolved changes by the buyer
                   or actions by the seller may be disputed by one party, meaning these
                   changes are identified and documented by project correspondence and
                   other documentation. [Monitoring and Controlling]

 7. c. Evaluate the proposals
       A data analysis technique in Conduct Procurement is proposal
       evaluation. They are evaluated to ensure they are complete, respond to
       the bid documents, the procurement statement of work, source selection
       criteria, and other documents that may be in the bid documents.

8. a. Ensure there is senior management approval before the contract award
       Selected sellers are an output of Conduct Procurements. These are
       sellers that have been judged to be in the competitive range. However,
       final approval of a high-value or high-risk procurement as in this
       question tends to require senior management approval before contract
       or agreement award. [Executing]

 9. b. Assess marketplace conditions
       Marketplace conditions and legal advice are both enterprise
       environmental factors to consider in preparing the procurement
       management plan and in determining the type contract to award.
       Marketplace conditions can show cost of similar updates at other
       Universities near you or in your same region. Another enterprise
       environmental factor that is appropriate is to see products and services
       available in the marketplace. [Planning]

10. a. Specific relevant experience
       An output of Plan Procurement Management is source selection criteria.
       There are a variety of criteria to consider. Specific relevant experience
       is a criterion to include. Also, technical expertise and approach and the
       staff's qualifications, availability, and competence should be considered.

          11. d. Request for Information
                   Procurement or bid documents are used to solicit proposals from
                   prospective sellers. A Request for Information is used when more
                   information on the goods and services to be acquired is needed from
                   the sellers. It then is followed by a Request for Quotation or a Request
                   for Proposal. It is an output of Plan Procurement Management. [Planning]

          12. b. Measurable procurement performance indicators
                   Control Procurements includes application of project management
                   processes to contractual relationships. Within this process are several
                   administrative activities. One is to collect data and manage project
                   records. It includes maintaining detailed records on physical financial
                   performance and establishing measurable procurement indicators.

          13. a. Advertising
                   Advertising is a tool and technique in Conduct Procurements. It enables
                   existing lists of sellers to be expanded by using advertising in general
                   circulation such as in newspapers or specialty trade publications. Online
                   resources also can be used. Some government agencies require public
                   advertising for certain types of procurement items, and most require
                   public advertising or online posting of pending government contracts.

          14. c. Earned value
                   Earned value analysis is a data analysis tool and technique in Control
                   Procurement. In this situation, since the contractor and subcontractors
                   are Level 3 certified for this agreement, they are using earned value. In
                   Control Procurement it provides schedule and cost variances along with
                   calculations of schedule and cost indices to determine the degree of
                   variance from the target. [Monitoring and Controlling]

15. a. Conduct a make-or-buy analysis
       A make-or-buy analysis is a Plan Procurement Management tool and
       technique in data analysis used to determine whether a product,
       service, or result can be produced or performed cost effectively by
       the performing organization or should be contracted out to another
       organization. Factors to consider include the organization's resource
       allocation and their skills and abilities, the need for special expertise,
       the desire not to expand permanent employment obligations, and the
       need for individual expertise. [Planning]

16. d. Time-and-materials contract
       A time-and-materials contract is a type of contract that provides for the
       acquisition of supplies or services on the basis of direct labor hours,
       They are a hybrid type of contract in that they contain aspects of cost-
       reimbursable and fixed-price contracts. They are often used to augment
       existing staff, acquire experts, and obtain outside support when a
       precise statement of work cannot be quickly prepared. They fit the
       scenario in this question and can increase in contract value if required.
       They also are part of organizational process assets, an input to Plan
       Procurement Management. [Planning]

17. d. Agreement
       Agreements are an output of Conduct Procurements. They are mutually
       binding agreements and obligate the seller to provide specified
       products, services, or results. The buyer compensates the seller, and the
       agreement then is a legal relationship subject to remedy in the court.
       While each agreement is different and contains different items, some
       provide warranties and future product support. For example, if the
       agreement is for software services, often warranties and future product
       support are included. [Executing]

          18. d. Establishing source selection criteria
                   The selection criteria are typically included in procurement documents
                   and are then used to rate or score seller responses to ensure the
                   proposal that is selected will offer the best quality for the services to be
                   provided. In this specific question, they are more than just price as they
                   also include other technical and management areas. The criteria may be
                   set up as a numerical score, a color code, or a written description of the
                   seller's understanding of the buyer's needs. They may be used to select
                   a single seller or to establish a negotiating sequence. Source selection
                   criteria are an output of Plan Procurement Management. [Planning]

          19. d. Adheres to the organization's procurement policies
                   Agreements are an output of the Conduct Procurements process.
                   However, an input in this process is organizational process assets. One
                   of these organizational process assets is adherence to organizational
                   policies that influence seller selection. These policies need to be
                   reviewed before an agreement. [Executing]

          20. d. The auditor has credibility
                   In Control Procurements the quality of the controls including the
                   independence and credibility of procurement audits are critical to
                   success. Controls using techniques such as these audits need to be
                   viewed in a positive way. Since the auditors are independent, they
                   are unbiased, and their findings and recommendations can improve
                   the overall success of procurement management. They are structured
                   reviews of the procurement process, and their observations should
                   be presented to both the buyer's and seller's project managers for any
                   needed adjustments. [Monitoring and Controlling]

21. a. Determine the type of legally binding agreement
       There are several objectives of the procurement strategy. One is the
       answer to the question. Other objectives are to determine the project
       delivery method, and another is to determine how the procurement will
       advance throughout the procurement system. [Planning]

22. c. Include in a procurement statement of work
       The procurement statement of work is an output of Plan Procurement
       Management. It is developed from the scope baseline and defines
       the portion of the scope of the project to be included in related
       agreements. It describes the procurement items in detail, so the sellers
       can determine if they can provide the needed products, services, and
       goods. Examples of items that can be included are the ones in this
       question. [Planning]

23. b. Resource calendars
       They are an output of Conduct Procurements as the quantity and
       availability of contracted resources and the dates on which each specific
       resource or resource group can be active or is idle is documented. They
       are part of the project documents to update. [Executing]

24. b. Requirements traceability matrix
       Other documents to update are the requirements documents, lessons
       learned repository, stakeholder register, milestone list, and the risk
       register. The procurement management plan will include certain
       requirements that may not have been considered at the time the
       traceability matrix was prepared. It is important in that it links product
       requirements from their origin to the deliverables that satisfy them. Each
       procurement statement of work, for example, contains requirements that
       the seller must meet; other requirements, such as performance bonds
       or insurance contracts and direction to sellers on developing a WBS are
       part of the procurement management plan. [Planning]

          25. c. Firm-fixed-price
                   In a firm-fixed-price contract, the seller receives a fixed sum of money
                   for the work performed regardless of costs. This arrangement places
                   the greatest financial risk on the seller and encourages it to control
                   costs. Any cost increase because of adverse performance is the seller's
                   responsibility, who is obligated to complete the effort. The buyer should
                   precisely state the products or services to be procured as any changes
                   to the procurement specification can increase the buyer's cost. It is the
                   best choice in this question since this seller is entering into a new area
                   of work. [Planning]

          26. a. Alternative dispute resolution
                   Alternative dispute resolution is used in Control Procurements in
                   contested changes. If the buyer and seller cannot reach an agreement
                   on contested changes or that a change has occurred, claims result. It
                   then may be handled through alternative dispute resolutions. It is a
                   relatively informal way to address differences of opinion. Its purpose
                   is to address such issues without having to seek formal legal redress
                   through the courts. [Monitoring and Controlling]

          27. d. If seller invoices have been paid
                   Work performance data are an input to Control Procurements.
                   Additionally, these data show costs that have been incurred or
                   committed, and technical performance activities that have started, are
                   in progress, or have completed. [Monitoring and Controlling]

          28. d. Responsibility to acquire professional licenses
                   An input to Conduct Procurement is requirements documentation. It
                   discusses requirements with contractual and legal implications. They
                   may include health, security, performance, environmental, insurance,
                   intellectual property rights, licenses, permits, and any other non-
                   technical requirements. [Executing]

29. c. $39,000
       To calculate the fee that the buyer must pay, actual costs are compared
       with the target cost. If actual costs are less than the target cost, the
       seller will earn profit that is additional to the target profit. If actual
       costs are more than the target cost, the seller will lose profit from the
       target profit. The amount of profit is determined by the share ratio
       (with the buyer's share listed first). In this example, the seller is under
       target cost by $30,000. That amount will be split 70/30. So the buyer
       keeps $21,000, and the seller receives an additional $9,000 added to
       the target profit, which is the incentive. Total fee is $39,000. In this
       type of contract the buyer and seller have flexibility in that it allows
       for deviations from performance with financial incentives in place
       tied to agreed-upon metrics. These incentives tend to be related to
       cost, schedule, or technical performance. The performance targets are
       established at the beginning. The price ceiling is set, and all costs above
       the price are the seller's responsibility. [Planning]

30. a. Agreement
       Agreements are an output of Conduct Procurements. They are a
       mutually binding agreement in which the seller provides the products,
       services, or results, and the buyer compensates the seller. There are
       many components of an agreement, one is acceptance criteria. It is
       described along with quality and inspection. [Executing]

31. b. Stated in the procurement documentation
       Procurement documentation is a tool and technique in Control
       Procurements. They contain complete supporting records to administer
       the procurement processes. They include the statement of work,
       payment information, contractor work performance information, plans,
       drawings, and correspondence. [Monitoring and Controlling]

         32. c. Review the risk management plan
                  The risk management plan is one of several components of the
                  project management plan, an input to Conduct Procurement. The
                  risk management plan should be reviewed since it describes how
                  risk management is conducted in the project. For example, the type
                  of agreement that is selected has its own degree of risk to the seller
                  and to the buyer. Other parts of the agreement further can be more
                  stringent based on the level of risk threshold or more lenient, especially
                  if the buyer has worked with the seller successfully on other projects.

         33. b. Organizational process assets
                  They are an input to Plan Procurement Management. This example
                  is one of a preapproved seller list. They are lists of sellers that have
                  been previously vetted by the buyer. They are used to streamline the
                  procurement process and enable the buyer and seller to work closely
                  together. They can shorten the timeline for the seller selection process.

         34. b. Cost-plus-award-fee contract
                  While there are a variety contract types to use, this situation is a
                  perfect example of the cost-plus-award-fee contract. In it the seller is
                  reimbursed for legitimate costs. The majority of the fee is earned based
                  on the buyer satisfaction with broad, subjective performance criteria.
                  These criteria are defined and incorporated into the contract. The
                  determination of the fee is based on buyer's subjective assessment of
                  the seller's performance and typically cannot be appealed. [Planning]

35. b. Have an independent estimate
       On large procurements the buyer may decide to prepare its own
       independent estimate or may have an outside professional prepare
       an estimate. The purpose is to have a benchmark for proposed
       responses. If there are significant differences in cost estimates, it may
       be an indication that the procurement statement of work is deficient or
       ambiguous or that the prospective sellers have misunderstood or failed
       to respond fully to the procurement statement of work. [Planning]

36. d. Are in the competitive range
       Selected sellers are an output of Conduct Procurements. These selected
       sellers are ones in a competitive range based on the proposal or
       bid evaluation. Typically approval of high-value, high-risk, complex
       procurements generally will require approval by senior managers prior
       to award. [Executing]

37. d. You should review the make-or-buy analysis you conducted
       Make-or-buy decisions are an output of Plan Procurement Management.
       As in this question, the team may decide to do the work, or the needs
       may be purchased from external sources. [Planning]

38. b. Follow the scope management plan
       The procurement statement of work is an output of Plan Procurement
       Management. The statement of work for each procurement uses the
       scope management plan. It is an input to this process under the project
       management plan, It describes how the scope of work will be managed
       though the execution of the project. The other possible answers are
       items that are part of the procurement management plan. [Planning]

        39. b. Cost-plus-fixed-fee
                 On a firm-fixed-price contract, the seller absorbs 100 percent of the
                 risks; while on a cost-type contract, the buyer carries the most risk.
                 Cost-reimbursable contracts provide flexibility to the project to redirect
                 the seller whenever the scope of work cannot be precisely defined at
                 the start and needs to be altered or when high risks may exist in the
                 effort. Cost-plus-fixed-fee contracts have less risk to sellers than cost-
                 plus-award-fee or cost-plus-incentive-fee contracts because the fee is
                 fixed based on costs, so the seller is guaranteed a certain level of profit.
                 The fee is paid only for completed work and does not change unless
                 the project scope changes. [Planning]

        40. b. $90,000
                 In this situation the fixed-fee of $10,000 does not change but now
                 represents a seller profit of 12.5 percent on incurred costs. This means
                 that the total cost to the project is $90,000. The actual fee is determined
                 when the seller completes its work. [Planning]

Practice Questions
   INSTRUCTIONS: Note the most suitable answer for each multiple-choice
   question in the appropriate space on the answer sheet.


 1. During your project, you will have a number of different types of meetings.
    Some will be informational, others will be key updates, and some will be
    for decision-making purposes. While different attendees will attend each
    meeting, a best practice to follow is to:
   a. Group stakeholders into categories to determine which ones should
      attend each meeting
   b. Invite those stakeholders who have a high level of interest in your project
      to attend each meeting
   c. Be sensitive to the fact that stakeholders often have very different
      objectives
   d. Recognize that roles and responsibilities may overlap but practice a policy
      of `no surprises' and inform your stakeholders about any upcoming
      meetings

 2. You are managing a project with team members located at customer sites
    on three different continents. You have a number of stakeholders on your
    project, and most of them are located outside of the corporate office. As you
    work to monitor and control Stakeholder Engagement, you should--
   a.   Consult the organizational process assets
   b.   Consult the enterprise environmental factors
   c.   Use assumptions analysis
   d.   Review the change log

                                                                              233

         3. When you are preparing your project charter, you also are identifying your
            stakeholders although you continue the process throughout the project. As
            you are doing so, you decide to do some stakeholder analysis. You decide to
            classify stakeholders based on directions of influence, which means you are--
           a.   Comparing power and influence
           b.   Using a stakeholder cube
           c.   Comparing upward, downward, outward, and sideward approaches
           d.   Using prioritization

         4. You are responsible for a project in your organization that has multiple
            internal customers. Because many people in your organization are interested
            in this project, you decide to prepare a stakeholder engagement strategy.
            Before preparing this strategy, you first should--
           a. Conduct a stakeholder analysis to collect information
           b. Determine a production schedule to show when each stakeholder needs
              each type of information produced
           c. Determine the potential impact that each stakeholder may generate
           d. Prioritize each stakeholder's level of interest and influence

         5. Recognizing the importance of preparing a stakeholder engagement plan,
            you met with your team to obtain their buy in and to discuss it. You
            explained the key benefit of Plan Stakeholder Engagement is to--
           a. Determine appropriate strategies for a continual focus on identifying
              stakeholders throughout the life cycle
           b. Provide a clear plan that is actionable to interact effectively with
              stakeholders
           c. Develop appropriate management strategies to effectively engage
              stakeholders
           d. Plan a series of meetings to ensure stakeholders remain interested and to
              address their concerns

         6. Assume you are actively working, along with your team, to manage
            stakeholder engagement on your project to develop a new drug to prevent
            any retina problems of any type. You know you must manage their
            engagement throughout the project life cycle. This means some project
            documents will need updating including--
           a.   Informal and formal project reports
           b.   The stakeholder register
           c.   The stakeholder engagement plan
           d.   The communications plan

 7. Stakeholders often have issues, and you have asked each of your team
    members to document them. At each team meeting, you and your team
    discuss them and determine appropriate responses. You have a project issue
    log, which is--
   a.   Part of the project's lessons learned
   b.   Added to the stakeholder register to show which stakeholder raised it
   c.   An output from the Manage Stakeholder Engagement process
   d.   An output from the Control Stakeholder Engagement process

 8. As you work on your project to update its software training classes to focus
    on an agile approach, you have a number of key stakeholders. As many
    students and their managers are requesting these classes, your CEO has
    taken a special interest in your project and has asked you to accelerate
    your schedule to complete it in two months rather than in your planned six
    months but still have quality offerings. This means as you work to monitor
    overall project stakeholder relationships, you should--
   a.   Provide notifications to stakeholders about status regularly
   b.   Ask your stakeholders for regular feedback as you work on your project
   c.   Provide presentations to each stakeholder group
   d.   Determine how changes will be monitored and controlled

 9. As you work with your team to prepare your stakeholder engagement plan,
    you decided to develop a stakeholder engagement assessment matrix. You
    set it up, so you could--
   a. Show the phase of your project of interest to identified stakeholders
   b. Show gaps between current and desired levels of engagement
   c. Determine which stakeholders you and your team felt were critical to
      project success but did not know about it
   d. Determine when to involve key stakeholders in your project

10. Assume you are working to prepare your stakeholder engagement plan.
    You want it to reflect the diverse information needs of your project
    stakeholders as you prepare your plan. However, you recognize you will
    need to update it because your stakeholders will change especially since
    your project will last two years. A trigger situation that shows it is time to
    update the plan is--
   a.   When assumptions change
   b.   If your project charter changes
   c.   When the organization structure changes
   d.   If the time frame and frequency for the distribution of required
        information to stakeholders changes

        11. Having worked as a project manager for nine years, you know how
            important it is to identify the critical stakeholders, so you do not overlook
            anyone who has a major influence on your project even if you do not ever
            plan to meet with or talk with this individual. As you work with your team,
            you explain the key benefit of the Identify Stakeholder Process is that it--
           a. Identifies the people, groups, or organizations that could impact or
              influence project decisions
           b. Shows the interdependencies among project stakeholders to enable
              classification for how best to involve them on your project
           c. Identifies the appropriate focus for each stakeholder or a group of
              stakeholders
           d. Shows the potential impact each stakeholder has on project success

       12. Assume you are working to Identify Stakeholders and are now gathering
           information about the stakeholders on your project. You decide to allow
           people who will participate in your brainstorming session to consider the
           questions you plan to ask before you meet as a group. This approach is--
           a.   The nominal group technique
           b.   Used to assess how stakeholders probably will respond in various situations
           c.   Brain writing
           d.   Mind mapping

       13. You realize that on projects, some stakeholders will not be as receptive as
           others to your project and actually can be negative from the beginning.
           Assume you have classified your stakeholders on your project designed to
           ensure students in your city have access to the best educational resources
           available, whether in class or on line. Now you are preparing your
           stakeholder engagement plan, and you want to determine the appropriate
           strategy to improve each stakeholder' level of engagement. You decide to--
           a.   Review the validity of the underlying constraints
           b.   Use root-cause analysis
           c.   Review the validity of its underlying assumptions
           d.   Use mind mapping

        14. Stakeholder engagement involves a number of critical activities. An example
            is--
           a. Managing stakeholder expectations by using negotiation and
              communications
           b. Developing management strategies to engage them during the project's
              life cycle
           c. Adjusting strategies and plans to engage stakeholders effectively
           d. Identifying the scope and impact of changes to project stakeholders

15. Work performance information is an output of Monitor Stakeholder
    Engagement. It includes a number of items, one of which is--
   a.   Change requests
   b.   Issue log
   c.   Documented lessons learned
   d.   Status of stakeholder engagement

16. Often in working as a project manager, it is easy to overlook key
    stakeholders. Assume you work for a device manufacturer and are working
    as the project manager for the next generation valve replacement. Your
    company has been a leader in this market, which means you have a lot of
    lessons learned available to you. Your project is scheduled to last four years.
    As a best practice, you should--
   a.   Work actively with your company's Knowledge Management Officer
   b.   Consult regularly with your program manager
   c.   Work actively with members of your Governance Board
   d.   Work actively with members of your company's Portfolio Review Board

17. Assume you are managing the development of a construction project in your
    city to replace its five bridges so they are state of the art and meet updated
    safety standards since they originally were constructed 20 years ago. The
    design work has been completed, you have awarded subcontracts, and are
    set to begin construction. Today your legal department told you to stop
    work as you had not consulted them, and there was a critical standard you
    overlooked during the design process. This example shows--
   a. You need to continually work to engage stakeholders on your project
   b. You should use a RACI chart and have one of your team members work

       18. Assume your construction project is for a small city with only 8,500
           people. There has been opposition to it from the beginning, when the City
           Commissioners approved it by many residents. The residents recognize they
           will be severely impacted as the new bridges are implemented, and during
           the public hearings before the Commissioners' decision, they hired an
           attorney to state they felt the more cost-effective approach was to strengthen
           the bridges, so they meet today's safety requirements. Residents now know
           you have been ordered to stop work, and they have requested a meeting
           with the Commission on Tuesday. This means you should--
           a. Develop a mitigation plan to present at this meeting

            sponsor is the Chief Operating Officer, and the IT Department Director was
            surprised as she thought all was well. However, you notice when planning
            meetings are held, the Chief Financial Officer never attends. You feel since
            IT affects the entire company, all the senior leaders need some type of

           b.   Revise and reissue your stakeholder management plan
           c.   Prepare a change request
           d.   Update the lessons learned documentation

       38. Identifying strategies to promote productive involvement of stakeholders

Answer Key
 1. d. Recognize that roles and responsibilities may overlap but practice
       a policy of `no surprises' and inform your stakeholders about any
       upcoming meetings
       Meetings are a tool and technique in Monitor Stakeholder Engagement.
       They include status meetings, standup meetings, retrospectives,
       or others as stated in the stakeholder engagement plan. They help
       to monitor stakeholder engagement levels. The intent of inviting
       stakeholders to meetings or reviews or posting project artifacts in public
       space is to surface quickly any misalignments, dependencies, or other
       issues in the project. It is a concept used in agile methods to promote
       aggressive transparency and to accelerate the flow of information
       sharing. [Monitoring and Controlling]

       Controlling, 9, Task 1

 2. b. Consult the enterprise environmental factors
       The key words in this question are the team members are located
       in three different continents. The geographic distribution of facilities
       and resources are enterprise environmental factors to consider in the
       Monitor Stakeholder Engagement process. [Monitoring and Controlling]

 3. c. Comparing upward, downward, outward, and sideward approaches
       Identifying and analyzing the stakeholders helps to classify them to
       develop a strategy to meet their expectations throughout the project. In
       this approach, you are analyzing them in terms of upward approaches
       to senior managers, customer, sponsors, and the steering committee;
       downward to the team or SMEs; outward to stakeholders and groups
       outside of the team such as suppliers, the government, public, end
       users, or regulators; and sideward to your peers or middle managers
       who also want the same scarce resources you need on your project.

         4. a. Conduct a stakeholder analysis to collect information
                 Stakeholder analysis is used to result in a stakeholder list and
                 information on the stakeholders such as their positions in the
                 organization, roles on the project, stakes or expectations, attitudes or
                 levels of support, and their interest in information about the project.
                 It is a data analysis tool and technique used in Identify Stakeholders.

         5. b. Provide a clear plan that is actionable to interact effectively with
               stakeholders
                 The Plan Stakeholder Engagement process develops appropriate
                 management strategies to involve stakeholders based on their interests,
                 needs, expectations and potential impact on the project. The key
                 benefit of this process is to have a plan that is clear and actionable to
                 interact with them. [Planning]

         6. b. The stakeholder register
                 The stakeholder register, along with the issue log, change log, and
                 lessons learned register, are project documents that may need updates
                 in the Manage Stakeholder Engagement process. [Executing]

         7. c. An output from the Manage Stakeholder Engagement process
                 Issues logs are an output of this process, as issues are expected in this
                 process. The log is updated to reflect an update to or the development
                 of an issue log entry. [Executing]

8. d. Determine how changes will be monitored and controlled
       The key words in this question are monitoring overall project
       stakeholder relations, which indicates you are in the Monitor
       Stakeholder Engagement process. Its purpose is to monitor these
       relationships and tailor strategies to engage stakeholders as you modify
       engagement strategies and plans. As you work in managing stakeholder
       engagement, you should review corporate policies and procedures for
       issue, risk, change, and data management, one of the organizational
       process assets that are inputs to this process. You also may need a
       change request with this change even though it is mandated by the
       CEO, an output of this process, as it describes the preventive and
       corrective actions [as in this question], to improve the current level of
       stakeholder engagement. [Monitoring and Controlling]

       Controlling, 9, Task 1

 9. b. Show gaps between current and desired levels of engagement
       The stakeholder engagement assessment matrix is a data representation
       tool used as a tool and technique in Plan Stakeholder Management.
       The purpose of the matrix is to show gaps between current and
       desired engagement levels required for successful project delivery. This
       engagement level classifies stakeholders to show if they are unaware,
       resistant, neutral, supportive, or leading. It also is useful to determine
       the level of communications needed to engage stakeholders. [Planning]

       PMI(R) PMP Examination Content Outline, 2015, Planning, 7, Task 13

10. c. When the organization structure changes
       Other trigger conditions are when it is time to start a new project phase;
       industry changes; when new people or groups become stakeholders,
       current stakeholders are no longer involved, or their importance to
       project success changes; and when outputs of other process areas such
       as change management, risk management, or issue management require
       a review of stakeholder engagement strategies. [Planning]

          11. c. Identifies the appropriate focus for each stakeholder or a group of
                 stakeholders
                  The Identify Stakeholder process has a number of purposes. It identifies
                  stakeholders regularly. It analyzes and documents relevant information
                  concerning their interests, involvement, interdependencies, influence,
                  and potential impact on project success. Its key benefit is to allow the
                  project manager and the team to identify the appropriate focus for each
                  stakeholder or stakeholder groups. [Initiating]

         12. c. Brain writing
                  In data gathering, questionnaires and surveys, brainstorming, and
                  brain writing are techniques to consider. Brain writing is a form of
                  brainstorming, as is the Nominal Group Technique, another possible
                  answer, but it focuses on giving the participants time to consider the
                  questions in advance of the brainstorming meeting or group creativity
                  meeting. Then, people can speak up during the session, whether it is
                  virtual or co-located, as they have had time to think about the answers.
                  it helps avoid one or two people from dominating the session and
                  enables more equal participation. [Initiating]

         13. b. Use root-cause analysis
                  Root-cause analysis is a data analysis approach in Plan Stakeholder
                  Engagement. It purpose is to identify the reasons for the level of
                  support of the stakeholders in the project and then use it to determine
                  the most appropriate strategy to improve their level of engagement.
                  Other data analysis techniques are assumption and constraint analysis.

14. a. Managing stakeholder expectations by using negotiation and
       communications
       A key activity in Manage Stakeholder Engagement is to manage
       stakeholder expectations through negotiation and communications,
       which can help ensure project goals are achieved. This process focuses
       on communicating with stakeholders and working with them to meet
       their needs or expectations, addressing issues as they occur, and
       fostering appropriate involvement. [Executing]

15. d. Status of stakeholder engagement
       Work performance information includes information about the status of
       stakeholder engagement. It includes the level of current project support
       compared to the desired level of engagement, which is defined in
       tools such as the stakeholder engagement assessment matrix and the
       stakeholder cube. [Monitoring and Controlling]

       Controlling, 9, Task 1

16. c. Work actively with members of your Governance Board
       New product development organizations are noted for setting up
       Governance Boards to oversee projects. Additionally, in this situation, it
       is a long project that is important to the company. Project governance
       refers to the framework, functions, and processes to guide project
       activities, regardless if the project is for a product, service, or result.
       Its objective is to meet organizational, strategic, and operational goals.
       Recognize there is no one governance framework that supports all
       projects. [Executing]

          17. d. You need to continually identify project stakeholders
                   Stakeholder identification is a continual process throughout the
                   project life cycle. The legal department often is overlooked, but it is a
                   significant stakeholder, and in this situation, delays resulted. Significant
                   expenses often are due to legal requirements that must be met before
                   the project can be completed, or the project scope is delivered. As
                   an output of Identify Stakeholders, the stakeholder register should be
                   consulted and updated; stakeholders may change, or new stakeholders
                   will be identified. Stakeholder identification is performed throughout
                   the project. [Initiating]

          18. d. Balance the interests of these negative stakeholders and meet with them
                 before Tuesday's meeting
                   Overlooking negative stakeholders' interests can result in an increased
                   likelihood of failures, delays, or other negative consequences to
                   projects. The project manager must control stakeholder engagement,
                   which can be difficult since they often have different or competing
                   objectives. The key benefit of the Monitor Stakeholder Engagement
                   process is to maintain or increase the efficiencies of stakeholder
                   engagement activities as the project evolves and the project
                   environment changes. Therefore, it is necessary to monitor stakeholder
                   relationships and adjust strategies and plans to engage stakeholders.

                   Controlling, 9, Task 1

          19. a. Stakeholders' power, urgency and legitimacy are used
                   In the salience model, stakeholders are described in classes based on
                   their power or level of authority or ability to influence the project,
                   urgency or need for immediate action, and legitimacy or their
                   involvement. It is an approach used for data representation along
                   with power/interest, power/influence, and influence/impact grids, the
                   stakeholder cube, prioritization, and meetings. Data representation is a
                   tool and technique in Identify Stakeholders to categorize stakeholders
                   using various methods. [Initiating]

20. c. Lessons learned repository
       Of the answers provided, the lessons learned repository is the only
       organizational process asset. It contains information about stakeholder
       preferences, actions, and involvement; therefore, it is useful to consult
       as the stakeholder engagement plan is prepared. [Planning]
       PMI(R), PMBOK(R) Guide, 2017, 520
       PMI(R) PMP Examination Content Outline, 2015, Planning, 7, Task 13

21. a. Resistant
       Since the Chief Financial Officer has financial responsibility for all of
       the company's work, in preparing a stakeholder engagement plan, he or
       she probably is aware of this project and probably is resistant to change.
       This resistance may be because of changes that will occur based on
       the project's work and its outcomes and will not be supportive. It is a
       data representation tool and technique in Plan Stakeholder Engagement.
       It is a stakeholder engagement assessment matrix used to compare
       stakeholders' current engagement levels and desired levels for success.
       Other ways to classify stakeholder engagement levels are unaware,
       neutral, supportive, or leading. [Planning]

22. d. Increase support and minimize resistance
       The benefit of the Manage Stakeholder Engagement process is to allow
       the project manager to increase support and minimize resistance from
       stakeholders. In this process, the purpose is to communicate with
       stakeholders to meet needs and expectations, address issues, and foster
       active involvement. [Executing]

23. b. The stakeholder has new information
       Project document updates are an output to the Manage Stakeholder
       Engagement process. These updates involve the stakeholder register.
       It should be updated because of new information provided to
       stakeholders on resolved issues, approved changes, and overall project
       status. [Executing]

          24. c. Resolving conflicts
                   Conflicts are common on projects and between stakeholders and the
                   project manager must resolve them in a timely way. Other interpersonal
                   and team skills useful in Manage Stakeholder Engagement are cultural
                   awareness, negotiation, observation/conversation, and political
                   awareness. [Executing]
                   PMI(R), PMBOK(R) Guide, 2017, 527

          25. c. Risk register
                   A project document to review as an input to the Monitor Stakeholder
                   Engagement process is the risk register. It is useful since it contains the
                   project's identified risks, which can include stakeholder engagement
                   and interaction, categorization, and potential responses. Other project
                   documents to consider are the issue log, project communications,
                   lessons learned register, and the stakeholder register. [Monitoring and
                   Controlling]

                   Controlling, 9, Task 1

          26. d. Use knowledge from team member contributions
                   Expert judgment in the Identify Stakeholder process is considered
                   from people or groups with specialized knowledge on a variety of
                   topics. Team members bring technical expertise to the project, and
                   their contributions should not be overlooked. The project manager
                   then should be familiar with the team members' knowledge, skills,
                   and competencies. Other topics of interest in expert judgment are
                   understanding the organization's politics and power structures,
                   knowledge of the organization's environment and culture, and
                   knowledge of the project's industry. [Initiating]

27. d. Organizational culture
        Enterprise environmental factors are inputs to Plan Stakeholder
        Management because the engagement of stakeholders should be
        adapted to the project environment. This means organizational culture
        is of particular importance, along with the political, climate, and
        governance framework. These three help determine the best option to
        support a better and more adaptive approach for planning stakeholder
        engagement. [Planning]

28. c. Identifies the strategies and actions to promote stakeholder involvement
        Plan Stakeholder Engagement has as its output the stakeholder
        engagement plan. It is necessary to identify these strategies and actions
        such that there is productive involvement from stakeholders in decision
        making and execution. It may include specific strategies or approaches
        to use based on the project's needs and stakeholder expectations.

29. c. Stakeholder registers from previous projects
        Stakeholder registers from previous projects is the only answer that is
        an organizational process asset. Other organizational process assets
        are a lesson learned repository that has information about preferences,
        actions, and involvement of stakeholders and a stakeholder register with
        instructions. [Initiating]

30. d. Conduct a stakeholder analysis
        A stakeholder analysis is a data analysis tool and technique the Identify
        Stakeholders process. In addition to roles and interests, it results in
        information on positions in the organization, "stakes", and attitudes.

          32. d. Contains a resource management plan
                   In Plan Stakeholder Engagement, project management plan components
                   to consider are the resource management, communications
                   management, and risk management plan. The resource management
                   plan is helpful since it has information on the team and other
                   stakeholders' roles and responsibilities based on the stakeholders listed
                   in the stakeholder register. [Planning]

          33. a. The project manager to prepare the stakeholder engagement plan
                   The stakeholder engagement assessment matrix shows the stakeholders
                   current engagement in the project and the desired engagement level
                   needed for project success. Stakeholders in this matrix can be classified
                   as unaware, resistant, neutral, supportive, or leading. [Planning]

          34. a. Consider the negative value of stakeholder engagement
                   There are several trends and emerging practices in project stakeholder
                   engagement. One is to capture both the positive and the negative
                   value of stakeholder engagement. Positive value considers benefits
                   from higher levels of stakeholder support. Negative value is derived
                   by measuring the true costs of not engaging stakeholders effectively
                   as by not doing so, it could lead to product recalls or loss of the
                   organization's and/or the project's reputation. [Executing]

35. c. Use co-creation
        Another emerging trend and practice in Project Stakeholder Engagement
        is co-creation. It is an approach to place greater emphasis on including
        the affected stakeholders in the team as partners, which fits the situation
        in this question. It is used to consult with the stakeholders who are the
        most affected by the work or the project's outcomes. [Executing]

36. b. Ethics corporate policies
        A number of organizational process assets are useful to consider in
        Monitor Stakeholder Engagement. One of importance to any project is
        corporate policies and procedures for ethics. The organization's code
        of ethics or code of conduct should be considered. Other corporate
        policies and procedures involve use of social media; security; and issue,
        risk, change and data management. [Monitoring and Controlling]

37. c. Prepare a change request
        A change request is an output of the Monitor Stakeholder Engagement
        process. This change request may involve corrective and preventive
        actions taken as you analyzed the root cause in this situation in the
        question. Other outputs are work performance information and updates
        to the resource management, communications management, and
        stakeholder engagement plans. [Monitoring and Controlling]

38. c. Stakeholder engagement plan
        The stakeholder engagement plan is the output of Plan Stakeholder
        Management. It is a component of the project management plan. Its
        purpose is to identify the strategies or actions to promote productive
        involvement of stakeholders in decision making and project execution.
        It may be limited to specific stakeholders or stakeholder groups.

          39. d. Organizational communications requirements
                   Many organizations have established communications requirements
                   such as who must approve information that is communicated to certain
                   stakeholders whether they are internal or external to the project. If your
                   organization has such policies, you should review them as you Manage
                   Stakeholder Engagement. [Executing]

                   In Monitor Stakeholder Engagement, they are examples of decision-
                   making techniques used in Monitor Stakeholder Engagement. Multi-
                   criteria decision analysis can be used to prioritize and weight the
                   criteria to be used for successful stakeholder engagement and to
                   identify the best choice. Voting also can be used to select the best
                   response if there is a variance in stakeholder engagement. [Monitoring

Practice Test

This practice test is designed to simulate PMI(R)'s 200-question PMP(R) certification
exam.
     INSTRUCTIONS: Note the most suitable answer for each multiple-choice
     question in the appropriate space on the answer sheet.


  1. You recently took over a relatively new project expected to last another seven
     years. The previous project manager completed most of the WBS. When you
     begin to define the project activities, you realize that the WBS work packages
     expected to occur in the next year are planned in detail, but the work
     packages for later in the future (three years or more) are not planned with
     much detail, if any detail at all. You determine--
    a. It is a major problem. The WBS is incomplete and you need to redefine
       the project scope to complete the project schedule.
    b. It is a problem that must be resolved quickly. The previous project
       manager was not done with the WBS, and you must stop the project to
       complete the WBS in sufficient detail.
    c. It is not a problem at this time. The previous project manager was using
       the rolling wave planning technique, so you are able to continue defining
       the activities.
    d. It is not a problem at this time. You can only plan what you know. You
       plan to communicate to the project sponsor that the WBS is not sufficient
       to plan the whole project and that the sponsor can worry about the
       details.




                                                                                   257

           2. You are managing a project to transform your organization into one that
              is more customer centric as your executives realize they no longer can
              assume existing customers will stay with your firm given offerings by
              the competition. You and your team identified over 300 stakeholders and
              classified them. You realize 45 are influential but negative to the project. You
              then prepared your stakeholder engagement plan. Now, you find you are
              addressing concerns from these stakeholders plus others, and it consumes
              most of your time. However, it is important because--
             a.   You want to increase their support and minimize resistance
             b.   The stakeholders only wish to work with you
             c.   You need committed stakeholders to ensure your project continues
             d.   You realize your project has the greatest chance for success if it operates
                  in a projectized environment, and stakeholder support is paramount

           3. On your project to construct a new runway for your City's airport, you
              are in the process of selecting sellers for various parts of this project. You
              have conducted your make-or-buy analysis and have issued Requests for

         34. Assume that your actual costs are $1,000; your planned value is $1,200; and
             your earned value is $1,500. Based on these data, what can be determined
             regarding your schedule variance?
             a. At -$300, the physical progress is being accomplished at a slower rate
                than is planned, indicating an unfavorable situation.
             b. At +$300, the situation is favorable, as physical progress is being
                accomplished ahead of your plan.
             c. At +$500, the situation is favorable, as physical progress is being
                accomplished at a lower cost than was forecasted.
             d. At -$300, you have a behind-schedule condition, and your critical path
                has slipped.

          35. You are concerned because when you did your stakeholder engagement
              assessment matrix, one of the stakeholders you classified as leading seems
              to now lack interest in your project. This stakeholder, your Chief Financial
              Officer, is someone you consider critical to success. You have been
              monitoring stakeholder engagement throughout the project. You realize
              you need to meet with this stakeholder personally and have a meeting
              scheduled. You want to see if the Chief Financial Officer feels you need
              to modify your stakeholder engagement strategies and plan. During this

                life-cycle phase
             c. Place emphasis on improving the productivity by which work was being
                performed
             d. Recognize that your original estimates were fundamentally flawed, and
                your project is in an atypical situation
                                                                       Practice Test      267

           way to generate electrical power. It is in this remote location as stakeholders
           will not know about it and become negative toward it if it were near their
           homes. To ensure physical resources arrive as specified, the project manager
           must--
           a.   Avoid a large expenditure of resources
           b.   Follow the project schedule
           c.   Specify in detail the problem and use problem solving to solve it
           d.   Identify and deal with resource shortages

        91. You are working to control resource use on your manufacturing project,
            which requires different types of physical resources. You want to allocate
            and use the necessary materials in a timely and effective way. Fortunately,
            your organization specializes in this area and has a knowledge repository
            available, which is easy to access and use. It includes--
           a.   Process analysis
           b.   Industry-specific resources
           c.   Resource configurations
           d.   Total productive maintenance

       92. You are preparing your cost estimate for your project in robotics. Already,
           some competitors have learned about this product, and they want to be
           possible purchasers of the project when it is complete. You consider this to
           be an opportunity, which means--
           a.   Your cost estimate's accuracy rate should be from -5% to +10%
           b.   You need to reduce activity costs as much as possible
           c.   Your estimate should include the cost of financing
           d.   You should include indirect costs in your estimate

       93. You are planning a project and want to account for how the project will
           be managed in the future. While building your cost performance data, you
           want to provide guidance for when the project is later executed, because
           you know that different responses are required depending upon the degree
           of variance from the baseline. For example, a variance of 10 percent might
           not require immediate action, whereas a variance of 20 percent will require
           more immediate action and investigation. You decide to include the details
           of how to manage the cost variances in the--
           a.   Cost management plan
           b.   Change management plan
           c.   Performance measurement plan

    following represents your team's stage of development?
   a.   Storming
   b.   Norming
   c.   Adjourning

    Before doing so, you need to--
   a.   Manage knowledge transfer
   b.   Ensue you met your planned success criteria
   c.   Conduct a review with your three contractors
   d.   Resolve all risks

96. You are working on a project and want to identify the cause of problems you
    are having as you Control Scope. You wonder if you need to tailor some of
    the processes in your organization to better meet your project's ability to be a
    success. You realize in the area of Control Scope it is not necessary as--
   a.   More inspections can be done
   b.   Informal scope control related practices are used
   c.   You have work performance information to review
   d.   You can use walkthroughs

97. You are working on a construction project in a city different from your
    headquarters' location. You and your team have not worked in this city, City
    B, previously, and you lack knowledge of the local building codes. You had
    a team member review the codes, and he said they were in far greater detail
    than those in your city, City A. In addition, your new project in City B is
    to take three years to complete and will use some unproven technology.
    Plus, your company wants you to follow agile, so you decided to collect
    requirements in user stories. In this situation, your best scheduling approach
    is--
   a.   Agile release planning
   b.   On-demand scheduling
   c.   Iterative scheduling with a backlog
   d.   Critical chain

          98. Assume that you are managing a project that once completed will take
              your company into new markets. Since it is so significant, it has the interest
              of executive managers and other key internal stakeholders. You know for
              success, the marketing department will play a key role. You and your team
              identified them as key stakeholders. You met with the Chief Marketing
              Officer, and she indicated she would support the project. However, each
              time you have had a status review meeting with the executive group,
              except for the first meeting, the Chief Marketing Officer has not attended
              subsequent meetings. She also has not sent someone from her staff. This
              situation shows the importance of--
             a.   Executive support
             b.   The need to escalate this issue to your sponsor
             c.   Maintaining the stakeholder register
             d.   Engaging stakeholders at certain stages

          99. The nature of project work is such that it inevitably changes. You know this
              is the case on your software project as you were about 50% done when the
              company announced all software work was to be done using agile, even
              work in progress, and your project was using waterfall. You now believe
              it is time to ensure your stakeholders have not changed, and you want to
              monitor and assess stakeholder engagement levels. You decide to--
             a.   Review work performance information
             b.   Hold some meetings
             c.   Use subject matter experts
             d.   Reevaluate your power/interest grid

         100. Communications develops the relationships for successful project outcomes.
              They can vary from short e-mails to formal meetings and presentations.
              There are two parts to successful communications. The first part is--
             a.   Preparing the communications management plan
             b.   Determining whether stakeholders are internal or external
             c.   Assessing cultural differences

102. You are managing a two-year project to transform your company, so it is
     more customer facing. No longer will work be done in silos, and instead,
     cross-functional teams will be used. The goal is the customer will know
     exactly whom to contact in the company with a question and will not have
     to make a number of calls to find the right person. Since this approach is
     one of the company's strategic priorities, the project management plan--
    a. Requires subsidiary plans from the other nine knowledge areas to be part
       of the plan
    b. Relies on organizational assets to complete it
    c. Needs stakeholder buy it at all levels to ensure success

     to be considered a success, you need people on your team that work in
     these functional departments. To make sure the functional managers will
     sign off on the charter and commit the resources you need at the time you
     need them, you decide to--
    a.   Conduct interviews
    b.   Have meetings
    c.   Convene a focus group

110. You are working extremely hard to manage the engagement of your
     stakeholders. You hold extensive meetings with those whom you have
     classified as leading, so they can assist you in changing resistors to be at
     least neutral. You also are using a variety of forums to connect with them
     and to continually identify new stakeholders. You decided to adapt agile
     since it is a software project and hold sprint planning meetings plus daily
     stand-up meetings with your team. Lately, even though the team had been
     working well together, and you consider it to be in the performing stage for

              project, and the team members agreed in the project's ground rules that
              were established. However, while your sponsor liked the idea, the human
              resources department states individual performance appraisals must be done.

              were hired to move the center into a formal project management approach
              since you have your PMP, so you decided the best approach to demonstrate
              the value of project management was to use this culture change as a project.

Appendix: Study Matrix


Overview
Periodically, the Project Management Institute (PMI(R)) publishes a Role
Delineation Study (RDS) and uses to define the responsibilities of the recipients
of the Project Management Professional (PMP(R)) credential, In June 2015, PMI
issued a new RDS, for the PMP(R), which then was published as the PMI(R) PMP(R)
Examination Content Outline (ECO). You can download it from PMI's web site
und the Certification section and then by the PMP(c). It serves as the foundation
for the PMP(R) exam and for our 200-question practice test in this book and in our
on-line test. This RDS is in effect for this PMP(c) exam beginning in 2018.
   The ECO identified five broad performance domains and determined how
the 175 questions on the PMP(R) exam would be distributed according to these
domains.* The distribution is as follows:


                                  I    Initiating                         13%
                                  II   Planning                           24%
                                  III Executing                           31%
                                  IV Monitoring and Controlling 25%
                                  V    Closing                            7%


   The matrix beginning on page identifies each practice test question according
to its performance domain and its knowledge area in the PMBOK(R) Guide.
   The matrix is designed to help you--

      Assess your strengths and weaknesses in each of the performance domains
      Identify those areas in which you need additional study before you take the
      PMP(R) exam

*   PMI(R) distributes 25 pretest questions across the five domains in any way that it deems appropriate for the
    purpose of "testing" the questions.

                                                                                                            315

         Here is an easy way to use the matrix:

           Step 1 Circle all the questions you missed on the practice test in Column 1.
           Step 2 For each circled question, note the corresponding process in Column 2.
           Step 3 To determine whether any patterns emerge indicating weak areas,
             tally the information you obtained from the matrix.
           Step 4 To ensure that you have a good understanding of the major
             management processes that define a particular knowledge area, including
             the inputs, tools and techniques, and outputs, refer to the appropriate
             knowledge area in the PMBOK(R) Guide.

         The last column in the matrix is provided for your notes.

1. c. It is not a problem at this time. The previous project manager was
      using the rolling wave planning technique, so you are able to continue
      defining the activities.
      Rolling wave planning provides progressive detailing of the work to be
      accomplished throughout the life of the project. Decomposition is a tool
      and technique in Create WBS and recognizes rolling wave planning
      may be needed for deliverables or subcomponents that will not be
      accomplished until much later in the project. In this case, the team
      waits until more information about the deliverable or subcomponent is
      available. This approach is rolling wave planning. [Planning]

2. a. You want to increase their support and minimize resistance
      During the Manage Stakeholder Engagement process, its benefit is
      that it enables the project manager to increase support and minimize
      resistance from stakeholders. This process involves communicating
      and working with stakeholders to meet their needs and expectations.

           3. a. Review invoicing and payment information
                  Invoicing and payment information as well as financial policies and
                  procedures are one of the organizational process assets to review as
                  an input to Conduct Procurements. The selected seller(s) will want to
                  know how to submit invoices and also know when they will be paid,
                  often dictated by the terms and conditions in the type of agreement.

           4. c. Determining problems and identifying business needs
                  A greater focus on requirements is an emerging trend in project
                  management. Increasingly in the global world in which project work
                  is done, more organizations are using business analysts to help define,
                  manage, and control requirements activities. A business analyst is
                  assigned to this team in this question. For success, the business
                  analyst and the project manager need to work collaboratively and
                  understand each other's role. Through this collaboration, the first step
                  is to determine the problems and understand the business needs. It
                  is followed by identifying and recommending solutions. Then, the
                  requirements are elicited, documented, and managed, and finally the
                  goal is to implement them successfully. [Planning]

           5. c. Part of the project management plan
                  Most of the components in the project management plan are produced
                  in other processes than in Project Integration Management. These
                  three are ones that are prepared during this part of Project Integration
                  Management. The project life cycle describes the phases in the
                  project from initiating to closing; the development approach describes
                  whether it is one that is predictive, iterative, agile, or a hybrid; and
                  the management reviews are the times in the project in which the
                  project manager and other stakeholders will review progress to see
                  if performance is as expected or if preventive or corrective action is
                  needed. [Planning]

6. a. Control Procurements
      The purpose of Control Procurements is to ensure that the contractual
      requirements are met by the seller. This objective is accomplished by
      managing procurement relationships, monitoring contract performance,
      making changes and corrections to contracts if appropriate, and closing
      contracts. In this process, change requests are an output and are
      processed for review and disposition through the Perform Integrated
      Change Control process. [Monitoring and Controlling]

7. b. The lowest level of detail to derive information
      Work performance data are an output of the Direct and Manage Project
      Work process. They are the raw observations and measurements
      identified during activities being performed to do the project work.
      Therefore, they are often viewed as the lowest level of detail from
      which to derive information by other processes. The data are gathered
      and then passed to the controlling processes of each process area for
      further analysis. [Executing]

8. a. Use it to involve your team in the planning process
      Meetings are a tool and technique in the Develop Project Management
      Process when the project management plan is prepared. A kick-off
      meeting tends to be used when the plan is complete, and the executing
      process begins. However, in this situation, it is a small project. The
      kick-off meeting thus is recommended shortly after initiating is
      complete since there is usually only one team responsible for planning
      and executing. [Planning]

           9. c. Job shadowing
                  Observation/conversation are an interpersonal and team skill tool
                  and technique in the Collect Requirements process. They provide a
                  way to view individuals in their environment and to see how they
                  perform their jobs or tasks and carry out processes. It is helpful in
                  situations in which people may have difficulty or are reluctant to state
                  their requirements. Another term for this approach is job shadowing
                  and usually is done by an observer viewing the person performing
                  his or her job. It can also be done by a `participant observer' who is
                  performing a process or procedure to experience how it is done to
                  uncover hidden requirements. [Planning]

          10. a. Plan-do-check-act
                  The plan-do-check act cycle is the basis for quality improvement
                  and efficiency. It was defined by Shewhart and modified by Deming.
                  Quality Management focuses on quality improvement, which also
                  includes total quality management, Six Sigma, and Lean Six Sigma.
                  These techniques improve project management quality and the quality
                  of the product, service, or result. Quality improvement methods are a
                  tool and technique in Manage Quality. [Executing]

          11. c. Use an affinity diagram
                  In Manage Quality, an affinity diagram is a data representation tool and
                  technique. This diagram is used to generate ideas that can be linked
                  to form organized patterns of thought about a problem. Using them
                  in project management, one can enhance the creation of the WBS by
                  using it to give structure to the decomposition of scope. [Executing]

12. d. Managing the interfaces among the sellers
       The Control Procurements process involves managing procurement
       relationships, monitoring contract performance, and making changes
       and corrections to contracts as needed. On a large project with multiple
       sellers as in this question, a major aspect is managing the interfaces
       among the sellers. Many organizations have contract administration as
       an administrative function separate from the project organization. While
       a procurement administrator may be on the core team, typically this
       person reports to someone other than the project manager in a different
       department. [Monitoring and Controlling]

13. c. Perform verification and audit on each configuration item
       Configuration management is an integral part of the Perform Integrated
       Change Control process. The first step is to identify the specific
       configuration item. The next step is to record and report the status of
       each configuration item. The answer is the last step. The verification
       and audits ensure the project's configuration item is correct. It also
       ensures any corresponding changes are registered, assessed, approved,
       tracked and implemented correctly. The purpose is to ensure the
       functional requirements defined in the formal configuration documents
       are met. [Monitoring and Controlling]

14. b. Procurement management plan
       The procurement management plan contains the activities to be done
       in the procurement process regardless of whether it is an international,
       national, or local bid. If it is financed externally, the funding sources
       and availability should be aligned with the procurement management
       plan and project schedule. It may be formal or informal, detailed or
       broadly framed based on the project needs. [Planning]

        15. c. Variance analysis
                Variance analysis reviews the differences or variances between

                of the Knowledge Areas, but in Monitor and Control Project Work,
                it reviews variances from an integrated perspective considering cost,
                time, and resource variance in relationship to each other. The objective
                is to have an overview view of variance on the project such that if
                required preventive or corrective action can be taken. [Monitoring and

17. d. A quality audit
       A quality audit is a tool and technique in the Manage Quality process.
       It is primarily used to determine whether the project team is complying
       with organizational and project policies, processes, and procedures.
       It identifies good and best practices being implemented; areas of
       nonconformity, gaps, and shortcomings; good practices introduced
       or implemented in similar projects or in the industry; ways to offer
       assistance positively to improve process implementation to help the
       team increase productivity; and highlights of the audit are placed in the
       lessons-learned repository. [Executing]

18. b. Defect repairs
       Change requests are an input to the Perform Integrated Change Control
       process. They also may include corrective action and preventive action
       and updates to formally controlled documents or deliverables if they
       reflect additional ideas or content. Sometimes performance against
       baselines may be affected, but the project manager is responsible for
       making these decisions. If the change requests do affect baselines,
       additional information is required. [Monitoring and Controlling]

19. d. Identified in the project management plan
       Usually, the project manager or the project sponsor can approve or
       reject a documented change request. At times, a Change Control Board
       (CCB) is used, which later may require customer or sponsor approval
       unless they are on the CCB. Regardless, the responsible person
       is identified in the project management plan or by organizational
       procedures. [Monitoring and Controlling]

          20. d. Change control meetings
                  Meetings, referred to as change control meetings, are a tool and
                  technique in Integrated Change Control. Often, a project will set up
                  a CCB, which has the responsibility for meeting and reviewing the
                  change requests, and approving, rejecting, or deferring them. Assessing
                  the impact of the change is part of the meeting, and alternatives
                  may be discussed and proposed. Finally, the decision of the CCB
                  is communicated to the required user or group. The CCB also may
                  review configuration management activities. Decisions of the board
                  are documented and agreed upon by appropriate stakeholders and
                  are documented in the change management plan. The CCB decisions
                  are documented to stakeholders for information and follow-up actions.

          21. b. Adds business value as it links to business and project objectives
                  The requirements traceability matrix is a grid that links requirements
                  to their origin and traces them throughout the life cycle. It is an output
                  in Collect Requirements. This approach helps to ensure that each
                  requirement adds value as it links to the business and project objectives.
                  It also tracks requirements during the life cycle to help ensure that the
                  requirements listed in the requirements document are delivered at the
                  end of the project. It provides a structure to manage changes to product
                  scope. [Planning]

23. c. Requirements traceability matrix
       Three project documents to consider since they are inputs to Perform
       Integrated Change Control are the basis of estimates [another possible
       answer to this question], the risk report, and the requirements
       traceability matrix. It is useful because it helps assess the impact of the
       change on the project's scope. [Monitoring and Controlling]

24. b. Concentrating on small batch systems
       Agile methods involve frequent quality and review steps that are built
       into the project. They focus on small batch systems in order to uncover
       inconsistencies and quality issues as early in the project as possible
       when the overall life cycle costs are low. A number of retrospectives
       also are used to evaluate the effectiveness of the quality processes, so
       improvement can be made. [Executing]

25. c. Control Quality is concerned with meeting the quality requirements for
       the deliverables
       Validate Scope focuses on accepting project deliverables. Control
       Quality is one way to ensure the correctness of the deliverables and
       meeting the quality specifications for the deliverables, which is why
       Control Quality typically is done before Validate Scope. Further,
       the verified deliverables obtained from Control Quality have been
       reviewed with the customer or sponsor to ensure they are completely
       satisfied and have received formal acceptance from the customer or
       sponsor. In the Validate Scope process, verified deliverables are a
       tool and technique used to ensure project deliverables are completed
       and checked for correctness through Control Quality. [Monitoring and

                  Administrative activities are necessary to close the project or a phase.
                  The answer is the first activity to do to satisfy completion of the
                  exit criteria for the phase or the project. The second administrative
                  activity is to ensure contractual agreements are completed; followed
                  by transferring the project's products, services, or results to the next
                  phase or productions or operations; collecting suggestion for improving
                  organizational policies and procedures; and last but not least measuring
                  stakeholder satisfaction. [Closing]

          27. c. Finding solutions for these issues and other challenges
                  Problem solving is a tool and technique in Manage Quality. It involves
                  finding solutions for issues or challenges. It includes gathering
                  additional information, using critical thinking, being creative, and
                  using quantitative and logical approaches. Often, problems can arise
                  from Control Quality or through audits. They may be associated with
                  a process or a deliverable. Problem solving with a structured approach
                  tends to result in a long-lasting solution. [Executing]

          28. b. You are holding bi-weekly reviews to identify emergent risks.
                  Project resilience is an emerging trend in risk management with the
                  increase in unknown unknowns. These risks are recognized after they
                  occur, which means the best way to handle them is through project
                  resilience. One way to do so especially in the Monitor Risks process
                  is to have frequent reviews of early warning signs such that any
                  emergent risks can be identified and then managed as soon as possible.

29. a. Need to spend less time defining requirements early on your project
       In an agile environment, especially if the requirements are evolving,
       the scope may not be understood at the beginning of the project. Using
       agile methods then less time is spent trying to define and agree on
       scope early in the project. More time instead is spent in establishing the
       process for ongoing discovery and refinement. This approach tends to
       mean there is a gap between the real business requirements and the
       business requirements that were stated when the project was approved.
       With agile, it focuses on building and reviewing prototypes and release
       versions to refine requirements. Scope then is defined and redefined
       throughout the project, and requirements constitute the backlog.

30. b. Work shadowing
       There are a number of tools and techniques in Manage Project
       Knowledge. Some key words in this question are diversity, innovation,
       and complexity. Therefore, since the project represents a new way of
       working, work shadowing is an excellent tool and technique to use. In
       it you or a member of your team can observe how a key stakeholder
       does his or her work under the current policies and procedures to
       learn what they will need to do to change to the new methods and the
       person's level of resistance involved. The other answers are from inputs

31. d. Continuously monitor the project
       The Monitor and Control Project Work process is performed
       throughout the project. Monitoring includes collecting, measuring, and
       disseminating performance information and assessing measurements
       and trends to effect process improvement. Continuous monitoring
       is important because it provides insight into the project's health,
       highlighting areas that may require special attention. [Monitoring and

          32. d. Determine whether the project should continue to the next phase
                  The review at the end of a project phase is called a phase gate. It
                  also may be called a stage gate, phase review, kill point, or phase
                  entrance or phase exit. In this review, the project's performance and
                  progress are compared to the project and business documents such as
                  the business case, project charter, project management plan, and the
                  benefits management plan. The purpose of this review is to determine
                  whether the project should continue to the next phase, continue with
                  modification, end the project, stay in the phase, or repeat the entire
                  phase or parts of it. [Initiating]

                  interdependently and work through issues smoothly and effectively.
                  The project manager then can empower the team to participate in

                  Schedule variance is calculated as EV - PV, or $1,500 - $1,200 = +$300.
                  Because the SV is positive, physical progress is being accomplished at a
                  faster rate than planned. It is a useful metric as it can indicate when a

35. b. Ask open-ended questions and use active listening
       The Monitor Stakeholder Engagement process is ongoing throughout
       the project. This situation shows a leading stakeholder, the Chief
       Financial Officer, has lost interest. The process suggests a number of
       interpersonal and team skills to use, one of which is active listening.
       At the meeting with this key stakeholder, the project manager
       should formulate some open-ended questions to ask. Then, he or
       she uses active listening to reduce any misunderstandings and any
       miscommunication. Since the goal is to continue to ensure this
       stakeholder is in the leading category, as a next step the project
       manager should request another meeting and explain strategies to
       modify the stakeholder engagement strategy to accommodate the Chief
       Financial Officer's concerns. [Monitoring and Controlling]

36. d. Recognize that your original estimates were fundamentally flawed, and
       your project is in an atypical situation
       CPI = EV/AC. It is considered the most critical earned value
       management metric since it measures the cost efficiency for the
       completed work. The CPI is useful for determining project status and
       provides a basis to estimate project cost and schedule outcomes. A CPI
       of 0.44 means that for every dollar spent, you are only receiving 44
       cents of progress. Therefore, something is not correct with how you
       planned your project, or your original estimates were fundamentally
       flawed, and your project is in an atypical situation. You might want to
       reconsider a formal "replan" and/or take a new baseline of your project.

37. c. A high-level cost forecast
       Projects with a high degree of uncertainty or if the scope is not fully
       defined may not benefit from detailed cost calculations because there
       are frequent changes. In an agile environment, lightweight estimates
       can be used to generate a high-level cost of project labor costs, which
       can be adjusted when changes are made. A detailed estimate is then
       used for a short-term planning horizon. [Planning]

                commitment of funds for the project. If there is a variance between
                the funding limits and the planned expenditures, it may mean
                the rescheduling of some work to level out the expenditures. It is
                accomplished by placing imposed date constraints on work in the
                project's schedule. [Planning]

                A number of activities are involved in the Control Costs process. The
                key to its effectiveness is in managing the approved cost baseline and
                any changes to it. Since change is inevitable on projects, it is a best
                practice each time there is an approved change to notify stakeholders of
                the costs to implement it, which tracks to this question as management
                is interested in a focus on controlling costs. Often stakeholders wish to

        performance measurements are used to assess the magnitude of
        variation to the original cost baseline. It is necessary to determine the
        cause and degree of variance relative to the baseline, but over time, the
        percentage range of acceptable variation will decrease as stakeholders
        see more work is being accomplished. They also will be less likely to
        terminate the project recognizing its sunk costs and the work completed
        to date. [Monitoring and Controlling]

43. c. Estimate at completion
        EAC is the expected total cost to complete all work expressed as the
        sum of the actual costs to date and the estimate to complete [ETC] or
        the expected cost to finish all remaining work. It can be calculated
        several different ways. To use it effectively the project team must predict
        what it will take for the ETC based on experience to date. It may differ
        from the budget at completion. It is a data analysis tool and technique
        in this process. [Monitoring and Controlling]

          47. c. EAC = AC + Bottom-up ETC
                  This formula assumes that all of the remaining work is independent
                  of the burn rate incurred thus far. AC is $2,900 + [$500 + $1,000].
                  The $500 is from Activity B, and the $1,000 is from Activity C. This
                  bottom-up approach builds on the actual costs and experience incurred
                  for the work completed and requires a new estimate to complete the
                  remaining work. [Monitoring and Controlling]

50. a. Influencing the factors that create change to the authorized cost
       baseline
        The Control Costs process is concerned with ensuring that requested
        changes have been acted upon, managing actual changes if and when
        they occur, ensuring cost expenditures do not exceed authorized
        funding, monitoring cost and work performance, preventing
        unapproved changes from being included in the reported cost or
        resource use, informing stakeholders of all approved changes and their
        costs, and bringing expected cost overruns within acceptable limits.

51. a. Agreement and trust
        In the Acquire Team process, the project manager is identifying, motivating,
        maintaining, leading and inspiring the team to meet project objectives.
        Teamwork is a critical factor in project success. High team performance is
        characterized by agreement and trust among team members. The project
        manager can promote working relationships in a climate of mutual trust.
        Feelings of trust and agreement among the team members raises morale,
        lowers conflict, and increases teamwork. [Executing]

52. b. An enterprise environmental factor
        Enterprise environmental factors can influence how the project
        management plan is developed. While there are several to consider,
        one is the project management body of knowledge for the vertical
        market such as construction or a focus area - in this case agile software
        development. Other examples in this category are environmental, safety,
        or risk as a focus area. [Planning]

        53. b. Reprioritizing the remaining work plan
                There are a number of areas in Control Schedule if agile is used. While
                one is the answer to this question, others are: comparing the project's
                current status by comparing the total amount of work delivered and
                accepted against the estimated amounts of work for the time cycle;
                conducting retrospectives or lessons learned to correct processes
                and possibly make improvements; determining the rate deliverables
                are produced, validated, and accepted in a given time per iteration;
                determining if the project schedule has changed; and managing actual
                changes as they occur. [Monitoring and Controlling]

        55. b. Encourage independent work
                In the Develop Team process, motivation is one of the interpersonal
                and team skills to use. Although people are motivated differently,
                the objective of motivation in this process is to provide a reason for
                someone to act. Teams are motivated if they can be empowered to
                participate in decision making and if they are encouraged to work
                independently. [Executing]

58. a. Benefit management plan
       The other answers are covered in the business case and its development.
       The benefit management plan is critical as it describes how and
       when the project's benefits will be delivered and ways to measure
       them. Benefits are outcomes of actions, behaviors, products, services,
       or results, which provide value to the organization and the project's
       intended beneficiaries. Developing this plan is done early in the project's
       life cycle to define the target benefits to be realized. [Initiating]

60. b. The risk appetite
       The risk appetite is an output from Plan Risk Management. It is also
       recorded in the risk management plan. It is significant as it states the
       stakeholders' measurable risk thresholds around each project objective.
       These individual thresholds then determine the acceptable level of
       overall risk thresholds around a project objective. They also are used
       in defining the probability and impact definitions used to evaluate and
       prioritize individual project risks. [Planning]

        61. b. Achieving project objectives
               Team assessments are an output of Develop Team. After some
               development efforts, such as training, and team building are
               implemented, the project manager conducts informal or formal team
               assessments of the team's effectiveness. Expected team development
               activities are supposed to increase the team's performance, which then
               leads to the likelihood of meeting the project's objectives. [Executing]

        62. b. Monte Carlo analysis
               Simulation is a tool and technique for the Develop Schedule process as
               it models the combined effects of individual project risks and any other
               sources of uncertainty to help evaluate the probability of achieving
               the project's objectives. Monte Carlo analysis is the most commonly
               used simulation technique. When it is used, risks and other sources of
               uncertainty are used to calculate possible schedule outcomes for the
               project. It calculates multiple work package durations with different
               sets of activity assumptions, constraints, issues, or scenarios using
               probability durations to determine the probability of achieving a certain
               project finish date. [Planning]

        63. d. Establish a knowledge management repository
               Even if the origination has a defined project management methodology
               to follow, each project is unique. A tailoring consideration is knowledge
               management. It is useful in the Monitor Communications process to set
               up a knowledge repository. Setting it up is the easy part. For it to be
               used, it needs up-to-date content that is easy to locate. Also, in Monitor
               Communications, the project management information system is a
               tool and technique. The knowledge repository can be part of it since
               it consists of standard tools for the project manager to capture, store,
               and distribute information to stakeholders following guidelines in the
               communications management plan. [Monitoring and Controlling]

64. d. Configuration management plan
       This plan is one that is prepared during the Develop Project
       Management Plan process and is an additional component to the
       plan. It is used to describe how information about the project items,
       and which items, will be recorded and updated. The purpose is to
       ensure the product, service, or result of the project is consistent and/or
       operative. [Planning]

66. b. Doubling the number of needed resources
       The Estimate Activity Duration process provides an estimate of the
       amount of work to complete an activity and the resources estimated to
       do so. In this question, you know you need key SMEs to be available
       at certain times, and resources tend to be scarce when specialization
       is concerned. In estimating durations, the number of resources needed
       must be considered. While increasing the number of resources to twice
       the original number can be done, it may not always reduce the time
       by half; it may even require extra time because of risk. Additionally, at
       some point too many resources may even increase duration because
       of knowledge transfer, the learning curve, additional coordination, and
       possibly other factors. [Planning]

                sections of the project management plan are updated because of these
                changes. Examples are the resource management, communications
                management, and stakeholder engagement plans. In the resource
                management plan, team responsibilities for stakeholder engagement
                may need updates. In the communications management plan, the
                communications strategy may need updates and in the stakeholder
                engagement plan, information about the stakeholder community may
                need updates as different stakeholders are interested in different phases
                of the project. [Monitoring and Controlling]

70. b. It needs to be robust
       The project management plan is the document used to define the
       project work. It therefore needs to be robust enough to respond to
       changes in the project environment, which probably will occur in
       this situation since the project is to last three years. This agility may
       result in more information as the project progresses, and the project
       management plan is not baselined immediately as updates to this plan
       may be required many times. [Planning]

72. b. An external dependency
       Some dependencies are external ones, and they involve a relationship
       between project activities and non-project activities. In sequencing
       activities, the project management team must determine which
       dependencies are external as they are usually outside of the team's
       control. Other examples of dependencies, a tool and technique

       73. d. Trend analysis
              Trend analysis is used in many control processes in project
              management. As a tool and technique in the data analysis category
              in Control Schedule, trend analysis examines the performance of the
              project over time to determine whether performance is improving
              or deteriorating. Graphical analysis techniques are valuable in trend
              analysis to understand performance to date and to compare it to future
              performance goals in the form of completion dates. [Monitoring and

       74. c. Focusing on codified explicit knowledge
              In the Manage Project Knowledge process, it is a common
              misperception that the key to managing project knowledge is to only
              document it, so it can be shared. Another misperception is managing
              project knowledge consists solely of only codified, explicit knowledge
              can be shared in this way; however, codified explicit knowledge
              lacks context and then can easily lead to different interpretations as
              to its meaning and usefulness. While it can be shared, it may not
              be understood or applied as desired. Tacit knowledge, on the other
              hand, has context built into it, but it is difficult to codify. This means
              it resides in the heads of the people involved and is then shared
              through conversations and interactions between them. Surveys, if
              well-constructed by the knowledge management specialist and the
              people involved, and one-on-one discussions between the knowledge
              management specialist and the people involved are other methods to
              use. [Executing]

       75. b. Accommodating
              Accommodating or smoothing is the preferred conflict resolution
              approach in this situation. In it, areas of agreement are emphasized
              rather than areas of difference. By doing so, one's position is conceded
              to that of the needs of the other person in this situation with the goal of
              maintaining harmony and relationships, the key words in this question.

76. b. Lessons learned register
       In closing the project, the first output is project document updates.
       They may be marked as final versions since the project is closed. The
       lessons learned register is the one of particular importance since it
       is then finalized and includes information on the project, as in this
       example, or phase closure. This final lesson learned register may
       include information on benefits management, accuracy of the business
       case, project and development life cycles, risk and issue management,
       and stakeholder engagement. [Closing]

       There are numerous advances in tools in procurement management.
       Online tools are more prevalent and helpful for the buyer and the seller.
       In the construction and infrastructure field, the building information
       model is a software tool that has proven to save significant amounts
       of time and money. It enables a substantial reduction in construction
       claims, which then reduces the schedule and budget set aside for
       claims. Many organizations and governments throughout the world are
       mandating its use. [Monitoring and Controlling]

78. b. Project charter
       Although the project charter cannot stop conflicts from arising, it can
       provide a framework to help resolve them, because it describes the
       project manager's authority to apply organizational resources to project
       activities. It is prepared by the project sponsor, as in this situation,
       and often in collaboration with the project manager as hopefully the
       project manager has been assigned and can participate. Regardless it is
       developed prior to the start of project planning. [Initiating]

        79. a. Detect and control any defects or issues before you finish the project
                There are five levels of increasingly effective quality management. The
                answer is the second one as you want to detect and control defects before
                deliverables are given to the customer. This is done as part of Control
                Quality. The Control Quality process has related costs, which primarily are
                appraisal costs and internal failure costs. [Monitoring and Controlling]

        80. c. Organizational change management
                Organizational change management can influence team behavior.
                Change is not only limited to changes at the project level but also to
                changes at the organizational level. Rather than being concerned about
                solely managing changes to scope, time, cost, and quality, the project
                manager must embrace a broader approach and be aware of changes
                at the organizational level. These changes are strategic and may mean
                a change in the project's priority because of a new strategic objective
                that makes it less important; mergers or acquisitions such as the new
                company may have a similar project under way or recently completed;
                and the constant need to do more with less meaning the need to cut the
                budget or the number of resources, to list a few. The project manager
                needs to broaden his or her sphere of influence and work closely with
                members of the portfolio group or the strategic planning group to learn
                about any possible changes and then how to exploit and adapt them to
                benefit the project rather than taking a negative view. [Executing]

        81. c. Create value for your team and for the suppliers
                Quality is everyone's responsibility including suppliers. The work done by
                suppliers must be of the highest possible quality. Your goal to achieving
                success in this area is to establish a mutually beneficial relationship with
                the suppliers ideally with long-term relationships. This mutually beneficial
                relationship then reduces your work to Control Quality and is an
                emerging practice in quality management. It enhances the ability for your
                organization and that of the suppliers' organizations to create value for
                each other, enhances joint responses to customer needs and expectations,
                and optimizes costs and resources. [Monitoring and Controlling]

82. d. Use multi-criteria decision analysis
        As a tool and technique in Acquire Resources, this approach enables
        criteria to be able to be developed and used to rate or score potential
        team members. The criteria are weighted given the team's requirements
        including items such as availability, cost, experience, ability, knowledge,
        skills, attitude, and international factors. [Executing]

83. d. A defined integrated change control process
        During the Control Resources process, change requests are an output.
        If changes occur in this process or when recommended corrective or
        preventive actions impact components of the project management plan,
        the project manager issues a change request. It is processed as defined
        in the Perform Integrated Change Control process. [Monitoring and

84. b. Use questionnaires and surveys
        In Control Quality, questionnaires and surveys are a data gathering
        technique. They are used to obtain data about customer satisfaction
        after the product or service is finished. Costs identified in these
        questionnaires and surveys may be considered external failure costs
        in the cost of quality, and if they occur, they then can have cost
        implications for the organization [Monitoring and Controlling]

        In this situation, part of your team will be located in a new country
        to your company. Given that no one has worked there before, special
        consideration is given to external negotiating policies, practices,
        processes, guidelines, and legal criteria. [Executing]

                  Schedule. Their purpose is to measure, compare, and analyze schedule
                  performance against the schedule baseline. They may review actual
                  start and finish dates, percent complete, and remaining schedule

          87. d. Defect repair
                  During the Direct and Manage Project Work process, work performance
                  data are collected, actioned, and communicated. This process requires
                  review of the impact of project changes and the implementation of
                  proposed changes, one of which is defect repair. It is an intentional
                  activity to modify a nonconforming product or project component.
                  Work performance information is an output of this process; other
                  examples are work completed, KPIs, technical performance resources,
                  actual start and finish dates of schedule activities, story point compiled,

89. c. Invite your customer and his team to project meetings
       An emerging trend in communications management is to include
       stakeholders in project meetings. In this approach, external
       stakeholders, such as the customer, are invited as well as other
       stakeholders inside the organization. It is also a practice common
       in agile processes in which during the daily stand-up meetings, any
       achievements and issues from the previous day are discussed, and the
       team discusses plans for the current day. Customer involvement may be
       useful in resolving issues that have occurred. [Executing]

90. d. Identify and deal with resource shortages
       The Control Resources process is concerned with physical resources
       and is performed throughout the project. Updating resource allocation
       requires knowing the actual resources that have been used, and
       the resources that still are needed. The project manager reviews
       performance to date. He or she then identifies resource shortages in a
       timely way. Since much of the physical resources are acquired through
       contracts/agreements, including leasing, the project manager also tracks
       the resources that are no longer required to close the contract or end
       the lease. [Monitoring and Controlling]

91. c. Resource configurations
       Controlling physical resources involves allocating and using material,
       equipment, and supplies needed for the project for its successful
       completion. Organizations that use a large amount of physical resources
       should have data on resources needed now and in the future. They also
       should have resource configurations, the answer to this question, that
       will be required to meet the demands and the supply of the resources.
       Successful project manager are ones who can manage and control
       needed physical resource effectively; otherwise, it is a source of risk to
       the project. [Monitoring and Controlling]

          92. b. You need to reduce activity costs as much as possible
                  This question shows an opportunity has been recognized, which means
                  the risk register is being used as it is an input in project documents
                  to the Estimate Costs process. It should be reviewed to as it contains
                  details of project risks that have been identified and prioritized and
                  need risk responses, which tend to involve costs. It provides detailed
                  information that can be used to estimate costs. Risks, whether threats
                  or opportunities, have an impact on both activity and overall project
                  costs. In this example, it is a potential opportunity that can benefit the
                  business depending on the response action selected as it may reduce
                  directly activity costs or accelerate the schedule. [Planning]

          93. a. Cost management plan
                  The management and control of costs focuses on variances. The cost
                  management plan includes control thresholds, also called variance
                  thresholds. Certain variances are acceptable, and others, usually
                  those falling outside a particular range, are unacceptable. The actions
                  taken by the project manager for all variances are described in the
                  cost management plan. These thresholds are typically expressed as
                  percentage deviations from the baseline plan. [Planning]

                  Tuckman; later adjourning was added as a fifth stage. In the norming
                  stage team members begin to work together, adjusting their work habits
                  and behaviors to support the team. The team members learn to trust

95. a. Manage knowledge transfer
        As you close your project, you cannot overlook the importance of
        knowledge transfer. Each person on the project brings knowledge assets
        and acquires others as he or she works on the project. By managing
        knowledge transfer, you are focusing on sharing knowledge for other
        projects under way or to be done in the future. It differs from collecting
        lessons learned, also important in closing, as its focus is on knowledge
        transfer and sharing knowledge, not hoarding it. [Closing]

        In this situation you are wondering whether you need to tailor some
        approaches in your project management methodology as they may
        not be needed. Tailoring considerations in Scope Management need to
        consider several areas, one of which is validation and control. In this
        area, the organization may have existing formal or informal validation
        and control related policies, procedures, and guidelines so tailoring is
        not needed. [Monitoring and Controlling]

97. c. Iterative scheduling with a backlog
        Iterative scheduling with a backlog is an emerging trend in developing
        a schedule. It is a form of rolling wave planning based on an adaptive
        life cycle and an agile approach in product development. Requirements
        are documented in user stories and are prioritized and refined before
        construction. Product features use time-based periods of work. Multiple
        teams can work concurrently to develop a large number of features
        with few interconnected dependencies. This approach also is open to
        changes throughout the development life cycle. [Planning]

                  engaging stakeholders at appropriate project stages to obtain, confirm,
                  and maintain their continual commitment to the project. If a key
                  stakeholder is missing meetings, it is critical for the project manager to
                  meet with this stakeholder and find out his or her concerns and actively
                  listen. If the stakeholder has concerns, then the project manager should
                  address them and see if he or she can regain the stakeholder's support.

         100. d. Developing a communications strategy
                  A communications strategy is the first step. It is based on the
                  project's needs and those of the stakeholders. Once the strategy is
                  determined, then the communications management plan is prepared,
                  which among other things ensures stakeholders receive messages
                  in various formats and means as defined by the strategy. These
                  messages constitute the planning process, which is the second part for
                  successful communications. Using the communications strategy and
                  the communications management plan then provide the foundation
                  to monitor the effect of communications and hopefully avoid
                  misunderstandings and mis-communications. [Planning]

101. a. Alternatives analysis
         In Plan Schedule Management, a tool and technique to use is data
         analysis, which includes alternatives analysis. It can include the
         scheduling method to use or how to combine different scheduling
         methods. It also can include the level of detail for the schedule, the
         need for rolling wave planning, and how often the schedule should
         be reviewed and updated. Consider a balance between the level of
         detail and the amount of time it will take to update it on the project.

102. d. Should be consistent with the portfolio management plan
         Therefore, if the portfolio management plan requires review by the key
         stakeholders each time it is revised, the same is the case for when the
         project management plan is revised. [Planning]

103. b. Resources for communications activities
         Of the answers to this question, resources are included in the
         communications management plan. Resources need to be allocated for
         communications activities. Without resources, these critical activities
         would not be performed. Also, in this plan while resources include
         human resources, they also include time and budget considerations.

104. d. Focus on goals to be served
         Decision making involves the ability to negotiate and influence the
         organization and the project management team. This answer is the
         first guideline; the other answers refer to items in leadership and
         influencing; all are examples of interpersonal skills of the project
         manager, a tool and technique in the Manage Team process. [Executing]

       105. b. Have meetings
                All four answers are tools and techniques in the Develop Project
                Charter process. However, in this situation, the best answer is to
                conduct meetings with the functional department leaders since you
                need resources from these groups for project success. These meetings
                are useful to discuss the project objectives, success criteria, key
                deliverables, high-level requirements, and other information. The
                meetings enable you to have an understanding of any concerns these
                managers may have and listen to them and provide feedback to enlist
                their support. [Initiating]

       106. d. Accelerate knowledge sharing
                In an agile environment to Monitor Risk, adaptive approaches are
                used through frequent reviews of incremental work products. It also is
                necessary to ensure the cross-functional team accelerates knowledge
                sharing and ensures risks are understood and managed. Requirements
                are updated regularly in order that risks can be reprioritized as the
                project progresses. [Monitoring and Controlling]

       107. c. Organizational strategy
                Expert judgment is a tool and technique in the Develop Project Charter
                process. It is defined as judgment provided based on experience in an
                application area, knowledge area, discipline, or industry based on the
                specific project. It may be provided by a group or by an individual. In
                developing the charter, experts are useful in organizational strategy,
                benefit management, technical knowledge of the project's industry
                and area of focus, duration and budget, and risk identification.
                Organizational strategy is useful since one purpose of the charter is to
                link the project to the organization's strategic objectives. [Initiating]

108. b. Reporting
        Meetings are a tool and technique in the Close Project or Phase process.
        They are used to confirm deliverables are accepted, to validate the
        exit criteria to realize contact completion, to evaluate stakeholder
        satisfaction, to collect lessons learned, to transfer knowledge and
        information, and to celebrate success. Close-out reporting meetings are
        an example of a type of meeting that may be held. [Closing]

109. b. Mind mapping
        In Plan Stakeholder Engagement, mind mapping is a data representation
        tool and technique to consider. It is useful because it visually organizes
        information about stakeholders, and it also shows their relationships to
        one another. [Planning]

110. c. Refer to the team charter
        In this situation, since the team members are having conflicts and are
        stakeholders to engage, you need to meet with the team and remind
        them of the team charter, which each team member agreed to follow
        and signed. The team charter is the ground rules for the team, a tool
        and technique in this process. It contains the expected behavior for the
        team members with regard to stakeholder engagement. [Executing]

111. b. Technical documentation
        Procurement documentation requires review before contracts are closed
        and later before the project is closed. The procurement documents
        are collected, indexed, and filed. It is easy to focus on cost/schedule
        information as an example, but technical documentation should not be
        overlooked in the process. Such information includes 'as-built" plans/
        drawings, "as-developed" documents, manuals, and troubleshooting
        as this information can be used for lessons learned and to evaluate
        contractors for future contracts. [Closing]

         112. c. Transfer your work to human resources
                 In the Close Process or Phase process, administrative closure
                 procedures include actions and activities to transfer the project's
                 products, services, or results (as in this example) to the next phase or to
                 production or operations as in this example. Since the project involves
                 mentoring, the human resource department or unit is the part of the
                 organization to continue this work. [Closing]
                 PMI(R), PMBOK(R) Guide, 2017, 101

         113. b. Release resources when the project is in the closing phase
                 The closing process is when all activities across all process groups
                 are complete. It verifies the project then project work is done, and
                 the project has met its objectives. While a variety of activities are
                 performed, one is to and release resources. The other answers are nice
                 practices to follow. [Closing]

         114. c. Assumption log
                 The other possible answers are part of the project charter. The
                 assumption log is the other output of this process. While high-level
                 assumptions and constraints are typically in the business case, lower
                 level activity and task assumptions are generated during the project.
                 They are then placed in this assumption log and used throughout the
                 project. [Initiating]

                 productivity and facilitate problem solving. A collaborative team is one
                 that may facilitate accelerated integration of distinct work activities,
                 improve communications, increase knowledge transfer, and promote
                 flexibility in work assignments. [Executing]

116. b. Involving team members in planning is beneficial.
        The project manager is the leader and manager of the team. Often,
        resources are preassigned to the project or have been identified in the
        charter. Although roles and responsibilities will be assigned, involving team
        members in planning and decision making is beneficial. Their participation
        when possible adds their expertise to the project, and most importantly, it
        helps strengthen their commitment to the project objectives. [Planning]

117. a. Use it to build a collaborative working environment
        Team building consists of activities to enhance the team's social relations
        and build a collaborative and cooperative working environment. Team
        building can be part of any meeting even as a five-minute agenda
        item. The team-building objective is to help individuals work together
        effectively as a team. It is ongoing for project success. [Executing]

118. c. Influencing
        All are useful skills for project managers. However, in the Control
        Resources process, negotiation and influencing are the two
        interpersonal skills tools and techniques to consider. In this situation
        influencing was necessary as the project manager has little or no direct
        control over team members as they work in a weak matrix. The ability
        of the project manager to influence stakeholders in a timely basis is
        critical to project success. By using influencing, the project manager
        can solve problems and obtain resources needed in a timely way.

119. a. Periodically review the business case
        The business case is not a one-time document but is used throughout
        the project, regardless of whether the project has multiple phases. It helps
        measure the project's success against the project outcomes. It is an input

         120. a. Conduct a risk audit
                  The risk audit is a tool and technique in Monitor Risks to evaluate the
                  effectiveness of the risk management process. The project manager is
                  responsible for ensuring these audits are done at the frequency defined
                  in the project risk management plan. They may be part of the regular
                  project review meeting, may be part of a risk review, or there may be
                  separate meetings for the risk audit. [Monitoring and Controlling]

                  Interpersonal and team skills are a tool and technique in the Develop
                  Project Charter process; one of them is conflict management skills.
                  Even if your charter provides you with the authority to acquire the
                  resources you need, unless you work in a pure projectized structure, it
                  still is a challenge to get the resources you need when you need them.
                  Functional managers will be reluctant to give you the key people you
                  require. These conflict management skills can bring stakeholders into
                  alignment on various aspects in the charter. [Initiating]

                  the schedule of technical achievement. It requires the definition of
                  objective, quantifiable measures of technical performance to help
                  compare actual results against targets. Example of these measures
                  are weight, transaction times, number of delivered defects, or storage
                  capacity. Deviation can help indicate the possible impact of threats or

123. c. Hold a meeting
        Meetings are a tool and technique in Monitor Risks. These meetings
        can include risk reviews. They are scheduled regularly to evaluate
        the effectiveness of risk responses in dealing with both overall and
        individual risks. These reviews may identify new risks, identify
        secondary risks, reassess existing risks, close outdated risks, close issues
        from risks that have occurred, and identify lessons learned. [Monitoring

124. b. You may accept more risks
        In procurement management an emerging trend is greater attention
        to risk management. No contractor can manage all the risks on a
        project. As you work in the Control Procurements process, you will
        be required to accept the risks in which the contractor lacks control,
        such as changing corporate policies, changing legislative or regulatory
        requirements, or other changes external to the project. [Monitoring and

        packages that already are behind schedule, over or under budget, or
        have resource or quality issues. Inspections and audits, answers b and
        c, are specified in the contract and are required by the buyer to verify
        compliance in the seller's work processes or deliverables; they also are

                Identify Stakeholders, it shows the current engagement levels of each
                stakeholder as compared to the desired levels for successful project
                delivery. In this process, it is used to identify gaps and to direct the
                appropriate level of communication needed to engage each stakeholder.

130. c. Use a stakeholder cube
        The stakeholder cube is a data representation tool and technique
        in Identify Stakeholders. It refines the three grids and combines the
        grid elements into a three-dimensional model. The project manager
        and team then use this grid to identify and engage the stakeholder
        community. The model has multiple dimensions to improve
        how the stakeholder community is shown as it is presented in a
        multidimensional way and can help develop communications strategies.

131. d. Direct and Manage Project Work
        Work performance data containing these examples are an output
        of Direct and Manage Project Work. They are raw observations and
        measurements identified as activities are being performed to complete
        the work of the project. These data often are viewed at the lowest
        level of detail from which information is derived by other processes.
        The data then are gathered as the work is done and passed to the
        controlling processes of the various processes for further analyses.

132. d. Forcing
        Forcing, or directing, using power or dominance, implies the use of
        position power to resolve conflict. It involves imposing one viewpoint
        at the expense of another. Project managers may use it when time is of
        the essence, when an issue is vital to the project's well-being, or when
        they think they are right based on available information. It offers only
        win-lose situations. Although this approach is appropriate when quick
        decisions are required or when unpopular issues are an essential part of
        the project, it puts project managers at risk. [Executing]

         133. b. The project charter
                  The project charter is an input in developing the project management
                  plan. It is the starting point for initial planning and at a minimum,
                  the charter defines the high-level information about the project to
                  be expanded upon in the various parts of the project management
                  plan. Outputs from other processes, organizational process assets, and
                  enterprise environmental factors are other inputs to consider. [Planning]

         134. c. Issue a change request
                  Change requests are an output of the Manage Project Team process.
                  Staffing changes can affect the rest of the team, even if by choice in this
                  situation or by an uncontrollable event. When staffing changes affect
                  the project, such as causing the schedule to slip or the budget to be
                  exceeded, a change request should be processed through the Perform
                  Integrated Change Control process. While in this question the change
                  involved moving the team member to a different assignment, staffing
                  changes also involve outsourcing the work and replacing team members
                  who leave. [Executing]

         135. d. Identify all potential project stakeholders and their relevant information
                  Stakeholder analysis is data analysis tool and technique in Identify
                  Stakeholders. Its purpose is to identify a list of stakeholders and relevant
                  information about each one. The information may include the position
                  in the organization, project roles, stakes in the project, expectations,
                  and attitudes. Stakes may be whether the stakeholders are interested,
                  have legal or moral rights, have ownership, have specialized ownership,
                  or are a contributor. [Initiating]

136. b. Project management plan
         Project scope is measured against the project management plan. The
         project scope statement and scope baseline are subsets of the project
         management plan. However, the whole plan and all the baselines
         (cost and schedule) need to be met in addition to scope. The project
         management plan is the agreement between the project manager and
         sponsor and defines what constitutes project completion. [Closing]

137. c. Follow an adaptive approach
         Large projects may use an adaptive approach for some deliverables,
         while for others a more stable approach may be used. Given the size
         and the geographic locations involved, this situation is one in which an
         adaptive approach is more suitable. A governing agreement such as a
         master services agreement may be used for the project. The adaptive
         approach may be part of an appendix. It shows changes to occur on
         adaptive scope without impacting the overall agreement, useful in
         Control Procurement. [Planning]

138. c. Assess the schedule objectives to see if benefits were achieved
         The other answers are variations of the tools and techniques used in
         Close Project or Phase. An output is the final report, which provides
         a summary of project performance. While it contains many items, it
         evaluates the schedule objectives to see if results achieved the benefits
         the project was undertaken to address. If the benefits were not met
         when the project was closed, then this section indicates the degree to
         which they were achieved and estimates what was needed for future
         benefit realization. [Closing]

         139. b. Identify the causes of the conflict
                  Conflicts are inevitable on projects. They may include scarce resources,
                  scheduling practices, and personal work styles. However, successful
                  conflict resolution can result in increased productivity and positive
                  working relationships. If managed properly, these differences may lead
                  to enhanced creativity and more effective decision making. In order to
                  address conflict, people must recognize and acknowledge that conflict
                  exists. The project manager must be able to identify the causes of the
                  conflict and then actively manage it to avoid any negative impacts.
                  Conflicts should be addressed early and usually in private with a direct,
                  collaborative approach. [Executing]

         140. c. Determine the number of languages used
                  It is often necessary in communications management to tailor how
                  processes are used. In Monitor Communications, language is a key
                  consideration. It is easy to consider English as the language preferred
                  by the team, but with the increase in virtual teams and teams with
                  people from different cultures, it may not be the preferred language to
                  use. However, it is necessary to determine how many languages are
                  used and then determine whether any allowances have been made to
                  adjust to team members from different language groups. One approach
                  to consider if diverse languages are spoken by team members as their
                  primary language is to adopt English but focus on the key 1,000 words
                  that commonly are used to ensure there are no misunderstandings
                  based on slang or the use of words that are not used frequently.

                  making tools and techniques. Voting is a decision-making technique
                  used to reach a conclusion when stakeholders and the project team
                  perform the validation. [Monitoring and Controlling]

142. c. Knowledge
        In this situation, the key word is `client'. In acquiring resources for
        your team, you can use multi-criteria decision analysis, a tool and
        technique in this process. The criteria are used to rate and score
        team members and can be weighted to show their importance. All
        of the answers to this question are important, but knowledge is the
        most critical since it considers whether the team member has relevant
        knowledge of the customer, focusing on this question. The knowledge
        criterion also involves similar related projects and nuances of the
        project environment. Other criteria not shown in the answers include
        availability, eliminated since it is a top project in the company, and one
        should then be able to acquire the resource; cost, eliminated for the
        same reason; attitude, which is desirable to be able to work well with
        the team; and international factors, eliminated since the question does
        not note it is a global project. Experience, ability, and skills are critical,
        but knowledge is selected as it emphasizes the customer. [Executing]

143. d. Forcing
        Forcing or directing is represented by a strong desire to satisfy oneself
        rather than to satisfy others. It involves imposing one viewpoint at
        the expense of another and is characterized by a win-lose outcome
        in which one party overwhelms the other. It pushes one's view at
        the expense of others usually through a power position to resolve a
        conflict. [Executing]

        Questionnaires and surveys are a data gathering technique, a tool and
        technique in Identify Stakeholders. Also, in this category are focus
        groups, which are used to gauge the attitudes of stakeholders about the
        project and enables the project manager and team to learn their level
        of support for it and any issues they may have so these issues can be
        resolved quickly. [Initiating]

        145. a. The choice of media
                The choice of media, or the way you deliver the information, is as
                important as what you say. It is important to determine when to
                communicate in writing versus orally, when to prepare an informal
                memo or when to use a formal report, and when to communicate face
                to face or by email, as examples. Other examples are when to use push
                or pull options and choosing the technology to use. [Executing]

        146. c. Issue a change request
                Change requests are an output of Implement Risk Responses. The
                key word in the question was cost. Implementing risk responses may
                require a change request to the cost and schedule baselines. These
                change requests then are processed for review and disposition using the
                Perform Integrated Change Control process. [Executing]

        147. c. Stakeholder register
                The stakeholder register is the main output of Identify Stakeholders and
                contains all the details known at the time related to the stakeholders
                including identification information, assessment information, and
                stakeholder classification. The project manager and team should review
                the stakeholder register regularly since stakeholder identification is
                ongoing throughout the project, and different stakeholders may have
                different interests, expectations, or potential influence than those
                initially identified. [Initiating]

                Of the answers listed, library services are the only tool and technique
                to create and connect people to information. These tools are useful to
                share simple, unambiguous, and codified explicit knowledge. These tools,
                however, can be enhanced by adding some type of information such as
                'contact me', so people can contact the originators and ask for advice as
                needed. The other examples are ones to connect people to people to
                work together to create new knowledge, share explicit knowledge, and
                integrate the team member's diverse knowledge. [Executing]

149. d. Basis of estimates
        Basis of estimates is an output from the Estimate Costs process. It
        provides details to support the cost estimate to provide a clear and
        understandable approach to how the costs were estimated. Typical
        contents include how the estimate was developed, assumptions and
        constraints, identified risks as costs were estimated, the range of possible
        estimates, and the level of confidence in the final cost estimate. [Planning]

        In the Develop Project Charter process, an agreement is an input to
        define initial intentions for the project. They may be known as an
        understanding or memorandum of understanding, a service level
        agreement, letter of intent, a verbal agreement, or an e-mail. Agreements
        are an input to the Develop Project Charter process. [Initiating]

        performance documents. Partial or interim deliverables may be included
        if it is a phased or a canceled project. Other inputs are the project charter,
        the project management plan, project documents, business documents,
        agreements, procurement documentation, and organizational process
        assets. Expert judgment is a tool and technique in this process. [Closing]

        project performance over time to see if performance is improving
        or deteriorating. Its focus is to determine the cause and amount of
        variance in relation to the scope baseline to be able to determine if

         153. c. A high-level requirement
                  The project charter formally authorizes the existence of the project and
                  provides the project manager with the organizational resources for the
                  project activities. Using agile is an example of a high-level requirement,
                  which is one of the many items included in the charter. [Initiating]

         154. c. Note key stakeholders as parties in the contract
                  Contracts are mutually binding agreements that obligate the seller
                  to provide products services or results and obligates the buyer to
                  compensate the seller. These contracts or agreements are legal
                  relationships subject to remedy in the courts. Agreements are an
                  input to the Identify Stakeholder process. If the project results from a
                  procurement activity or is based on an established agreement/contract,
                  the parties in the contract are key project stakeholders. Others, such as
                  suppliers, are also stakeholders and should be added to the stakeholder
                  list. [Initiating]

         155. a. Use an impact/influence grid
                  All four answers are data representation techniques and can help
                  categorize your stakeholders to help build relationships with them.
                  The key words in the question is it is a small project. Since it is small,
                  a power/interest, power/influence, or impact/influence [the answer]
                  grid are appropriate ways to categorize them. Each of these three grids
                  categorizes them according to their level of authority, level of concern,
                  ability to influence the project's outcomes, or the ability to cause
                  changes to the project's planning or execution. These models are used
                  for small projects or ones with relationships that are relatively simple
                  between the stakeholders and the project or within the stakeholder
                  community. [Initiating]

156. b. Use an issue log
        An issue log is an output of the Direct and Manage Project Work
        process. It lists items such as: issue type, who raised it and when,
        description, priority, person assigned to the issue, target resolution
        date, status, and the final solution. This issue log can help the project
        manager track and manage issues, investigate them, and resolve them;
        recognizing issues may occur at any time on the project. [Executing]

157. a. Role
        The resource plan documents roles, responsibilities, authority, and
        competence on the project. A role is the function assumed by or
        assigned to a person in the project. The court liaison in this question
        is an example of such a role on a project. Other examples are
        civil engineer, business analyst, or testing coordinator. Role clarity
        concerning authority and responsibilities also should be documented to
        help avoid negative conflicts later in the project. [Planning]

158. b. Determine how and when project benefits will be delivered
        In Identify Stakeholders in the first iteration of doing so, business
        documents should be reviewed, one of which is the benefits
        management plan. The purpose of this plan is to realize the benefits in
        the project's business case. It may include the people who will benefit
        the most when the outcomes of the project are complete as they are
        stakeholders and beneficiaries. This plan includes a description of
        the target benefits, both tangible and intangible, the stakeholders will
        realize, how and when the benefits will be delivered, and how the
        benefits will be measured. [Initiating]

        160. c. Understand as much as possible about the communications receiver
                There are three fundamental activities of effective communications and
                developing effective communications artifacts. One is the answer to
                the question. One should understand as much as possible about the
                receiver, which includes needs and preferences, rather than relying
                on the traditional sender-receiver model. It also is necessary to have
                clarity as to the purpose of the communication rather than the push
                communications approach, and then to monitor and measure whether
                the communications were effective. [Planning]

        161. b. Management is responsible for providing needed resources
                An emerging practice in project quality management is management
                responsibility. While the quality management plan states resource roles
                and responsibilities, management retains in its requirements for quality
                the responsibility to provide suitable resources with adequate capacities.
                It also should be noted that quality success requires the participation of
                all project team members. [Planning]

        162. d. Enterprise environmental factor
                Enterprise environmental factors and organizational process assets are
                both inputs to Plan Quality Management. In this situation, the team is
                located in different geographical areas, and geographic distribution is an
                enterprise environmental factor to consider. Another one, which fits this
                question, is the organizational structure. Enterprise environmental factors
                are typically outside of the project manager's responsibilities. [Planning]

        163. d. Work with the buyer for discounts
                There are many emerging trends in procurement management. This
                question points to the need for large projects in different countries.
                When these projects involve procurement, it is important for the seller
                to work with the buyer prior to officially signing an agreement to take
                advantage of discounts through quantity purchases or other special
                considerations. [Executing]

164. a. Ensure your team knows the level of accepted risk appetite
        The effectiveness of risk management is related to project success.
        Management of risk keeps risk exposure within a defined range,
        and if implementing agreed-upon risk responses successfully, it can
        reduce negative variation, increase positive variation, and maximize
        achieving project objectives. However, to manage risks effectively, the
        team needs to know the risk appetite or level of risk exposure that is
        acceptable. Measurable risk thresholds can reflect the risk appetite of
        the organization and the project stakeholders. These thresholds show
        the degree of acceptable variation and should be stated explicitly and
        communicated to the project team. [Executing]

165. c. Hold a bidder conference
        A bidder conference is a tool and technique in Conduct Procurements.
        They also may be called contractor, vendor, or pre-bid conferences. The
        purpose is to have a meeting between the buyer and prospective sellers
        prior to proposal submittal. All prospective sellers then have a clear and
        common understanding, and no bidders receive preferential treatment.

166. a. Have a meeting
        Meetings are a tool and technique in Plan Procurement Management.
        Research alone does not provide specific information to formulate a
        procurement strategy without influencing information exchange with
        potential sellers. However, the buyer organization can collaborate
        with potential bidders and may benefit. The sellers also can benefit
        to influence a mutually beneficial approach or product. Meetings
        then are used to determine strategy for managing and monitoring the
        procurement. [Planning]

         167. c. Agreements for fast supply
                 Projects with high variability as in this question benefit from team
                 structures that maximize focus and collaboration. Planning for physical
                 and human resources then is less predictable. In such a situation, you
                 need agreements for fast supply and team methods in order to control
                 costs and to achieve the schedule objectives. [Planning]

        168. d. Acquire generalized specialists
                 In agile, self-organizing teams are often used. In these teams, the team
                 functions without centralized control. The project manager may not be
                 called a project manager in these teams. Instead, the project manager
                 provides the team with the environment and needed support and trusts
                 the team to finish the project. In resource planning, successful self-
                 organizing teams consist of generalized specialists rather than subject
                 matter experts. These generalized specialists then continuously adapt to
                 the changing environment. In acquiring these resources, they need to be
                 people who can accept and even request constructive feedback. [Planning]

        169. b. Use experts
                 Although all four answers are tools and techniques in the Plan Resource
                 Management process, experts are the most appropriate answer. Expert
                 judgment is a key tool and technique. It especially applies to this
                 question as it notes expert judgment determines the preliminary effort
                 level needed to meet project objectives. [Planning]

170. a. Preventive action
        The Direct and Manage Project Work process, among other things,
        also includes change requests as an output. They can be submitted
        throughout the project, may be submitted by any stakeholder, and
        may be initiated from inside or outside the project. They also can
        be optional or legally or contractually mandated. They may require
        preventive action, the answer to this question, along with corrective
        action, defect repair, and updates. [Executing]

171. a. Review agreements
        Agreements are an input to the Close Project or Phase. This situation
        had four contractors. The agreements require review since the
        requirements for formal procurement closure are defined in the contract
        terms and conditions and are in the procurement management plan.
        They are especially important to review in complex projects in which
        multiple contractors may be managed simultaneously or in sequence.

        communications with your stakeholders
        While the Manage Communications process covers numerous areas, in
        working in an agile environment, posting artifacts that are completed
        in a transparent fashion should be done. Holding regular stakeholder
        reviews also is recommended to promote communications with
        management and stakeholders. [Executing]

        The adaptive life cycle is one that is known as agile or change
        driven and is set up to respond to high levels of change and ongoing
        stakeholder involvement. The detailed scope is defined and approved
        before the start of an iteration; they then can be referred to as agile,
        iterative, or incremental. Other life cycles are predictive or a hybrid.

         174. b. Gather data through focus groups
                  You are new to the organization and introducing formal project
                  management to it represents a major culture change. Since most people
                  tend to resist change, you need to determine the extent the people in
                  the organization are ready for change and will accept it to enable you
                  to determine how much tailoring you need to do. You can use focus
                  groups as a data gathering technique to gauge the attitudes of the
                  people involved and help you as you prepare your project management
                  plan. With focus groups, you can bring stakeholders together to
                  discuss your approach and help integrate different parts of the project
                  management plan. Other data gathering techniques are brainstorming,
                  checklists, and interviews; tools and techniques in the Develop Project
                  Management Plan process. [Planning]

         175. d. Correct identification may lead to project success
                  Academic research and analysis of high-profile projects that failed
                  shows the importance of using a structured approach to identify,
                  prioritize, and engage all stakeholders. One powerful but negative
                  stakeholder may cause the project to fail. If the project manager can
                  correctly identify and then later engage stakeholders in an appropriate
                  way, it may lead to the difference between project success or failure.

         176. b. Select communications technology
                  In the Manage Communications process the choice of media is a key
                  technique for communications management. It involves decisions
                  concerning artifacts to meet the needs of the project. Examples are
                  when to communicate in writing versus orally, when to prepare an
                  informal memo rather than a formal report, when to use push or
                  pull communications, and the choice of technology. Communications
                  technology also is a tool and technique in Manage Communications.
                  Factors to consider are the location of the team, the confidentiality
                  of information to share, resources available to the team, and the
                  organization's culture since it affects how meetings and discussions
                  typically are conducted. [Executing]

177. d. Storming
         During the storming stage, the team is addressing the work, technical
         decisions, and the project management approach. However, if team
         members are not collaborating and open to different ideas and
         perspectives, the environment becomes counterproductive. It is the
         second stage in the Tuckman team development [forming, storming,
         norming, performing, and adjourning] model. [Executing]

178. c. Prioritization
         All the answers are examples of data representation techniques used
         to categorize stakeholders. The key words in this project is that it is a
         large project, and 155 stakeholders were identified through stakeholder
         analysis. Prioritization is recommended when there is a large number
         of stakeholders, when the stakeholder community membership would
         change frequently, or when the relationship between the stakeholders
         and the project team or in the stakeholder community are complex. The
         latter two examples also characterize this situation. [Initiating]

179. d. Emphasize flexible processes
         An emerging practice in project risk management is project resilience.
         These are risks that only are recognized after they occur. These
         emergent risks can be handled through project resilience by the answer
         to this question. Other ways to do so are a budget and schedule
         contingency for these risks, an empowered project team, frequent
         reviews of early warning signs, and input from stakeholders concerning
         areas where project scope or strategy can be adjusted if emergent risks
         occur. [Planning]

       180. c. Organizational, stakeholder, and customer culture
               This answer is an enterprise process asset to consider. People are more
               likely to want to share knowledge if they work in a culture that has a
               trusting relationship and a no-blame approach or shoot-the-messenger.
               Other factors are the value placed on learning and social behavioral
               norms. While the geographic locations of the team members are also
               an enterprise environmental factor, it does not fit this question, and the
               other two possible answers are project documents. [Executing]

               An emerging trend in procurement management is more advanced risk
               management. In Conduct Procurements contracts or agreements now
               may specify that risk management be performed as part of the contract
               for both the buyer and the seller. [Executing]

               Observation/conversation is a key interpersonal and team skill and is
               a tool and technique in Manage Stakeholder Engagement. It is useful
               to stay in touch with the work and attitudes of the project team and
               stakeholders. Such an approach enables the project manager to have a
               better understanding of any concerns or issues stakeholders are having
               and to be able to then work to resolve them proactively. It also can be
               useful in avoiding potential conflicts among the team members or with
               any other stakeholders. [Executing]

       183. d. Transference
               Risk transfer is shifting some or all negative impact of a threat and the
               ownership of the response to the threat to a third party. It does not
               eliminate the threat posed by an adverse risk. It simply gives another party
               responsibility for it, and the other party is responsible if the risk occurs. It
               almost always involves paying a risk premium to the party taking on the
               risk. Transfer tools are diverse and include using insurance, performance
               bonds, warranties, and guarantees. Agreements also can be used to transfer
               ownership and liability for the risk to the third party. It may be prudent to
               transfer some work and its concurrent risk back to the buyer. [Planning]

184. b. `As-built' plans
         The key word in the answer is it is a construction program. The project
         manager working with contractors needs to review the procurement
         documentation. It includes collecting, indexing, and filing information
         on contract schedule, scope, quality, and cost performance. It also
         includes the contract change management system, payment records,
         and inspection reports and cataloging them for future reference. It
         also involves 'as-built' plans/drawings, or 'as-developed' documents,
         manuals, and other technical documentation. The purpose is to use this
         information for lessons learned and to evaluate contractors for future
         procurements. [Closing]

185. d. Review the business case
         Even though this project was one with a lot of contracts in systems
         integration, as the project is closing, the business case is reviewed. It
         is reviewed since it documents the business need and the cost/benefit
         analysis that were used to justify the project. It is an input in the Close
         Project or Phase. [Closing]

186. c. Inherent systems complexity
         There are two classes of non-event risks: variable risks and ambiguity
         risks. Inherent systems complexity is an example of an ambiguity
         risk. They are described as ones in which uncertainty exists about the
         future, or imperfect knowledge affects the project's ability to fulfill
         its objectives. Other examples in addition to the answer are elements
         of requirements or the technical solution or future developments in
         regulatory frameworks. [Planning]

         187. d. Prompt lists
                  A prompt list is a tool and technique in Identify Risks as a
                  predetermined list of risk categories. Its purpose is to aid the project
                  team in generating ideas when using risk identification techniques.
                  The categories in the lowest level of the RBS can be used as a prompt
                  list. Some strategic frameworks such as political, economic, social
                  technological, legal, environment or volatility, uncertainty, complexity,
                  ambiguity may be used. [Planning]

         188. b. The right message with the right content is delivered to the right
                 audience
                  In the Monitor Communications process, the purpose is to ensure
                  stakeholder information needs are met. The goal is an optimal
                  information flow, which tracks to the answer to this question. Monitor
                  Communications may require a variety of methods such as stakeholder
                  satisfaction surveys, collecting lessons learned, observing the team,
                  reviewing data from the issue log, and evaluating the stakeholder
                  engagement matrix. [Monitoring and Controlling]

         189. b. Negotiation
                  Negotiation is the interpersonal and team skill used in Conduct
                  Procurements. It is a discussion with the purpose to reach agreement.
                  Procurement negotiation is needed to clarify the structure, rights, and
                  obligations of the buyer and the seller. Its goal is mutual agreement
                  before an agreement is signed. It concludes with a signed agreement
                  that is executed the buyer and seller. [Executing]

190. a. Communicating whether the remaining reserve is adequate
        Burndown charts are used in reserve analysis, a data analysis tool
        and technique in Monitor Risks. Throughout the project negative and
        positive risks will occur with budget and schedule reserves needed
        to manage them. Reserve analysis then compares the amount of
        contingency reserve remaining to the amount of risk remaining to see if
        the reserve is adequate. Burndown charts show these data graphically.

191. b. Quality and technical
        There are six commonly used source selection methods. All of the
        possible answers are ones to consider. In this situation, it is a high-risk
        project, and it is important that the selected seller have an outstanding
        quality-based/highest technical proposal score. You a using a RFP. The
        sellers are submitting a proposal with both technical and cost details.
        Using this method, the technical proposals are first ranked on the
        quality of the solution, and then the seller with the highest rating is
        invited to negotiate if the technical proposal is acceptable. Then, the
        financial proposal can be negotiated and evaluated. [Planning]

192. b. Categories of changes received
        Work performance information in Control Scope is an output of this
        process. It includes information on how the project is performing in
        relation to the scope baseline. It also can include the categories of the
        changes received, identified scope variances, and their causes, and how
        they impact schedule or cost and future scope performance. [Monitoring

       193. a. Organizational process asset
                Learning reviews before, during, and after the project are an example
                of formal knowledge-sharing and information-sharing procedures, an
                organizational process asset. Identifying, capturing, and sharing lessons
                learned from this project and other projects complement these learning
                reviews. Organizational process assets are an input to the Manage
                Project Knowledge process. [Executing]

       194. a. Create it early in the project
                While the lessons-leaned register is an output of the Manage Project
                Knowledge process, it is best to create it early. In this process, it also is
                an input as it provides information on effective practices in knowledge
                management and is a project document. By creating it early, it can be
                used by other processes in the project; therefore, providing additional
                value. The people working on the project are responsible for capturing
                the lessons learned. Knowledge then can be documented by a variety
                of methods. [Executing]

       195. a. Plan Procurement Management
                Enterprise environmental factors, which include marketplace conditions
                and products, services, and results, are ones the team needs to be
                aware of as they develop plans for purchases and acquisitions. They are
                an input to the Plan Procurement Management process. [Planning]

       196. d. Contributor
                Stakeholder analysis is used as a data analysis technique in Identify
                Stakeholders. It results in a list of stakeholders, which includes among
                other things, their roles on the project. One role is that of a contributor.
                This is a person who makes a contribution to the project in terms of
                providing funds or other resources, including people, or provides support
                for the project in intangible ways. Intangible ways include advocacy in
                promoting project objectives or serving as a buffer between the project
                and the organization's power structure and its politics. [Initiating]

197. d. Political awareness
        While all of the answers are examples of interpersonal skills in the
        Manage Project Knowledge process, political awareness if the one that
        relies on helping the project manager plan communications based on
        the project and the organization's political environment. [Executing]

198. b. Bid documents
        Bid documents are a procurement document, an input to Conduct
        Procurements. The procurement documents include the RFP, RFI, RFQ,
        or other documents sent to sellers for response. They need review
        before an agreement can be prepared and signed, [Executing]

199. b. The lessons-learned register becomes an organizational process asset
        The lessons-learned register is an output of the Manage Project
        Knowledge process. However, at the end of the project or a phase, as
        in this situation, the information in the lessons-learned register then
        transfers to an organizational process asset. [Executing]

200. b. Where the stakeholder has the most influence
        The stakeholder register has three main sections: identification
        information, assessment information, and stakeholder classification.
        This answer is in the assessment information section, which describes
        the major requirements, expectations, potential to influence the project
        outcome, and the phase of the project where the stakeholder has the
        greatest impact or influence. [Initiating]
