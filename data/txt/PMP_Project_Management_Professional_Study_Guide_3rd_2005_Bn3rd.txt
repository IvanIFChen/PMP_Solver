                                 To BB, my forever love.


                                 --Kimmie



            Acknowledgments
                Thank you to the thousands of readers who have read previous editions of the PMP Study
            Guide and recommended it to their friends and co-workers. Because of your success using the
            book in passing the PMP exam, we are able to continue to upgrade and refresh the Study Guide
            with tips and hints from readers and with the changes made by PMI. Thank you also to all of
            the instructors and PMI chapters who use this book in their classes.
                As always, a very special thank you to Neil Edde, Associate Publisher, for taking a chance on the
            first edition of this book and for giving me the opportunity to write it. Thank you again for the
            opportunity to revise and update it.
                This book clearly fits the definition of a project and the team at Sybex is the best project team
            on earth to work with. I appreciate all the hard work and dedication everyone on the team put
            into producing this book. First, a special thanks to Jeff Kellum, Acquisitions Editor, for over-
            seeing this project and for his many suggestions that helped improve and strengthen the text.
            Thank you also, for keeping everyone focused on the quick turn around time even though we
            faced some uncertainties in the midst of the project.
                Thank you to Elizabeth Campbell for all her help managing the many, many activities that
            must be coordinated in order to finish on schedule. She was very helpful throughout the process
            and didn't scream when we found out close to the end of the project that some changes were
            needed to match up with newly published PMI materials.
                Thanks to Judy Flynn, copyeditor, who did an outstanding job of helping me with all my gram-
            matical blunders. (She'll probably even find some in this sentence!) She's the best copyeditor I've ever
            worked with. I appreciate her eye for detail and that she never told me "doh" after her suggestions.
                Thanks also to all the behind the scenes team members including proofreader Nancy Riddi-
            ough, and the compositors at Happenstance Type-o-rama!
                I again had the pleasure of working with Claudia Baca who served as the technical editor for this
            edition. Claudia was invaluable when helping me decipher areas of A Guide to the PMBOK that I
            questioned or weren't clear to me. Thank you, Claudia, for your help, suggestions, and contribution.
                None of this would have been possible without the continued support and encouragement
            from my best friend in the whole world, BB. I love you and there's no one else I'd rather spend the
            rest of my life with. Thank you to Bob and Terri, our best friends in all the earth, for your support
            and prayers--they're always coveted. Thanks to my sister Jill and hubby John and to Sam, Prom-
            ise, and Destiny for their cheerleading behind the scenes. Thank you mom and dad for giving me
            the love of reading; some of my best memories are story time. And thanks also to the greatest chil-
            dren on the planet: Jason and Leah (our soon to be daughter-in-law), Noelle, and Amanda. And
            I can't forget the two best grandchildren anywhere in the universe, Kate and Juliette. Thank you
            for your understanding of my limited availability and for your encouragement and support.

             Introduction
             This book was designed for anyone thinking of taking the Project Management Professional
             (PMP) exam sponsored by the Project Management Institute (PMI). This certification is grow-
             ing in popularity and demand in all areas of business. PMI has experienced explosive growth in
             membership over the last few years, and more and more organizations are recognizing the
             importance of project management certification.


                                    While this book is written primarily for those of you taking the PMP exam, you
                                    can also use this book to study for the Certified Associate in Project Manage-
                                    ment (CAPM) exam. The exams are similar in style and the information covered
                                    in this book will help you with either exam.

                 This book has been updated to reflect the latest edition of A Guide to the Project Manage-
             ment Body of Knowledge, (PMBOK Guide) Third Edition. It assumed you have knowledge of
             general project management practices, although not necessarily specific to A Guide to the
             PMBOK. It's written so that you can skim through areas you are already familiar with, picking
             up the specific Guide to the PMBOK terminology where needed to pass the exam. You'll find
             that the project management processes and techniques discussed in this book are defined in such
             a way that you'll recognize things you've always done and be able to identify them with A Guide
             to the PMBOK process names or methodologies.
                 PMI offers the most recognized certification in the field of project management, and this
             book deals exclusively with its procedures and methods. There are many methods of project
             management, each with its own terminology, tools, and procedures. If you're familiar with
             another organized project management methodology, don't assume you already know the
             Guide to the PMBOK processes. I strongly recommend that you learn all of the processes--their
             key inputs, tools and techniques, and outputs. Take the time to memorize the key terms found
             at the end of every chapter as well. Sometimes just understanding the definition of a term will
             help you answer a question. It might be that you've always done that particular thing or used
             the methodology described but called it by another name. Know the name of each process and
             its primary purpose.


             What Is the PMP Certification?
             PMI is the leader and the most widely recognized organization in terms of promoting project
             management best practices. PMI strives to maintain and endorse standards and ethics in this
             field and offers publications, training, seminars, chapters, special interest groups, and colleges
             to further the project management discipline.
                 PMI was founded in 1969 and first started offering the Project Management Professional (PMP)
             certification exam in 1984. PMI is accredited as an American National Standards Institute (ANSI)
             standards developer and also has the distinction of being the first organization to have its certifica-
             tion program attain International Organization for Standardization (ISO) 9001 recognition.

                     xviii        Introduction



                         PMI boasts a worldwide membership of over 150,000, with members from 150 different coun-
                     tries. Local PMI chapters meet regularly and allow project managers to exchange information and
                     learn about new tools and techniques of project management or new ways to use established tech-
                     niques. I encourage you to join a local chapter and get to know other professionals in your field.


                     Why Become PMP Certified?
                     The following benefits are associated with becoming PMP certified:
                             It demonstrates proof of professional achievement.
                             It increases your marketability.
                             It provides greater opportunity for advancement in your field.
                             It raises customer confidence in you and in your company's services.

                     Demonstrates Proof of Professional Achievement
                     PMP certification is a rigorous process that documents your achievements in the field of project
                     management. The exam tests your knowledge of the disciplined approaches, methodologies,
                     and project management practices as described in A Guide to the PMBOK.
                        You are required to have several years of experience in project management before sitting for
                     the exam, as well as 35 hours of formal project management education. Your certification
                     assures employers and customers that you are well grounded in project management practices
                     and disciplines. It shows that you've got the hands-on experience and a mastery of the processes and
                     disciplines to manage projects effectively and motivate teams to produce successful results.

                     Increases Your Marketability
                     Many industries are realizing the importance of project management and its role in the organi-
                     zation. They are also seeing that simply proclaiming a head technician to be a "project man-
                     ager" does not make it so. Project management, just like engineering, information technology,
                     and a host of other trades, has its own specific qualifications and skills. Certification tells poten-
                     tial employers you've got the skills, experience, and knowledge to drive successful projects and
                     ultimately improve the company's bottom line.
                         A certification will always make you stand out above the competition. If you're certified and
                     you're competing against a project manager without certification, chances are you'll come out
                     as the top pick. As a hiring manager, all other things being equal, I will usually opt for the can-
                     didate who has certification over the candidate who doesn't have it. Certification tells potential
                     employers you have gone the extra mile. You've spent time studying techniques and methods as
                     well as employing them in practice. It shows dedication to your own professional growth and
                     enhancement and to adhering to and advancing professional standards.

                     Provides Opportunity for Advancement
                     PMP certification displays your willingness to pursue growth in your professional career and
                     shows that you're not afraid of a little hard work to get what you want. Potential employers will

                                                                                           Introduction        xix




             interpret your pursuit of this certification as a high-energy, success-driven, can-do attitude on
             your part. They'll see that you're likely to display these same characteristics on the job, which
             will help make the company successful. Your certification displays a success-oriented, moti-
             vated attitude that will open up opportunities for future career advancements in your current
             field as well as in new areas you might want to explore.

             Raises Customer Confidence
             Just as the PMP certification assures employers that you've got the background and experience
             to handle project management, it assures customers that they have a competent, experienced
             project manager at the helm. Certification will help your organization sell customers on your
             ability to manage their projects. Customers, like potential employers, want the reassurance that
             those working for them have the knowledge and skills necessary to carry out the duties of the
             position and that professionalism and personal integrity are of utmost importance. Individuals
             who hold these ideals will translate their ethics and professionalism to their work. This
             enhances the trust customers will have in you, which in turn will give you the ability to influence
             them on important project issues.


             How to Become PMP Certified
             There are several requirements you need to fulfill in order to sit for the PMP exam. PMI has
             detailed the certification process quite extensively at its website. Go to www.pmi.org and click
             the Professional Development and Careers tab to reveal the Certifications selection and get the
             latest information on certification procedures and requirements.
                As of the date this book was published, you are required to fill out an application to sit for
             the PMP exam. You can submit this application online at PMI's website. You also need to doc-
             ument 35 hours of formal project management education. This might include college classes,
             seminars, workshops, and training sessions. Be prepared to list the class titles, location, date,
             and content.
                In addition to filling out the application and documenting your formal project management
             training, there is one additional set of criteria you'll need to meet to sit for the exam. These cri-
             teria fall into two categories. You need to meet the requirements for only one of these categories:
                   Category 1 is for those who hold a baccalaureate degree. You'll need to provide proof, via
                   transcripts, of your degree with your application. In addition, you'll need to complete ver-
                   ification forms--found at the PMI website--that show 4,500 hours of project management
                   experience that spans a minimum of three years and no more than six years.
                   Category 2 is for those who do not hold a baccalaureate degree but do hold a high school
                   diploma or equivalent. You'll need to complete verification forms documenting 7,500
                   hours of project management experience that spans a minimum of five years and no more
                   than eight years.
                The exam fee at the time this book is being published is $405 for PMI members in good
             standing and $555 for non-PMI members. Testing is conducted at Thomson Prometric centers.
             You can find a center near you at the PMI website. You have six months from the time PMI

                    xx          Introduction



                    receives and approves your completed application to take the exam. You'll need to bring a form
                    of identification such as a driver's license with you to the Thomson Prometric center on the test
                    day. You will not be allowed to take anything with you into the testing center. You will be given
                    a calculator, pencils, and scrap paper. You will turn in all scrap paper, including the notes and
                    squiggles you've jotted during the test, to the center upon completion of the exam.
                        The exam is scored immediately, so you will know if you've passed at the conclusion of the
                    test. You're given four hours to complete the exam, which consists of 200 randomly generated
                    questions. Only 175 of the 200 questions are scored. A passing score requires you answer 141
                    of the 175 questions correctly. 25 of the 200 questions are "pretest" questions that will appear
                    randomly throughout the exam. These 25 questions are used by PMI to determine statistical
                    information and to determine if they can or should be used on future exams. The questions on
                    the exam cover the following process groups and areas:
                          Initiating
                          Planning
                          Executing
                          Monitoring and Controlling
                          Closing
                          Professional Responsibility
                       All unanswered questions are scored as wrong answers, so it benefits you to guess at an
                    answer if you're stumped on a question.
                       After you've received your certification, you'll be required to earn 60 professional develop-
                    ment units (PDUs) every three years to maintain certification. Approximately one hour of struc-
                    tured learning translates to one PDU. The PMI website details what activities constitute a PDU,
                    how many PDUs each activity earns, and how to register your PDUs with PMI to maintain your
                    certification. As an example, attendance at a local chapter meeting earns one PDU.



                    How to Become CAPM Certified

                    If you find you don't have quite enough experience or education to sit for the PMP exam, you
                    should consider sitting for the Certified Associate in Project Management (CAPM) exam. The
                    CAPM exam is structured like the PMP exam only the requirements are not as strict as they are
                    for the PMP. CAPM candidates typically work in a supporting role with a project manager or as
                    a subproject manager. Like the PMP, CAPM has two categories of requirements; each category
                    requires 23 hours of project management education.

                    Category 1 is for those who hold a baccalaureate degree. You'll need to provide proof, via tran-
                    scripts, of your degree with your application. In addition, you'll need to complete verification
                    forms that show 1,500 hours of project management experience that spans a minimum of two
                    years and no more than three years.

                                                                                             Introduction        xxi




             Category 2 is for those who do not hold a baccalaureate degree but do hold a high school diploma
             or equivalent. You'll need to complete verification forms documenting 2,500 hours of project
             management experience that spans a minimum of two years and no more than three years.

             The CAPM exam fee at the time of this publication is $225 for PMI members in good standing
             and $300 for non-PMI members.

             Included on the CD with this book is a sample CAPM exam. If you're sitting for the CAPM exam,
             I encourage you to answer all of the end-of-chapter questions and take the Bonus Exams in
             addition to the sample CAPM exam. You'll get a much broader sense of the types of questions
             and the topics you'll encounter on the actual exam by using all of the sample questions pro-
             vided in this book and on the CD.



             Who Should Buy This Book?
             If you are serious about passing the PMP exam (or the CAPM exam for that matter), you should
             buy this book and use it to study for the exam. This book is unique in that it walks you through
             the project processes from beginning to end, just as projects are performed in practice. When
             you read this book, you will benefit by learning specific Guide to the PMBOK processes and
             techniques coupled with real-life scenarios that describe how project managers in different sit-
             uations handle problems and the various issues all project managers are bound to encounter
             during their career. This Study Guide describes in detail the exam objective topics in each chap-
             ter and has attempted to cover all of the important project management concepts.


             How to Use This Book and CD
             We've included several testing features, both in the book and on the companion CD. Following this
             introduction is an Assessment Test that you can use to check your readiness for the actual exam.
             Take this test before you start reading the book. It will help you identify the areas you may need to
             brush up on. The answers to the Assessment Test appear after the last question of the test. Each
             answer includes an explanation and a note telling you in which chapter this material appears.
                 An Exam Essentials section appears at the end of every chapter to highlight the topics you'll most
             likely find on the exam and help you focus on the most important material covered in the chapter
             so that you'll have a solid understanding of those concepts. However, it isn't possible to predict what
             questions will be covered on your particular exam, so be sure to study everything in the chapter.


                                    Like the exam itself, this Study Guide is organized in terms of process groups
                                    and the natural sequence of events a project goes through in its life cycle. By
                                    contrast, in other study guides, material is organized by knowledge area--
                                    Human Resource Management, Communications Management, and so on--
                                    and it can be confusing when studying for the exam to map the processes in
                                    each knowledge area to process groups.

                     xxii        Introduction



                        Review Questions are also provided at the end of every chapter. You can use these to gauge
                     your understanding of the subject matter before reading the chapter and to point out the areas
                     in which you need to concentrate your study time. As you finish each chapter, answer the
                     Review Questions and then check to see if your answers are right--the correct answers appear
                     on the pages following the last question. You can go back to reread the section that deals with
                     each question you got wrong to ensure that you answer the question correctly the next time you
                     are tested on the material. If you can answer at least 80 percent of the Review Questions cor-
                     rectly, you can probably feel comfortable moving on to the next chapter. If you can't answer
                     that many correctly, reread the chapter, or the section that seems to be giving you trouble, and
                     try the questions again. You'll also find 200+ flashcard questions on the CD for on-the-go
                     review. Download them right onto your Palm PocketPC device for quick and convenient
                     reviewing.


                                            Don't rely on studying the Review Questions exclusively as your study method.
                                            The questions you'll see on the exam will be different than the questions pre-
                                            sented in the book. There are 200 randomly generated questions on the PMP
                                            exam and 150 on the CAPM, so it isn't possible to cover every potential exam
                                            question in the Review Questions section of each chapter. Make sure you
                                            understand the concepts behind the material presented in each chapter and
                                            memorize all the formulas as well.

                        In addition to the Assessment Test and the Review Questions, you'll find Bonus Exams on
                     the CD. Take these practice exams just as if you were actually taking the exam (i.e., without any
                     reference material). When you have finished the first exam, move on to the next exam to solidify
                     your test-taking skills. If you get more than 85 percent of the answers correct, you're ready to
                     take the real exam.


                                            If you purchased the Standard Edition of this book, there are a total of two
                                            bonus PMP exams and two additional CAPM exams. If you purchased the
                                            Deluxe Edition, there are a total of eight bonus PMP exams and two additional
                                            CAPM exams.

                        Finally, you will notice various Real World Scenario sidebars throughout each chapter.
                     These are designed to give you insight into how the various processes and topic areas apply to
                     real-world situations.
                        Additionally, if you are going to travel but still need to study for the PMP exam and you have
                     a laptop with a CD drive, you can take this entire book with you just by taking the CD. This
                     book is in PDF (Adobe Acrobat) format, so it can be easily read on any computer.
                        For those of you who purchased the Deluxe Edition, you'll find a series of scenarios and exer-
                     cises that map to each chapter. These workbook exercises are designed to help you put the the-
                     ories you've learned in each chapter into practice.

                     Tips for Taking the PMP Exam
                     Here are some general tips for taking your exam successfully:
                            Get to the exam center early so that you can relax and review your study materials.
                            Read the exam questions very carefully. Make sure you know exactly what each question
                            is asking and don't be tempted to answer too quickly.
                            Unanswered questions score as wrong answers. It's better to guess than to leave a question
                            unanswered.

                  If you're not sure of an answer, use a process of elimination to identify the obvious incorrect
                  answers first. Narrow the remaining choices down by referring back to the question, look-
                  ing for key words that might tip you off to the correct answer.
                  You'll be given scratch paper to take with you to the exam station. As soon as you get to
                  your place, write down all the formulas and any other memory aids you used while study-
                  ing before starting the exam. That way, you can relax a little because you won't have to
                  remember the formulas when you get to those questions on the exam--you can simply look
                  at your scratch paper.
                  Visit the PMI website at www.pmi.org for the latest information regarding certification and
                  to find a testing site near you.

                     4.     The project sponsor has approached you with a dilemma. The CEO announced at the annual
                            stockholders meeting that the project you're managing will be completed by the end of this year.
                            The problem is that this is six months prior to the scheduled completion date. It's too late to go
                            back and correct her mistake, and stockholders are expecting implementation by the announced
                            date. You must speed up the delivery date of this project. Your primary constraint before this
                            occurred was the budget. What actions can you take to help speed up the project?
                            A. Hire more resources to get the work completed faster.
                            B. Ask for more money so that you can contract out one of the phases you had planned to do
                               with in-house resources.
                            C. Utilize negotiation and influencing skills to convince the project sponsor to speak with the
                               CEO and make a correction to her announcement.
                            D. Examine the project plan to see if there are any phases that can be fast tracked, and then
                               revise the project plan to reflect the compression of the schedule.

                         team members are having a difficult time adjusting to the new culture. You provided them with
                         training on cultural differences and the customs of this country before arriving, but they still
                         seem uncomfortable and disoriented. Which of the following statements is true?
                           A. This is the result of working with teams of people from two different countries.

                     62. Your project involves the research and development of a new food additive. You're ready to
                         release the product to your customer when you discover that a minor reaction might occur in
                         people with certain conditions. The reactions to date have been very minor, and no known long-
                         lasting side effects have been noted. As project manager, what should you do?
                           A. Do nothing because the reactions are so minor that very few people will be affected.
                           B. Inform the customer that you've discovered this condition and tell them you'll research it
                              further to determine its impacts.
                           C. Inform your customer that there is no problem with the additive except for an extremely
                              small percentage of the population and release the product to them.
                           D. Tell the customer you'll correct the reaction problems in the next batch, but you'll release the
                              first batch of product to them now to begin using.

                     63. You have just prepared an RFP for release. Your project involves a substantial amount of con-
                         tract work detailed in the RFP. Your favorite vendor drops by and offers to give you and your
                         spouse the use of their company condo for your upcoming vacation. It's located in a beautiful
                         resort community that happens to be one of your favorite places to go for a getaway. What is
                         the most appropriate response?
                           A. Thank the vendor but decline the offer because you know this could be considered a conflict
                              of interest.
                           B. Thank the vendor and accept. This vendor is always offering you incentives like this, so this
                              offer does not likely have anything to do with the recent RFP release.
                           C. Thank the vendor, accept the offer, and immediately tell your project sponsor so they're
                              aware of what you're doing.
                           D. Thank the vendor but decline the offer because you've already made another arrangement
                              for this vacation. Ask them if you can take a rain check and arrange another time to use the
                              condo.

             64. As a PMP, one of your responsibilities is to ensure integrity on the project. When your personal
                 interests are put above the interests of the project or when you use your influence to cause others
                 to make decisions in your favor without regard for the project outcome, this is considered which
                 of the following?
                   A. Conflict of interest
                   B. Using professional knowledge inappropriately

                     Answers to Assessment Test
                     1.   C. Negotiation, influencing, and problem-solving skills are all important for a project manager
                          to possess. However, good communication skills are the most important skills a project manager
                          can have. For more information, please see Chapter 1.

                     2.   A. Project managers have the highest level of power and authority in a projectized organiza-
                          tion. They also have high levels of power and authority in a strong matrix. However, a matrix
                          organization is a blend of functional and projectized organizations. Therefore, the project man-
                          ager does not have quite the same level of authority as they would in a projectized organization.
                          For more information, please see Chapter 1.

                     3.   B. The project management knowledge areas bring processes together that have commonali-
                          ties. For example, the Project Quality Management Knowledge Area includes the Quality Plan-
                          ning, Perform Quality Assurance, and Perform Quality Control processes. For more
                          information, please see Chapter 1.

                     4.   D. Fast tracking is the best answer in this scenario. Budget was the original constraint on this
                          project, so it's highly unlikely the project manager would get more resources to assist with the
                          project. The next best thing is to compress phases to shorten the project duration. For more
                          information, please see Chapter 1 and Chapter 7.

                     5.   A. The Executing process group takes published project plans and turns them into actions to
                          accomplish the goals of the project. For more information, please see Chapter 1.

                     6.   B. Functional managers who have lots of authority and power working with project coordina-
                          tors who have minimal authority and power characterizes a weak matrix organization. Project
                          managers in weak matrix organizations are sometimes called project coordinators, project lead-
                          ers, or project expeditors. For more information, please see Chapter 1.

                     7.   C. According to A Guide to the PMBOK, the project manager should be identified prior to
                          beginning the Planning processes and is named and authorized in the project charter. For more
                          information, please see Chapter 2.

                     8.   D. Product descriptions are used during the Initiating process group and contain less detail now
                          and more detail as the project progresses. For more information, please see Chapter 2.

                     9.   C. These elements are part of the project statement of work used as an input to both of the Ini-
                          tiating processes. For more information, please see Chapter 2.

                     10. C. Project B's cost-benefit analysis is a $9.2 million benefit to the company, compared to $6.6
                         million for Project A. Cost-benefit analysis takes into consideration the initial costs to imple-
                         ment and future operating costs. For more information, please see Chapter 2.

                     11. B. The purpose of a project charter is to recognize and acknowledge the existence of a project
                         and commit resources to the project. The charter names the project manager and project spon-
                         sor, but that's not its primary purpose. For more information, please see Chapter 2.

                 Chapter 3.

             19. A. Constraints limit the options of the project team by restricting action or dictating action.
                 Scope, time, and cost are the three most common constraints and each of these has an affect on
                 quality. Assumptions are presumed to be true for planning purposes. Always validate your
                 assumptions. For more information, please see Chapter 3.

             20. D. The work package level is the lowest level in the work breakdown structure. Schedule and

                 requests should be approved by the CCB, but in the case of an emergency, change requests may
                 be approved by the project manager in accordance with the process outlined in the configuration
                 management system. The project team may have discretion to approve changes within certain
                 parameters without CCB approval. Configuration management also describes the physical char-
                 acteristics of the product, it controls changes to the product, and tracks the changes requests and
                 their status. For more information, please see Chapter 10.

             49. D. Estimate at completion (EAC) estimates the total cost of the project at completion based on
                 the performance of the project to date. For more information, please see Chapter 10.

             50. C. VAC is calculated this way: VAC = BAC - EAC. Therefore, 525 - 500 = 25. For more infor-
                 mation, please see Chapter 10.

             51. C. Approved change requests are an output of this process, not requested change requests. The
                 other tools and techniques of this process are rejected change requests, project management plan
                 updates, approved preventive actions, approved defect repair, and deliverables. For more infor-
                 mation, please see Chapter 10.

                                                    Congratulations on your decision to study for and take the
                                                    Project Management Institute (PMI) Project Management Profes-
                                                    sional (PMP) certification exam. This book was written with you
                    in mind. The focus and content of this book revolve heavily around the information contained in
                    A Guide to the Project Management Body of Knowledge (PMBOK Guide) Third Edition, pub-
                    lished by PMI. I will refer to this guide throughout this book and elaborate on those areas that
                    appear on the test. Keep in mind that the test covers all the project management processes, so
                    don't skip anything in your study time.
                        When possible, I'll pass on hints and study tips that I collected while studying for the exam
                    myself. Your first tip is to familiarize yourself with the terminology used in A Guide to the
                    PMBOK. Volunteers from differing industries worked together to come up with the standards
                    and terms used in the guide. These folks have worked hard to develop and define standard
                    project management terms, and these terms are used interchangeably among industries. For
                    example, resource planning means the same thing to someone working in construction, infor-
                    mation technology, or telecommunications. You'll find A Guide to the PMBOK terms
                    explained throughout this book. Even if you are an experienced project manager, you might
                    find you use specific terms for processes or actions you regularly perform but A Guide to the
                    PMBOK calls them by another name. So, step one is to get familiar with the terminology.
                        This chapter lays the foundation for building and managing your project. We'll address
                    project and project management definitions as well as organizational structures. Good luck!



                    Is It a Project?
                    Consider the following scenario: The VP of marketing approaches you with a fabulous idea--
                    "fabulous" because he's the big boss and because he thought it up. He wants to set up kiosks
                    in local grocery stores as mini offices. These offices will offer customers the ability to sign up for
                    new wireless phone services, make their wireless phone bill payments, and purchase equipment
                    and accessories. He believes that the exposure in grocery stores will increase awareness of the
                    company's offerings. After all, everyone has to eat, right? He told you that the board of directors
                    has already cleared the project and he'll dedicate as many resources to this as he can. He wants
                    the new kiosks in place in 12 stores by the end of next year. The best news is he's assigned you
                    to head up this project.
                        Your first question should be, "Is it a project?" This may seem elementary, but confusing
                    projects with ongoing operations happens often. Projects are temporary in nature, have definite
                    start and end dates, result in the creation of a unique product or service, and are completed
                    when their goals and objectives have been met and signed off by the stakeholders.

                                                                                       Is It a Project?       3




                When considering whether or not you have a project on your hands, there are some things
             to keep in mind. First, is it a project or an ongoing operation? Next, if it is a project, who are
             the stakeholders? And third, what characteristics distinguish this endeavor as a project. We'll
             look at each of these next.


             Projects versus Operations
             Projects are temporary in nature and have definitive start dates and definitive end dates. The
             project is completed when its goals and objectives are accomplished. Sometimes projects end
             when it's determined that the goals and objectives cannot be accomplished or when the product
             or service of the project is no longer needed and the project is canceled. Projects exist to bring
             about a product or service that hasn't existed before. This may include tangible products, ser-
             vices such as consulting or project management, and business functions that support the orga-
             nization. Projects may also produce a result or an outcome, such as a document that details
             findings of a research study. In this sense, a project is unique. However, don't get confused by
             the term unique. For example, Ford Motor Company is in the business of designing and assem-
             bling cars. Each model that Ford designs and produces can be considered a project. The models
             differ from each other in their features and are marketed to people with various needs. An SUV
             serves a different purpose and clientele than a luxury model. The design and marketing of these
             two models are unique projects. However, the actual assembly of the cars is considered an oper-
             ation--a repetitive process that is followed for most makes and models.
                Determining the characteristics and features of the different car models is carried out through
             what A Guide to the PMBOK terms progressive elaboration. This means the characteristics of
             the product or service of the project (the SUV, for example) are determined incrementally and
             are continually refined and worked out in detail as the project progresses. This concept goes
             along with the temporary and unique aspects of a project because when you first start the
             project, you don't know all the minute details of the end product. Product characteristics typ-
             ically start out broad based at the beginning of the project and are progressively elaborated into
             more and more detail over time until they are complete and finalized. Keep in mind that product
             characteristics are progressively elaborated but the work of the project itself stays constant.



             Exam Spotlight

             Progressive elaboration is a concept you may encounter on the exam. Know this concept as it's
             described in A Guide to the PMBOK.



               Operations are ongoing and repetitive. They involve work that is continuous without an
             ending date and you often repeat the same processes and produce the same results. The pur-
             pose of operations is to keep the organization functioning while the purpose of a project is to
             meet its goals and to conclude. Therefore, operations are ongoing while projects are unique
             and temporary.

                    4           Chapter 1           What Is a Project?




                    Stakeholders
                    A project is successful when it achieves its objectives and meets or exceeds the expectations of
                    the stakeholders. Stakeholders are those folks (or organizations) with a vested interest in your
                    project. They are the people who are actively involved with the work of the project or have
                    something to either gain or lose as a result of the project.


                                          Key stakeholders can make or break the success of a project. Even if all the
                                          deliverables are met and the objectives are satisfied, if your key stakeholders
                                          aren't happy, nobody's happy.

                       The project sponsor, generally an executive in the organization with the authority to assign
                    resources and enforce decisions regarding the project, is a stakeholder. The customer is a stake-
                    holder, as are contractors and suppliers. The project manager, project team members, and the
                    managers from other departments in the organization are stakeholders as well. It's important to
                    identify all the stakeholders in your project up front. If you leave out an important stakeholder
                    or their department's function and don't discover the error until well into the project, it could
                    be a project killer.
                       Figure 1.1 shows a sample listing of the kinds of stakeholders involved on a typical project.

                 Many times, stakeholders have conflicting interests. It's the project manager's responsibility
             to understand these conflicts and try to resolve them. It's also the project manager's responsi-
             bility to manage stakeholder expectations. Be certain to identify and meet with all key stake-
             holders early in the project to understand all their needs and constraints. And when in doubt,
             stakeholder conflicts should always be resolved in favor of the customer.


                                   We'll talk more about stakeholders and their needs in Chapter 3, "Developing
                                   the Project Scope Statement."




             Project Characteristics
             We've just learned that a project has several characteristics:
                  Projects are unique.
                  Projects are temporary in nature and have a definite beginning and ending date.
                  Projects are completed when the project goals are achieved or it's determined the project is
                  no longer viable.
                  A successful project is one that meets or exceeds the expectations of your stakeholders.
                 Using these criteria, let's examine the assignment from the VP of marketing to determine if
             it is a project:
             Is it unique? Yes, because the kiosks don't exist in the local grocery stores. This is a new way
             of offering the company's services to its customer base. While the service the company is offer-
             ing isn't new, the way it is presenting its services is.
             Does the project have a limited time frame? Yes, the start date of this project is today, and the
             end date is the end of next year. It is a temporary endeavor.
             Is there a way to determine when the project is completed? Yes, the kiosks will be installed,
             and services will be offered from them. Once all of the kiosks are intact and operating, the
             project will come to a close.
             Is there a way to determine stakeholder satisfaction? Yes, the expectations of the stakehold-
             ers will be documented in the form of requirements during the planning processes. These
             requirements will be compared to the finished product to determine if it meets the expectations
             of the stakeholder.
                Houston, we have a project.

                    6           Chapter 1           What Is a Project?




                    What Is Project Management?
                    You've determined that you indeed have a project. What now? The notes you scratched out on
                    the back of a napkin at coffee break might get you started, but that's not exactly good project
                    management practice.
                       We have all witnessed this scenario--an assignment is made and the project team members
                    jump directly into the project, busying themselves with building the product or service requested.
                    Often, careful thought is not given to the project-planning process. I'm sure you've heard co-
                    workers toss around statements like "That would be a waste of valuable time" or "Why plan
                    when you can just start building?" Project progress is rarely measured against the customer
                    requirements. In the end, the delivered product or service doesn't meet the expectations of the cus-
                    tomer! This is a frustrating experience for all those involved. Unfortunately, many projects follow
                    this poorly constructed path.
                       Project management brings together a set of tools and techniques--performed by people--
                    to describe, organize, and monitor the work of project activities. Project managers are the peo-
                    ple responsible for managing the project processes and applying the tools and techniques used
                    to carry out the project activities. All projects are composed of processes, even if they employ
                    a haphazard approach. There are many advantages to organizing projects and teams around the
                    project management processes endorsed by PMI. We'll be examining those processes and their
                    advantages in depth throughout the remainder of this book.
                       Project management involves applying knowledge, skills, and techniques during the course
                    of the project to accomplish the project requirements. It is the responsibility of the project man-
                    ager to ensure that project management techniques are applied and followed.



                    Exam Spotlight

                    Know the term project management as it's described in A Guide to the PMBOK.



                        Project management is a process that includes planning, putting the project plan into action,
                    and measuring progress and performance. It involves identifying the project requirements,
                    establishing project objectives, balancing constraints, and taking the needs and expectations of
                    the key stakeholders into consideration. Planning is one of the most important functions you'll
                    perform during the course of a project. It sets the standard for the rest of the project's life and
                    is used to track future project performance. Before we begin the planning process, let's look at
                    some of the ways the work of project management is organized.


                    Programs
                    Programs are groups of related projects that are managed using the same techniques in a coor-
                    dinated fashion. When projects are managed collectively as programs, they capitalize on bene-
                    fits that wouldn't be achievable if the projects were managed separately. This would be the case

                                                                       What Is Project Management?               7




             where a very large program exists with many subprojects under it--for example, building a new
             shopping mall. Many subprojects exist underneath this program, such as excavation, construc-
             tion, interior design, store placement, marketing, facilities management, and so on. Each of the
             subprojects is really a project unto itself. Each subproject has its own project manager, who
             reports to a project manager with responsibility over several of the areas, who in turn reports
             to the head project manager over the entire program. All of the projects are related and are man-
             aged together so that collective benefits are realized and controls are implemented and managed
             in a coordinated fashion. Sometimes programs involve aspects of ongoing operations as well.
             After the shopping mall in our example is built, the management of the facility becomes the
             ongoing operations part of this program. The management of this collection of projects is called
             program management. Program management involves centrally managing and coordinating
             groups of related projects to meet the objectives of the program.


             Portfolios
             Portfolios are collections of programs and projects that meet a specific business goal or objective.
             Let's say our company is in the construction business. There are several business units within our
             organization: retail, single family residential, and multifamily residential. All projects and pro-
             grams associated with the retail business unit belong to the retail portfolio. The program we
             talked about in the preceding section (the collection of projects associated with building the new
             shopping mall) is one of the programs that belongs to the retail portfolio. There could be other
             programs and projects within this portfolio as well. The objective of any program or project in this
             portfolio is to meet the strategic objectives of the portfolio, which in turn should meet the objec-
             tives of the department and ultimately the corporation. Portfolio management encompasses man-
             aging the collections of programs and projects in the portfolio. This includes weighing the value
             of each project, or potential project, against the portfolio's strategic objectives. It also concerns
             monitoring active projects for adherence to objectives, balancing the portfolio among the other
             investments of the organization, and assuring the efficient use of resources. Portfolio management
             is generally performed by a senior manager in the organization.


             Project Management Offices
             The concept of a project management office, sometimes referred to as the PMO, has been around
             for several years. You'll find that many organizations are establishing PMOs in many different
             forms. PMOs may also be called project offices or program management offices. The PMO is usu-
             ally a centralized organizational unit that oversees the management of projects and programs
             throughout the organization. The most common reason a company starts a project management
             office is to establish and maintain procedures and standards for project management methodol-
             ogies. In some organizations, project managers and team members might report directly to the
             PMO and are assigned to projects as they are initiated. In other organizations, the PMO only pro-
             vides support functions for projects and trains others in project management procedures and tech-
             niques. Still others, depending on their size and function, have experts available that assist project
             managers in project planning, estimating, and business assumption verification tasks. They serve
             as mentors to junior-level project managers and act as consultants to the senior project managers.

                    8           Chapter 1           What Is a Project?




                                          A PMO can exist in all organizational structures, functional, matrix, or projec-
                                          tized. It may have full authority to oversee projects, including the authority to
                                          cancel projects, or it may serve only in an advisory role.

                        The PMO usually has responsibility for maintaining and archiving project documentation
                    for future reference. This office compares project goals with project progress and gives feedback
                    to the project teams. It also measures the project performance of active projects and suggests
                    corrective actions. The PMO evaluates completed projects for their adherence to the project
                    plan and asks questions like the following: Did the project meet the time frames established, did
                    it stay within budget, and was the quality acceptable?
                        Project management offices are becoming more common in organizations today, if for no
                    other reason than to serve as a collection point for project documentation. Some PMOs are
                    fairly sophisticated and prescribe the standards and methodologies to be used in all project
                    phases across the enterprise. Still others provide all these functions and also offer project man-
                    agement consulting services. However, the establishment of a PMO is not required in order for
                    you to apply good project management practices to your next project.



                    Defining Skills Every Good Project
                    Manager Needs
                    Many times, organizations will knight their technical experts as project managers. The skill and
                    expertise that made them stars in their technical fields are mistakenly thought to translate into
                    project management skills. This is not necessarily so.
                        Project managers are generalists with many skills in their repertoire. They are also problem solv-
                    ers who wear many hats. Project managers might indeed possess technical skills, but technical skills
                    are not a prerequisite for sound project management skills. Your project team should include a few
                    technical experts, and these are the people whom the project manager will rely on for technical
                    details. Understanding and applying good project management techniques, along with a solid under-
                    standing of general management skills, are career builders for all aspiring project managers.
                        Project managers have been likened to small-business owners. They need to know a little bit
                    about every aspect of management. General management skills include every area of manage-
                    ment, from accounting to strategic planning, supervision, personnel administration, and more.
                    General management skills are called into play on every project. But some projects require spe-
                    cific skills in certain application areas. Application areas are made up of categories of projects
                    that have common elements. These elements, or application areas, can be defined several ways:
                    by industry group (automotive, pharmaceutical), by department (accounting, marketing), by
                    technical (software development, engineering) or management (procurement, research and
                    development) specialties. These application areas are usually concerned with disciplines, regu-
                    lations, and the specific needs of the project, the customer, or the industry. For example, most

                                                    Defining Skills Every Good Project Manager Needs            9




             governments have specific procurement rules that apply to their projects that wouldn't be appli-
             cable in the construction industry. The pharmaceutical industry is acutely interested in regula-
             tions set forth by the Food and Drug Administration, whereas the automotive industry has little
             or no concern for either of these types of regulations. Having experience in the application area
             you're working in will give you a leg up when it comes to project management. While you can
             call in the experts who have application area knowledge, it doesn't hurt for you to understand
             the specific aspects of the application areas of your project.
                The general management skills listed in this section are the foundation of good project manage-
             ment practices. Your mastery of them (or lack thereof) will likely affect project outcomes. The var-
             ious skills of a project manager can be broken out in a more or less declining scale of importance.
             We'll look at an overview of these skills now and discuss each in more detail in subsequent chapters.


             Communication Skills
             One of the single most important characteristics of a first-rate project manager is excellent com-
             munication skills. Written and oral communications are the backbone of all successful projects.
             Many forms of communication will exist during the life of your project. As the creator or man-
             ager of most of the project communication (project documents, meeting updates, status reports,
             etc.), it's your job to ensure that the information is explicit, clear, and complete so that your
             audience will have no trouble understanding what has been communicated. Once the informa-
             tion has been distributed, it is the responsibility of the person receiving the information to make
             sure they understand it.


                                   There are many forms of communication and communication styles. I'll dis-
                                   cuss them more in depth in Chapter 8, "Developing the Project Team."




             Organizational and Planning Skills
             Organizational and planning skills are closely related and probably the most important, after
             communication skills, a project manager can possess. Organization takes on many forms. As
             project manager, you'll have project documentation, requirements information, memos, project
             reports, personnel records, vendor quotes, contracts, and much more to track and be able to
             locate at a moment's notice. You will also have to organize meetings, put together teams, and
             perhaps manage and organize media release schedules, depending on your project.
                 Time management skills are closely related to organizational skills. It's difficult to stay orga-
             nized without an understanding of how you're managing your time. I recommend you attend
             a time management class if you've never taken one. They have some great tips and techniques
             to help you prioritize problems and interruptions, prioritize your day, and manage your time.
                 Planning is discussed extensively throughout the course of this book. There isn't any aspect
             of project management that doesn't first involve planning. Planning skills go hand in hand with
             organizational skills. Combining these two with excellent communication skills is almost a sure
             guarantee of your success in the project management field.

                    10          Chapter 1         What Is a Project?




                    Budgeting Skills
                    Project managers establish and manage budgets and therefore need some knowledge of finance
                    and accounting principles. Especially important in this skill area is the ability to perform cost
                    estimates for project budgeting. There are different methods available to determine the project
                    costs. They range from estimating individual activities and rolling the estimates up to estimating
                    the project's cost in one big chunk. These methods will be discussed more fully in later chapters.
                        After a budget is determined, you can start spending. This sounds more exciting than it actually
                    is. Reading and understanding vendor quotes, preparing or overseeing purchase orders, and rec-
                    onciling invoices are budgeting skills that will be used by the project manager on most projects.
                    These costs will be linked back to project activities and expense items in the project's budget.


                    Conflict Management Skills
                    Show me a project, and I'll show you problems. All projects have some problems, as does, in
                    fact, much of everyday life. Isn't that what they say builds character? But I digress.
                        Conflict management involves solving problems. Problem solving is really a twofold process.
                    First, you must define the problem by separating the causes from the symptoms. Often when
                    defining problems, you end up just describing the symptoms instead of really getting to the heart
                    of what's causing the problem. To avoid that, ask yourself questions like, "Is it an internal or
                    external problem?" and "Is it a technical problem?" and "Are there interpersonal problems
                    between team members?" and "Is it managerial?" and "What are the potential impacts or con-
                    sequences?" These kinds of questions will help you to get to the cause of the problem.
                        Next, after the problem has been defined, you have some decisions to make. It will take a lit-
                    tle time to examine and analyze the problem, the situation causing it, and the alternatives avail-
                    able. After this analysis, the project manager will determine the best course of action to take and
                    implement the decision. The timing of the decision is often as important as the decision itself.
                    If you make a good decision but implement it too late, it may turn into a bad decision.


                    Negotiation and Influencing Skills
                    Effective problem solving requires negotiation and influencing skills. We all utilize negotiation
                    skills in one form or another every day. For example, on a nightly basis I am asked, "Honey, what
                    do you want for dinner?" Then the negotiations begin, and the fried chicken versus swordfish dis-
                    cussion commences. Simply put, negotiating is working with others to come to an agreement.
                        Negotiation on projects is necessary in almost every area of the project, from scope definition
                    to budgets, contracts, resource assignments, and more. This may involve one-on-one negotia-
                    tion or it might involve teams of people, and it can occur many times throughout the project.
                        Influencing is convincing the other party that swordfish is a better choice than fried chicken, even
                    if fried chicken is what they want. It's also the ability to get things done. Influencing requires an
                    understanding of the formal and informal structure of all the organizations involved in the project.
                        Power and politics are techniques used to influence people to perform. Power is the ability
                    to get people to do things they wouldn't do otherwise. It's also the ability to change minds and
                    the course of events and to influence outcomes.

                                   We'll discuss power further in Chapter 8.



                Politics involve getting groups of people with different interests to cooperate creatively even
             in the midst of conflict and disorder.
                These skills will be utilized in all areas of project management. Start practicing now because,
             guaranteed, you'll need these skills on your next project.

             Leadership Skills
             Leaders and managers are not synonymous terms. Leaders impart vision, gain consensus for
             strategic goals, establish direction, and inspire and motivate others. Managers focus on results
             and are concerned with getting the job done according to the requirements. Even though leaders and
             managers are not the same, project managers must exhibit the characteristics of both during dif-
             ferent times on the project. Understanding when to switch from leadership to management and
             then back again is a finely tuned and necessary talent.

             Team-Building and Motivating Skills
             Project managers will rely heavily on team-building and motivational skills. Teams are often
             formed with people from different parts of the organization. These people may or may not have
             worked together before, so there may be some component of team-building groundwork that
             will involve the project manager. The project manager will set the tone for the project team and will
             help them work through the various team-forming stages to become fully functional. Motivat-
             ing the team, especially during long projects or those experiencing a lot of bumps along the way,
             is another important role the project manager fulfills during the course of the project.
                 An interesting caveat to the team-building role is that project managers many times are
             responsible for motivating team members who are not their direct reports. This has its own set
             of challenges and dilemmas. One way to help this situation is to ask the functional manager to
             allow you to participate in your project team members' performance reviews. Use the negotia-
             tion and influencing skills I talked about earlier to make sure you're part of this process.



             A Mile Wide and an Inch Deep

             Project managers are an interesting bunch. They know a little bit about a lot of things and are excel-
             lent communicators. Or, as one person said, they're "a mile wide and an inch deep." They have the
             ability to motivate people, even those who have no reason to be loyal to the project, and they can
             make the hard-line calls when necessary. Project managers can get caught in sticky situations that
             occasionally require making decisions that are good for the company (or the customer) but aren't
             good for certain stakeholders. These offended stakeholders will then drag their feet, and the project
             manager has to play the heavy in order to motivate and gain their cooperation again. Some orga-
             nizations hire contract project managers to run their large, company-altering projects, just because
             they don't want to burn out a key employee in this role. Fortunately, that doesn't happen often.

                    12          Chapter 1         What Is a Project?



                       Now that you've been properly introduced to some of the skills you need in your tool kit,
                    you'll know to be prepared to communicate, solve problems, lead, and negotiate your way
                    through your next project.



                    Understanding Organizational Structures
                    Just as projects are unique, so are the organizations in which they're carried out. Organizations
                    have their own styles and cultures that influence how project work is carried out. One of the keys
                    to determining the type of organization you work in is measuring how much authority senior man-
                    agement is willing to delegate to project managers. While uniqueness abounds in business cultures,
                    all organizations are structured in one of three ways: functional, projectized, or matrix. Variations
                    and combinations exist among these three structures, such as a projectized structure within a func-
                    tional organization and weak matrix, balanced matrix, and strong matrix organizations.
                        It pays to know and understand the organizational structure and the culture of the entity
                    you're working with. Companies with aggressive cultures that are comfortable in a leading-edge
                    position within their industry are highly likely to take on risky projects. Project managers who
                    are willing to suggest new ideas and projects that have never been undertaken before are likely
                    to receive a warm reception in this kind of environment. Conversely, organizational cultures
                    that are risk averse and prefer the follow-the-leader position within their industry are highly
                    unlikely to take on risky endeavors. Project managers with risk-seeking, aggressive styles are
                    likely to receive a cool reception in a culture like this.
                        The level of authority the project manager enjoys is denoted by the organizational structure.
                    For example, a project manager within a functional organization has little to no formal author-
                    ity. And their title may not be project manager; instead they might be called a project leader, a
                    project coordinator, or perhaps a project expeditor.
                        Let's take a look at each of these types of organizations individually to better understand
                    how the project management role works in each one.


                    Functional Organizations
                    One common type of organization is the functional organization. Chances are you have worked
                    in this type of organization. This is probably the oldest style of organization and is therefore
                    known as the traditional approach to organizing businesses.
                       Functional organizations are centered on specialties and grouped by function, hence the term
                    functional organization. As an example, the organization might have a human resources depart-
                    ment, finance department, marketing department, etc. The work in these departments is spe-
                    cialized and requires people who have the skill sets and experiences in these specialized
                    functions to perform specific duties for the department. Figure 1.2 shows a typical organiza-
                    tional chart for a functional organization.

                             Human                                       Information

                You can see that this type of organization is set up to be a hierarchy. Staff personnel report
             to managers who report to department heads who report to vice presidents who report to the
             CEO. In other words, each employee reports to only one manager; ultimately, one person at the
             top is in charge. Many companies today, as well as governmental agencies, are structured in a
             hierarchical fashion. In organizations like this, be aware of the chain of command. A strict chain
             of command may exist, and the corporate culture might dictate that you follow it. Roughly
             translated: Don't talk to the big boss without first talking to your boss who talks to their boss
             who talks to the big boss. Wise project managers should determine if there is a chain of com-
             mand, how strictly it's enforced, and how the chain is linked before venturing outside of it.
                Each department or group in a functional organization is managed independently and has a
             limited span of control. Marketing doesn't run the finance department or their projects, for
             example. The marketing department is concerned with their own functions and projects. If it
             were necessary for the marketing department to get input from the finance department on a
             project, the marketing team members would follow the chain of command. A marketing man-
             ager would speak to a manager in finance to get the needed information and then pass it back
             down to the project team.

             Human Resources in a Functional Organization
             Commonalities exist among the personnel assigned to the various departments in a functional
             organization. In theory, people with similar skills and experiences are easier to manage as a
             group. Instead of scattering them throughout the organization, it is more efficient to keep them
             functioning together. Work assignments are easily distributed to those who are best suited for
             the task when everyone with the same skill works together. Usually, the supervisors and man-
             agers of these workers are experienced in the area they supervise and are able to recommend
             training and career enrichment activities for their employees.

                    14          Chapter 1         What Is a Project?




                                          Workers in functional organizations specialize in an area of expertise--finance
                                          or personnel administration, for instance--and then become very good at their
                                          specialty.

                       There is a clear upward career path for people in a functional organization. An assistant bud-
                    get analyst may be promoted to a budget analyst and then eventually to a department manager
                    over many budget analysts.

                    The Downside of Functional Organizations
                    Functional organizations have their disadvantages. If this is the kind of organization you work
                    in, you probably have experienced some of them.
                        One of the greatest disadvantages for the project manager is that they have little to no formal
                    authority. This does not mean that project managers in functional organizations are doomed to
                    failure. Many projects are undertaken and successfully completed within this type of organiza-
                    tion. Good communication and interpersonal and influencing skills on the part of the project
                    manager are required to bring about a successful project under this structure.
                        In a functional organization, the vice president or senior department manager is usually the
                    one responsible for projects. The title of project manager denotes authority, and in a functional
                    structure, that authority rests with the VP.

                    Managing Projects in a Functional Organization
                    Projects are typically undertaken in a divided approach in a functional organization. For exam-
                    ple, the marketing department will work on their portion of the project and then hand it off to
                    the manufacturing department to complete their part, and so on. The work the marketing
                    department does is considered a marketing project, while the work the manufacturing depart-
                    ment does is considered a manufacturing project.
                        Some projects require project team members from different departments to work together at
                    the same time on various aspects of the project. Project team members in this structure will more
                    than likely remain loyal to their functional manager. The functional manager is responsible for
                    their performance reviews, and their career opportunities lie within the functional department--
                    not within the project team. Exhibiting leadership skills by forming a common vision regarding
                    the project and the ability to motivate people to work toward that vision are great skills to exercise
                    in this situation. As previously mentioned, it also doesn't hurt to have the project manager work
                    with the functional manager in contributing to the employee's performance review.

                    Resource Pressures in a Functional Organization
                    Competition for resources and project priorities can become fierce when multiple projects are
                    undertaken within a functional organization. For example, in my organization, it's common to
                    have competing project requests from three or more departments all vying for the same
                    resources. Thrown into the heap is the requirement to make, for example, mandated tax law
                    changes, which automatically usurps all other priorities. This sometimes causes frustration and

             political infighting. One department thinks their project is more important than another and
             will do anything to get that project pushed ahead of the others. Again, it takes great skill and
             diplomatic abilities to keep projects on track and functioning smoothly. In a later chapter, we'll
             discuss the importance of gaining stakeholder buy-in and of prioritization and communication
             distribution to avert some of these problems.
                Project managers have little authority in functional organizations, but with the right skills,
             they can successfully accomplish many projects. Table 1.1 highlights the advantages and disad-
             vantages of this type of organization.

             Projectized Organizations
             Projectized organizations are nearly the opposite of functional organizations. The focus of this
             type of organization is the project itself. The idea behind a projectized organization is to develop
             loyalty to the project, not to a functional manager.
                Figure 1.3 shows a typical org chart for a projectized organization.

                    16          Chapter 1         What Is a Project?



                        Organizational resources are dedicated to projects and project work in purely projectized organi-
                    zations. Project managers almost always have ultimate authority over the project in this structure and
                    report directly to the CEO. In a purely projectized organization, supporting functions like human
                    resources and accounting might report directly to the project manager as well. Project managers are
                    responsible for making decisions regarding the project and acquiring and assigning resources. They
                    have the authority to choose and assign resources from other areas in the organization or to hire them
                    from outside if needed. For example, if there isn't enough money in the budget to hire additional
                    resources, the project manager will have to come up with alternatives to solve this problem. This is
                    known as a constraint. Project managers in all organizational structures are limited by the triple con-
                    straints commonly known as: project scope, schedule, and cost (or budget). Quality is sometimes
                    considered a constraint and it's generally affected by scope, schedule, and/or cost. We'll talk more
                    about constraints in Chapter 2, "Creating the Project Charter and Preliminary Scope Statement."
                        Teams are formed and often collocated, which means that team members physically work at
                    the same location. Project team members report to the project manager, not to a functional or
                    departmental manager. One obvious drawback to a projectized organization is that project
                    team members may find themselves out of work at the end of the project. An example of this
                    might be a consultant who works on a project until completion and then is put on the bench or
                    let go at the end of the project. Some inefficiency exists in this kind of organization when it
                    comes to resource utilization. If you have a situation where you need a highly specialized skill
                    at certain times throughout the project, the resource you're using to perform this function might
                    be idle during other times in the project.
                        In summary, projectized organizations are identified in several ways:
                          Project managers have ultimate authority over the project.
                          The focus of the organization is the project.
                          The organization's resources are focused on projects and project work.
                          Team members are collocated.
                          Loyalties are formed to the project, not to a functional manager.
                          Project teams are dissolved at the conclusion of the project.


                    Matrix Organizations
                    Matrix organizations came about to minimize the differences between, and take advantage of,
                    the strengths and weaknesses of functional and projectized organizations. The idea at play here
                    is that the best of both organizational structures can be realized by combining them into one.
                    The project objectives are fulfilled and good project management techniques are utilized while
                    still maintaining a hierarchical structure in the organization.
                        Employees in a matrix organization report to one functional manager and to at least one
                    project manager. It's possible that employees could report to multiple project managers if they
                    are working on multiple projects at one time. Functional managers pick up the administrative
                    portion of the duties and assign employees to projects. They also monitor the work of their
                    employees on the various projects. Project managers are responsible for executing the project
                    and giving out work assignments based on project activities. Project managers and functional
                    managers share the responsibility of performance reviews for the employee.

             The Projectized Graphic Artist

             You've been appointed project manager for your company's website design and implementa-
             tion. You're working in a projectized organization, so you have the authority to acquire and
             assign resources. You put together your team, including programmers, technical writers,
             testers, and business analysts. Debbie, a highly qualified graphic arts designer, is also part of
             your team. Debbie's specialized graphic arts skills are needed only at certain times throughout
             the project. When she has completed the graphic design portion of the screen she's working
             on, there isn't anything else for her to do until the next page is ready. Depending on how
             involved the project is and how the work is structured, days or weeks might pass before Deb-
             bie's skills are needed. This is where the inefficiency occurs in a purely projectized organiza-
             tion. The project manager will have to find other duties that Debbie can perform during these
             down times. It's not practical to let her go and then hire her back when she's needed again.

             In this situation, you might assign Debbie to other project duties when she's not working on
             graphic design. Perhaps she can edit the text for the web pages or assist with the design of the
             upcoming marketing campaign. You might also share Debbie's time with another project man-
             ager in the organization.

             During the planning process, you will discover the skills and abilities of all your team members
             so that you can plan their schedules accordingly and eliminate idle time.




                                   In a nutshell, functional managers assign employees to projects, while project
                                   managers assign tasks associated with the project in a matrix organization.

                Matrix organizations have unique characteristics. We'll look at how projects are conducted
             and managed and how project and functional managers share the work in this organizational
             structure next.

             Project Focus in a Matrix Organization
             Matrix organizations allow project managers to focus on the project and project work just as
             in a projectized organization. The project team is free to focus on the project objectives without
             distractions from the functional department.
                Project managers should take care when working up activity and project estimates for the
             project in a matrix organization. The estimates should be given to the functional managers for
             input before publishing. The functional manager is the one in charge of assigning or freeing up
             resources to work on projects. If the project manager is counting on a certain employee to work
             on the project at a certain time, the project manager should determine their availability up front
             with the functional manager. Project estimates might have to be modified if it's discovered that
             the employee they were counting on is not available when needed.

                    18          Chapter 1           What Is a Project?



                    Balance of Power in a Matrix Organization
                    As we've discussed, a lot of communication and negotiation takes place between the project
                    manager and the functional manager. This calls for a balance of power between the two or one
                    will dominate the other.
                       In a strong matrix organization, the balance of power rests with the project manager. They
                    have the ability to strong-arm the functional managers into giving up their best resources for
                    projects. Sometimes, more resources than necessary are assembled for the project, and then
                    project managers negotiate these resources among themselves, cutting out the functional man-
                    ager altogether, as you can see in Figure 1.4.

                 On the other end of the spectrum is the weak matrix (see Figure 1.5). As you would suspect,
             the functional managers have all the power in this structure. Project managers are really project
             coordinators or expeditors with part-time responsibilities on projects in a weak matrix organi-
             zation. Project managers have little to no authority, just as in the functional organization. On
             the other hand, the functional managers have a lot of authority and make all the work assign-
             ments. The project manager simply expedites the project.
                 In between the weak matrix and the strong matrix is an organizational structure called the
             balanced matrix (see Figure 1.6). The features of the balanced matrix are what we've been dis-
             cussing throughout this section. The power is balanced between project managers and func-
             tional managers. Each manager has responsibility for their parts of the project or organization,
             and employees get assigned to projects based on the needs of the project, not the strength or
             weakness of the manager's position.
                 Matrix organizations have subtle differences, and it's important to understand their differ-
             ences for the PMP exam. The easiest way to remember them is that the weak matrix has many
             of the same characteristics as the functional organization, while the strong matrix has many of
             the same characteristics as the projectized organization. The balanced matrix is exactly that--
             a balance between weak and strong, where the project manager shares authority and responsi-
             bility with the functional manager. Table 1.2 compares all three structures.
                 Most organizations today use some combination of the organizational structures described
             here. They're a composite of functional, projectized, and matrix structures. It's rare that an
             organization would be purely functional or purely projectized. For example, projectized struc-
             tures can coexist within functional organizations.
                 In the case of a high-profile, critical project, the functional organization might appoint a spe-
             cial project team to work only on that project. The team is structured outside the bounds of the
             functional organization and the project manager has ultimate authority for the project. This is
             a workable project management approach and ensures open communication between the
             project manager and team members. At the end of the project, the project team is dissolved and
             the project members return to their functional areas to resume their usual duties.

                    Exam Spotlight

                    Organizational structure is a topic you may encounter on the exam. Know this topic as it's
                    described in A Guide to the PMBOK.



                       Organizations are unique, as are the projects they undertake. Understanding the organiza-
                    tional structure will help you, as a project manager, with the cultural influences and communi-
                    cation avenues that exist in the organization to gain cooperation and successfully bring your
                    projects to a close.



                    Understanding Project Life Cycles and
                    Project Management Processes
                    Project life cycles are similar to the life cycle that parents experience raising their children to
                    adulthood. Children start out as infants and generate lots of excitement wherever they go. How-
                    ever, not much is known about them at first. So you study them as they grow and assess their

             needs. Over time, they mature and grow (and cost a lot of money in the process), until one day
             the parents' job is done.
                Projects start out just like this and progress along a similar path. Someone comes up with a great
             idea for a project and actively solicits support for it. The project, after being approved, progresses
             through the intermediate phases to the ending phase, where it is completed and closed out.


             Project Phases and Project Life Cycles
             All projects are divided into phases, and all projects, large or small, have a similar life cycle
             structure. At a minimum, a project will have a beginning or initiation phase, an intermediate
             phase or phases, and an ending phase. The number of phases depends on the project complexity
             and the industry. For example, information technology projects may progress through phases
             such as requirements, design, program, test, and implement. All the collective phases the project
             progresses through in concert are called the project life cycle.
                The end of each phase allows the project manager, stakeholders, and project sponsor the
             opportunity to determine if the project should continue to the next phase. In order to progress
             to the next phase, the deliverable from the phase before it must be reviewed for accuracy and
             approved. As each phase is completed, it's handed off to the next phase. We'll look at handoffs
             and progressions through these phases next.

             Handoffs
             Project phases evolve through the life cycle in a series of phase sequences called handoffs, or
             technical transfers. The end of one phase sequence typically marks the beginning of the next.
             However, the completion of one phase does not automatically signal the beginning of the next
             phase. For example, in the construction industry, feasibility studies often take place in the begin-
             ning phase of a project.
                The purpose of the feasibility study is to determine if the project is worth undertaking and
             whether the project will be profitable to the organization. A feasibility study is a preliminary
             assessment of the viability of the project, the viability or perhaps marketability of the product
             or service of the project, and the project's value to the organization. It may also determine if the
             product or service of the project is safe and meets industry or governmental standards and reg-
             ulations. The completion and approval of the feasibility study triggers the beginning of the
             requirements phase, where requirements are documented and then handed off to the design
             phase, where blueprints are produced. The feasibility may also show that the project is not
             worth pursuing and the project is terminated; thus, the next phase never begins.

             Phase Completion
             You will recognize phase completion because each phase has a specific deliverable, or multiple
             deliverables, that marks the end of the phase. A deliverable is an output that must be produced,
             reviewed, and approved to bring the phase or project to completion. Deliverables are tangible and
             can be measured and easily proved. For instance, a hypothetical deliverable produced in the begin-
             ning phase of our construction industry example would be the feasibility study. Deliverables
             might also include things like design documents, project budgets, blueprints, project schedules,

                    prototypes, etc. This analysis allows those involved with the opportunity to determine if the
                    project should continue to the next phase. The feasibility study might show that environmental
                    impacts of an enormous nature would result if the construction project were undertaken at the
                    proposed location. Based on this information, a go or no-go decision can be made at the end of
                    this phase. The end of a phase gives the project manager the ability to discover, address, and take
                    corrective action against errors discovered during the phase.


                                          A Guide to the PMBOK states that phase ending reviews are also known by a
                                          few other names: phase exits, phase gates, or kill points.

                        There are times when phases are overlapped to shorten or compress the project schedule.
                    This is called fast tracking. Fast tracking means that a later phase is started prior to completing
                    and approving the phase, or phases, that come before it. This technique is used to shorten the
                    overall duration of the project.
                        Most projects follow phase sequences within a project life cycle and, as a result, have the fol-
                    lowing characteristics in common: In the beginning phase, which is where the project is initi-
                    ated, costs are low and there are few team members assigned to the project. As the project
                    progresses, costs and staffing increase and then taper off at the closing phase. The potential that
                    the project will come to a successful ending is lowest at the beginning of the project; its chance
                    for success increases as the project progresses through its phases and life cycle stages. Risk is
                    highest at the beginning of the project and gradually decreases the closer the project comes to
                    completion. Stakeholders have the greatest chance of influencing the project and the character-
                    istics of the product or service of the project in the beginning phases and have less and less influ-
                    ence as the project progresses. This same phenomenon exists within the project management
                    processes as well. We'll look at those next.


                    Project Management Process Groups
                    Project management processes organize and describe the work of the project. A Guide to the
                    PMBOK describes five process groups used to accomplish this end. These processes are per-
                    formed by people and, much like project phases, are interrelated and dependent on one another.
                       A Guide to the PMBOK documents five project management process groups:
                          Initiating
                          Planning
                          Executing
                          Monitoring and Controlling
                          Closing
                       All of these process groups have individual processes that collectively make up the group. For
                    example, the Initiating process group has two processes called Develop Project Charter and
                    Develop Preliminary Project Scope Statement. Collectively, these process groups--including all
                    their individual processes--make up the project management process. Projects start with the

                             Understanding Project Life Cycles and Project Management Processes                 23




             Initiating process and progress through all the processes in the Planning process group, the Exe-
             cuting process group, and so on until the project is successfully completed or it's canceled. All
             projects must complete the Closing processes, even if the project is killed. Phase handoffs (the
             design phase handoff to manufacturing, for example) also occur within these life cycles.


                                   Don't confuse project phases and life cycles with the project management pro-
                                   cess groups. A Guide to the PMBOK makes a strong point of this. Project
                                   phases and life cycles describe how the work associated with the product of the
                                   project will be completed. For example, a construction project may have
                                   phases such as feasibility study, design, build, inspection, turnover. The five
                                   project management process groups (Initiating, Planning, Executing, Monitor-
                                   ing and Controlling, Closing) organize and describe how the project activities
                                   will be conducted in order to meet the project requirements. These processes
                                   are generally performed for each phase of a large project. The five process
                                   groups are the heart of A Guide to the PMBOK and the exam. As you progress
                                   through this book, be certain you understand each of these processes as
                                   they're described in A Guide to the PMBOK.

                Let's start with a high-level overview of each process group. The remainder of this book will
             cover each of these processes in detail. If you want to peek ahead, Appendix A lists each of the
             process groups, the individual processes that make up each process group, and the Knowledge
             Area they belong in. (I'll cover knowledge areas in the section titled "The Project Management
             Knowledge Areas" later in this chapter.)

             Initiating
             The Initiating process group, as its name implies, occurs at the beginning of the project and at the
             beginning of each project phase for large projects. Initiating acknowledges that a project, or the
             next project phase, should begin. This process group grants the approval to commit the organi-
             zation's resources to working on the project or phase and authorizes the project manager to begin
             working on the project. The outputs of the Initiating process group, including the project charter
             and preliminary project scope statement, become inputs into the Planning group.

             Planning
             The Planning process is the process group of formulating and revising project goals and objec-
             tives and creating the project management plan that will be used to achieve the goals the project
             was undertaken to address. The Planning process group also involves determining alternative
             courses of action and selecting from among the best of those to produce the project's goals. This
             process group is where the project requirements are fleshed out and stakeholders are identified.
             Planning has more processes than any of the other project management process groups. The
             Executing, Monitoring and Controlling, and Closing process groups all rely on the Planning
             processes and the documentation produced during the Planning processes in order to carry out
             their functions. Project managers will perform frequent iterations of the Planning processes
             prior to project completion. Projects are unique and, as such, have never been done before.
             Therefore, Planning must encompass all areas of project management and consider budgets,

                    activity definition, scope planning, schedule development, risk identification, staff acquisition,
                    procurement planning, and more. The greatest conflicts a project manger will encounter in this
                    process group are project prioritization issues.

                    Executing
                    The Executing process group involves putting the project management plan into action. It's here
                    that the project manager will coordinate and direct project resources to meet the objectives of
                    the project plan. The Executing process keeps the project plan on track and ensures that future
                    execution of project plans stays in line with project objectives. This process group is typically
                    where approved changes are implemented. The Executing process group will utilize the most
                    project time and resources, and as a result, costs are usually highest during the Executing pro-
                    cess. Project managers will experience the greatest conflicts over schedules in this cycle.

                    Monitoring and Controlling
                    The Monitoring and Controlling process group is where project performance measurements are
                    taken and analyzed to determine if the project is staying true to the project plan. The idea is to
                    identify problems as soon as possible and apply corrective action to control the work of the
                    project and assure successful outcomes. For example, if you discover that variances exist, you'll
                    apply corrective action to get the project activities realigned with the project plan. This might
                    require additional passes through the Planning processes to adjust project activities, resources,
                    schedules, budgets, and so on.

                    Closing
                    The Closing process group is probably the most often skipped process group in project man-
                    agement. Closing brings a formal, orderly end to the activities of a project phase or to the
                    project itself. Once the project objectives have been met, most of us are ready to move on to the
                    next project. However, Closing is important because all the project information is gathered now
                    and stored for future reference. The documentation collected during the Closing process group
                    can be reviewed and utilized to avert potential problems on future projects. Contract closeout
                    occurs here, and formal acceptance and approval are obtained from project stakeholders.



                    Exam Spotlight

                    The project manager and project team are responsible for determining which processes within
                    each process group are appropriate for the project you're working on. This is called tailoring. You
                    should take into consideration the size and complexity of the project and the various inputs and
                    outputs of each of the processes when determining which processes to implement and perform.
                    Small independent projects may not require the rigor of each of the processes within a process
                    group, but every process should be addressed and its level of implementation determined. Use
                    your judgment when deciding which processes to follow, particularly for small projects.

             Characteristics of the Process Groups
             The progression through the project management process groups exhibit the same characteris-
             tics as progression through the project phases do. That is, costs are lowest during the Initiating
             processes and few team members are involved. Costs and staffing increase in the Executing pro-
             cess group and then decrease as you approach the Closing process group. The chances for suc-
             cess are lowest during Initiating and highest during Closing. The chances for risks occurring are
             higher during Initiating, Planning, and Executing, but the impacts of risks are greater during the
             later processes. Stakeholders have the greatest influence during the Initiating and Planning pro-
             cesses and less and less influence as you progress through Executing, Monitoring and Control-
             ling, and Closing. To give you a better idea of when certain characteristics influence a project,
             refer to Table 1.3 and Table 1.4. A recap of the characteristics in the beginning and ending pro-
             cess groups are shown here.

                Remember that costs and resources are usually highest during the Executing phase.

             The Process Flow
             The five process groups should not be thought of as one-time processes that are performed as
             discrete elements. Rather, these processes interact and overlap with each other. They are itera-
             tive and may be revisited and revised throughout the project's life several times as the project
             is refined. A Guide to the PMBOK calls this process of going back through the process groups
             an iterative process. The conclusion of each process group allows the project manager and

                    stakeholders to re-examine the business needs of the project and determine if the project is sat-
                    isfying those needs. And it is another opportunity to make a go or no-go decision.
                        Figure 1.7 shows the five process groups in a typical project. Keep in mind that during phases
                    of a project, the Closing process group can provide input to the Initiating process group. For
                    example, once the feasibility study discussed earlier is accepted or closed, it becomes input to the
                    Initiating process group of the design phase.

                        It's important to understand the flow of these processes for the exam. If you remember the pro-
                    cesses and their inputs and outputs, it will help you when you're trying to decipher an exam ques-
                    tion. The outputs of one process group become the inputs into the next process group (or the outputs
                    may be a deliverable of the project). Sometimes just understanding which process the question is ask-
                    ing about will help you determine the answer. One trick you can use to memorize these processes is
                    to remember syrup of ipecac. You probably have some of this poison antidote in your medicine cab-
                    inet at home. If you think of the Monitoring and Controlling process group as simply "Controlling,"
                    when you sound out the first initial of each of the processes, it sounds like "ipecac"--IPECC (Initi-
                    ating, Planning, Executing, Monitoring and Controlling, and Closing).
                        As I stated earlier, individual processes make up each of the process groups. For example, the Clos-
                    ing life cycle process group consists of two processes: Close Project and Contract Closure. Each pro-
                    cess takes inputs and uses them in conjunction with various tools and techniques to produce outputs.


                                          It's outside the scope of this book to explain all the inputs, tools and techniques,
                                          and outputs for each process in each process group (although each is listed in
                                          Appendix A). You'll find each input, tool and technique, and output detailed in A
                                          Guide to the PMBOK, and I highly recommend you get familiar with them.

             Exam Spotlight

             Understand each project management process group and all of the processes that make up
             these groups. Appendix A contains a table of all of the process, their inputs, tools and tech-
             niques, outputs, and the Knowledge Area they each belong in. (We'll cover knowledge areas in
             the section titled "The Project Management Knowledge Areas" later in this chapter.)



                There are test questions regarding inputs, tools and techniques, and outputs of many of the
             processes within each process group. One way to keep them all straight is to remember that
             tools and techniques usually require action of some sort, be it measuring, applying some skill or
             technique, planning, or using expert judgment. Outputs are usually in the form of a deliverable.
             Remember that a deliverable is characterized with results or outcomes that can be measured, are
             tangible, and are provable. Last but not least, outputs from one process sometimes serve as
             inputs to another process.

             Process Interactions
             We've covered a lot of material but there's one more concept I want to explain before we move
             on to the next section. As stated earlier, project managers must determine the processes that are
             appropriate for effectively managing a project based on the complexity and scope of the project,
             available resources, budget, and so on. As the project progresses, the project management pro-
             cesses may be revisited and revised to update the project management plan as more information
             becomes known. Underlying the concept that process groups are iterative is a cycle A Guide to
             the PMBOK describes as the "Plan-Do-Check-Act" cycle that was originally defined by Walter
             Shewhart and later modified by Edward Deming. The idea behind this concept is that each ele-
             ment in the cycle is results oriented. The results from the Plan cycle become inputs into the Do
             cycle and so on, much like the way the project management process groups interact. The cycle
             interactions can be mapped to work in conjunction with the five project management process
             groups. For example, the Plan cycle maps to the Planning process group. Before we go any fur-
             ther, let's do a brief refresher.
                  Project phases describe how the work required to produce the product of the project will
                  be completed
                  Project management process groups organize and describe how the project activities will be
                  completed in order to meet the goals of the project
                  The Plan-Do-Check-Act cycle is an underlying concept that shows the integrative nature of
                  the process groups
                Figure 1.8 shows the relationships and interactions of the concepts we've learned so far.
             Please bear in mind that a simple figure can't get across all the interactions and iterative nature
             of these interactions; however, I think you'll see that the figure ties the basic elements of these
             concepts together.

                    The Project Management Knowledge Areas
                    There is one more way to classify the processes from each project management process group.
                    A Guide to the PMBOK groups these processes into nine categories that they call the Project
                    Management Knowledge Areas. These groupings, or knowledge areas, bring together processes
                    that have characteristics in common. For example, the Project Cost Management knowledge
                    area involves all aspects of the budgeting process, as you would suspect. Therefore, processes
                    such as Cost Estimating, Cost Budgeting, and Cost Control belong to this knowledge area.
                    Here's the tricky part--these processes don't belong to the same project management process
                    groups (Cost Estimating and Cost Budgeting are part of the Planning process group and Cost
                    Control is part of the Monitoring and Controlling process group). Think of it this way: knowl-
                    edge areas bring together processes by commonalities, whereas project management process

             groups are more or less the order you perform the project management processes (although
             remember you can come back through these processes more than once). The nine knowledge
             areas are as follows:
                  Project Integration Management
                  Project Scope Management
                  Project Time Management
                  Project Cost Management
                  Project Quality Management
                  Project Human Resource Management
                  Project Communications Management
                  Project Risk Management
                  Project Procurement Management
                Let's take a closer look at each knowledge area so you understand how they relate to the pro-
             cess groups. Included in each of the following subsections is a table that illustrates the processes
             that make up that knowledge area and the project management process group that each process
             belongs to. This will help you to see the big picture in terms of process groups compared to
             knowledge areas. We'll be discussing each of the processes in the various knowledge areas
             throughout the book, but for now, let's take a high-level look at each of them.



             Exam Spotlight

             The PMP exam will most likely have a question or two regarding the processes that make up
             a knowledge area. Remember that knowledge areas bring together processes by commonali-
             ties, so thinking about the knowledge area itself should tip you off to the processes that belong
             to it. Projects are executed in process group order, but the knowledge areas allow a project
             manager to think about groups of processes that require specific skills. This makes the job of
             assigning resources easier because team members with specific skills might be able to work on
             and complete several processes at once. To broaden your understanding of the knowledge
             areas, cross-reference the purposes and the processes that make up each knowledge area with
             A Guide to the PMBOK.




             Project Integration Management
             Project Integration Management (see Table 1.5) comprises seven processes:
                  Develop Project Charter
                  Develop Preliminary Project Scope Statement
                  Develop Project Management Plan
                  Direct and Manage Project Execution

                    30          Chapter 1         What Is a Project?



                          Monitor and Control Project Work
                          Integrated Change Control
                          Close Project
                       The Project Integration Management knowledge area is concerned with coordinating all
                    aspects of the project plan and is highly interactive. This knowledge area involves identifying
                    and defining the work of the project and combining, unifying, and integrating the appropriate
                    processes. This knowledge area also takes into account satisfactorily meeting the requirements
                    of the customer and stakeholder and managing their expectations.
                       Project planning, project execution, monitoring project work, and change control occur
                    throughout the project and are repeated continuously while working on the project. Project
                    planning and execution involve weighing the objectives of the project against the alternatives to
                    bring the project to a successful completion. This includes making choices about how to effec-
                    tively use resources and coordinating the work of the project on a continuous basis. Monitoring
                    the work of the project involves anticipating potential problems and issues and dealing with
                    them before they reach the critical point. Change control impacts the project plan, which in turn
                    impacts the work of the project, which in turn can impact the project management plan, so you
                    can see that these processes are very tightly linked. The processes in this area, as with all the
                    knowledge areas, also interact with other processes in the remaining knowledge areas. For
                    example, the Close Project process uses outputs from the Contract Administration process and
                    produces inputs to the Contract Closure process.
                       The Project Integration Management knowledge area has two tools for assisting with process
                    integration: Earned Value Management and project management software. Earned Value Man-
                    agement (EVM) is a project-integrating methodology used in this knowledge area to integrate
                    the processes and measure project performance through a project's life cycle. We'll further
                    define EVM and talk more about project management software tools in Chapter 7, "Creating
                    the Project Schedule and Budget."

                                                          The Project Management Knowledge Areas               31




             Project Scope Management
             Project Scope Management (see Table 1.6) has five processes:
                  Scope Planning
                  Scope Definition
                  Create WBS
                  Scope Verification
                  Scope Control
                Project Scope Management is concerned with defining all of the work of the project and only
             the work needed to successfully meet the project goals. These processes are highly interactive.
             They define and control what is and what is not part of the project. Each process occurs at least
             once--and often many times--throughout the project's life.
                Project Scope Management encompasses both product scope and project scope. Product
             scope concerns the characteristics of the product or service or result of the project. It's measured
             against the product requirements to determine successful completion or fulfillment. The appli-
             cation area usually dictates the process tools and techniques you'll use to define and manage
             product scope. Project scope involves managing the work of the project and only the work of
             the project. Project scope is measured against the project management plan, the project scope
             statement, the work breakdown structure (WBS) and the WBS dictionary.


                                   To ensure a successful project, both product and project scope must be well
                                   integrated. This implies that Project Scope Management is well integrated with
                                   the other knowledge area processes.

                Scope Planning, Scope Definition, Create WBS, Scope Verification, and Scope Control
             involve the following:
                  Detailing the requirements of the product of the project
                  Verifying those details using measurement techniques
                  Creating a project scope management plan
                  Creating a work breakdown structure
                  Controlling changes to these processes

                    Project Time Management
                    The Project Time Management knowledge area, shown in Table 1.7, has six processes:
                          Activity Definition
                          Activity Sequencing
                          Activity Resource Estimating
                          Activity Duration Estimating
                          Schedule Development
                          Schedule Control
                       This knowledge area is concerned with estimating the duration of the project plan activities, devis-
                    ing a project schedule, and monitoring and controlling deviations from the schedule. Collectively, this
                    knowledge area deals with completing the project in a timely manner. Time management is an impor-
                    tant aspect of project management because it concerns keeping the project activities on track and
                    monitoring those activities against the project plan to ensure that the project is completed on time.
                       While each process in this knowledge area occurs at least once in every project (and sometimes
                    more), in many cases, particularly on small projects, Activity Sequencing, Activity Duration Esti-
                    mating, and Schedule Development are completed as one activity. Only one person is needed to
                    complete these processes for small projects, and they're all worked on at the same time.

                                                          The Project Management Knowledge Areas               33




             Project Cost Management
             As its name implies, the Project Cost Management knowledge area centers around costs and
             budgets. The processes that make up this knowledge area are as follows:
                  Cost Estimating
                  Cost Budgeting
                  Cost Control
                You can see how they work together in Table 1.8.
                The activities in the Project Cost Management knowledge area establish cost estimates for
             resources, establish budgets, and keep watch over those costs to ensure that the project stays
             within the approved budget. This knowledge area is primarily concerned with the costs of
             resources, but other costs should be considered as well. For example, make certain to examine
             ongoing maintenance and support costs for software you're considering for the project.
                Depending on the complexity of the project, these processes might need the involvement of
             more than one person. For example, the finance person might not have expertise about the
             resources documented in the staffing management plan so the project manager will need to
             bring in a staff member with those skills to assist with the activities in this process.
                Two techniques are used in this knowledge area to decide among alternatives and improve the
             project process: life-cycle costing and Value Engineering. The life-cycle costing technique consid-
             ers a group of costs collectively (such as acquisition, operations, disposal, and so on) when decid-
             ing among or comparing alternatives. The Value Engineering technique helps improve project
             schedules, profits, quality, and resource usage and optimizes life-cycle costs, among others. These
             techniques can improve decision making, reduce costs, reduce activity durations, and improve the
             quality of the deliverables. Some application areas require additional financial analysis to help
             predict project performance. Techniques such as payback analysis, return on investment, and dis-
             counted cash flows are a few of the tools used to accomplish this.


                                   We'll discuss these techniques and others in further detail in Chapter 2.

                    34          Chapter 1         What Is a Project?




                    Project Quality Management
                    The Project Quality Management knowledge area assures that the project meets the require-
                    ments that it was undertaken to produce. This knowledge area focuses on product quality as
                    well as on the quality of the project management process used during the project. These pro-
                    cesses measure overall performance and monitor project results and compare them to the qual-
                    ity standards set out in the project-planning process to assure the customer will receive the
                    product or service they commissioned.
                        As you can see from Table 1.9, Project Quality Management is composed of the following
                    three processes: Quality Planning, Perform Quality Assurance, and Perform Quality Control.

                    Project Human Resource Management
                    Project Human Resource Management involves all aspects of people management and personal
                    interaction, including leading, coaching, dealing with conflict, performance appraisals, and
                    more. These processes ensure that the human resources assigned to the project are used in the
                    most effective way possible. Some of the project participants whom you'll get to practice these
                    skills on include stakeholders, team members, and customers. Each requires the use of different
                    communication styles, leadership skills, and team-building skills. A good project manager
                    knows when to enact certain skills and communication styles based on the situation.
                       Projects are unique and temporary and so usually are project teams. Teams are put together based
                    on the skills and resources needed to complete the activities of the project, and many times project
                    team members may not know one another. Because the makeup of each team is different and the
                    stakeholders involved in the various stages of the project may change, you'll use different techniques
                    at different times throughout the project to manage the processes in this knowledge area.
                       The Project Human Resource Management knowledge area contains the following processes:
                          Human Resources Planning
                          Acquire Project Team
                          Develop Project Team
                          Manage Project Team
                         Take a look at Table 1.10 to see a visual overview of Project Human Resource Management.

             Project Communications Management
             The following processes make up the Project Communications Management knowledge area:
                  Communications Planning
                  Information Distribution
                  Performance Reporting
                  Manage Stakeholders
                The processes in the Project Communications Management knowledge area are related to gen-
             eral communication skills, but they encompass much more than an exchange of information. Com-
             munication skills are considered general management skills that the project manager utilizes on a
             daily basis. The processes in the Process Communications Management knowledge area seek to
             ensure that all project information--including project plans, risk assessments, meeting notes, and
             more--is collected, documented, archived, and disposed of at the proper time. These processes also
             ensure that information is distributed and shared with stakeholders, management, and project mem-
             bers at appropriate times. When the project is closed, the information is archived and used as a ref-
             erence for future projects. This is referred to as historical information in several project processes.
                Everyone on the project has some involvement with this knowledge area because all project mem-
             bers will send and/or receive project communication throughout the life of the project. It is impor-
             tant that all team members and stakeholders understand how communication affects the project.
                Table 1.11 shows the Project Communications Management process in progress.

                    Project Risk Management
                    Project Risk Management, as seen in Table 1.12, contains six processes:
                          Risk Management Planning
                          Risk Identification
                          Qualitative Risk Analysis

                          Risk Monitoring and Control
                       Risks include both threats to and opportunities within the project. The processes in this
                    knowledge area are concerned with identifying, analyzing, and planning for potential risks,
                    both positive and negative, that may impact the project. This means minimizing the probability
                    and impact of negative risks while maximizing the probability and impact of positive risks.
                    These processes are also used to identify the positive consequences of risk and exploit them to
                    improve project objectives or discover efficiencies that may improve project performance.
                       Organizations will often combine several of these processes into one step. For example, Risk
                    Identification, Qualitative Risk Analysis, and Quantitative Risk Analysis might be performed at
                    the same time. The important thing about the Project Risk Management knowledge area is that
                    you should strive to identify all the risks and develop responses for those with the greatest con-
                    sequences to the project objectives.

             Project Procurement Management
             The Project Procurement Management knowledge area includes the processes involved with pur-
             chasing goods or services from vendors, contractors, suppliers, and others outside the project
             team. When discussing the Project Procurement Management processes, it's assumed that the dis-
             cussion is taking place from your perspective as a buyer while sellers are external to the project
             team. Interestingly, the seller may manage their work as a project, particularly when the work is
             performed on contract, and you as the buyer become a key stakeholder in their project.
                The processes in the Project Procurement Management knowledge area, shown in Table 1.13,
             are as follows:
                  Plan Purchases and Acquisitions
                  Plan Contracting
                  Request Seller Responses
                  Select Sellers
                  Contract Administration

                    38          Chapter 1         What Is a Project?



                        The remainder of this book will deal with processes and process groups as they occur in order
                    (i.e., Initiating, Planning, Executing, Monitoring and Controlling, and Closing), as this is the
                    way you will encounter and manage them during a project.



                    Summary
                    Phew! We covered a lot of ground in this chapter. We learned that projects exist to bring about
                    a unique product, service, or result. Projects are temporary in nature and have definite begin-
                    ning and ending dates.
                       Stakeholders are those people or organizations that have a vested interest in the outcome of
                    the project. Stakeholders include people like the project sponsor, the customer, key manage-
                    ment personnel, the project manager, contractors, suppliers, and more. Projects are considered
                    complete when the project meets or exceeds the expectations of the stakeholders.
                       Project management is a discipline that brings together a set of tools and techniques to
                    describe, organize, and monitor the work of project activities. Project managers are the ones
                    responsible for carrying out these activities. Projects may be organized into programs or port-
                    folios and may be managed centrally by a PMO.
                       Project managers have a wide variety of skills. Not only should they be versed in the field
                    they're working in, but in general management skills as well. Communication is the most impor-
                    tant skill a project manager will use in the course of a project.
                       Organizational structures come in variations of three forms: functional, projectized, and
                    matrix organizations. Functional organizations are traditional with hierarchical reporting
                    structures. Project managers have little to no authority in this organization. Projectized organi-
                    zations are structured around project work, and staff personnel report to project managers.
                    Project managers have full authority in this organizational structure. Matrix organizations are
                    a combination of the functional and projectized. A project manager's authority varies depend-
                    ing on the structure of the matrix, be it a weak matrix, a balanced matrix, or a strong matrix.
                       Projects progress through phases along a life cycle path to complete the product of the
                    project. The project management process groups are performed throughout the project's life
                    cycle. The process groups described in A Guide to the PMBOK are Initiating, Planning, Exe-
                    cuting, Monitoring and Controlling, and Closing. Additionally, there are nine knowledge areas
                    that bring together processes that have characteristics in common.



                    Exam Essentials
                    Be able to describe the difference between projects and operations. A project is temporary in
                    nature with a definite beginning and ending date. Projects produce unique products, services, or
                    results. Operations are ongoing and use repetitive processes that typically produce the same
                    result over and over.

             Be able to denote some of the skills every good project manager should possess. Communi-
             cation, budgeting, organizational, problem solving, negotiation and influencing, leading, and
             team building are skills a project manager should possess.
             Be able to differentiate the different organizational structures and the project manager's author-
             ity in each. Organizations are usually structured in some combination of the following: func-
             tional, projectized, and matrix (including weak matrix, balanced matrix, and strong matrix).
             Project managers have the most authority in a projectized organization and the least amount of
             authority in a functional organization.
             Be able to name the five project management processes. The five project management pro-
             cesses are Initiating, Planning, Executing, Monitoring and Controlling, and Closing.
             Be able to name the nine Project Management Knowledge Areas. The nine Project Manage-
             ment Knowledge Areas are Project Integration Management, Project Scope Management,
             Project Time Management, Project Cost Management, Project Quality Management, Project
             Human Resource Management, Project Communications Management, Project Risk Manage-
             ment, and Project Procurement Management.

             3.   Your company manufactures small kitchen appliances. They are introducing a new product line of
                  appliances in designer colors with distinctive features for kitchens in small spaces. These new products
                  will be offered indefinitely starting with the spring catalog release. Which of the following is true?
                  A. This is a project because this new product line has never been manufactured and sold by this
                     company before.
                  B. This is an ongoing operation because the company is in the business of manufacturing
                     kitchen appliances. Introducing designer colors and features is simply a new twist on an
                     existing process.

                    42          Chapter 1         What Is a Project?



                    5.    A project is considered successful when ___________________.
                          A. The product of the project has been manufactured.
                          B. The project sponsor announces the completion of the project.
                          C. The product of the project is turned over to the operations area to handle the ongoing
                             aspects of the project.
                          D. The project meets or exceeds the expectations of the stakeholders.

                    6.    The VP of customer service has expressed concern over a project you're involved in. His specific
                          concern is that if the project is implemented as planned, he'll have to purchase additional equip-
                          ment to staff his customer service center. The cost is substantial and was not taken into consid-
                          eration in the project budget. The project sponsor insists that the project must go forward as
                          originally planned or the customer will suffer. Which of the following is true?
                          A. The VP of customer service is correct. Since the cost was not taken into account at the begin-
                             ning of the project, the project should not go forward as planned. Project initiation should
                             be revisited to examine the project plan and determine how changes can be made to accom-
                             modate customer service.
                          B. The conflict should be resolved in favor of the customer.
                          C. The conflict should be resolved in favor of the project sponsor.
                          D. The conflict should be resolved in favor of the VP of customer service.

                    7.    Which of the following brings together a set of tools and techniques used to describe, organize,
                          and monitor the work of project activities?
                          A. Project managers
                          B. A Guide to the PMBOK

             11. You've decided to try your hand at project management in the entertainment industry. You're
                 working on a movie production and the team has just completed the storyboard phase of the
                 project. Which of the following is true?
                  A. The storyboard is a deliverable that marks the end of the phase. The deliverable must be
                     approved before the next phase begins.
                  B. The storyboard phase marks the end of the Initiating process group and the next phase of
                     the project should begin.
                  C. All of the phases of this project together make up a program.
                  D. The division of phases and determining which processes to use in each phase is called tailoring.

             12. You are managing a project to install a new postage software system that will automatically
                 print labels and administer postage for certified mailings, overnight packages, and other special
                 mailing needs. You've attempted to gain the cooperation of the business analyst working on this
                 project and need some answers. She is elusive and tells you that this project is not her top pri-
                 ority. What should you do to avoid situations like this in the future?
                  A. Establish the business analyst's duties well ahead of due dates and tell her you'll be reporting
                     on her performance to her functional manager.
                  B. Establish the business analyst's duties well ahead of due dates and tell her you are expecting
                     her to meet these expectations because the customer is counting on the project meeting due
                     dates to save significant costs on their annual mailings.
                  C. Negotiate with the business analyst's functional manager during the planning process to
                     establish expectations and request to participate in the business analyst's annual perfor-
                     mance review.
                  D. Negotiate with the business analyst's functional manager during the planning process to
                     establish expectations and inform the functional manager of the requirements of the project.
                     Agreement from the functional manager will assure the cooperation of the business analyst.

                 south highway through your city by two lanes in each direction. You are interested in implement-
                 ing a new project process called Design-Build in order to speed up the project schedule. The idea
                 is that the construction team will work on the first mile of the highway reconstruction at the same
                 time the design team is coming up with plans for the third mile of the reconstruction rather than
                 completing all design before any construction begins. This is an example of ___________________.

                    46          Chapter 1         What Is a Project?




                    Answers to Review Questions
                    1.    C. The Project Management Institute (PMI) is the industry-recognized standard for project man-
                          agement practices.

                    2.    B. Projects exist to create a unique product or service. The logon screen in this question is not
                          a unique product. A minor change has been requested, indicating this is an ongoing operation
                          function. Some of the criteria for projects are that they are unique, temporary with definitive
                          start and end dates, and considered complete when the project goals are achieved.

                    3.    A. This is a project. The product line is new, which implies that this is a unique product--it
                          hasn't been done before. We can discern a definite start and end date by the fact that the new
                          appliances must be ready by the spring catalog release.

                    4.    D. Progressive elaboration is the process of determining the characteristics and features of the
                          product of the project. Progressive elaboration is carried out in steps in detailed fashion.

                    5.    D. A project is considered successful when stakeholder needs and expectations are met or exceeded.

                    6.    B. Conflicts between stakeholders should always be resolved in favor of the customer. This ques-
                          tion emphasizes the importance of identifying your stakeholders and their needs as early as pos-
                          sible in the project. We'll discuss this more in later chapters.

                    7.    C. Project management brings together a set of tools and techniques to organize project activi-
                          ties. Project managers are the ones responsible for managing the project processes.

                    8.    B. Project Integration Management is made up of Project Plan Development, Project Plan Exe-
                          cution, and Integrated Change Control.

                    9.    D. Project Time Management involves the following processes: Activity Definition, Activity
                          Sequencing, Activity Duration Estimating, Schedule Development, and Schedule Control.

                    10. A. Negotiation and influencing skills are needed to convince Jack's boss and come to agreement
                        concerning his assignment.

                    11. A. The storyboard is a deliverable. Phase endings are characterized by the completion, review,
                        and approval of the deliverable. The next phase should not begin until the deliverable is
                        approved.

                    12. C. Negotiate with the functional manager to participate in the business analyst's annual perfor-
                        mance review.

                    13. B. The level of authority the project manager has is determined by the organizational structure.
                        For instance, in a functional organization, the project manager has little to no authority, but in
                        a projectized structure, the project manager has full authority.

                    14. A. An advantage for employees in a functional organization is that they have only one supervisor
                        and a clear chain of command exists.
3601.book Page 47 Wednesday, July 13, 2005 1:39 PM




                                                                        Answers to Review Questions              47




             15. D. Employees in a balanced matrix often report to two or more managers. Functional managers
                 and project managers share authority and responsibility for projects. There is a balance of power
                 between the functional managers and project managers.

             16. C. Projectized organizations are focused on the project itself. One issue with this type of struc-
                 ture is determining what to do with project team members when they are not actively involved
                 on the project. One alternative is to release them when they are no longer needed.

             17. D. Remember the acronym that sounds like syrup of ipecac: IPECC (Initiating, Planning, Exe-
                 cuting, Monitoring and Controlling, and Closing).

             18. B. Fast tracking is starting a new phase before the phase you're working on is completed. This
                 compresses the project schedule, and as a result, the project is completed sooner.

             19. C. The Initiating process is where stakeholders have the greatest ability to influence outcomes of
                 the project. Risk is highest during this stage because of the high degree of unknown factors.

             20. A. The Planning process is where requirements are fleshed out, stakeholders are identified, and
                 estimates on project costs and time are made.

                                                    Now that you're fully armed with a detailed overview of project
                                                    management, you can easily determine if your next assignment
                                                    really is a project or an ongoing operation. You've also learned
                    some of the basics of good project management techniques and the knowledge areas where you
                    might need specific expertise. We're going to start putting those techniques into practice during
                    the Initiating process group, which is where all projects start. And, as you've probably already
                    guessed, we'll be using some of the general management skills outlined in Chapter 1, "What Is
                    a Project?"
                       One of the first skills you will put to use will be your communication skills. Are you sur-
                    prised? Of course you're not. It all starts with communication. You can't start defining the
                    project until you've first talked to the project sponsor, key stakeholders, and management per-
                    sonnel. All good project managers have honed their communication skills to a nice sharp edge.
                       You'll remember from Chapter 1 that Initiating is the first process group in the five project
                    management process groups. You can think of it as the official project kickoff. Initiating
                    acknowledges that the project, or the next phase in an active project, should begin. This process
                    group culminates in the publication of a project charter and a preliminary project scope state-
                    ment. We'll cover each in this chapter.
                       At the end of this chapter, I'll introduce a case study that will illustrate the main points of the
                    chapter. We'll take this case study with us from chapter to chapter and begin building a project
                    using each of the skills we learn.



                    How Projects Come About
                    Your company's quarterly meeting is scheduled for today. You take your seat, and each of the
                    department heads gets up and gives their usual "We can do it" rah-rah speech, one after the other.
                    You sit up a little straighter when the CEO takes the stage. He starts out his part of the program
                    pretty much the same way the other department heads did, and before long you find yourself drift-
                    ing off. You are mentally reviewing the status of your current project when suddenly your day-
                    dreaming trance is shattered. You perk up as you hear the CEO say, "...and the new phone system
                    will be installed by Thanksgiving."
                        Wait a minute. You work in the telecom department and haven't heard a word about this
                    project until today. You also have a funny feeling that you've been elected to manage this project.
                    It's amazing how good communication skills are so important for project managers but not...well,
                    we won't go there.
                        Project initiation is the formal recognition that a project, or the next phase in an existing
                    project, should begin and resources should be committed to the project. Unfortunately, many

                                                                          How Projects Come About             51




             projects are initiated the way the CEO did in this example. Each of us, at one time or another,
             has experienced being handed a project with little to no information and told to "make it hap-
             pen." The new phone system scenario is an excellent example of how not to initiate a project.
                Taking one step back leads you to ask, "How do projects come about in the first place? Do
             CEOs just make them up as in this example?" Even though your CEO announced this new
             project at the company meeting with no forewarning, there is no doubt it came about as a result
             of a legitimate need. Believe it or not, CEOs don't just dream projects up to give you something
             to do. They're concerned about the future of the company and the needs of the business and its
             customers.
                The business itself might drive the need for a project, customers might demand changes to
             products, or legal requirements may create the need for a new project. According to A Guide
             to the PMBOK, projects come about as a result of one of six needs or demands. Once those
             needs and demands are identified, the next logical step might include performing a feasibility
             study to determine the viability of the project. We'll look at these topics next.


             Needs and Demands
             Organizations exist to generate profits or serve the public. To stay competitive, organizations
             are always examining new ways of creating business, better ways of gaining efficiencies, or bet-
             ter ways to serve their customers. Sometimes laws are passed to force organizations to make
             their products safer or to less harmful to the environment. Projects result from all of these needs.
             Most projects will fit one of the six needs and demands described in the following list. It is those
             needs and demands that dictate the germination of a project. Needs and demands can also take
             the form of a business requirement, an opportunity, or a problem. Let's take a closer look at
             each of these areas:
             Market demand The demands of the marketplace can drive the need for a project. For
             example, a bank initiates a project to offer customers the ability to apply for mortgage loans
             over the Internet due to a drop in interest rates and an increase in demand for refinancing and
             new home loans.
             Business need The new phone system talked about earlier that was announced at the quarterly
             meeting came about as a result of a business need. The CEO, on advice from his staff, was
             advised that call volumes were maxed on the existing system. Without a new system, customer
             service response times would suffer, and that would eventually affect the bottom line.
             Customer request Customer requests run the gamut. Generally speaking, most companies
             have customers, and their requests can drive new projects. Customers can be internal or external
             to the organization. Government agencies don't have external customers per se (we're captive
             customers at any rate), but there are internal customers within departments and across agencies.
             Perhaps you work for a company that sells remittance-processing equipment and you've just
             landed a contract with a local utility company. This project is driven by the need of the utility
             company to automate its process or upgrade its existing process. The utility company's request
             to purchase your equipment and consulting services is the project driver.

                    52          Chapter 2         Creating the Project Charter and Preliminary Scope Statement



                    Technological advance Do you happen to own one of those electronic personal digital assis-
                    tants? They keep names and addresses handy and usually come with a calendar and a to-do list
                    of some kind. I couldn't live without mine. However, there is always a newer, better version
                    coming to market. The introduction of satellite communications now allows these little devices
                    to connect to the Web or get e-mail almost anywhere in the world. The introduction of satellite
                    communications is an example of a technological advance. Due to this introduction, electronics
                    manufacturers revamped their products to take advantage of this new technology.
                    Legal requirement Private industry and government agencies both generate new projects as a
                    result of laws passed every legislative season. For example, new sales tax laws might require new
                    programming to the existing sales tax system. The requirement that food labels appear on every
                    package describing the ingredients and the recommended daily allowances is another example
                    of a project driven by legal requirements.
                    Social need The last need is a result of social demands. For example, perhaps a developing
                    country is experiencing a fast-spreading disease that's infecting large portions of the popula-
                    tion. Medical supplies and facilities are needed to vaccinate and cure those infected with the
                    disease. Another example might include cleaning up waste products from the water supply of
                    manufacturing plants prior to putting the water back into a local river or stream to prevent
                    contamination.



                    Exam Spotlight

                    Understand each of the needs and demands that bring about a project for the exam.



                       All of these needs and demands represent opportunities, business requirements, or problems
                    that need to be solved. Management must decide how to respond to these needs and demands,
                    which will more often than not initiate new projects.


                    Feasibility Studies
                    After the opportunity for a project becomes evident, the next step might be to go ahead and ini-
                    tiate it, which means you're ready to jump right into creating a project charter for the project.
                    But before you take that plunge, you should know that some organizations will require a fea-
                    sibility study prior to making a final decision about starting the project.
                       Feasibility studies are undertaken for several reasons. One is to determine if the project is
                    a viable project. A second reason is to determine the probability of the project succeeding.
                    Feasibility studies can also examine the viability of the product of the project. For example,
                    the study might ask, "Will the new lemon-flavored soda be a hit? Or is it marketable?" The
                    study might also look at the technical issues related to the project and determine if the tech-
                    nology proposed is feasible, reliable, and easily assimilated into the organization's existing
                    technology structure.

                                                                             How Projects Come About                 53




                Feasibility studies may be conducted as separate projects, as subprojects, or as the
             first life cycle phase of the project. When you don't know the outcome of the study, it's best
             to treat it as a separate project. The group of people conducting the feasibility study should
             not be the same ones who will work on the project. Project team members may have
             built-in biases toward the project and will tend to influence the feasibility outcome toward
             those biases.




             The Interactive Voice Response Tax-Filing System

             Jason, Sam, and Kate are web programmers working for the Department of Revenue in the
             State of Bliss. Ron, their manager, approaches them one day with an idea.

             "Team, business unit managers are thinking it would be a great idea to offer taxpayers the abil-
             ity to file their income tax returns over the telephone. We already offer them the ability to file
             on the Internet, thanks to all your efforts on that project last year. It's been a fabulous success.
             No other state has had the success that Bliss has had with our Internet system."

             "Kate, I know you've had previous experience with IVR technology, but I'm not sure about you
             guys, so this is new territory for us. I'd like to hear what each of you thinks about this project."

             Jason speaks up first. "I think it's a great idea. You know me, I'm always up for learning new
             things, especially when it comes to programming. When can we start?"

             Sam echoes Jason's comments.

             "This technology is pretty sophisticated," Kate says. "Jason and Sam are excellent coders and
             could work on the programming side of things, but I would have to pick up the telephony piece
             on my own. After we're up and running, we could go over the telephony portions step by step,
             so Jason and Sam can help me support it going forward. I'd really like to take on this project.
             It would be good for the team and good for the department."

             Ron thinks for a minute. "Let's not jump right into this. I know you're anxious to get started, but
             I think a feasibility study is in order. The senior director of the tax business unit doesn't know
             if this project is cost justified and has some concerns about its life span. A feasibility study will
             tell us the answers to those questions. It should also help us determine if we're using the right
             technology to accomplish our goals, and it will outline alternative ways of performing the
             project that we haven't thought of. I don't want Kate going it alone without first examining all
             the issues and potential impacts to the organization."

                    54          Chapter 2         Creating the Project Charter and Preliminary Scope Statement




                    Kicking Off the Project Charter
                    Our first stop in the Initiating group is a process called Develop the Project Charter. As the name
                    of the process suggests, our purpose is to create a project charter. As we talked about in Chapter 1,
                    the purpose for the Initiating group is to authorize a project, or the next phase of a project, to
                    begin. It also gives the project manager the authority to apply resources to the project. These are
                    also the purposes of a project charter: formally authorizing the project to begin and committing
                    resources.


                                          The charter contains several elements which we'll discuss in the section "For-
                                          malizing and Publishing the Project Charter" later in this chapter.




                    Exam Spotlight

                    Understand the purposes of the project charter for the exam.



                        As you'll discover, every process has inputs, tools and techniques, and outputs and this one
                    is no exception. We'll start with the inputs. Let's get to it.


                    Project Charter Inputs
                    Inputs to the project processes are typically informational in nature or they are outputs from
                    previously completed processes. Inputs are used in combination with the tools and techniques
                    to produce the outputs of each process. Process outputs are usually tangible, like a report or an
                    update or a list, for example. In order to get to the output, we have to start with the inputs. Let's
                    take a look at the Develop Project Charter process inputs:
                          Contract (where applicable)
                          Project statement of work
                          Enterprise environmental factors
                          Organizational process assets
                       The first input, a contract, is applicable only when the organization you are working for is
                    performing a project for a customer external to the organization. The contract is used as an
                    input to this process because it typically documents the conditions under which the project will
                    be executed, the time frame, and a description of the work.

                                                                     Kicking Off the Project Charter        55




             Project Statement of Work
             The project statement of work (SOW) describes the product or service the project was under-
             taken to complete. This is usually a document written by either the project sponsor or the ini-
             tiator of the project. When the project is external to the organization, the SOW is typically
             written by the buyer. For example, suppose you work for a consulting firm and have been
             assigned as the project manager for a project your company is performing on contract. The cus-
             tomer, the organization you'll be performing the project for, is the one who wrote the SOW.
                According to A Guide to the PMBOK, a project SOW should contain or consider all of the
             following elements:
             Business need The business need for the project here relates to the needs of the organization
             itself. The need may be based on training, governmental standards, technological advances,
             market demands, or a legal requirement.
             Product scope description The product scope description describes the characteristics of the
             product or service of the project. The product scope description should be documented and
             should also include a description of the relationship between the business need or demand that's
             driving the project and the products being created.
             Product descriptions contain less detail in the early phases of a project and more detail as the
             project progresses. Product scope descriptions, like the work of the project, are progressively
             elaborated. They will contain the greatest amount of detail in the project Executing processes.
             When a project is performed under contract, typically the buyer of the product or service will
             provide the product description to the vendor or contractor. The product description can
             serve as a statement of work when the project is contracted to a vendor. A statement of work
             describes the product or service in enough detail so that the vendor can accurately price the
             contract and satisfactorily fulfill the requirements of the project.
             Strategic plan Part of the responsibility of a project manager during the Initiating processes is
             to take into consideration the company's strategic plan. Perhaps the strategic plan states that
             one of the company goals is to build 15 new stores by the end of the next fiscal year. If your
             project entails installing a new human resources software system, it would make sense to write
             the requirements for your project with the 15 new stores in mind. Your management team will
             refer to the strategic plan when choosing which new projects to initiate and which ones to drop,
             depending on their relationship to the strategic vision of the company.

             Enterprise Environmental Factors
             The enterprise environmental factors input shows up as an input to many of the other processes
             we'll discuss throughout the book. This input refers to the factors outside of the project itself
             that have (or may have) significant influence on the success of the project. According to A Guide
             to the PMBOK, the environmental factors include the following:
             Organizational or company culture and structure We talked about organizational structures
             and their influence on the organization in Chapter 1.

                    56          Chapter 2         Creating the Project Charter and Preliminary Scope Statement



                    Governmental or industry standards These include elements like regulatory standards and
                    regulations (for instance, doctors must be licensed to practice medicine on people or pets),
                    quality standards (International Standards Organization standards, for example), product
                    standards, and workmanship standards.
                    Infrastructure This refers to the organization's facilities and capital equipment. I would also
                    include information technology in this category, even though PMI doesn't mention it.
                    Human resources This refers to the existing staff's skills and knowledge.
                    Personnel administration These are guidelines for hiring and firing, training, and employee
                    performance reviews.
                    Organization's work authorization system           This defines how the work of the project is
                    authorized.
                    Marketplace conditions The old supply-and-demand theory applies here along with economic
                    and financial factors.
                    Stakeholder risk tolerance This is the level of risk stakeholders are willing to take on. We'll
                    talk more about this in Chapter 5, "Risk Planning."
                    Commercial databases These refer to industry-specific information, risk databases, and so on.
                    Project management information systems This is typically a software product that allows you
                    to schedule project activities and resources and collect and distribute project information.
                        These factors can influence the way you manage the project and, in some cases, the outcomes
                    of the project. For example, perhaps the folks assigned to your project are junior level and don't
                    have the skills, experience, or knowledge needed to complete the work of the project. It's up to
                    the project manager to understand the organization's environmental factors and account for
                    and consider how they can influence the management and outcomes of the project.

                    Organizational Process Assets
                    Organizational process assets refers to the organization's policies, guidelines, procedures, plans,
                    approaches, or standards for conducting work, including project work. This includes a wide
                    range of elements that may affect several aspects of the project, such as project management pol-
                    icies, safety policies, performance measurement criteria, templates, financial controls, commu-
                    nication requirements, issue and defect management procedures, change control procedures,
                    risk control procedures, and the procedures used for authorizing work.
                        Organizational process assets also includes the information the organization has learned on
                    previous projects (including how to store and retrieve that information). For example, previous
                    project risks, performance measurements, earned value data, and schedules for past projects are
                    valuable resources of knowledge for the current project. This information is also known as his-
                    torical information. If you don't capture and store this information, however, it won't be avail-
                    able when starting a new project. You'll want to capture and store information such as project
                    financial data (budgets, costs, overruns), historical information, lessons learned, project files,
                    issues and defects, process measurements, and configuration management knowledge.

                                                     Using Tools and Techniques for Charter Development         57




                                   There are several elements included in the organizational process assets title,
                                   and I'll cover of each of them in later chapters of the book.

                Organizational process assets and historical information should be reviewed and examined
             when starting a new project. Historical information can be very useful to project managers and
             to stakeholders. When you're evaluating new projects, historical information about previous
             projects of a similar nature can be very handy in determining if the new project should be
             accepted and initiated. Historical information gathered and documented during an active
             project is used to assist in determining whether the project should proceed to the next phase.
             Historical information will help you with the project charter, preliminary project scope state-
             ment, project scope statement, development of the project management plan, the process of
             defining and estimating activities, and more during the project-planning processes.
                Understanding previous projects of a similar nature--their problems, successes, issues,
             and outcomes--will help you avoid repeating mistakes while reusing successful techniques
             to accomplish the goals of this project to the satisfaction of the stakeholders. Many of the
             processes in the project management process groups have organizational process assets as
             an input, implying that you should review the pertinent organizational assets that apply for
             the process you're about to start. For example, when performing the Cost Estimating pro-
             cess, you may find it helpful to review the activity estimates and budgets on past projects
             of similar size and scope before estimating the costs for the activities on the new project.



             Exam Spotlight

             Make certain you understand what the organizational process assets entail for the exam.




             Using Tools and Techniques for
             Charter Development
             The Develop Project Charter process has four tools and techniques you can use to help you pro-
             duce the project charter. They are project selection methods, project management methodology,
             project management information system, and expert judgment. We'll look at each one next.


             Selecting and Prioritizing Projects
             Most organizations don't have the luxury of performing every project that's proposed. Even

                    projects. The project selection methods tool and technique calculates measurable differences
                    between projects and determines the tangible benefits to the company of choosing or not choosing
                    the project.
                        Project selection methods will vary depending on the company, the people serving on the
                    selection committee, the criteria used, and the project. Sometimes selection methods will be
                    purely financial, sometimes purely marketing, and sometimes they'll be based on public percep-
                    tion or political perception. In most cases, the decision is based on a combination of all of these
                    and more.
                        Most organizations have a formal, or at least semiformal, process for selecting and prior-
                    itizing projects. In my organization, a steering committee is responsible for project review,
                    selection, and prioritization. A steering committee is a group of folks comprising senior man-
                    agers and sometimes midlevel managers who represent each of the functional areas in the
                    organization.
                        Here's how our process works: The steering committee requests project ideas from the
                    business staff prior to the beginning of the fiscal year. These project ideas are submitted in
                    writing and contain a high-level overview of the project goals, a description of the deliver-
                    ables, the business justification for the project, a desired implementation date, what the
                    organization stands to gain from implementing the project, a list of the functional business
                    areas affected by the project, and if applicable, a cost-benefit analysis (we'll talk about that
                    in a bit).
                        A meeting is called to review the projects and a determination is made on each project
                    as to whether it will be included on the upcoming list of projects for the new year. Once the
                    no-go projects have been weeded out, the remaining projects are prioritized according to their
                    importance and benefit to the organization. The projects are documented on an official
                    project list, and progress is reported on the active projects at the regular monthly steering
                    committee meetings.
                        In theory, it's a great idea. In practice, it works only moderately well. Priorities can and do
                    change throughout the year. New projects come up that weren't originally submitted during the
                    call for projects and they must be added to the list. Reprioritization begins anew, and resource
                    alignment and assignments are shuffled. But again, we're getting ahead of ourselves. Just be
                    aware that organizations usually have a process to recognize and screen project requests, accept
                    or reject those requests based on some selection criteria, and prioritize the projects based on
                    some criteria.
                        The project selection methods we'll talk about next are ones you should know and
                    understand for the exam. However, keep in mind they are only one aspect of project selec-
                    tion in the real world. The individual opinion, and power, of selection committee members
                    also plays a part in the projects the organization chooses to perform. Don't underestimate
                    the importance of the authority, political standing, and individual aspirations of selection
                    committee members. Those committee members who happen to carry a lot of weight in
                    company circles, so to speak, are likely to get their projects approved just on the fact that
                    they are who they are. This is sometimes how project selection works in my organization.
                    How about yours?

             Using Project Selection Methods
             Project selection methods are concerned with the advantages or merits of the product of
             the project. In other words, selection methods measure the value of what the product or ser-
             vice of the project will produce and how it will benefit the organization. Selection methods
             involve the types of concerns executive managers are typically thinking about. This includes
             factors like market share, financial benefits, return on investment, customer retention and
             loyalty, and public perceptions. They are used to evaluate and choose between alternative
             ways of performing the project.
                According to A Guide to the PMBOK, there are two categories of selection methods: benefit
             measurement methods and mathematical models. These selection methods are known as deci-
             sion models and calculation methods. Decision models examine different criteria used in mak-
             ing decisions regarding project selection, while calculation methods provide a way to calculate
             the value of the project, which is then used in project selection decision making.



             Exam Spotlight

             Cross-reference your understanding of benefit measurement methods and mathematical mod-
             els with the descriptions provided in A Guide to the PMBOK.



             Mathematical Models
             For the exam, all you need to understand about mathematical models is that they use linear,
             dynamic, integer, nonlinear, and/or multi-objective programming in the form of algorithms--
             or in other words, a specific set of steps to solve a particular problem. These are complicated
             mathematical formulas and algorithms that are beyond the scope of this book and require an
             engineering, statistical, or mathematical background to fully understand. Organizations con-
             sidering undertaking projects of enormous complexity may use mathematical modeling tech-
             niques to make decisions regarding these projects. Mathematical models are also known as
             constrained optimization methods. The vast majority of project selection techniques will use the
             benefit measurement methods to make project selection decisions.

             Benefit Measurement Methods
             Benefit measurement methods employ various forms of analysis and comparative approaches to
             make project decisions. These methods include comparative approaches such as cost-benefit,
             scoring models, and benefit contribution methods that include various cash flow techniques and
             economic models. We'll examine several of these methods, starting with cost-benefit.

             Cost-Benefit Analysis
             One common benefit measurement method is the cost-benefit analysis. The name of this method
             implies what it does--it compares the cost to produce the product or service of the project to
             the benefit (usually financial in the form of savings or revenue generation) the organization will

                    receive as a result of executing the project. Obviously, a sound project choice is one where the
                    costs to implement or produce the product of the project are less than the financial benefits.
                    How much less is the organization's decision. Some companies are comfortable with a small
                    margin, while others are comfortable with a much larger margin between the two figures.
                       When examining costs for a cost-benefit analysis, include the costs to produce the product
                    or service, the costs to take the product to market, and ongoing operational support costs. For
                    example, let's say your company is considering writing and marketing a database software
                    product that will allow banks to dissect their customer base, determine which types of custom-
                    ers buy which types of products, and then market more effectively to those customers. You will
                    take into account some of the following costs:
                          The costs to develop the software, such as programmer costs, hardware costs, testing, and
                          testing costs.
                          Marketing costs such as advertising, traveling costs to perform demos at potential customer
                          sites, and so on.
                          Ongoing costs such as having a customer support staff available during business hours to
                          assist customers with product questions and problems.
                       Let's say the cost to produce this software plus the ongoing support costs total $5 million.
                    Initial projections look like the demand for this product is high. Over a three-year period, the
                    potential life of the software in its proposed form, projected revenues are $12 million. Taking
                    only the financial information into account, the benefits outweigh the costs of this project. This
                    project should receive a go recommendation.


                                          Projects of significant cost or complexity usually involve more than one benefit
                                          measurement method when go or no-go decisions are being made or one
                                          project is being chosen over another. Keep in mind that selection methods can
                                          take subjective considerations into account as well--the project is a go because
                                          it's the new CEO's pet project; nothing else needs to be said.


                    Scoring Models
                    Another project selection technique in the benefit measurement category is a scoring model,
                    or weighted scoring model. My organization uses weighted scoring models not only to
                    choose between projects, but also as a method to choose between competing bids on out-
                    sourced projects.
                       Weighted scoring models are quite simple. The project selection committee decides on the
                    criteria that will be used on the scoring model--for example, profit potential, marketability
                    of the product or service, the ability of the company to quickly and easily produce the product
                    or service, and so on. Each of these criteria is assigned a weight depending on its importance
                    to the project committee. More important criteria should carry a higher weight than less
                    important criteria.
                       Then each project is rated on a scale from 1 to 5 (or some such assignment), with the higher
                    number being the more desirable outcome to the company and the lower number having the

             opposite effect. This rating is then multiplied by the weight of the criteria factor and added to
             other weighted criteria scores for a total weighted score. Let's look at an example that brings
             this together (see Table 2.1).

             *5 = highest




                In this example, Project A is the obvious choice.

             Cash Flow Analysis Techniques
             The remaining benefit measurement methods involve a variety of cash flow analysis techniques,
             including payback period, discounted cash flows, net present value, and internal rate of return.
             We'll look at each of these techniques individually, and I'll provide you with a crash course on
             their meanings and calculations.
             PAYBACK PERIOD
             The payback period is the length of time it takes the company to recoup the initial costs of pro-
             ducing the product or service of the project. This method compares the initial investment to the
             cash inflows expected over the life of the product or service. For example, say the initial invest-
             ment on a project is $200,000, with expected cash inflows of $25,000 per quarter every quarter
             for the first two years and $50,000 per quarter from then on. The payback period is two years
             and can be calculated as follows:
                  Initial investment = $200,000
                  Cash inflows = $25,000 x 4 (quarters in a year) = $100,000/year total inflow
                  Initial investment ($200,000) - year 1 inflows ($100,000) = $100,000 remaining balance
                  Year 1 inflows remaining balance - year 2 inflows = $0
                  Total cash flow year 1 and year 2 = $200,000
                  Payback is reached in two years.
3601.book Page 62 Wednesday, July 13, 2005 1:39 PM




                    62          Chapter 2         Creating the Project Charter and Preliminary Scope Statement



                       The fact that inflows are $50,000 per quarter starting in year 3 makes no difference because
                    payback is reached in two years.
                       Payback period is the least precise of all the cash flow calculations. That's because payback
                    period does not consider the value of the cash inflows made in later years, commonly called the
                    time value of money. For example, if you have a project with a five-year payback period, the
                    cash inflows in year 5 are worth less than they are if you received them today. The next section
                    will explain this idea more fully.
                    DISCOUNTED CASH FLOWS
                    As I just stated, money received in the future is worth less than money received today. The reason
                    for that is the time value of money. If I borrowed $2,000 from you today and promised to pay it
                    back in three years, you would expect me to pay interest in addition to the original amount bor-
                    rowed. Okay, if you were a family member or a really close friend maybe you wouldn't, but ordi-
                    narily this is the way it works. You would have had the use of the $2,000 had you not lent it to
                    me. If you had invested the money (does this bring back memories of your mom telling you to save
                    your money?), you'd receive a return on it. Therefore, the future value of the $2,000 you lent me
                    today is $2,315.25 in three years from now at 5 percent interest per year. Here's the formula for
                    future value calculations:
                          FV = PV(1 + i)n
                       In English, this formula says the future value (FV) of the investment equals the present value
                    (PV) times (1 plus the interest rate) raised to the value of the number of time periods (n) the
                    interest is paid. Let's plug in the numbers:
                          FV = 2,000(1.05)3
                          FV = 2,000(1.157625)
                          FV = $2,315.25
                       The discounted cash flow technique compares the value of the future cash flows of the
                    project to today's dollars. In order to calculate discounted cash flows, you need to know the
                    value of the investment in today's terms, or the present value (PV). PV is calculated as follows:
                          PV = FV / (1 + i)n
                        This is the reverse of the FV formula talked about earlier. So, if we ask the question, "What
                    is $2,315.25 in three years from now worth today given a 5 percent interest rate?" we'd use the
                    preceding formula. Let's try it:
                          PV = $2,315.25 / (1 + .05)3
                          PV = $2,315.25 / 1.157625
                          PV = 2,000
                        $2,315.25 in three years from now is worth $2,000 today.
                        Discounted cash flow is calculated just like this for the projects you're comparing for selec-
                    tion purposes or when considering alternative ways of doing the project. Apply the PV formula
                    to the projects you're considering and then compare the discounted cash flows of all the projects

             against each other to make a selection. Here is an example comparison of two projects using this
             technique:
                  Project A is expected to make $100,000 in two years.
                  Project B is expected to make $120,000 in three years.
                  If the cost of capital is 12 percent, which project should you choose?
                  Using the PV formula used previously, calculate each project's worth.
                  The PV of Project A = $79,719.
                  The PV of Project B = $85,414.
               Project B is the project that will return the highest investment to the company and should be
             chosen over Project A.
             NET PRESENT VALUE
             Projects may begin with a company investing some amount of money into the project to com-
             plete and accomplish its goals. In return, the company expects to receive revenues, or cash
             inflows, from the resulting project. Net present value (NPV) allows you to calculate an accu-
             rate value for the project in today's dollars. The mathematical formula for NPV is compli-
             cated, and you do not need to memorize it in that form for the test. However, you do need
             to know how to calculate NPV for the exam, so I've given you some examples of a less-
             complicated way to perform this calculation in Tables 2.2 and 2.3 using the formulas you've
             already seen.
                 Net present value works like discounted cash flows in that you bring the value of future mon-
             ies received into today's dollars. With NPV, you evaluate the cash inflows using the discounted
             cash flow technique applied to each period the inflows are expected instead of in one sum. The
             total present value of the cash flows is then deducted from your initial investment to determine
             NPV. NPV assumes that cash inflows are reinvested at the cost of capital.
                 Here's the rule: If the NPV calculation is greater than zero, accept the project. If the NPV cal-
             culation is less than zero, reject the project.
                 Look at the two project examples in Tables 2.2 and 2.3. Project A and Project B have total
             cash inflows that are the same at the end of the project, but the amount of inflows at each period
             differs for each project. We'll stick with a 12 percent cost of capital. Note that the PV calcula-
             tions were rounded to two decimal places.

                        Project A has an NPV greater than zero and should be accepted. Project B has an NPV less
                    than zero and should be rejected. When you get a positive value for NPV, it means that the
                    project will earn a return at least equal to or greater than the cost of capital.
                        Another note on NPV calculations: Projects with high returns early in the project are better
                    projects than projects with lower returns early in the project. In the preceding examples, Project A
                    fits this criterion also.
                    INTERNAL RATE OF RETURN
                    The internal rate of return (IRR) is the most difficult equation to calculate of all the cash flow
                    techniques that we've discussed. It is a complicated formula and should be performed on a
                    financial calculator or computer. IRR can be figured manually, but it's a trial-and-error
                    approach to get to the answer.
                       Technically speaking, IRR is the discount rate when the present value of the cash inflows
                    equals the original investment. When choosing between projects or when choosing alternative
                    methods of doing the project, projects with higher IRR values are generally considered better
                    than projects with low IRR values.

                                                     Using Tools and Techniques for Charter Development       65




             Exam Spotlight

             For the exam, you need to know three things concerning IRR:

                  IRR is the discount rate when NPV equals zero.

                  IRR assumes that cash inflows are reinvested at the IRR value.

                  You should choose projects with the highest IRR value.




             Exam Spotlight

             Although A Guide to the PMBOK doesn't specifically address these cash flow techniques, you'll
             likely see exam questions on these topics. They are inferred in A Guide to the PMBOK under the
             heading "Benefit Measurement Methods."



             Applying Project Selection Methods
             Now that we've discussed some of the techniques used in the project selection methods tool and
             technique, let's look at how to apply them when choosing projects or project alternatives. One,
             two, or several of the benefit measurement methods can be used alone or in combination to
             come up with a selection decision. Remember that payback period is the least precise of all the
             cash flow techniques, NPV is the most conservative cash flow technique, and NPV and IRR will
             generally bring you to the same accept/reject conclusion.
                Project selection methods, and particularly the benefit measurement methods, can be used
             to evaluate multiple projects or a single project. You might be weighing one project against
             another or simply considering if the project you're proposing is worth doing. Remember that
             project selection methods are a tool and technique of the Develop Project Charter process and
             this tool and technique covers two broad categories called mathematical methods (also known
             as constrained optimization methods) and benefit measurement methods. Both of these together
             are often called decision models.


             Project Management Methodology and
             Information Systems
             These two techniques are similar so I've put them together under the same heading. The project man-
             agement methodology tool and technique refers to a methodology for managing projects much like
             A Guide to the PMBOK process groups and all of the processes contained within each of them. A
             project management methodology may be a formal, recognized project management standard like
             the one outlined in this book or an informal technique. Whether formal or informal, the methodol-
             ogy should help the project manager develop the project charter.

                    66          Chapter 2         Creating the Project Charter and Preliminary Scope Statement




                    Fun Days Vacation Resorts

                    Jerry is a project manager for Fun Days Vacation Resorts. He is working on three different
                    project proposals to present to the executive steering committee for review. As part of the
                    information-gathering process, Jerry visits the various resorts pretending to be a guest. This
                    gives him a feel for what Fun Days guests experience on their vacations, and it better prepares
                    him to present project particulars and alternatives.

                    Jerry has prepared the project overviews for three projects and called upon the experts in mar-
                    keting to help him out with the projected revenue figures. He works up the numbers and finds
                    the following:

                          Project A--payback period = 5 years; IRR = 8 percent

                          Project B--payback period = 3.5 years; IRR = 3 percent

                          Project C--payback period = 2 years; IRR = 3 percent

                    Funding exists for only one of the projects. Jerry recommends Project A and predicts this is the
                    project the steering committee will choose since the projects are mutually exclusive.

                    Jerry's turn to present comes up at the steering committee. Let's listen in on the action.

                    "And, on top of all the benefits I've just described, Project A provides an IRR of 8 percent, a full
                    5 percent higher than the other two projects we discussed. I recommend the committee choose
                    Project A."

                    "Thank you Jerry," Colleen says. "Good presentation." Colleen is the executive chairperson of
                    the steering committee and has the authority to break ties or make final decisions when the
                    committee can't seem to agree.

                    "However, here at Fun Days we like to have our fun sooner rather than later." Chuckles ensue
                    from the steering committee. They've all heard this before. "I do agree that an 8 percent IRR is
                    a terrific return, but the payback is just too far out into the future. There are too many risks and
                    unknowns for us to take on a project with a payback period this long. As you know, our industry
                    is directly impacted by the health of the economy. Anything can happen in five years' time. I
                    think we're much better off going with Project C. I recommend we accept Project C. Committee
                    members, do you have anything to add?"



                       Project management information system (PMIS) is listed in this process as a tool and tech-
                    nique. Notice that this is also noted as one of the enterprise environmental factors. A PMIS is
                    a set of automated tools (generally a software program) that allows you to schedule project
                    activities and resources and collect and distribute project information. As a tool and technique
                    of the Develop Project Charter process, the PMIS facilitates the creation of the project charter,

                                                     Formalizing and Publishing the Project Charter              67




             provides a way to capture feedback and changes to the charter, and publishes the finalized,
             approved charter.


             Expert Judgment
             Expert judgment is the last tool and technique in this process. The concept behind expert judg-
             ment is to rely on individuals, or groups of people, who have training, specialized knowledge,
             or skills in the areas you're assessing. These folks may be stakeholders, consultants, other
             experts in the organization, or technical or professional organizations. Expert judgment is a tool
             and technique used in other planning processes as well.
                In the case of developing a project charter, expert judgment would be helpful in assessing the
             inputs of this process, the environmental factors, and organizational assets --that is, the project
             statement of work, product descriptions, strategic plan, project selection methods, and histor-
             ical information. For example, as the project manager, you might rely on the expertise of your
             executive committee to help you understand how the proposed project gels with the strategic
             plan. Or you might rely on team members who have participated on similar projects in the past
             to make recommendations regarding the proposed project.



             Formalizing and Publishing
             the Project Charter
             The project charter is the official, written acknowledgment and recognition that a project exists.
             It ties the work of the project with the ongoing operations of the organization. It's usually issued
             by senior management and gives the project manager the authority to assign organizational
             resources to the work of the project.
                 The charter documents the business need or demand that the project was initiated to address
             and the project justification, and it includes a description of the product or service of the project.
             It is usually the first official document of the project once acceptance of the project has been
             granted. Project charters are often used as a means to introduce a project to the organization.
             Since this document outlines the high-level project description, the business opportunity or
             need, and the project's purpose, executive managers can get a "first glance" look at the benefits
             of the project. Good project charters that are well documented will address many of the ques-
             tions your stakeholders are likely to have up front.
                 Let's take a brief look at the key stakeholders who may be involved with the project charter
             and the role they'll play in its development and on the project in the future.


             Key Stakeholders
             A Guide to the PMBOK states that the project sponsor or initiator is the one who provides the infor-
             mation for the project charter. It also says a manager who is external to the project should publish
             the charter. However, A Guide to the PMBOK and common project management practices don't
3601.book Page 68 Wednesday, July 13, 2005 1:39 PM




                    68          Chapter 2         Creating the Project Charter and Preliminary Scope Statement



                    always match up. In practice, my experience has been that the project charter is published under the
                    name of the project sponsor. It also involves the input of key stakeholders. Often, the project sponsor
                    or initiator won't have all the information needed to complete the charter and you'll be charged with
                    digging out all the facts needed to create this document as well as the preliminary project scope state-
                    ment. But remember, you're studying to pass the exam, so you should know that A Guide to the
                    PMBOK states that the author of the project charter should be a manager external to the project and
                    input comes from the initiator or sponsor.

                    Project Manager
                    The project manager is the person who assumes responsibility for the success of the project. The
                    project charter identifies the project manager and describes the authority the project manager has in
                    carrying out the project. The project manager's primary responsibilities are project planning and
                    then executing and managing the work of the project. By overseeing the project charter and the
                    project planning documents created later on in the project, the project manager is assured that every-
                    one knows and understands what's expected of them and what constitutes a successful project.
                       Project managers are responsible for setting the standards and policies for the projects they
                    work on. As a project manager, it is your job to establish and communicate the project proce-
                    dures to the project team and stakeholders.
                       Project managers will identify activities and tasks, resource requirements, project costs,
                    project requirements, performance measures, and more. Communication and documentation
                    must become the project manager's best friends. Keeping stakeholders, the project sponsor, the
                    project team, and all other interested parties informed is "job one," as the famous car manu-
                    facturer's ads say.

                    Project Sponsor
                    Have you ever attended a conference or event that was put on by a sponsor? In the information
                    technology field, conferences and seminars are often sponsored by software development compa-
                    nies. The sponsor pays for the event, the facilities, and the goodies and provides an opportunity
                    for vendors to display their wares. In return, the sponsor comes out looking like a winner. Because
                    they are footing the bill for all this fun, the sponsor gets to call the shots on conference content
                    and they get the prime spots for discussing their particular solutions. And last but not least, they
                    usually provide the keynote speaker and get to present their information to a captive audience.
                       Project sponsors are similar to this in that they rally support from stakeholders and the exec-
                    utive management team for the project. The project sponsor is usually an executive in the orga-
                    nization who has the power and authority to make decisions and settle disputes or conflicts
                    regarding the project. The sponsor takes the project into the limelight, so to speak, and gets to
                    call the shots regarding project outcomes. The project sponsor is also the one with the big bucks
                    who provides funds for your project. The project sponsor should be named in the project char-
                    ter and identified as the final authority and decision maker for project issues.
                       Sponsors are actively involved in the Initiating and Planning phases of the project and tend to
                    have less involvement during the Execution and Monitoring and Controlling phases. It's up to the
                    project manager to keep the project sponsor informed of all project activities, project progress, and
                    any conflicts or issues that arise. The sponsor is the one with the authority to resolve conflicts
                    and set priorities when these things can't be dealt with any other way.

             Project Champion
             The project champion is another strong project supporter. Unlike the sponsor, the project
             champion doesn't necessarily have a lot of authority or executive powers. The champion helps
             focus attention on the project from a technical perspective. The project champion is usually
             someone with a great deal of technical expertise or industry knowledge regarding the project.
             They can lend credibility to the viability of the project and to the skills and abilities of the key
             project team members to carry out project activities. Sometimes, the project manager may act
             as project champion.
                The project champion isn't necessarily identified in the project charter. But as a project manager,
             you'll want to know who this person is because they're a strong project advocate and you might need
             them later on to help rally support for project decisions.

             Functional Managers
             We covered functional managers briefly in Chapter 1. Project managers must work with and gain
             the support of functional managers in order to complete the project. Functional managers fulfill the
             administrative duties of the organization, provide and assign staff members to projects, and con-
             duct performance reviews for their staff. It's a good idea to identify the functional managers who'll
             be working on project tasks or assigned project responsibilities in the charter.
                It's also a good idea to identify the key project stakeholders in the project charter. While this
             isn't explicitly stated as part of this process, you'll see in the next section that stakeholder influ-
             ences make up one of the components of the project charter. In order to identify stakeholder
             influences, I believe it's also necessary to identify the stakeholders and describe their role in
             high-level terms as I've done here.


             Pulling the Project Charter Together
             According to A Guide to the PMBOK, in order to create a useful and well-documented project
             charter, you should include at least these elements:
                  Purpose or justification for the project
                  Business need for the project
                  Business justification for the project, including return on investment analysis
                  High-level project description or product description
                  Requirements that must be completed satisfactorily according to stakeholder, sponsor, and
                  customer expectations
                  Stakeholder influences
                  Involvement of other departments (in the functional organization) and the level of partic-
                  ipation needed
                  Constraints
                  Assumptions

                    70          Chapter 2         Creating the Project Charter and Preliminary Scope Statement



                          Summary budget (preliminary)
                          Name of the project manager and their authority levels
                       We've already discussed some of these elements. The purpose of the project, business need,
                    and business justification were covered in earlier sections of this chapter. In the last section, we
                    talked some about stakeholders and their roles. We'll cover this topic more thoroughly in the
                    next chapter. The roles or involvement of other departments and their level of participation is
                    a matter of defining the level of involvement and the types of actions required from the other
                    departments to fulfill the purpose and requirements of the project.
                       A constraint is anything that restricts the actions of the project team. Perhaps the project
                    has a hard end date. The date cannot move due to circumstances outside of the control of
                    the project. Or perhaps the project has a set budget. Both of these things are examples
                    of constraints. Assumptions are events or actions believed to be true. Both constraints and
                    assumptions should be documented in the project charter. However, many of these elements
                    are included in the processes related to creating a scope statement and become further
                    refined as you get into the Planning process, so we'll talk more about these topics in
                    Chapter 3, "Creating the Scope Statement."
                       The important thing to remember for the exam about the project charter is that it authorizes
                    the project to begin, it authorizes the project manager to assign resources to the project, it doc-
                    uments the business need and justification, it describes the customer's requirements, and it ties
                    the project to the ongoing work of the organization.



                    Exam Spotlight

                    In some organizations, the project charter might be written by the project manager. However,
                    if you (as the project manager) are asked to write the charter, remember that your name should
                    not appear as the author of the project charter document. Since the project charter authorizes
                    the project and authorizes you as the project manager, it doesn't make sense for you to write
                    a document authorizing yourself to manage the project. The author of the charter should be an
                    executive manager in your organization (external to the project) with the power and authority
                    to assign resources to this project. Remember for the exam that the charter is authorized exter-
                    nal to the project organization.




                    Project Charter Sign-off
                    The project charter isn't complete until you've received sign-off from the project sponsor, senior
                    management, and key stakeholders. Sign-off indicates that the document has been read by those
                    signing it (let's hope so, anyway) and that they agree with its contents and are on board with
                    the project. It also involves the major stakeholders right from the beginning and hopefully wins
                    their continued participation in the project going forward. If someone has a problem with any
                    of the elements in the charter, now is the time to raise the red flag.
                       One of the things I like to do prior to publishing the charter is to hold a kick-off meeting with
                    the key stakeholders to discuss the charter and then obtain their sign-off. While A Guide to the

                                                     Developing a Preliminary Project Scope Statement                 71




             PMBOK doesn't bring stakeholders into the picture until the Planning processes, I think it's
             imperative that you identify your key stakeholders as soon as possible and involve them in the cre-
             ation of the project charter and preliminary scope statement. Remember for the exam, however,
             that the initiator or sponsor provides the input for the charter and preliminary scope statement.


                                   We'll talk more about key stakeholder roles in Chapter 3, "Developing the
                                   Project Scope Statement."

                Signing the project charter document is the equivalent of agreeing to and endorsing the
             project. This doesn't mean that the project charter is set in stone, however. Project charters will
             change throughout the course of the project. As more details are uncovered and outlined and as
             the Planning processes begin, more project issues will come to light. This is part of the iterative
             process of project management and is to be expected. The charter will occasionally be revised
             to reflect these new details, project plans will be revised, and project execution will change to
             incorporate the new information or direction.
                The last step in this process is publishing the charter. Publishing, in this case, simply means distrib-
             uting a copy of the project charter to the key stakeholders, the customer, the management team, and
             others who may be involved with the project. Publication can take several forms, including printed
             format or electronic format distributed via the company e-mail system or on the company's intranet.
                Next, I'll further describe the work of the project in a preliminary project scope statement.



             Developing a Preliminary Project
             Scope Statement
             The preliminary scope statement is the first blush, so to speak, of a definition of what the project
             entails. This preliminary document is a high-level look at the project objectives and deliverables.
             It serves the purpose of capturing the intended outcome of the project and its deliverables. It
             provides a brief background of the project and describes the business opportunity the company
             is attempting to benefit from. It also describes the business objectives the project should meet.
                 The preliminary scope statement is based on information provided by the project sponsor or
             initiator and lays the groundwork for future consensus on deliverables and project expectations
             and will be further elaborated in the Scope Definition process that we'll talk about in Chapter 3.


             Preliminary Scope Statement Inputs and Techniques
             The inputs for this process are as follows:
                  Project charter
                  Project SOW
                  Enterprise environmental factors
                  Organizational process assets

                    72          Chapter 2         Creating the Project Charter and Preliminary Scope Statement



                       We've seen all of these previously in this chapter. Remember that many times, outputs from
                    one process become inputs into the next process. That's the case here, where you'll examine the
                    project charter, meet with the project sponsor or initiator, and develop the preliminary project
                    scope statement. Before we get to what the scope statement contains, let's take a look at the
                    tools and techniques of this process. These will look familiar too.
                       The tools and techniques for the Develop Preliminary Scope Statement process include project
                    management methodology, project management information system, and expert judgment.


                    The Preliminary Scope Statement Document
                    The preliminary scope statement document contains several elements, most of which are
                    repeated in the final scope statement created during the Planning process group. Creating a pre-
                    liminary scope statement is a good thing for very large projects or projects with multiple phases.
                    On large projects, each phase has its own preliminary scope statement document that can be
                    reexamined, revised, and elaborated as the new phase begins. Small- to medium-sized projects
                    probably will not need a preliminary scope statement. You could skip straight to the Planning
                    processes from here, but I urge you, don't turn the page. You do need to know about this pro-
                    cess for the exam even if you'll only use it a few times in the course of your project work. And
                    remember, it's up to the project manager (that's you) to determine which processes should be
                    completed for the project. My guess is the majority of the time you'll skip this one.



                    Exam Spotlight

                    For the exam, understand the purpose of the preliminary scope document, which is to describe
                    the characteristics of the product of the project, what is and what is not included in project
                    scope (A Guide to the PMBOK calls this "boundaries"), how the final product or service of the
                    project will be accepted, and how scope will be controlled.



                       According to A Guide to the PMBOK, the preliminary scope statement should contain
                    these elements:
                          Project objectives
                          Characteristics of the product or service of the project (i.e., a product description)
                          Product objectives
                          Project deliverables
                          Requirements (both product and project)
                          Exclusions from scope (project boundaries)
                          Constraints
                          Assumptions

                 I know you're dying to know more about some of these elements! I don't mean to keep you
             in suspense, but it makes a lot more sense to cover these elements when we talk about the scope
             statement in Chapter 3. You will always create a scope statement for your project, no matter
             how large or small. (You do this, right?) Besides, we've covered a lot of material in these first
             two chapters and you probably need a little breather to absorb what you've learned. Kick back,
             run through the end-of-chapter questions, and then you'll be ready to jump into these topics.



             The Kitchen Heaven Project Case Study
             This chapter introduces a case study that we'll follow throughout the remainder of the book.
             You'll find an updated case study closing out every chapter. They're designed to show you how
             a project manager might apply the material covered in the chapter to a real-life project. As hap-
             pens in real life, not every detail of every process is followed during all projects. Remember that
             the processes from A Guide to the PMBOK that we'll cover in the remaining chapters are
             project management guidelines. You will often combine processes during your projects, which
             allows you to perform several steps at once. The case studies will present situations or processes
             that you might find during your projects and describe how one project manager resolves them.



             Project Case Study: New Kitchen Heaven Retail Store

             You are a project manager for Kitchen Heaven, a chain of retail stores specializing in kitchen
             utensils, cookware, dishes, small appliances, and some gourmet food stuffs such as bottled
             sauces and spices. You're fairly new to the position, having been hired to replace a PM who
             recently retired.

             Kitchen Heaven currently owns 49 stores in 34 states and Canada. The world headquarters
             for Kitchen Heaven is in Denver, Colorado. Counting full-time and part-time employees, the
             company employs 1,500 people, 200 of whom work in the headquarters office.

             The company's mission statement reads: "Great gadgets for people interested in great food."

             Recently, the vice president of marketing came to pay you a visit. Dirk Perrier is a very nice man,
             well dressed, with the formal air that you would expect a person in his capacity might have. He
             shakes your hand and gives you a broad, friendly smile.

                    74          Chapter 2         Creating the Project Charter and Preliminary Scope Statement




                    "We've decided to go forward with our 50th store opening! Sales are up, and our new line of
                    ceramic cookware is a hot seller, no pun intended. I don't know if you're familiar with our store phi-
                    losophy, so let me take a moment to explain it. We like to place our stores in neighborhoods that
                    are somewhat affluent. The plain fact is that most of our shoppers have incomes of over $150,000
                    a year. So, we make an effort to place our stores in areas where those folks normally shop.

                    "We're interested in targeting the non-gourmet customer, one who's interested in cooking but
                    won't be making Peking duck. So, the stores are upbeat and convey a little bit of a laid-back feel,
                    if you will.

                    "Our next store is going to be right here in our home area--Colorado Springs. We have a store
                    in Boulder and one in Denver, but none down south. Because this is going to be our 50th store,
                    we plan on having a 50th grand-opening celebration, with the kind of surprises and activities
                    you might expect for such a notable opening.

                    "Our stores generally occupy from 2,000 to 4,000 square feet of retail space, and we typically use
                    local contractors for the build-out. A store build-out usually takes 120 days from the date the
                    property has been procured until the doors open to the public. I can give you our last opening's
                    project plan so you have a feel for what happens. Your job will be to procure the property, nego-
                    tiate the lease, procure the shelving and associated store furnishings, get a contractor on the job,
                    and prepare the 50th store festivities. My marketing folks will assist you with that last part.

                    "You have six months to complete the project. Any questions?"

                    You take in a deep breath and collect your thoughts. Dirk has just given you a lot of information
                    with hardly a pause in between thoughts. A few initial ideas drift through your head while
                    you're reaching for your notebook.

                    You work in a functional organization with a separate projectized department responsible for
                    carrying out projects of this nature. You've been with the company long enough to know that
                    Dirk is high up there in the executive ranks and carries the authority and the power to make
                    things happen. Therefore, Dirk is the perfect candidate for project sponsor.

                    You grab your notebook and start documenting some of the things Dirk talked about, clarifying
                    with him as you write:

                          The project objective is to open a new store in Colorado Springs six months from today.

                          The store should be located in an affluent area.

                          The store will carry the full line of products from utensils to gourmet food items.

                          The grand opening will be accompanied by lots of fanfare because this is the 50th
                          store opening.

                                                             The Kitchen Heaven Project Case Study                  75




             You have a question or two for Dirk.

             "Is there a special reason we have to open...let's see...six months from now is February 1st?"

             "Yes, we want the store open the first week in February. Early February is when the Garden and
             Home Show conference hits the Springs area. We'll have a trade show booth there. We know
             from experience in other areas that our stores generally see a surge in sales during this month
             as a result of the trade show. It's a great way to get a lot of advertising out there and let folks
             know where we're located."

             "Another question, Dirk. Is there a budget set for this project yet?"

             "We haven't set a hard figure," Dirk replies. "But again, from past experience we know it takes
             anywhere from $1.5 to $2 million to open a new store. And we don't want to forget the big bash
             for the grand opening."

             "Thanks, Dirk. I'll get started writing the project charter right away. I'll be putting your name on
             the document since you're the project sponsor."

             Dirk concludes with, "Feel free to come to me with questions or concerns at any time."

             One week later.

             You review your notes and reread the project charter you've prepared for the Kitchen Heaven
             retail store one last time before looking for Dirk. You finally run across Dirk in a hallway near
             the executive washroom.

             "Dirk, I'm glad I caught you. I'd like to go over the project charter with you before the kickoff
             meeting tomorrow. Do you have a few minutes?"

             "Sure," Dirk says to you. "Let's have it."

             "The project charter states the purpose of the project, which of course is to open the 50th
             Kitchen Heaven store in Colorado Springs. I also documented some of the high-level require-
             ments, many of which we talked about last time we met. I documented the assumptions and
             constraints you gave me with the understanding that we'll define these much more closely
             when I create the scope statement. I've included a section that outlines a preliminary milestone
             schedule and I've included some preliminary return on investment calculations. Using your
             estimate of $2 million as our initial budget request and based on the projected inflows you gave
             me last week, I've calculated a payback period of 16 months, with an IRR of 22 percent."

             "That's impressive," replies Dirk. "Even better than our Phoenix store. If I recall, the payback
             period there was just over two years. Let's hope those numbers hold true."

                    "I think they're reliable figures. I researched our data based on recent store openings in similar-
                    sized cities and factored in the economic conditions of the Colorado Springs area. Since they're
                    on a growth pattern, we think the timing is perfect."

                    "As you know, the project kickoff is scheduled for tomorrow. What I'll need then is for you to
                    talk about the project and the goals, talk about the commitment you'll need from the manage-
                    ment team to support this project, and introduce me as the project manager. I've already for-
                    warded a copy of the project charter to the meeting attendees so that they can review it before
                    the meeting. And I included a list of the assumptions we've made so far as an appendix to the
                    charter. Lastly, I'll need you to ask everyone present to sign a copy of the project charter."

                    "Sounds like you've covered everything," Dirk says. "I don't anticipate any problems tomor-
                    row, as everyone is looking forward to this store opening."

                     Project Case Study Checklist
                            Project objective: To open a new store in Colorado Springs six months from today.

                            Business need or demand for project: Company data concludes that the Kitchen Heaven
                            consumers have incomes of over $150,000 a year. The Colorado Springs area is home to
                            a large number of people with that income. Currently, there is not a Kitchen Heaven there,
                            but there appears to be a demand for one.

                            Project sponsor: Dirk Perrier, VP of marketing.

                            Organizational structure: Functional organization with a separate projectized department.

                            Project selection methods: Payback period calculated at 16 months and IRR calculated at
                            22 percent.

             Summary
             This chapter started with a discussion of how projects are initiated. Projects come about as a
             result of one of six needs or demands: market demand, business need, customer requests, tech-
             nological advances, legal requirements, and social needs.
                 Then we talked about the Develop the Project Charter process. The project statement of
             work is an input to this process that describes the product or service the project was undertaken
             to complete. The SOW should include the business needs of the organization and a product
             scope description and should map to the organization's strategic plan.
                 Enterprise environmental factors are factors outside of the project that may have significant
             influence on the success of the project. Organizational process assets refer to policies, guide-
             lines, and procedures for conducting the project work.
                 Project selection methods are a tool and technique of the Develop Project Charter process.
             Selection methods include decision models in the form of benefit measurement methods and
             mathematical models (also called constrained optimization methods). The mathematical meth-
             ods utilize mathematical models. Benefit measurement methods come in the form of cost-benefit
             analyses, scoring models, and economic analyses. These are primarily comparative approaches.
             Besides cost-benefit analysis, the most commonly used form of benefit measurement methods is
             cash flow analysis.
                 Analysis of cash flows includes payback period, discounted cash flows, net present value
             (NPV), and internal rate of return (IRR). These last three methods are concerned with the time
             value of money--or in other words, converting future dollars into today's value. Generally,
             projects with a shorter payback period are desired over those with longer payback periods.
             Projects that have an NPV greater than zero should be accepted. Projects with the highest IRR
             value are considered a better benefit to the organization than projects with low IRR values.
                 Expert judgment is another tool and technique of this process. Experts usually have spe-
             cialized knowledge or skills and can include staff from other departments in the company,
             external or internal consultants, and members of professional and technical associations or
             industry groups.
                 The output of this process is the project charter, which is the formal recognition that a
             project, or the next project phase, should begin. The charter authorizes the project to begin,
             it authorizes the project manager to assign resources to the project, it documents the business
             need and justification, it describes the customer's requirements, and it ties the project to the
             ongoing work of the organization.
                 The preliminary project scope statement is a high-level definition of what the project
             entails, including the project objectives and deliverables. It describes the business opportunity
             the company is attempting to benefit from and the business objectives the project intends to
             meet. Many of the elements included in the preliminary scope statement are also part of the
             project scope statement.

                    Exam Essentials
                    Be able to distinguish between the six needs or demands that bring about project creation.
                    The six needs or demands that bring about project creation are market demand, business need,
                    customer requests, technological advances, legal requirements, and social needs.
                    Be able to denote the Develop the Project Charter inputs. The inputs for Develop the Project
                    Charter are contract (where applicable), project statement of work, enterprise environmental
                    factors, and organizational process assets.
                    Be able to define decision models. Decision models are project selection methods that are a
                    tool and technique of the Develop Project Charter process. Decision models include benefit
                    measurement methods and mathematical models.
                    Be able to describe and calculate payback period. Payback period is the amount of time it
                    will take the company to recoup its initial investment in the product of the project. It's calcu-
                    lated by adding up the expected cash inflows and comparing them to the initial investment to
                    determine how many periods it takes for the cash inflows to equal the initial investment.
                    Be able to denote the decision criteria for NPV and IRR. Projects with an NPV greater than
                    zero should be accepted, and those with an NPV less than zero should be rejected. Projects with
                    high IRR values should be accepted over projects with lower IRR values. IRR is the discount
                    rate when NPV is equal to zero, and IRR assumes reinvestment at the IRR rate.
                    Be able to describe the importance of the project charter. The project charter is the docu-
                    ment that officially recognizes and acknowledges that a project exists. The charter authorizes
                    the project to begin, it authorizes the project manager to assign resources to the project, it doc-
                    uments the business need and justification, it describes the customer's requirements, and it ties
                    the project to the ongoing work of the organization.

                    Review Questions
                    1.    When a project is being performed under contract, the SOW is provided by which of the following?
                          A. The buyer
                          B. The project sponsor
                          C. The project manager
                          D. The contractor

                    2.    You've been hired as a manager for the Adjustments Department of a nationwide bank
                          based in your city. The Adjustments Department is responsible for making corrections to
                          customer accounts. This is a large department, with several smaller sections that deal with
                          specific accounts; for example, personal checking or commercial checking. You've received
                          your first set of management reports and can't make heads or tails of the information. Each
                          section appears to use a different methodology to audit their work and record the data for
                          the management report. You request a project manager from the PMO to come down and
                          get started right away on a project to streamline this process and make the data and reports
                          consistent. This project came about as a result of which of the following?
                          A. Technological advance
                          B. Business need
                          C. Customer request
                          D. Legal requirement

                    3.    What are the inputs to the Develop Project Charter process?
                          A. Contract, project SOW, enterprise environmental factors, organizational process assets
                          B. Project SOW, project selection methods, organizational process assets
                          C. Contract, project selection methods, enterprise environmental factors, organizational pro-
                             cess assets
                          D. Project SOW, project selection methods, enterprise environmental factors

                    4.    You work for a large manufacturing plant. Your firm is thinking of initiating a new project to
                          release an overseas product line. This is the company's first experience in the overseas market,
                          and it hopes to make a big splash with the introduction of this product. The project entails pro-
                          ducing your product in a concentrated formula and packaging it in smaller containers than the
                          U.S. product uses. A new machine is needed in order to mix the first set of ingredients in the con-
                          centrated formula. Which of the following actions should the project manager take?
                          A. The project manager should document the project's objectives and business justification in
                             a project charter document and recommend that the project proceed.
                          B. The project manager knows the project is a go and should document the project's objectives
                             and known deliverables in a preliminary scope statement document.
                          C. The project manager should document the business need for the project and recommend that
                             a feasibility study be performed to determine viability of the project.
                          D. The project manager should document the high-level product requirements and stakeholder
                             expectations in a preliminary scope statement.

                  D. The organization's PMIS system

             8.   Which of the following is true regarding product scope descriptions?
                  A. The product scope description is a component of the output of the Develop Project Charter
                     process. It describes the characteristics of the product or service and contains a good deal of
                     detail in the later phases of the project.
                  B. The product description is a component of the output of the Preliminary Scope Statement
                     process. It describes the characteristics of the product or service and contains less detail in
                     the early phases of the project.
                  C. The product description is a component of an input of the Preliminary Scope Statement pro-
                     cess. It describes the characteristics of the product or service and contains a good deal of
                     detail in the early phases of the project.
                  D. The product description is a component of an input of the Develop Project Charter process.
                     It describes the characteristics of the product or service and contains less detail in the early
                     phases of the project.

                    10. You are the project manager for the Late Night Smooth Jazz Club chain, with stores in 12 states.
                        Smooth Jazz is considering opening a new club in Arizona or Nevada. You have derived the fol-
                        lowing information:
                             Project Arizona: Payback period is 18 months, and the NPV is <250>.
                             Project Nevada: Payback period is 24 months, and the NPV is 300.

                          Which project would you recommend to the selection committee?
                          A. Project Arizona, because the payback period is shorter than the payback period for
                             Project Nevada.
                          B. Project Nevada, because its NPV is a positive number.
                          C. Project Arizona because its NPV is a negative number.
                          D. Project Nevada, because its NPV is a higher number than Project Arizona's NPV.

                    11. You are the project manager for the Late Night Smooth Jazz Club chain, with stores in 12 states.
                        Smooth Jazz is considering opening a new club in Kansas City or Spokane. You have derived the
                        following information:
                             Project Kansas City: The payback period is 27 months, and the IRR is 35 percent.
                             Project Spokane: The payback period is 25 months, and the IRR is 32 percent.

                          Which project should you recommend to the selection committee?
                          A. Project Spokane, because the payback period is shortest.
                          B. Project Kansas City, because the IRR is highest.
                          C. Project Spokane, because the IRR is lowest.
                          D. Project Kansas City, because the payback period is longest.

                    12. Which of the following is true regarding NPV?
                          A. NPV assumes reinvestment at the cost of capital.
                          B. NPV decisions should be made based on the highest value for all of the selections.
                          C. NPV assumes reinvestment at the prevailing rate.
                          D. NPV assumes reinvestment at the NPV rate.

                  D. A form of historical information

             16. Your project selection committee used a weighted scoring model and found that Project B,
                 with a score of 54, should be chosen over the other competing projects. Which of the following
                 is true?
                  A. Weighted scoring models are benefit measurement methods, which are used as a tool and
                     technique during the Develop Project Charter process.
                  B. Weighted scoring models are constrained optimization methods, which are used as a tool
                     and technique in both Initiating process group processes.
                  C. Weighted scoring models are benefit measurement methods and are the least efficient
                     method of project selection.
                  D. Weighted scoring models are a type of mathematical model that can be used both for project
                     selection and vendor selection.

             17. Your selection committee is debating between two projects. Project A has a payback period of
                 18 months. Project B has a cost of $125,000, with expected cash inflows of $50,000 the first
                 year and $25,000 per quarter after that. Which project should you recommend?
                  A. Either Project A or Project B, because the payback periods are equal.
                  B. Project A, because Project B's payback period is 21 months.
                  C. Project A, because Project B's payback period is 24 months.
                  D. Project A, because Project B's payback period is 20 months.

                    18. Which of the following is true?
                          A. Discounted cash flow analysis is the least precise of the cash flow techniques, because it does
                             not consider the time value of money.
                          B. NPV is the least precise of the cash flow analysis techniques, because it assumes reinvestment
                             at the discount rate.
                          C. Payback period is the least precise of the cash flow analysis techniques, because it does not
                             consider the time value of money.
                          D. IRR is the least precise of the cash flow analysis techniques, because it assumes reinvestment
                             at the cost of capital.

                    19. You are a project manager for Zippy Tees. Your selection committee has just chosen a project
                        you recommended for implementation. Your project is to manufacture a line of miniature
                        stuffed bears that will be attached to your company's trendy T-shirts. The bears will be wearing
                        the same T-shirt design as the shirt they're attached to. Your project sponsor thinks you've really
                        impressed the big boss and wants you to skip to the manufacturing process right away. What is
                        your response?
                          A. Agree with the project sponsor because they are your boss, and they have a lot of authority
                             and power in the company.
                          B. Require that a preliminary budget be established and a resource list be put together to alert
                             other managers of the requirements of this project. This should be published and signed by
                             the other managers who are impacted by this project.
                          C. Require a project charter be written and signed off on by all stakeholders before proceeding.
                          D. Suggest that a preliminary scope statement be written as this will outline the objectives of the
                             project and greatly assist in the development of the scope statement in the Planning processes

                    20. Which of the following is true regarding the project charter?
                          A. The project charter should be published under the name of a manager external to the project.
                          B. The project charter should be published under the project sponsor's name.
                          C. The project charter should be published under the name of the project manager.
                          D. The project charter should be published under the name of the project champion.

                                                                          Answers to Review Questions               85




             Answers to Review Questions
             1.   A. The buyer provides SOW when projects are performed under contract.

             2.   B. This came about due to a business need. Staff members were spending unproductive hours
                  producing information for the management report that wasn't consistent or meaningful.

             3.   A. Develop Project Charter has four inputs and they are contract, project SOW, enterprise envi-
                  ronmental factors, and organizational process assets.

             4.   C. The most correct answer is to perform a feasibility study. Since this project is taking the com-
                  pany into a new, unknown market, there's lots of potential for error and failure. A feasibility
                  study would help the stakeholders determine if the project is viable and cost effective and
                  whether it has a high potential for success.

             5.   C. The Develop Project Charter and Preliminary Scope Statement processes both have the follow-
                  ing as inputs: project SOW, enterprise environment factors, and organizational process assets.
                  Both processes share the following tools and techniques: project management methodology,
                  PMIS, and expert judgment.

             6.   B. The project SOW should contain the business need for the project and the product scope
                  description and should support the organization's strategic plan.

             7.   B. Historical information on projects of a similar nature can be very helpful when initiating new
                  projects. They can help in formulating project deliverables and identifying constraints and assump-
                  tions and will be helpful further on in the project Planning processes as well.

             8.   D. The product description is a component of the project SOW, which is an input of both the
                  Develop Project Charter and Preliminary Scope Statement processes. It describes the character-
                  istics of the product or service and contains less detail in the early phases of the project and more
                  detail as the project progresses.

             9.   A. Benefit measurement methods include comparative methods, scoring models, and cash flow
                  analysis, which are all part of the project selection method tools and techniques in the Develop
                  Project Charter process.

             10. B. Projects with NPV greater than zero should be given an accept recommendation.

             11. B. Projects with the highest IRR value are favored over projects with lower IRR values.

             12. A. Net present value (NPV) assumes reinvestment is made at the cost of capital.

             13. C. Year 1 and 2 inflows are each $100,000 for a total of $200,000. Year 3 inflows are an addi-
                 tional $300,000. Add one more quarter to this total and the $575,000 is reached in three years
                 and three months, or 39 months.

             14. D. IRR assumes reinvestment at the IRR rate and is the discount rate when NPV is equal to zero.

             15. C. Mathematical models are one of the methods described in the project selection methods tool
                 and technique of the Develop Project Charter process.

                    86          Chapter 2         Creating the Project Charter and Preliminary Scope Statement



                    16. A. Benefit measurement methods include comparative methods and scoring models, among others,
                        to make project selections during the Develop Project Charter process.

                    17. B. Project B has a payback period of 21 months. $50,000 is received in the first 12 months, with
                        another $75,000 coming in over each of the next three quarters, or nine months.

                    18. C. Payback period does not consider the time value of money and is therefore the least precise
                        of all the cash flow analysis techniques.

                    19. C. The project should be kicked off with a project charter that authorizes the project to begin,
                        assigns the project manager, and describes the project objectives and business need for the
                        project. This ensures that everyone is working with the same purposes in mind.

                    20. A. According to A Guide to the PMBOK, the project charter should be published by a manager
                        external to the project but with sufficient power and authority to carry it off.

                                                   Great job! You've successfully completed the project Initiating
                                                   processes and published the project charter and the preliminary
                                                   scope statement. The project is officially under way. Stakeholders
                    have been informed, there is management buy-in on the project, the project manager has been
                    assigned, and the project objectives and description have been identified. A solid foundation for
                    the Planning process is in place.
                       In this chapter, we will begin the Planning processes for the project. In fact, we will continue
                    discussing the Planning processes through Chapter 7, "Creating the Project Schedule and Bud-
                    get." Planning is a significant activity in any project and, if done correctly, will go a long way
                    toward ensuring project success.
                       This chapter begins with the Develop Project Management Plan process. This process will
                    describe the overall approach you'll use to manage the project. The result of this process is the
                    project management plan document that describes how you'll execute and monitor and control
                    the project outcomes as the project progresses and how to close out the project once it concludes.
                       Then we'll move on to the Scope Planning process. You'll use the project charter and pre-
                    liminary scope statement you created in the last chapter--plus some other inputs--and then
                    apply the tools and techniques of this process to come up with the project scope management
                    plan. From there, you're off to the Scope Definition process, where you'll further elaborate the
                    project objectives and deliverables. We'll talk in depth about project objectives, requirements,
                    constraints, assumptions, and other elements of writing the project scope statement, which is an
                    output of this process.



                    Developing the Project Management Plan
                    The first process in the Planning process group is the Develop Project Management Plan pro-
                    cess. It's first for good reason. This process is a part of the Integration Management knowledge
                    area and is concerned with defining, coordinating, and integrating all the various ancillary
                    project plans. Remember when we talked about tailoring in Chapter 1?
                       This process involves defining and documenting the processes you're going to use to manage
                    this project. For example, let's say you and the project team have determined you will use
                    project management processes involving costs, human resources, risks, and a project schedule.
                    (Warning: This is a demonstration only--don't try this at home. In reality, professionals per-
                    form many more processes than this on a typical project.) Each particular process may have a
                    management plan that describes it. For instance, a cost management plan would describe how
                    costs will be managed and controlled and how changes to costs will be approved and managed

                                                             Developing the Project Management Plan               89




             throughout the project. The Develop Project Management Plan process brings all these subsid-
             iary plans together, along with the outputs of the Planning group processes, into one document
             called the project management plan.
                In order to create and document the plan, we need to gather some inputs and build on the
             information we've already collected.


             Developing Inputs
             There are four inputs into the Develop Project Management Plan:
                  Preliminary scope statement
                  Project management processes
                  Enterprise environmental factors
                  Organizational process assets
                Organizational process assets here are the same ones we considered when developing the
             project charter in Chapter 2, "Creating the Project Charter and Preliminary Scope Statement."
             There are some important elements to note in the remaining inputs, so let's take a look.
             Preliminary scope statement You'll recall that the preliminary scope statement describes the
             objectives of the project and the high-level requirements needed to satisfy stakeholder expecta-
             tions. The reason it's an input into this process is because the content of the preliminary scope
             statement--including objectives, product requirements, schedule milestones, and so on--will help
             you and the team determine exactly which project management processes to use on the project.


                                   Remember, you're studying for the exam, so the correct input into this process
                                   is the preliminary scope statement. However, if you've skipped that process and
                                   only performed the project charter, you could use it as an input to this process.


             Project management processes The project management processes include all of the individ-
             ual processes that make up the process groups we're talking about throughout this book. The
             Initiating group, for example, has two processes, Planning has a zillion (okay, not that many but
             it seems like it), and so on. Each of the processes you determine to use on the project will be doc-
             umented in the project management plan.
             Enterprise environmental factors We've seen enterprise environmental factors before. Some
             of the key elements of the environmental factors you should consider when choosing the pro-
             cesses to perform for this project include standards and regulations (both industry and govern-
             mental), company culture, skills and knowledge of existing personnel, risk tolerances of
             stakeholders, and the project management information system (PMIS).
                As we talked about in Chapter 1, the processes you choose to perform for the project will be
             based on the complexity of the project, the project scope, and the type of industry you work in.
             Your organization's standards, guidelines, and policies (a component of organizational process

                    assets) or the project management office (PMO) may also dictate the types of processes you'll
                    use for the project. You should also consider if your organization has existing change control
                    processes in place, templates that you're required to use, or financial controls and processes.
                    Don't forget to look for historical information and then use it to help you decide which pro-
                    cesses to use for this project.
                       The tools and techniques for this process are also familiar. They include project management
                    methodology, expert judgment, and PMIS. We covered expert judgment and project manage-
                    ment methodology in Chapter 2, if you need a refresher.



                    Exam Spotlight

                    Be aware that A Guide to the PMBOK lists the PMIS as a tool and technique of some processes
                    and as an input (it's part of the enterprise environmental factors) of others. The PMIS in the
                    Develop Project Management Plan process includes a subsystem called the configuration man-
                    agement system (we'll cover this in Chapter 9, "Measuring and Controlling Project Perfor-
                    mance") and the change control system, which is a subsystem of the configuration
                    management system.



                       The PMIS in this case is an automated system used to document the subsidiary plans and the
                    project management plan, facilitate the feedback process, and revise the documents. It incorporates
                    the configuration management system and the change control system, both of which we'll cover in
                    Chapter 9. Later in the project, the PMIS can be used to control changes to any of the plans. When
                    you're thinking about the PMIS as an input (that is, as part of the enterprise environmental factors),
                    think of it as a collection and distribution point for information as well as an easy way to revise and
                    update documents. When you're thinking about the PMIS as a tool and technique, think of it just
                    that way--as a tool to facilitate the automation of data collection and distribution and to automate
                    and monitor processes like scheduling, resource leveling, budgeting, and web interfaces.


                    Documenting the Project Management Plan
                    The purpose of most every process is of course, to get to the output. Outputs are usually a report
                    or document of some type or a deliverable. In this case, we end up with a document--the project
                    management plan--that describes, integrates, and coordinates subsidiary plans for the pro-
                    cesses you've determined to use for the project. The project management plan can be detailed
                    or a high-level summary based on the needs of the project.
                        According to A Guide to the PMBOK, the project management plan defines how the project
                    is executed, how it's monitored and controlled, and how it's closed. It also documents the out-
                    puts of the Planning group processes, which we'll cover over the next several chapters. The
                    project management plan should include or discuss the following elements:
                          Processes you'll use to perform the project
                          Degrees of execution of each of the processes selected for the project

                  Tools and techniques to use from each process
                  Essential inputs and outputs from each of the processes and how they'll be used to manage

                 In addition to the elements just listed, the subsidiary plans that are associated with the pro-
             cesses you'll be using for this project should be documented in the project management plan.
             Each of these subsidiary management plans may contain the same elements as the overall
             project management plan does only it's specifically related to the topic at hand. For example,
             the cost management plan should define how changes to cost estimates will be reflected in the
             project budget and how changes or variances with a significant impact should be communicated
             to the project sponsor and stakeholders. The schedule management plan describes how changes to
             the schedule will be managed, and so on.
                 The subsidiary plans may be detailed or simply a synopsis, depending on the needs of the
             project. I've listed the subsidiary plans along with a brief description. We will cover each of
             these plans in more detail throughout the remainder of this book. According to A Guide to the
             PMBOK, the subsidiary plans are as follows:
             Project scope management plan Describes the process for determining project scope, facili-
             tates creating the work breakdown structure (WBS), describes how the product or service of the
             project is verified and accepted, and documents how changes to scope will be handled.
             Schedule management plan Describes how the project schedule will be developed and con-
             trolled and how changes will be incorporated into the project schedule.
             Cost management plan Describes how costs will be managed and controlled and how changes
             to costs will be approved and managed.
             Quality management plan Describes how the organization's quality policy will be imple-
             mented. It must address and describe quality control procedures and measures, quality assur-
             ance procedures and measures, and continuous process improvement.
             Process improvement plan Describes how processes will be analyzed for the value they bring
             to the performance of project management. This analysis focuses on excluding or eliminating
             inefficiencies and waste.
             Staffing management plan Describes how human resource requirements for the project will be
             met, including how staff acquisition will occur and the time frames in which resources are needed.

                    92          Chapter 3         Developing the Project Scope Statement



                    Communications management plan Describes the communication needs of the stakeholders,
                    including timing, frequency, and methods of communications.
                    Risk management plan Describes how risks will be managed and controlled during the
                    project. This should include risk management methodology, roles and responsibilities, defini-
                    tions of probability and impact, when project management will be performed, and the catego-
                    ries of risk, risk tolerances, and reporting and tracking formats.
                    Procurement management plan Describes how the procurement processes will be managed
                    throughout the project. This may include elements such as type of contract, procurement doc-
                    uments, lead times for purchases.
                       The project management plan is not limited to the subsidiary plans listed here. You may
                    include other plans and documentation that help describe how the project will be executed or
                    monitored and controlled. Perhaps you're working on a project that requires precise calcula-
                    tions and exact adherence to requirements. You could include a plan that describes these cal-
                    culations, how they'll be monitored and measured, and the processes you'll use to make changes
                    or corrections.
                       There's one more piece to this output. There are components of each of the processes asso-
                    ciated with the subsidiary plans that should be considered when developing the plans. The com-
                    ponents that A Guide to the PMBOK recommends you consider are as follows:
                          Milestone list
                          Resource calendar
                          Schedule baseline
                          Cost baseline
                          Quality baseline
                          Risk register
                         We'll talk about each of these in the remaining chapters as well.


                                          Be aware that I'm about to get on my soapbox. If you don't want to indulge me,
                                          skip the next few sentences and go to the next paragraph. I find it a little discon-
                                          certing that the 2004 version of A Guide to the PMBOK presents information that
                                          the reader has no knowledge of way in advance of learning the process. It's
                                          almost as if you need to be well versed in all the processes before you read the
                                          book! You're going to see several places throughout the remainder of this book
                                          where topics are introduced, as in the previous list, that you don't know anything
                                          about yet. Rest assured we will cover these topics in their proper place. If I began
                                          to tell you now about the risk management plan and risk register, for example, I'd
                                          first have to explain what risks are, the processes involved, and how the risk reg-
                                          ister is produced. I think it will make much more sense for you to see these ele-
                                          ments in the processes they're produced in. Thanks...I feel better now.

                                                                              Scoping Out the Project             93




             Exam Spotlight

             Understand that the purpose of the project management plan is to define how the project is
             executed, monitored and controlled, and closed, and to document the outputs of the Planning
             group processes you'll use during the project.



                As the project progresses and more and more processes are performed, there may be changes
             to the subsidiary plans and to the project management plan itself. These changes should be
             reviewed and the project management plan should be updated to reflect the approved changes.
             Depending on the nature of the changes, the project manager, stakeholders, or sponsor (or some
             combination) should review and approve the changes.



             Exam Spotlight

             In practice, you'll find that you'll prepare the project management plan after you've progressed
             through several of the other Planning processes. It's difficult to create some of these subsidiary
             plans without performing the process they're associated with first. However, for the exam,
             remember that Develop Project Management Plan is the first process in the Planning group and
             it should be performed first.




             Scoping Out the Project
             Scope Planning is the first process in the Project Scope Management knowledge area and the
             second process in the Planning process group. You may recall from Chapter 1 that the purpose
             of the Project Scope Management knowledge area is to describe and control what is and what
             is not work of the project. Scope is collectively the product or service of the project and the
             results the project intends to produce.
                 The primary purpose of Scope Planning is to document the scope management plan. This is
             a planning tool that documents how the project team will go about defining project scope, how
             the work breakdown structure will be developed, how changes to scope will be controlled, and
             how project scope will be verified.


                                   We'll talk more about this in the section "Documenting the Scope Management
                                   Plan" later in this chapter.

               For now let's concentrate on the inputs to this process, which will help you get started doc-
             umenting the decisions about the Scope Planning process for your project.

                    94          Chapter 3         Developing the Project Scope Statement




                    Scope Planning Inputs
                    I'm beginning to sound like a broken record...we've seen the inputs to the Scope Planning pro-
                    cess before. They are as follows:
                          Enterprise environmental factors
                          Organizational process assets
                          Project charter
                          Preliminary project scope statement
                          Project management plan
                       Even though we've talked about these before, there are some specific elements of some of these
                    inputs we'll want to look at closely. Defining project scope and managing to that scope as you
                    progress through the project has a direct relationship to the success of the project. It's difficult to doc-
                    ument how you'll define project scope if you don't first understand the purpose behind the project,
                    the product or service you're trying to produce, and the environmental factors and organizational
                    process assets you're working under. The process of how you'll go about defining and managing
                    scope is what the scope management plan (which is what we're ultimately getting to with this pro-
                    cess) is about.
                       One of the environmental factors that may influence the way scope is managed is the human
                    resources involved on the project. Their skills, knowledge, and ability to communicate and esca-
                    late issues appropriately may influence the way project scope is managed. Personnel policies
                    governing those resources may also have an effect. For example, you may have a team member
                    who has a close relationship with one of the stakeholders. Let's say the stakeholder wants a
                    change to the project. The stakeholder and team member grab a cup of coffee together at the
                    corner deli and the next thing you know, the team member is incorporating the change into the
                    project. Scope can't be managed efficiently when it's being changed without the knowledge of
                    the project manager or project team.
                       Other environmental factors that may affect scope management are the organization's cul-
                    ture, economic conditions, and physical and technological infrastructure.
                       Organizational process assets typically include things like policies and procedures, whether
                    formal or informal. Your organization's policies or the policies and guidelines of your industry
                    may have an effect on scope management, so make certain you're familiar with them. And don't
                    forget historical information. You can review the scope management plan from previous
                    projects of similar size and scope to help you craft the one for this project.
                       The project charter and preliminary scope statement describe the purpose and high-level
                    requirements of the project. Analyzing the information in these documents will help you deter-
                    mine the appropriate tools and methodologies to use (as well as which processes to perform) for
                    the project. The idea here is that you want to understand the size and complexity of the project
                    so that you don't spend more time documenting how you're going to go about defining and
                    managing scope than what's needed.

             Scope Planning Tools and Techniques
             There are two tools and techniques in Scope Planning:
             Expert judgment You'll rely on the expert judgment of people or groups with specific skills,
             knowledge, or training to help assess the process inputs. One expert you can count on in this
             process is the executive manager who wrote or contributed to the project charter. They can clar-
             ify questions you may have about the project objectives as well as the product description.
             Stakeholders or other project managers with previous experience on projects similar to yours
             can help you determine how scope management should work for this project.
             Templates, forms, and standards Your PMO may have scope management templates, forms,
             and standards that you can use to help define the scope management plan. Work breakdown
             structure templates and scope change control forms may also help because they outline how to
             break down work of the project and what elements are needed to describe changes.


             Documenting the Scope Management Plan
             The only output of the Scope Planning process is the project scope management plan. This plan
             describes how the project team will go about defining project scope, verifying the work of the
             project, and managing and controlling scope. According to A Guide to the PMBOK, the project
             scope management plan should contain the following:
                  The process you'll use to prepare the project scope statement. The project scope statement
                  (which we'll define later in this chapter) contains a detailed description of what the deliv-
                  erables and requirements of the project are and is based on the information contained in the
                  preliminary scope.
                  A process for creating the work breakdown structure (WBS). The WBS (we'll cover that in
                  the next chapter) further defines the work of the project (as defined in the project scope
                  statement) by breaking down the deliverables into requirements.
                  A definition of how the deliverables will be verified for accuracy and the process used for
                  accepting deliverables.
                  A description of the process for controlling scope change requests, including the procedure
                  for requesting changes and how to obtain a change request form.



             Exam Spotlight

             The project scope management plan is a planning tool that documents how the project team
             will go about defining project scope, how the work breakdown structure will be developed,
             how changes to scope will be controlled, and how the work of the project will be verified and
             accepted. And don't forget, the scope management plan is a component of (or a subsidiary of)
             the project management plan.

                    96          Chapter 3         Developing the Project Scope Statement




                    Formulating Scope Definition
                    Now we're getting to the meat of the project Planning process group. The high-level objectives and
                    deliverables and the initial constraints and assumptions of the project were defined in the prelim-
                    inary scope statement. When we prepared the preliminary scope statement it was, well, prelimi-
                    nary. Now we're ready to further define these in the Scope Definition process and prepare a
                    detailed project scope statement because more information is known now. The project scope
                    statement (which we'll get to shortly) is what we'll use to further break down the work of the
                    project into activities that we can assign to resources.

                    You'll want to pay particular attention to the accuracy and completeness of this process. Defin-
                    ing project scope is critical to the success of the project since it spells out exactly what the prod-
                    uct or service of the project looks like. Conversely, poor scope definition may lead to cost
                    increases, rework, schedule delays, and poor morale.



                         First, we'll examine the inputs and tools and techniques of this process.


                    Defining the Scope Definition Inputs and
                    Tools and Techniques
                    The inputs to the Scope Definition process are as follows:
                          Organizational process assets
                          Project charter
                          Preliminary scope management plan
                          Approved change requests
                       Some of the important information you'll want to key in on from these inputs are historical infor-
                    mation, the product description, and the project objectives, assumptions, and constraints. (We'll
                    cover each of these in the section "Writing the Project Scope Statement" later in this chapter.)
                       The approved change requests input will obviously impact the project scope. They may also
                    impact quality, estimated costs, or the project schedule. As changes are approved, you'll have
                    to modify the project scope statement (and other planning documents) to reflect them.
                       We're going to see some new tools and techniques in this process:
                          Product analysis
                          Alternatives identification

                We've covered expert judgment before. We'll cover product analysis, alternatives identifica-
             tion, and stakeholders in the following sections.



             Exam Spotlight

             In practice, you'll often find that you'll skip over the preliminary scope statement process and
             begin writing the project scope statement after the charter is documented. However, you're
             studying for the exam, so remember that the project scope statement is further elaborated
             based on the information contained in the preliminary scope statement. Most of the informa-
             tion found in the preliminary scope statement is also found in the project scope statement.

             Also note that if the project charter and/or the preliminary project scope statement are missing
             or were not developed, you should use the product scope description as an input to this process.



             Product Analysis
             Product analysis goes hand in hand with the product scope description. Product analysis is a
             method for converting the product description and project objectives into deliverables and
             requirements. According to A Guide to the PMBOK, product analysis might include perform-
             ing value analysis, functional analysis, systems-engineering techniques, systems analysis, or
             value-engineering techniques to further define the product or service.



             Exam Spotlight

             It's beyond the scope of this book to go into the various analysis techniques used in product analysis.
             For exam purposes, remember that product analysis is a tool and technique of the Scope Definition
             process and memorize the list of analysis techniques that might be performed in this process.



             Alternatives Identification
             Alternatives identification is a technique used for discovering different methods or ways of
             accomplishing the project. For example, brainstorming might be used to discover alternative
             ways of implementing one of the project objectives. Perhaps the project's budget doesn't allow
             for a portion of the project that the stakeholders really think needs to be included. Brainstorm-
             ing might uncover an alternative that would allow the needed portion to be accomplished.
                Lateral thinking is a form of alternatives identifications that can be used to help define scope.
             Edward de Bono created this term and has done extensive research and writing on the topic of lateral
             thinking. The simplest definition is that it's thinking outside the box. Lateral thinking is a process of
             separating the problem--or in our case the components of project scope (the deliverables and require-
             ments)--looking at them from different angles than their obvious presentation, and encouraging team
             members to come up with ways to solve problems or look at scope that are not apparently obvious.

                    98          Chapter 3         Developing the Project Scope Statement



                    Stakeholder Analysis
                    During stakeholder analysis, you'll want to identify the influences stakeholders have in regard
                    to the project and understand their expectations, needs, and desires. From there, you'll derive
                    more specifics regarding the project goals and deliverables. Be warned that stakeholders are
                    mostly concerned about their own interests and what they (or their organization) have to gain
                    or lose from the project. In all fairness, we all fall into the stakeholder category, so we're all
                    guilty of focusing on those things that impact us most.


                                          A Guide to the PMBOK doesn't heavily reference stakeholders prior to this pro-
                                          cess. You'll recall they state that the information for the project charter and pre-
                                          liminary scope statement comes from the project requestor or sponsor. In
                                          practice, you'll want to bring your stakeholders into the project as early in the
                                          process as you can, preferably when the project charter or preliminary scope
                                          statement is being written.

                       Your objective at this point is to begin defining exactly what the stakeholders' expectations
                    are of project outcomes. This should include information like the project's objectives and how
                    you'll recognize when the project is successfully completed. At the end of this identification and
                    analysis process, you'll be able to describe and prioritize their expectations in terms of project
                    requirements. But we're getting ahead of ourselves. We'll define objectives and requirements
                    shortly. Let's discover who those stakeholders are first.

                    Identifying Stakeholders
                    Think of stakeholders and project participants as a highly polished orchestra. Each participant
                    has a part to play. Some play more than others, and alas, some play their parts better than oth-
                    ers. An integral part of project management is getting to know your stakeholders and the parts
                    they play. You'll remember from Chapter 1 that stakeholders are those people or organizations
                    who have a vested interest in the outcome of the project. They have something to either gain or
                    lose as a result of the project and have the ability to influence project results. Stakeholders are
                    officially identified in the Planning process. In practice, key stakeholders will have to be con-
                    tacted early on to get their input for the project goals and deliverables.
                        Identifying key stakeholders seems as if it should be fairly easy, but once you get beyond the
                    obvious stakeholders, the process can get difficult. Sometimes stakeholders, even key stakehold-
                    ers, will change throughout the project's life. The key stakeholders on a project might include
                    the project sponsor, the customer (who might be one and the same as the project sponsor), the
                    project manager, project team members, management personnel, contractors, suppliers, and so
                    on. Stakeholders can be internal or external to the organization. One way to uncover stake-
                    holders whom you might not have thought about right at the start is to ask known stakeholders
                    if they're aware of anyone else that might be impacted by this project. Ask team members if
                    they're aware of stakeholders who haven't been identified. Stakeholders might also come to the
                    forefront once you start uncovering some of the goals and deliverables of the project.
                        Don't forget important stakeholders. That could be a project killer. Leaving out an impor-
                    tant stakeholder, or one whose business processes weren't considered during the Initiating and
                    Planning processes, could spell disaster for your project.

                                                                        Formulating Scope Definition           99




             Understanding Stakeholder Roles
             It's important for the project manager to understand each stakeholder's role in the project and
             their role in the organization. Get to know them and their interests. Determine the relationship
             structure among the various stakeholders. Start cultivating partnerships with these stakeholders
             now, as it's going to get pretty cozy during the course of your project. If you establish good
             working relationships up front and learn a little about their business concerns and needs, it
             might be easier to negotiate or motivate them later on when you have a pressing issue that needs
             action. Knowing which stakeholders work well together and which don't can also help you in
             the future. One stakeholder may have the authority or influence to twist the arm of another, fig-
             uratively speaking, of course. Or conversely, you might know of two stakeholders who are like
             oil and water when put into the same room together. This can be valuable information to keep
             under your hat for future reference.
                 Stakeholders may have a significant amount of influence over the project and its outcomes.
             Understanding the organizational structure, and where the stakeholders fit in that structure,
             should be your first step in determining the level of influence they have. For example, if Melanie
             in accounting wields a significant amount of power and influence over the organization, when
             you need input or decisions from her regarding costs or budgets for the project you better
             believe that those decisions are not likely going to get overridden. Conversely, if stakeholders
             with little influence provide direction that you don't verify, that input could be overridden at a
             later date by a more powerful stakeholder, causing changes to the project.

             Communicating with Stakeholders
             Now those finely honed communication skills are going to come in handy. We're just about ready
             to start documenting the deliverables and requirements of the project. In order to determine the
             specifics of your project, you'll want to meet with each of the key stakeholders and document their
             needs, wants, and expectations. You may want to ask them what business process the project will
             likely change, enhance, or replace. Perhaps the existing business processes, and the systems that
             support them, are so old that little documentation exists for them. Determine if there is a critical
             business need for this project or if it's a "nice to have," as we say around our office. What will be
             the result of this project? Will customer service be improved or sales increased? Find out what pre-
             vents the stakeholders today from achieving the results they hope the project will accomplish. Ask
             about the deliverables and how they can be verified and measured. And always ask the stakehold-
             ers how they will know that the project was completed successfully.
                 One way to help identify project objectives (which we'll talk about in the next section) is to
             talk about what is not included in a project. For example, let's say you're working on a highway
             project to create a new on-ramp from a downtown city street. The goal of this project is to have
             a new on-ramp constructed and ready for traffic in 18 months from the project start date. Spe-
             cifically excluded from this project is the demolition of a deteriorating bridge adjacent to the
             new on-ramp. Make sure you state this in the project scope statement.


                                   Remember that the definition of a successful project is one that accomplishes
                                   the goals of the project and meets or exceeds stakeholders' expectations.
                                   Understand and document those expectations and you're off to a good start.

                    100         Chapter 3         Developing the Project Scope Statement




                    Writing the Project Scope Statement
                    The purpose of the project scope statement is to document the project objectives, deliverables,
                    and requirements so that they can be used to direct the project team's work and as a basis for
                    future project decisions. The scope statement is an agreement between the project and the
                    project customer that states precisely what the work of the project will produce. Simply put, the
                    scope statement tells everyone concerned with the project exactly what they're going to get
                    when the work is finished.



                    Exam Spotlight

                    Understand that the purpose of the scope statement, according to A Guide to the PMBOK, is to
                    provide all the stakeholders with a foundational understanding of project scope. Also remem-
                    ber that the scope statement defines and progressively elaborates the work of the project and
                    guides the work of the project team during the Executing process and that all change requests
                    will be evaluated against the scope statement. If the change request is outside the bounds of
                    the project scope as documented here, it should be denied.



                       Since the scope statement serves as a baseline for the project, if questions arise or changes are
                    proposed later in the project, they can be compared to what's documented in the scope state-
                    ment. Making change decisions is easier when the original deliverables and requirements are
                    well documented. You'll also know what is out of scope for the project simply because the work
                    isn't documented here (or conversely, deliverables or elements are documented and noted as
                    being specifically out of scope). The criteria outlined in the scope statement will also be used to
                    determine if the project was completed successfully. Hopefully, you're already seeing the impor-
                    tance of documenting project scope.


                    Scope Statement Components
                    According to A Guide to the PMBOK, the project scope statement should include all of the following:
                          Project objectives
                          Product scope description
                          Project deliverables
                          Project requirements
                          Project boundaries
                          Product acceptance criteria
                          Project constraints
                          Project assumptions

                  Initial project organization
                  Initial defined risks
                  Schedule milestones
                  Fund limitations
                  Cost estimates
                  Project configuration management requirements
                  Project specifications
                  Approval requirements
                 If the details surrounding these are spelled out in other documents, you don't have to reenter
             all the information into the scope statement. Simply reference the other document in the scope
             statement so that readers know where to find it.


                                   Are we there yet? Remember in Chapter 2 I promised you we'd get to the details
                                   of the preliminary scope statement when we got to this point? We're there! All of
                                   the elements in the preceding list are part of the preliminary scope statement as
                                   well as the project scope statement, and we're going to discuss each one of
                                   them. The explanations given here apply to these elements as they pertain to the
                                   preliminary and the project scope statements. The difference is that at this point
                                   in the project we know more then we did earlier on, so there'll be more detail
                                   here than in the preliminary scope statement. Are you ready? Here we go.




                                   Several terms are tossed about when we start talking about project scope and
                                   sometimes they're used interchangeably. They are words such as goals, objec-
                                   tives, requirements, and deliverables (we'll get to these last two later in this sec-
                                   tion). I've referenced the term objectives several times throughout this chapter.
                                   Goals and objectives are the purpose for undertaking the project. These are the
                                   "what" it is you're trying to accomplish. They describe the final result of the
                                   project. "Increase warehouse space by 17 percent to house the new product line
                                   for distribution" and "Improve turnaround times by 25 percent on loan applica-
                                   tion services" are both examples of objectives. They state the purpose for the
                                   project and the desired end result. Some project managers in practice use the
                                   term goals to describe what A Guide to the PMBOK terms objectives. A Guide to
                                   the PMBOK doesn't use the word goals and you won't find it in its glossary. Be
                                   that as it may, we'll stick with the term it uses, objective. Just keep in mind that
                                   you can think of goals and objectives as interchangeable.



             Project Objectives
             Objectives are quantifiable criteria used to measure project success. They describe the what it
             is you're trying to do, accomplish, or produce. Quantifiable criteria should at least include
             schedule, cost, and quality measures. You may use business measures or quality targets as well.

                    In the case of project objectives, these elements are used as measurements to determine project
                    satisfaction and successful completion. Costs are typically stated in monetary units (U.S. dol-
                    lars, Euro dollars, and so on) and should be specific. Schedules are typically stated in time mea-
                    surements, and I recommend sticking with a consistent measurement throughout your project.
                    If you use hours, state all schedule-related topics in hours.
                        You've probably seen the acronym SMART regarding goals and objectives a dozen times,
                    but it's worth repeating. If you follow these principles, you'll be certain that your objectives
                    meet the "quantifiable criteria" needed to measure success. Objectives should follow the
                    SMART rule:
                    S--Specific Objectives should be specific and written in clear, concise, and understandable terms.
                    M--Measurable Objectives should be measurable.
                    A--Accurate Objectives should be accurate and should describe precisely what's required.
                    R--Realistic and tangible Objectives that are impossible to accomplish are not realistic and not
                    attainable. Objectives must be centered in reality. For example, it's not likely you and I will be
                    sending up rocket ships full of chocolate candies to sell to tourists visiting the moon anytime soon.
                    T--Time bound Objectives should have a time frame with an end date assigned to them.
                       Let's look at some examples of the tangible terms, or quantifiable criteria, we talked about
                    earlier. If your objective is to increase warehouse space, it is better to say the objective is to build
                    four new warehouses. Describing the number of new warehouses to be built is specific and tan-
                    gible. For that reason, you'll know the project is completed when this objective is met. The
                    objective of offering faster loan approvals might be better stated that the company will provide
                    loan applications over the Internet to increase the speed of the application process by 25 percent
                    by the end of the calendar year. In other words, the purpose for the project is to do something
                    or accomplish something--an objective.
                       Let's say your company is going to produce a run of holiday beer. Your objective statement
                    might be stated this way: "Beer Buddies, Inc. will produce two million cases of holiday beer to
                    be shipped to our distributors by October 30 at a cost of $1.5 million or less." The objective cri-
                    teria in this statement are clearly stated, and fulfillment of the project objective can be easily
                    measured. Stakeholders will know the objective is met when the two million cases are produced
                    and shipped by the due date within the budget stated.

                    Product Scope Description
                    The product scope description describes the characteristics of the product or service of the project.
                    We talked about this in Chapter 2. If the product scope description is contained in the project
                    charter, you can reference the project charter in the project scope statement. Chances are very
                    good you'll be using a word processing system of some sort to write these documents. An even bet-
                    ter idea is to copy and paste the information from the project charter into the scope statement. It
                    won't hurt anything to have it in both places and will make reading the scope statement easier.

                    Project Deliverables
                    Deliverables are measurable outcomes, measurable results, or specific items that must be produced
                    to consider the project or project phase completed. Deliverables, like objectives, must be specific and

                                                                  Writing the Project Scope Statement              103




             verifiable. For example, one of your deliverables might include widgets with a three-inch diameter
             that will in turn be assembled into the final product. This deliverable, a three-inch-diameter widget,
             is specific and measurable. However, if the deliverable was not documented or not communicated
             to the manager or vendor responsible for manufacturing the widgets, there could be a disaster wait-
             ing to happen. If they deliver two-inch widgets instead of the required three-inch version, it would
             throw the entire project off schedule or perhaps cause the project to fail. This could be a career-lim-
             iting move for the project manager, because it's the project manager's responsibility to document
             deliverables and monitor the progress of those deliverables throughout the project. Most projects
             have multiple deliverables. As in this example, if you are assembling a new product with many parts,
             each of the parts might be considered independent deliverables.
                 A Guide to the PMBOK describes a project deliverable as either a unique and verifiable prod-
             uct or result or a service that's performed. The product or service must be produced or per-
             formed in order to consider the project complete. The deliverables may also include
             supplementary outcomes like documentation or project management reports.



             Critical Success Factors

             Deliverables and objectives are sometimes referred to as critical success factors. Critical success
             factors are those elements that must be completed in order for the project to be considered com-
             plete. For example, if you're building a bridge, one of the deliverables might be to produce a spe-
             cific number of trusses that will be used to help support the bridge. Without the trusses, the
             bridge can't be completed; in fact, the bridge might not stand without them. The trusses, in this
             case, are a critical success factor. Not all deliverables are necessarily critical success factors, but
             many of them will fall into this category and should be documented as such.



                The bottom line is this: No matter how well you apply your project skills, if the wrong deliv-
             erables are produced or the project is managed to the wrong objectives, you will have an unsuc-
             cessful project on your hands.

             Project Requirements
             After all the deliverables are identified, the project manager needs to discover and document all of the
             requirements of the project. Requirements describe the characteristics of the deliverable. They may
             also describe functionality that the deliverable must have or specific conditions the deliverable must
             meet in order to satisfy the objective of the project. According to A Guide to the PMBOK, require-
             ments are conditions that must be met or criteria that the product or service of the project must possess
             in order to satisfy the project documents, a contract, a standard, or a specification. Requirements
             quantify and prioritize the wants, needs, and expectations of the project sponsor and stakeholders.
                Requirements may include things like dimensions, ease of use, color, specific ingredients, and
             so on. If we go back to our holiday beer example, you'll recall that the project objective was to
             produce a new bottle of beer for the holidays. One of the major deliverables is the cartons to
             hold the bottles. The requirements for that deliverable may include carton design, photographs
             that will appear on the carton, color choices, and so on.

                    104         Chapter 3         Developing the Project Scope Statement




                    Documenting All of the Deliverables and Requirements

                    One of the project manager's primary functions is to accurately document the deliverables and
                    requirements of the project and then manage the project so that they are produced according
                    to the agreed-upon criteria. Deliverables describe the components of the goals and objectives
                    in a quantifiable way. Requirements are the specifications of the deliverables.

                    The project manager should use the project charter and preliminary scope statement as a start-
                    ing point for identifying and progressively elaborating project deliverables, but it's possible
                    that only some of the deliverables will be documented there. Remember that the charter was
                    written by a manager external to the project, and it was the first take at defining the project
                    objectives and deliverables. As the project manager, it's your job to make certain all the deliv-
                    erables are identified and documented in the project scope statement. That's because the
                    scope statement (not the project charter) serves as the agreement among stakeholders--
                    including the customer of the project--regarding what project objectives and deliverables will
                    be produced in order to meet and satisfy the requirements of the project.

                    Interview the stakeholders, other project managers, project team members, customers, man-
                    agement staff, industry experts, and any other experts who can help you identify all the deliv-
                    erables of the project. Depending on the size of the project, you might be able to accomplish
                    this in a group setting using simple brainstorming techniques, but large complex projects may
                    have scope statements for each deliverable of the project. Remember that the project scope
                    statement is progressively elaborated into finer detail and is used later on to help decompose
                    the work of the project into smaller tasks and activities.



                       Again, the project manager needs to pull those communications skills out of her tool bag and
                    use them to interview stakeholders, customers, project team members, and business process
                    owners about the project requirements. While the project manager is responsible for making
                    certain the requirements are documented, it doesn't mean this task must be performed by the
                    project manager. The project manager can enlist the help of stakeholders, business analysts,
                    requirements analysts, business process owners, and other team members to conduct the inter-
                    views and document the requirements. The project manager then reviews the requirements and
                    incorporates them into the project documentation and project plan.
                       Business process owners are those people who are experts in their particular area of the busi-
                    ness. They are invaluable resources to the project manager. They are usually the midlevel man-
                    agers and line managers who still have their fingers in the day-to-day portion of the business.
                    For example, it takes many experts in various areas to produce and market a great bottle of
                    beer. There are machinists whose specialty is regulating and keeping the stainless steel and cop-
                    per drums in top working order. There are chemists who daily check and adjust the secret for-
                    mulas brewing in the vats. Graphic artists must develop colorful and interesting labels and
                    cartons to attract the attention of those thirsty patrons. And of course, those great TV commer-
                    cials advertising the tasty brew are produced by yet another set of business experts. These are
                    the kinds of people you'll interview and ask to assist you in identifying requirements.
3601.book Page 105 Wednesday, July 13, 2005 1:39 PM




                                                                 Writing the Project Scope Statement            105




                                   You can use the same techniques to determine requirements as you did to
                                   determine deliverables. There are several techniques discussed in Chapter 5,
                                   "Risk Planning," that you can use during the Scope Definition process as well
                                   to identify deliverables and requirements.

                Getting the business process owners and stakeholders (who could be one and the same,
             depending on the project) together in a meeting room and brainstorming the requirements can
             produce terrific results. Depending on the size of the project, this isn't always possible, but the
             idea holds true. Interview your stakeholders and business experts to get at the requirements and
             then document them in the project scope statement. Remember that, according to A Guide to
             the PMBOK, the stakeholder analysis (a tool and technique of the Scope Definition process--
             yes we're still talking about that process) you performed ultimately turns their needs and expec-
             tations into prioritized requirements that are documented here in the project scope statement.



             Exam Spotlight

             Understand the differences between objectives, deliverables, and requirements. These are first
             defined during the Initiating processes and are fine-tuned in more detail during the Planning
             processes.



             Project Boundaries
             Project boundaries define what is and what is not included in the work of the project. In this sec-
             tion of the scope statement, you'll state what is excluded from scope. The following statement may
             seem obvious, but I'll note it anyway: objectives, deliverables, and requirements not specifically
             included in the project scope statement are explicitly excluded from the project. Stakeholders can-
             not become confused later and expect that a specific product or deliverable was going to be
             included in the project when it's stated here that it will not be produced.

             Product Acceptance Criteria
             Product acceptance criteria includes the process and the criteria that will be used to determine
             if the deliverables, and the final product or service of the project, are acceptable and satisfac-
             tory. Acceptance criteria may include any number of elements, such as quality criteria, fitness
             for use, and performance criteria.

             Project Constraints
             Constraints are anything that either restricts the actions of the project team or dictates the actions
             of the project team. Constraints put you in a box. (I hope you're not claustrophobic.) As a project
             manager, you have to manage to the project constraints, which sometimes requires creativity.

                    106         Chapter 3         Developing the Project Scope Statement



                        In my organization, and I'm sure the same is true in yours, there are far more project requests
                    than we have resources to work on them. In this case, resources are a constraint. You'll find that
                    a similar phenomenon occurs on individual projects as well. Almost every project you'll encoun-
                    ter must work within the triple constraint combination of scope, time, and cost. The quality of
                    the project (or the outcomes of the project) is affected by how well these three constraints are
                    managed. Usually one or two of the triple constraints, sometimes all three, apply, which restricts
                    the actions of the project team. You might work on projects where you have an almost unlim-
                    ited budget (don't we wish!), but time is the limitation. For example, if the president mandated
                    that NASA put a man on Mars by the end of 2008, you'd have a time-constrained project on
                    your hands.
                        Other projects might present the opposite scenario. You have all the time you need to com-
                    plete the project, but the budget is fixed. Still other projects may incorporate two or three of the
                    constraints. Government agencies are notorious for starting projects that have at least two and
                    sometimes all three constraints. For example, new tax laws are passed that impact the computer
                    programs, requiring new programs to calculate and track the tax changes. Typically, a due date
                    is given when the tax law takes effect, and the organization responsible is required to implement
                    the changes with no additions to budget or staff. In other words, they are told to use existing
                    resources to accomplish the objectives of the project, and the specific requirements, or scope, of
                    the project are such that they cannot be changed to try to meet the time deadline.
                        As a project manager, one of your biggest jobs is to balance the project constraints while
                    meeting or exceeding the expectations of your stakeholders. In most projects, you will usually
                    be faced with balancing only one or two of the triple constraints. For example, if one of the
                    project objectives is to complete the project by the end of the year, the saying goes, "I can give
                    it to you fast or I can give to you cheap, but I can't give it to you fast and cheap."
                        Constraints can take on many forms and aren't limited to time, cost, and scope. Anything
                    that impedes your project team's ability to perform the work of the project or specifically dic-
                    tates the way the project should be performed is considered a constraint. Governments are a
                    good example here. Let's say in order to fulfill some of the deliverables of your project you'll
                    have to purchase a large amount of materials and equipment. Procurement processes can be so
                    cumbersome that ordering supplies for a project may literally add months to the project sched-
                    ule. The procurement process itself becomes a constraint because of the methods and proce-
                    dures you're required to use to get the materials in house.
                        Let's take a brief look at some of the common constraints you'll likely encounter on your
                    future projects.
                    Time constraint As I said, time can be a project constraint. This usually comes in the form of
                    an enforced deadline, commonly known as the "make it happen now" scenario. If you are in
                    charge of the company's holiday bash scheduled for December 10, your project is time con-
                    strained. Once the invitations are out and the hall has been rented, you can't move the date. All
                    activities on this project are driven by the due date.
                    Budget constraints Budgets are another one of the triple constraints. Budgets limit the project
                    team's ability to obtain resources and might potentially limit the scope of the project. For exam-
                    ple, component X cannot be part of this project because the budget doesn't support it.

             Quality constraints While A Guide to the PMBOK doesn't list quality as a constraint, you'll
             find in practice that quality can often be a constraint. Quality constraints typically are restricted
             by the specifications of the product or service. The specifications for those three-inch widgets
             talked about earlier could be considered a quality constraint. Most of the time, if quality is a
             constraint, one of the other constraints--time or budget--has to have some give. You can't pro-
             duce high quality on a restricted budget and within a tightly restricted time schedule. Of course,
             there are exceptions, but only in the movies.
             Schedule constraints Schedule constraints can cause interesting dilemmas for the project man-
             ager. For example, say you're the project manager in charge of building a new football stadium
             in your city. The construction of the stadium will require the use of cranes--and crane opera-
             tors--at certain times during the project. If crane operators are not available when your project
             plan calls for them, you'll have to make schedule adjustments so that the crane operators can
             come in at the right time.
             Technology constraints Technology is a marvelous thing. In fact, how did humans survive
             prior to the invention of computers and cell phones? Technology certainly can be marvelous,
             but it can also be a project constraint. For example, your project might require the use of brand-
             new technology that is still so new it hasn't been released on a wide-scale basis. One impact
             might be that the project will take an additional six months because the new technology isn't
             ready or hasn't been tested yet.
             Directive constraints Directives from management can be constraints as well. Your depart-
             ment may have specific policies that management requires for the type of work you're about to
             undertake. This may add time to the project, so you must consider those policies when identi-
             fying project constraints. And when you're performing work on contract, the provisions of the
             contract can be constraints.
                Constraints, particularly the triple constraints, can be used to help drive out the objectives
             and requirements of the project. If it's difficult to discern which constraint is the primary con-
             straint, ask the project sponsor something like this, "Ms. Sponsor, if you could only have one
             of these two alternatives, which would you choose? The project is delivered on the date you've
             stated, or the quality is manufactured to the exact specifications you've given." If Ms. Sponsor
             replies with the date response, you know your primary constraint is time. If push comes to shove
             during the project Planning processes, time might have to give because quality cannot.
                You'll want to understand what the primary constraint is on the project. If you assume the pri-
             mary constraint is budget when in actuality the primary constraint is time, in the immortal words of
             two-year-olds worldwide, "Uh-oh." Understanding the constraints and which one carries the most
             importance will help you out later on in the project Planning process group with things like scope
             planning, scheduling, estimating, and project plan development. That's assuming your project gets
             to the project Planning processes, which brings us to the next topic: project assumptions.

             Project Assumptions
             You've probably heard the old saying about the word assume, something about what it makes
             out of "u" and "me." In the case of project management, however, throw this old saying out
             the window, because it's not true.

                    108         Chapter 3         Developing the Project Scope Statement



                        Assumptions, for the purposes of project management, are things you believe to be true. For
                    example, if you're working on a large construction project, you might make assumptions about
                    the availability of materials. You may assume that concrete, lumber, drywall, and so on are
                    widely available and reasonably priced. You may also assume that finding contract labor is
                    either easy or difficult, depending on the economic times and the availability of labor in your
                    locale. Each project will have its own set of assumptions, and they should be identified, docu-
                    mented, and updated throughout the project.
                        It's essential to understand and document the assumptions you're making, and the assump-
                    tions your stakeholders are making, about the project. It's also important to find out as many
                    of the assumptions as you can up front. Projects can fail, sometimes after lots of progress has
                    been made, because an important assumption was forgotten or the assumption was incorrect.
                    You will have more assumptions at this point in the project then you did when creating the
                    project charter because more is known about the goals and deliverables of the project. Defining
                    new assumptions and refining old ones are another form of progressive elaboration.
                        Let's say you make plans to meet your buddy for lunch on Friday at 11:30 at your favorite spot.
                    When Friday rolls around, you assume he's going to show up, barring any catastrophes between the
                    office and the restaurant. Project assumptions work the same way. For planning purposes, you pre-
                    sume the event or thing you've made the assumptions about is true, real, or certain. For example, you
                    might assume that key resources will be available when needed on the project. Document that
                    assumption. If Nancy is the one and only resource who can perform a specific task at a certain point
                    in the project, document your assumption that Nancy will be available and run it by her manager.
                    If Nancy happens to be on a plane for Helsinki at the time you thought she was going to be working
                    on the project, you could have a real problem on your hands.
                        Other assumptions could be factors such as vendor delivery times, product availability, contrac-
                    tor availability, the accuracy of the project plan, the assumption that key project members will per-
                    form adequately, contract signing dates, project start dates, and project phase start dates. This is not
                    an exhaustive list but should get you thinking in the right direction. As you interview your stake-
                    holders, ask them about their assumptions and add them to your list. Use brainstorming exercises
                    with your team and other project participants to come up with additional assumptions.


                                          Think about some of the factors you normally take for granted when you're try-
                                          ing to identify assumptions. Many times they're the elements everyone
                                          expects will be available or will behave in a specific way. Think about factors
                                          such as key team members' availability, access to information, access to equip-
                                          ment, management support, and vendor reliability.

                       Try to validate your assumptions whenever possible. When discussing assumptions with ven-
                    dors, make them put it in writing. In fact, if the services or goods you're expecting to be deliv-
                    ered by your suppliers are critical to the project, include a clause in the contract to assure a
                    contingency plan in case your suppliers fail to perform. For example, if you're expecting 200
                    PCs to be delivered, configured, and installed by a certain date, require the vendor to pay the
                    cost of rental equipment in the event they can't deliver on the promised due date.
                       Remember, when assumptions are incorrect or not documented, it could cause problems
                    halfway through the project and might even be a project killer.
3601.book Page 109 Wednesday, July 13, 2005 1:39 PM




                                                                 Writing the Project Scope Statement          109




             Initial Project Organization
             In the initial project organization section, you'll document who the stakeholders are on the
             project. We talked about stakeholders earlier in this chapter. You should also document the
             team members and the way the project will be organized here.

             Initial Defined Risks
             Risks pose threats and opportunities to the project. This section should contain a list of all
             known risks.


                                   We'll cover risks in much more detail in Chapter 5.




             Schedule Milestones
             Milestones are typically points in the project where something significant is achieved or completed.
             List the major milestones that you know about now in this section of the project scope statement.


                                   We'll talk more about milestones in Chapter 7.




             Fund Limitations
             Fund limitations really refer to the cost constraint. If there are fund limitations (and I've never
             worked on a project where there wasn't), document them here. Also document any time frames
             associated with the funding limitations. For example, I often work on projects where funding
             runs out at the end of the fiscal year. If you haven't spent the money by then, you'll no longer
             have access to it.

             Cost Estimates
             Cost estimates is the section where you list the cost estimates for the project. This should include
             overall costs for the project and some level of confidence in that estimate.

             Project Configuration Management Requirements
             Configuration management describes the characteristics of the product of the project and
             ensures that the description is accurate and complete.


                                   We'll talk more about configuration management in Chapter 9.

                    110         Chapter 3         Developing the Project Scope Statement



                    Project Specifications
                    If there are specification documents that the project should comply with, for example, industry
                    specifications or technology specifications--note that in the project specifications section.

                    Approval Requirements
                    Approval requirements refer to how the objectives, deliverables, project management docu-
                    ments, and other outcomes and results of the project will be approved. This is different than
                    product acceptance criteria--that element describes how the product itself will be approved,
                    whereas this element describes the requirements that must be met in order to approve the objec-
                    tives and so on. An example product acceptance criteria might be "all widgets must measure
                    three inches." A deliverable approval requirement might be that the director of sales must
                    approve a prototype before the project can proceed. This section may also contain the process
                    and approval requirements of the project scope statement.


                    Approving and Publishing the Project Scope Statement
                    Just like the project charter, the project scope statement should be approved, agreed upon, pub-
                    lished, and distributed to the stakeholders, key management personnel, and project team mem-
                    bers. You can accomplish this with a formal sign-off procedure that's documented as part of the
                    "approval requirements" section of the scope statement. When stakeholders sign off and agree
                    to the scope statement, they're agreeing to the deliverables and requirements of the project. And,
                    as with the project charter, their agreement and endorsement of the project requirements and
                    deliverables will likely sustain their participation and cooperation throughout the rest of the
                    project. That doesn't mean they'll agree to everything as the project progresses, but it does mean
                    the stakeholders are informed and will likely remain active project participants.


                    Updating the Project Scope Management Plan
                    Two outputs of the Scope Definition process remain. Those outputs are requested changes and
                    project scope management plan updates. When you're in the midst of defining deliverables and
                    requirements, you'll often find that changes to the original objectives and requirements will
                    occur. These requested changes, once reviewed and approved, will change the scope of the
                    project. If the project scope statement has been approved and published, you'll need to make
                    changes to it and notify stakeholders that changes have been made.


                                          We'll talk more about change control and change request processes in Chapter 9.



                       Approved changes may also impact the project scope management plan or some of the sub-
                    sidiary plans that make up this plan. Make certain you update this plan as a result of the changes
                    made during the Scope Definition process.

             Mountain Streams Services

             Maria Sanchez is the CEO of Mountain Streams Services. She recently accepted a prestigious
             industry award on behalf of the company. Maria knows that without the dedication and support
             of her employees, Mountain Streams Services wouldn't have achieved this great milestone.

             Maria wants to host a reception for the employees and their guests in recognition of all their hard
             work and contributions to the company. Maria has appointed you to arrange the reception.

             The reception is scheduled for April 12, and Maria has given you a budget of $125 per person. The
             company employs 200 people. The reception should be semiformal.

             You've documented the deliverables as follows:

                  Location selection

                  Food and beverage menu

                  Invitations

                  Entertainment

                  Insurance coverage

                  Decorations

                  Photographer

                  Agenda

             In addition to the deliverables, you want to go over the following requirements with Maria to
             be certain you both are in agreement:

                  The location should be somewhere in the downtown area.

                  Employees are encouraged to bring one guest but no children.

                  There will be an open bar paid for by Maria.

                  The agenda will include a speech by Maria, followed by the distribution of bonus checks
                  to every employee. This is to be kept secret until the reception.

                  The decorations should include gold-trimmed fountain pens with the company logo at
                  every place setting for the attendees to keep.

             Once you've documented all the particulars, you ask to speak with Maria to go over this project
             scope statement and get her approval before proceeding with the project.

                    112         Chapter 3         Developing the Project Scope Statement




                    Project Case Study: New Kitchen Heaven Retail Store

                    The project charter kickoff meeting was held and well attended. You're ready to start writing the
                    project scope statement and have a question or two for Dirk. You knock on his door and he
                    invites you in.

                    "Shoot."

                    "I'm ready to define the deliverables and requirements for this project. I want to make sure I get
                    the right folks involved in the meeting. Who are key stakeholders you recommend I speak with?"

                    "There are a few people I can think of right off that you don't want to miss. There's Jake Peter-
                    son over in Facilities. He's in charge of store furnishings, shelving, things like that--any sup-
                    plies for the stores that aren't retail products. He can help out with store build-outs, too. He
                    supervised our last eight stores and did a terrific job."

                     "Anyone else?" you ask.

                    "You should also talk to Jill Overstreet, the director in charge of retail products. She can help
                    with the initial store stocking, and once the store is open, her group will take over the ongoing
                    operations. All the district managers report to Jill."

                    You thank Dirk and tell him you're going to contact Jake and Jill and set up a brainstorming ses-
                    sion to determine requirements.

                    A few days later.

                    You review your notes and reread the first draft of the project scope statement you've prepared
                    for the Kitchen Heaven retail store before looking for Dirk. After your meetings with the stake-
                    holders, you were better able to refine the project objectives and deliverables.

                    "Dirk, I'm glad I caught you. I'd like to go over the project scope statement with you before I give
                    it to the stakeholders. Do you have a few minutes?"

                    "Sure," Dirk says to you. "Let's have it."

                    "The project objective is to open the 50th Kitchen Heaven store in Colorado Springs by Febru-
                    ary 1. When I met with Jake, he confirmed it takes 120 days to do the store build-out. That
                    includes having the shelves set up and in place, ready to stock with inventory."

                    Dirk asks if Jake told you about his store location idea.

                    "Yes, Jake gave me a contact name of the leasing agent, and I've left her a voice mail. The sooner
                    we can get that lease signed, the better. It takes Jake 120 days to do the build-out, and Jill said
                    she needs 2 weeks lead time to order the initial inventory and stock the shelves. That puts us
                    pretty close to our February 1st deadline, counting the time to get the lease papers signed."

                    "Sounds good so far," Dirk replies. "What else?"
3601.book Page 113 Wednesday, July 13, 2005 1:39 PM




                                                                  Writing the Project Scope Statement           113




             "I've included an updated description of the products and services the new store will offer,
             based on the documentation that was written from the last store opening. Jill reviewed the
             updates to the description, so we should be in the clear there. The store will include some new
             lines that we've decided to take on--cookware from famous chefs, that kind of thing.

             "Jake has already made contact with a general contractor in Colorado Springs, and he is ready
             to roll once we've signed the lease.

             "One more thing, Dirk. Since we're including the big bash at grand opening as part of the deliv-
             erables, I talked to some of your folks in marketing to get some ideas. They are thinking we
             should have some great giveaways as door prizes and that we will want to cater in the food.
             They also thought having some live cooking demonstrations with some local chefs would be
             a good attraction."

             "Sounds like you're on the right track. So what's next?" Dirk asks.

             "Once you approve the scope statement, I'd like to send a copy to the stakeholders. My next
             step is to break down the deliverables and requirements I've documented here into activities so
             we can get rolling on the work of the project."

             Project Case Study Checklist
                   Stakeholder analysis: Jake Peterson and Jill Overstreet interviewed. Needs, wants, and
                   expectations recorded and requirements prioritized.

                   Organizational structure: Functional organization with a separate projectized department.

                   Constraints: February 1 date to coincide with home and garden show.

                   Assumptions:

                      A store build-out usually takes 120 days.

                      Jill Overstreet will help with the initial store stocking.

                      Jake Peterson will provide supplies for the stores that aren't retail products, such as
                      store furnishings, shelving, etc., and can help with the store build-out as well.

                      The budget for the project will be anywhere from $1.5 to $2 million.

             Created project scope statement, which includes the following:

                   Project objectives: Open 50th store by February 1 in Colorado Springs.

                   Project deliverables:

                      Build out storefront, including shelving.

                      Retail product line delivered two weeks prior to grand opening.

                    Summary
                    This chapter started you on the road to project Planning via the Develop Project Management
                    Plan process, the Scope Planning process, and the Scope Definition process.
                        The output of the Develop Project Management Plan process is the project management
                    plan, which is concerned with defining, coordinating and integrating all the ancillary project
                    plans. The purpose of this plan is to define how the project is executed, how it's monitored and
                    controlled, and how it's closed
                        Scope Planning is where you produce the scope management plan, which is a planning tool
                    that documents how the project team will go about defining project scope, how the work break-
                    down structure will be developed, how changes to scope will be controlled, and how project
                    scope will be verified
                        The scope statement is produced during the Scope Definition process. It describes the project
                    objectives, deliverables, and requirements. The scope statement forms a baseline you'll use to
                    weigh future project decisions, most particularly change requests. The scope statement contains a
                    list of project deliverables that will be used in future Planning processes. Measurement criteria for
                    project objectives are agreed upon by the stakeholders and project manager. These criteria are
                    associated with the deliverables and documented in the scope statement to track project progress.
                        The deliverables, requirements, and measurement criteria should be spelled out clearly and
                    concisely in the scope statement to avoid any misunderstandings later in the project. Formal
                    acceptance of the scope statement is required by the stakeholders and project manager. Accep-
                    tance is usually accompanied by sign-offs on the document indicating that it has been read and
                    that the signing party agrees with the deliverables and requirements of the project.
                        The project scope statement contains many elements, including objectives, deliverables,
                    requirements, boundary descriptions (exclusions from scope), constraints, assumptions, prod-
                    uct acceptance criteria, project organization, initial risks, schedule milestones, fund limitations,
                    configuration management requirements, cost estimates, project specifications, and approval
                    requirements.

                                                                                      Exam Essentials         115




                Constraints restrict or dictate the actions of the project team. Constraints usually involve
             time, cost, and scope but can also include schedules, technology, and more.
                Assumptions are things believed to be true. You'll want to document project assumptions
             and validate them as the project progresses.



             Exam Essentials
             Be able to state the purpose of the Develop Project Management Plan process. It defines,
             coordinates, and integrates all subsidiary project plans.
             Be able to explain the purpose of the project management plan. This plan defines how the
             project is executed, how it's monitored and controlled, and how it's closed, and also documents
             the outputs of the Planning group processes. The size and complexity of the project will deter-
             mine the level of detail contained in this plan.
             Be able to describe the purpose of the scope management plan. The scope management plan
             has a direct influence on the project's success and describes the process for determining project
             scope, facilitates creating the WBS, describes how the product or service of the project is verified
             and accepted, and documents how changes to scope will be handled. The scope management
             plan is a subsidiary plan of the project management plan.
             Be able to name the Scope Definition tools and techniques and outputs. The tools and tech-
             niques from the Scope Definition process are product analysis, alternatives identification,
             expert judgment, and stakeholder analysis. The outputs are the project scope statement,
             requested changes, and project scope management plan updates.
             Understand the purpose of the project scope statement. The scope statement serves as a com-
             mon understanding of project scope among the stakeholders. The project objectives and deliv-
             erables and their quantifiable criteria are documented in the scope statement and are used by the
             project manager and the stakeholders to determine if the project was completed successfully. It
             also serves as a basis for future project decisions.
             Be able to define project constraints and assumptions. Project constraints limit the options of
             the project team and restrict their actions. Sometimes constraints dictate actions. Time, budget,
             and quality are the most common constraints. Assumptions are conditions that are presumed to
             be true or real.

                          A. The primary constraint is time because the president wants the film done quickly. She told
                             you to get it to air as soon as possible.
                          B. Resources are the primary constraint. Even though the president has given you free rein on
                             resource use, you assume she didn't mean those actively assigned to projects.
                          C. The schedule is the primary constraint. Even though the president has given you free rein on
                             resource use, you assume she didn't mean those actively assigned to projects. The photog-
                             rapher won't be finished for another three weeks on his current assignment, so schedule
                             adjustments will have to be made.
                          D. The primary constraint is quality because the president wants this to be the best film ever
                             produced by this company. She's given you free rein to use whatever resources needed to get
                             the job done.

                 with this project as well. Which of the following is true?
                  A. You've made an assumption about vendor availability and expertise. The project came
                     about due to a business need.
                  B. Vendor availability and expertise are constraints. The project came about due to a business need.
                  C. You've made an assumption about vendor availability and expertise. The project came
                     about due to a market demand.
                  D. Vendor availability and expertise are constraints. The project came about due to a market

                    122         Chapter 3         Developing the Project Scope Statement




                    Answers to Review Questions
                    1.    A. The PMIS is a tool and technique of the Develop Project Management Plan process. It's one
                          of the elements of the enterprise environmental factors, which is an input to the Scope Planning
                          process.

                    2.    C. The project management plan describes the processes you'll use to perform the project and
                          describes how the project will be executed, monitored, controlled, and closed.

                    3.    B. The scope management plan describes how project scope will be defined and verified, how the
                          scope statement will be developed, how the WBS will be developed, and how project scope will
                          be controlled.

                    4.    D. The Develop Project Management Plan involves describing the methods for executing the
                          work of the project, documenting dependencies and interactions among the processes, determin-
                          ing the validity of and maintaining the performance baselines, and determining key management
                          reviews for pending decisions, among other elements. The project scope management plan and
                          quality management plans are examples of the subsidiary plans contained within the project
                          management plan, which is the output of this process.

                    5.    B. The scope statement further elaborates the project objectives, deliverables, requirements, and
                          constraints and assumptions defined in the preliminary scope statement. It serves as a basis for
                          future project decisions.

                    6.    D. The project scope statement will change throughout the project as change requests are received
                          and approved. Project managers must be certain to discover all deliverables before publishing the
                          project scope statement to prevent situations like the one described in this question.

                    7.    A. The project scope statement documents the detailed project deliverables and is an output of
                          the Scope Definition process.

                    8.    D. Alternatives identification is a tool and technique of the Scope Definition process that
                          includes brainstorming and lateral thinking techniques.

                    9.    C. Requested changes are an output of the Scope Definition process. They are not part of the
                          project scope statement.

                    10. D. Option A might seem like a correct answer, but option D is more correct. There isn't enough
                        information to determine if stakeholders will require overtime. We do know that poor scope def-
                        inition may lead to cost increases, rework, schedule delays, and poor morale.

                    11. D. Deliverables are tangible, verifiable outcomes or items that must be produced in order to
                        complete the project or project phase. These items wouldn't be considered objectives, because
                        the objective of the project is to break into the overseas market with a successful product
                        revamped for that audience.

                    12. B. According to A Guide to the PMBOK, functionality and specific conditions that must be met
                        in order to satisfy the project, contract, standard, or specification describe the criteria for
                        requirements, not objectives.

                                                                        Answers to Review Questions            123




             13. C. The primary constraint is time. Since the trade show demos depend on project completion
                 and the trade show is in late September, the date cannot be moved. The budget is the secondary
                 constraint in this example.

             14. B. Stakeholder analysis is a tool and technique of Scope Definition used to determine and doc-
                 ument the needs, wants, and expectations of stakeholders and prioritize and quantify those
                 needs into project requirements.

             15. B. Product analysis includes techniques like value engineering, value analysis, systems analysis,
                 systems engineering, product breakdown, and functional analysis.

             16. D. The primary constraint is quality. If you made the assumption as stated in option B, you
                 assumed incorrectly. Clarify these assumptions with your stakeholders and project sponsors.
                 This applies to option C as well.

             17. C. This is an example of an assumption. You've used this vendor before and not had any prob-
                 lems. You're assuming there will be no problems with this delivery based on your past experience.

             18. B. Constraints restrict the actions of the project team.

             19. A. The project came about due to a business need. The phones have to be answered because
                 that's the core business. Upgrading the system to handle more volume is a business need. An
                 assumption has been made regarding vendor availability. Always validate your assumptions.

             20. B. The product scope description can be used as an input to the Scope Definition process when
                 the project charter and/or preliminary project scope statement are missing.

                                                       Create the WBS
3601.book Page 126 Wednesday, July 13, 2005 1:39 PM




                                                   Now that we have the deliverables and requirements well
                                                   defined, we'll begin the process of breaking down the work
                                                   of the project via a work breakdown structure (WBS). We'll
                    accomplish this task in the Create WBS process. The WBS defines the scope of the project and
                    breaks the work down into components that can be scheduled and estimated and easily mon-
                    itored and controlled.
                       Next we'll talk about how project information is documented and communicated. We've
                    talked a lot about documentation so far, and we will discuss it more in this chapter. Documen-
                    tation is something you will do throughout the remainder of the project, and the Communica-
                    tions Planning process details how to collect information, how to store it, and when and how
                    to distribute it to stakeholders.
                       We'll end this chapter by defining the quality plan in the Quality Planning process. This pro-
                    cess focuses on determining the quality standards that are necessary for the project and docu-
                    menting how we'll go about meeting them.



                    Creating the Work Breakdown Structure
                    Have you ever mapped out a family tree? In the Create WBS process, we'll construct something
                    like it called a work breakdown structure (WBS). It maps out the deliverables of the project with
                    subdeliverables and other components stemming from each major deliverable in a tree or chart
                    format. A Guide to the PMBOK describes a WBS as "a deliverable-oriented hierarchical decom-
                    position of the work to be executed by the project team, to accomplish the project objectives and
                    create the required deliverables. The WBS defines the total scope of the project." Simply put, a
                    WBS is a deliverable-oriented hierarchy that defines the work of the project and only the work
                    of the project. Like the scope statement, the WBS serves as a foundational agreement among the
                    stakeholders and project team members regarding project scope.



                    Exam Spotlight

                    The subdividing of deliverables into smaller components is the purpose of the Create WBS pro-
                    cess. A Guide to the PMBOK calls this decomposition, which is also a tool and technique of this
                    process.
3601.book Page 127 Wednesday, July 13, 2005 1:39 PM




                                                              Creating the Work Breakdown Structure             127




                The WBS will be used throughout many of the remaining Planning processes and is an impor-
             tant part of project planning. As you probably have concluded, everything we've done so far
             builds on the previous step. The project charter and preliminary scope statement outline the
             project goals and major deliverables. The project scope statement further refines these deliver-
             ables into an exhaustive list and documents the requirements of the deliverables. Now that com-
             prehensive list of deliverables produced in the project scope statement is going to be used to
             build the framework of the WBS.


                                   The importance and accuracy of the work you've done up to this point can't be
                                   stressed enough. Your WBS will only be as accurate as your list of deliverables.
                                   The deliverables will become the groupings that will form the higher levels of
                                   the WBS from which activities will be derived later in the Planning processes.

                The WBS should detail the full scope of work needed to complete the project. This break-
             down will smooth the way for estimating project cost and time, scheduling resources, and deter-
             mining quality controls later in the Planning processes. Project progress will be based on the
             estimates and measurements assigned to the WBS segments. So again, accuracy and complete-
             ness are required when composing your WBS.
                Before we begin constructing the WBS, we'll need to gather and review some important
             project documents. We'll look at those next.


             Gathering the WBS Inputs
             The inputs to the Create WBS process aren't new. They are as follows:
                  Organizational process assets
                  Project scope statement
                  Project scope management plan
                  Approved change requests
                The important thing to note about the inputs to this process is that the approved project
             scope statement is the document you will use to define and organize the work of the project in
             the WBS. Make certain you're using the most current version of the scope statement. And note
             also that the WBS, just like the project scope statement, contains the work of the project and
             only the work of the project.


             Decomposing the Deliverables
             There are two tools and techniques for the Create WBS process. The first is the work breakdown
             structure templates. Many organizations and application areas (industries) have WBS templates
             they use for their projects. Keep in mind that you may use a WBS from a previous project as a
             template for your current project also. If you work in the same organization, and the same
             department within the organization, you'll often find yourself working on the same types of
3601.book Page 128 Wednesday, July 13, 2005 1:39 PM




                    128         Chapter 4         Creating the WBS and Communicating the Plan



                    projects. WBS templates lend themselves well to this situation because even though a project is
                    unique, it's similar to projects you've worked on in the past and probably has similar life cycle
                    phases. Check with your PMO as they may also have WBS templates.
                       The next tool and technique is called decomposition. This technique involves breaking down
                    the deliverables into smaller, more manageable components of work. The idea here is to break
                    down the deliverables to a point where you can easily plan, execute, monitor and control, and
                    close out the project deliverables. Decomposition typically pertains to breaking deliverables
                    down into smaller deliverables, or component deliverables, where each level of the WBS (or
                    each level of decomposition) is a more detailed definition of the level above it.
                       This breaking-down or decomposing process will accomplish several things for you, one of
                    which is improving estimates. It's easier to estimate the costs, time, and resources needed for
                    individual work components than it is to estimate them for a whole body of work or deliverable.
                    Using smaller components also makes it easier to assign performance measures and controls.
                    These give you a baseline to compare against throughout the project or phase. And finally,
                    assigning resources and responsibility for the components of work makes better sense because
                    several resources with different skills might be needed to complete one deliverable. Breaking
                    them down assures that an assignment, and the responsibility for that assignment, goes to the
                    proper parties.
                       According to A Guide to the PMBOK, decomposition is a five-step process:
                    1.    Step one involves identifying all the major project deliverables and related work. A Guide
                          to the PMBOK makes a point of noting that the major deliverables are identified by using
                          the expert judgment technique to analyze the project scope statement.
                    2.    Step two involves organizing the work of the project and determining the WBS structure.


                                          We'll talk more about this in the next section, "Constructing the WBS."



                    3.    Step three involves decomposing the WBS levels into lower-level components. WBS com-
                          ponents, like the deliverables and requirements, should be defined in tangible, verifiable
                          terms so that performance and successful completion (or delivery) are easily measured and
                          verified. Each component must clearly describe the product, service, or result in verifiable
                          terms, and it must be assigned to a unit in the organization that will take responsibility for
                          completing the work and making certain of its accuracy.
                    4.    Step four is a process where you assign identification codes or numbers to each of the WBS
                          components.
                    5.    Step five is a verification step. Examine the decomposition to determine if all the compo-
                          nents are clear and complete. Determine if each component listed is absolutely necessary to
                          fulfill the requirements of the deliverable and verify that the decomposition is sufficient
                          enough to describe the work.

                                   We'll talk more about the process in step 4 in the section titled "Unique WBS
                                   Identifiers" later in this chapter.

                 The components you've identified can now be plugged into the WBS. This all sounds like a
             lot of work. I won't kid you--it is, but it's essential to project success. If you don't perform the
             WBS process adequately and accurately, you might end up setting yourself up for a failed
             project at worst or for lots of project changes, delayed schedules, and increased costs at best, not
             to mention all those team members who'll throw up their hands when you go back to them for
             the third or fourth time to ask that they redo work they've already completed. I know you won't
             let this happen, so let's move on to constructing the WBS.
                 There are several outputs of the Create WBS process, one of which is the WBS itself. We'll
             look at the specifics of how to create the WBS next.


             Constructing the WBS
             There is no "right" way to construct a WBS. In practice, the chart structure is used quite often.
             (This structure resembles an organization chart with different levels of detail.) But a WBS could
             be composed in outline form as well. The choice is yours. We'll look at both ways shortly, along
             with some figures that depict the different levels of a WBS.
                According the A Guide to the PMBOK, there are also several ways you can organize
             the WBS:
             Major deliverables and subprojects The major deliverables of the project are used as the first
             level of decomposition in this structure. If you're opening a new store, for example, the deliv-
             erables might include determining location, store build-out, furnishings, product, and so on.
             We'll talk about subprojects under the next heading.
             Subproject executed outside the project team Another way to organize the work is by sub-
             projects. Perhaps you're building out an existing highway and there are several subprojects
             involved. Some of your first level of decomposition may include these subprojects: demolition,
             design, bridgework, and paving. Each of the subprojects managers will develop a WBS for their
             subproject that details the work required for that deliverable. When subproject work is
             involved, often times the subproject work is contracted out. In our example, if we contracted
             out the bridgework deliverable, this subproject requires its own WBS, which the seller (the
             bridgework subcontractor) is responsible for creating as part of the contract and contract work.
             Project phases Many projects are structured or organized by project phases. For example, let's
             say you work in the construction industry. The project phases used in your industry might
             include project initiation, planning, design, build, inspection, and turnover. A feasibility study
             might be a deliverable under the project initiation phase, blueprints might be a deliverable under
             the planning phase, and so on. Each phase listed here would be the first level of decomposition
             (that is, the first level of the WBS) and their deliverables would be the next level and so on.

                    Combination approach This approach combines some or all of the methods we've talked
                    about. You may use project phases and major deliverables together as the first level of decom-
                    position. Or you could have subprojects listed with major deliverables. You can use this
                    approach in other levels of the WBS structure as well, not just the first level.
                          Let's take a look at some example WBS structures next.

                    Understanding the Various WBS Levels
                    Although the project manager is free to determine the number of levels in the WBS based on
                    the complexity of the project, all WBS structures start out with the project itself. Some WBS
                    structures show the project as level one. Others show the level under the project, or the first
                    level of decomposition, as level one. A Guide to the PMBOK notes that level one is the first level
                    of decomposition, so we'll follow that example here.
                       The first level of decomposition may be the deliverables, phases, or subprojects as we talked
                    about earlier. The levels that follow show more and more detail and may include more deliv-
                    erables, followed by requirements, and so on. Each of these breakouts is called a level in the
                    WBS. The lowest level of any WBS is called the work package level. (We'll talk more about this
                    in "Defining Work Packages" later in this chapter). The goal is to construct the WBS to the
                    work package level where we can easily and reliably estimate cost and schedule dates.



                    Exam Spotlight

                    Remember that each descending level of the WBS is a more detailed description of the project
                    deliverables than the level above it. Each component of the WBS should be defined clearly and
                    completely and should describe how the work of the project will be performed and controlled.




                                          There is some controversy among project managers over whether activities
                                          should be listed on the WBS. There isn't a rule in A Guide to the PMBOK regard-
                                          ing this; it's up to the project manager to determine how far to break the deliv-
                                          erables down and whether to include activities. In practice, I often include
                                          activities on my work breakdown structure for small projects as it facilitates
                                          other Planning processes later on. In this case, the activities are the work pack-
                                          age level. However, you should realize that large, complex projects will not
                                          likely list activities on the WBS. And for the exam, remember that you will
                                          decompose activities during the Activity Definition process that we'll talk about
                                          in Chapter 6, "Resource Planning," and that activities are not part of the WBS.

                       The easiest way to describe the steps for creating a WBS is with an example. Let's suppose
                    you work for a software company that publishes children's games. You're the project manager
                    for the new Billy Bob's Bassoon game, which teaches children about music, musical rhythm, and

                                                                      Creating the Work Breakdown Structure            131




             beginning sight reading. The first box on the WBS is the project name; it appears at the top of
             the WBS, as shown in Figure 4.1.
                 The next level is the first level of decomposition and should describe the major deliverables
             for the project. In this example, some of the deliverables might be requirements definition,
             design specifications, and programming. This isn't an exhaustive list of deliverables; in practice,
             you would go on to place all of your major deliverables into the WBS as level one content. For
             illustration purposes, just look at a slice of the WBS for this project. Figure 4.1 shows the WBS
             with level one detail added.

             FIGURE 4.1               WBS level one



                                                                       Billy Bob's Bassoon

                Level two content might be the component deliverables that are further broken out from the
             major deliverables of level one, or it might be requirements or activities that contribute to the
             deliverable. The Billy Bob's Bassoon example shows further deliverables as level two content.
             See Figure 4.2 for an illustration of the WBS so far.

                The goal here is to eventually break the work out to the point where responsibility and
             accountability for each work package can be assigned to an organizational unit or a team of
             people. I've decomposed this WBS to the activity level because it's a small project. An easy way

                    to differentiate between deliverables and activities in the WBS is to use nouns as the deliverable
                    descriptors and verbs as activity descriptors. Reaching way back to my grade school English, I
                    recall that a noun is a person, place, or thing. In this example, the deliverables in level one and
                    level two are described using nouns. The activity level, level three in the example in Figure 4.3,
                    is described using verbs, or action words. Some of the verbs used in level three are define, design,
                    and determine. There are many more activities that would go with these deliverables, but for the
                    sake of illustration, we've listed just a few for each deliverable to give you an idea of how the
                    WBS is constructed.

                       You can see from these illustrations how a poor scope definition or inadequate list of deliv-
                    erables will lead to a poorly constructed WBS. Not only will this make the WBS look sickly, but
                    the project itself will suffer and might even succumb to the dreaded premature project demise.
                    The final cost of the project will be higher than estimated, and lots of rework (translate as late
                    nights and weekends) will be needed to account for the missing work not listed on the WBS. You
                    can construct a good WBS and maintain a healthy project by taking the time to document all
                    the deliverables during the Scope Definition process.

             WBS Templates

             Don't forget that work breakdown structures can be constructed using WBS templates or the
             WBS from a similar completed project. A bit earlier, we mentioned that WBS templates are a
             tool and technique of the Create WBS process. While every project is unique, many companies
             and industries perform the same kind of projects over and over. The deliverables are similar
             from project to project, and they generally follow a consistent path. The WBS templates can be
             used in a case like this as a tool to simplify the WBS process, saving the project manager time.




                                   Large, complex projects are often composed of several subprojects that collec-
                                   tively make up the main project. The WBS for a project such as this would show
                                   the subprojects as level one detail. These subprojects' major deliverables
                                   would then be listed as level two content, perhaps more deliverables as level
                                   three, and so on.

                 Don't get too carried away when creating a WBS. The object is to define the work of the
             project so you can easily plan, manage, and monitor and control the work. But, you don't want
             to take this too far. If you decompose the work to the point that you're showing every minute
             detail, you've ventured into inefficiency and will find it more difficult to plan and manage. In
             addition, you're potentially stifling the creativity of the people working on the project because
             everything is so narrowly defined.
                 Sometimes, particularly when working on large projects that consist of several subprojects,
             some of the subprojects may not be scheduled to be worked on until a future date. Obviously,
             it makes sense to develop the WBS in detail at that future date when the deliverables and sub-
             projects are better known and more details are available. This technique is called rolling wave
             planning. The idea behind this technique is that you elaborate the work of the project to the
             level of detail you know about at the time. If a subproject or deliverable is scheduled sometime
             in the future, the only component that may appear on the WBS today is the subproject itself. As
             you get closer to the subproject, you'll elaborate the details of the subproject and record them
             on the WBS.



             Exam Spotlight

             Understand that rolling wave planning is a process of elaborating deliverables, project phases,
             or subprojects in the WBS to differing levels of decomposition depending on the expected date
             of the work. Work in the near term is elaborated in more detail than work to performed in the
             future.

                    Unique WBS Identifiers
                    Each element at each level of the WBS is generally assigned a unique identifier according to A
                    Guide to the PMBOK. This unique identifier is typically a number, and it's used to sum and
                    track the costs, schedule, and resources associated with the WBS elements. These numbers are
                    usually associated with the corporation's chart of accounts, which is used to track costs by cat-
                    egory. Collectively, these numeric identifiers are known as the code of accounts. The unique
                    identifiers for the requirements definition branch of the WBS might look something like this:

                    Defining Work Packages
                    As mentioned earlier, the project manager is free to determine the number of levels in the WBS based
                    on the complexity of the project. You need to include enough levels to accurately estimate project
                    time and costs but not so many levels that it's difficult to distinguish between the components.
                    Regardless of the number of levels in a WBS, the lowest level in a WBS is called a work package.
                       Work packages are the components that can be easily assigned to one person, or team of peo-
                    ple, with clear accountability and responsibility for completing the assignment. Assignments are
                    easily made at the work package level; however, assignments can be made at any level in the
                    WBS, as in the Lincoln Street office building scenario. The work package level is where time esti-
                    mates, cost estimates, and resource estimates are determined.
                       Work package levels on large projects can represent subprojects that are further decomposed
                    into their own work breakdown structures. They may also consist of project work that will be
                    completed by a vendor, another organization, or another department in your organization. If
                    you're giving project work to another department in your organization, you'll assign the work
                    packages to individual managers, who will in turn break them down into activities during the
                    Activity Definition process later in the Planning process group.
                       Work packages may be assigned to vendors or others external to the organization. For exam-
                    ple, perhaps one of the deliverables in your project is special packaging and a vendor is respon-
                    sible for completing this work. The vendor will likely treat this deliverable as a project within
                    their own organization and construct their own WBS with several levels of decomposition.
                    However, for your project, it's a deliverable listed at the work package level of the WBS.


                                          This may seem self-evident, but work elements not shown on the WBS are not
                                          included in the project. The same holds true for the project scope statement--
                                          if the deliverable isn't noted there, it isn't part of the project.

             The Lincoln Street Office Building

             Flagship International has just purchased a new building to house its growing staff. The folks
             at Flagship consider themselves very lucky to have won the bid on the property located in a
             prime section of the downtown area. The building is a historic building and is in need of some
             repairs and upgrades to make it suitable for office space. Constructing the renovations will
             require special handling and care as outlined in the Historical Society Building Revisions Guide.

             Alfredo Martini is the project manager assigned to the renovation project. Alfredo has already
             gathered the deliverables for this project. In so doing, he's discovered that he will not be able
             to manage all the work himself. He will need several subproject managers working on individ-
             ual deliverables, all reporting to him. Alfredo calls a meeting with the other project managers
             to deliver the WBS. Let's eavesdrop on the meeting.

             "As you all know, we're planning to move into the Lincoln Street building by November 1st.
             There is quite a bit of work to do between now and then, and I'm enlisting each of you to man-
             age a segment of this project. Take a look at this WBS."

             A portion of the WBS Alfredo constructed looks like this:

                    Alfredo continues, "I'm going to manage the Facility Safety project. Adrian, I'd like you to take
                    the Asbestos Abatement project, and Orlando, you're responsible for the Office Space project."

                    "Alfredo," Adrian says. "Asbestos abatement is going to take contractors and specialized
                    equipment. We don't have staff to do these tasks."

                    "I understand. You'll need to take charge of securing the contractor to handle this. Your respon-
                    sibility will be to manage the contractor and keep them on schedule," Alfredo answers.

                    Orlando reminds Alfredo that he's missed a deliverable on the WBS. "Part of the Office Space
                    project needs to include the network communications and telecommunications equipment
                    rooms. I don't see that on here."

                    "Good point, Orlando," Alfredo says. "The level two and three elements of this WBS are not
                    complete. Each of you has been assigned to the subproject level, level one. Your first assign-
                    ment is to meet back here in two weeks with a WBS for your subproject. And I'd like to see some
                    ideas about the staff assignments you'd make at the work package level and how long you think
                    these components will take. We'll refine those after we meet next."



                    Other Breakdown Structures
                    One point that A Guide to the PMBOK makes that I want you to be aware of is that you should
                    not confuse the WBS with other types of breakdown structures. I'm not sure why you would
                    confuse them, but the team who wrote the guide makes a point of telling you about it, so you
                    should be aware of it for the exam. Here are the other structures they point out that we'll see
                    as we proceed through the remaining project processes:
                    Organization breakdown structure (OBS) This is an organization chart that describes the hier-
                    archical nature of the organization, what departments exist, and who reports to whom. It can be
                    used to identify the organizational units responsible for the work package levels of the WBS.
                    Bill of materials (BOM) BOMs are typically used in the manufacturing industry and identify
                    the components needed to produce the product.
                    Risk breakdown structure (RBS) This is a hierarchical picture of the risks identified on the
                    project arranged by risk category.
                    Resource breakdown structure (RBS) This is a hierarchical description of the resources,
                    arranged by type, that will work on the project.
                          Now we'll move on to the remaining outputs of the Create WBS process.


                    Create WBS Process Outputs
                    There are six outputs of the Create WBS process:
                           Project scope statement updates
                           Work breakdown structure

                  WBS dictionary
                  Scope baseline
                  Project scope management plan updates
                  Requested changes
                We've covered the WBS in detail already. Updates to the scope statement and scope manage-
             ment plan may come about as a result of approved changes that occur when you're creating the
             WBS. You can see from the examples we've walked through in this chapter how new deliverables
             or requirements may surface as a result of working on the WBS. These requested changes (the last
             output here) should be reviewed and either approved or denied using your change control pro-
             cesses. (We'll talk about that in Chapter 9, "Measuring and Controlling Project Performance.")
             The approved changes should be noted in the project scope statement and the project management
             plan should be updated to reflect the new approved project scope statement.
                We'll look at the remaining outputs next.

             WBS Dictionary
             The WBS dictionary is where work component descriptions are documented. According to A
             Guide to the PMBOK, the WBS dictionary should include the following elements for each com-
             ponent of the WBS:
                  Code of accounts identifier
                  Statement of work, which describes the work of the component
                  Organization responsible for completing the component
                  List of schedule milestones
                Here are some other elements that you may include in the WBS dictionary for each component:
                  Contract information
                  Quality requirements for the component
                  Technical references that assist the responsible party with defining performance of the work
                Let's look at an example of what a WBS dictionary entry might look like. We'll use the work
             package level defined in the sidebar "The Lincoln Street Office Building" earlier called Inspec-
             tion and Identification. The WBS dictionary entry for this might look like the following:
             2.1 Inspection and Identification
             Statement of work: Inspect the building for asbestos and identify all areas where it's found.
             Update the plan for removal (WBS 2.2) with each location identified.
             Responsible organization: Adrian in Facilities will hire and oversee a contractor to perform
             this work.
             Schedule milestones: Inspection and identification to start after contractor is identified and
             hired (no later than July 1.) Work to be completed no later than Sep 15.
             Contract information: Two contractors have been identified as qualified and experienced in this
             type of work. Contract process to close no later than June 12.

                    138         Chapter 4         Creating the WBS and Communicating the Plan



                    Scope Baseline
                    Remember how I said that everything we've done so far has built upon itself? This is an impor-
                    tant concept you should know for this output. The scope baseline for the project is the approved
                    project scope statement, the WBS, and the WBS dictionary. (You'll recall from Chapter 3 that
                    the project scope statement serves as a baseline for future project decisions because it helps the
                    team determine whether requested changes are inside or outside of scope.) In other words, these
                    documents together describe in detail all of the work of the project. From these documents,
                    you'll document schedules, assign resources, and monitor and control the work of the project
                    according to what's described here.



                    Exam Spotlight

                    The scope baseline is defined as the detailed project scope statement, the WBS, and the WBS
                    dictionary. Understand this concept for the exam.



                       If the WBS is constructed well, you've given yourself a huge helping hand with the remaining
                    Planning processes. The completion of many of the remaining processes depend on the project
                    scope statement and WBS to be accurate and complete. In Chapter 6, for example, we'll use the
                    work packages created here to further elaborate the work into activities. From there, costs can
                    be estimated, schedules can be developed, and so on. Before we get there though, we're going
                    to take a little breather and look at some of the other Planning processes important to your
                    project. Don't forget about the WBS! We're going to come back to this in the later planning
                    chapters of this book.



                    Communicating the Plan
                    We've talked a good deal about documentation so far, and this topic will continue to come up
                    throughout the remainder of the book. Keeping good documentation should become the motto
                    of all good project managers. "Is that documented?" should be an ever-present question on the
                    mind of the project manager. Documentation can save your bacon, so to speak, later in the
                    project. Documentation is only one side of the equation though--communication is the other.
                    You and your stakeholders need to know who gets what information and when.
                       The Communications Planning process involves determining the communication needs of
                    the stakeholders by defining the types of information needed, the format for communicating the
                    information, how often it's distributed, and who prepares it. All of this is documented in the
                    communications management plan, which is the only output of this process.
3601.book Page 139 Wednesday, July 13, 2005 1:39 PM




                                                                            Communicating the Plan         139




                                   Pop quiz: Do you remember where else the communications management plan
                                   belongs? I'll give you the answer later in the section "Communications Man-
                                   agement Plan."




             Communications Planning Inputs
             The inputs to the Communications Planning process will look very familiar to you. They are as
             follows:
                  Enterprise environmental factors
                  Organizational process assets
                  Project scope statement
                  Constraints and assumptions elements of the project management plan
                A Guide to the PMBOK notes that all the elements described in the enterprise environmental
             factors and in the organizational process assets are inputs to this process. However, special note
             is made of the lessons learned and historical information elements of the organizational process
             assets input. Information you learn as you're progressing through the project is documented as
             lessons learned. This information is helpful for future projects of similar scope and complexity.
             Historical information is also useful to review when starting the Communications Planning pro-
             cess. Either of these documents may contain information about communication decisions on
             past projects and their results. Why reinvent the wheel? If something didn't work well on a past
             project, you'd want to know that before implementing that procedure on this project, so review
             past project documentation.
                The project scope management plan (we talked about this in Chapter 3) provides a common
             understanding of project scope among the stakeholders and serves a basis for future project
             decisions. (I'm sure you have this definition memorized by now--that's good.) Since you per-
             formed stakeholder analysis as part of the Scope Definition process (which produced the project
             scope statement as an output that became an input to this process), you should review the stake-
             holder analysis and refresh your memory on their communication needs.
                The project management plan defines how the subsidiary plans will be defined and integrated
             into the overall project management plan. As such, it's rich with constraints and assumptions
             that you should review as they pertain to stakeholder communication needs.


             Tools and Techniques for Communications Planning
             The Communications Planning process concerns defining the types of information you're going
             to deliver, to whom, and when and then documenting this. There are two tools and techniques
             in this process to help determine these elements. They are communications requirements anal-
             ysis and communications technology. We'll look at both of these next.

                    140         Chapter 4         Creating the WBS and Communicating the Plan



                    Requirements Analysis
                    Communications requirements analysis involves analyzing and determining the communication
                    needs of the project stakeholders. According to A Guide to the PMBOK, there are several
                    sources of information you can examine to help determine these needs, including the following:
                          Company and departmental organizational charts
                          Stakeholder relationships
                          Other departments and business units involved on the project
                          The number of resources involved on the project and where they're located in relation to
                          project activities
                          External needs that organizations like the media, government, or industry groups may have
                          that require communication updates
                          Communication needs that are internal to the organization
                          Stakeholder information (a lot of this was documented during stakeholder analysis)
                        This tool and technique requires an analysis of the items in the preceding list to make certain you're
                    communicating information that's valuable to the stakeholders. Communicating valuable informa-
                    tion doesn't mean you always paint a rosy picture. Communications to stakeholders may consist of
                    either good or bad news--the point is that you don't want to bury stakeholders in too much infor-
                    mation but give them enough so that they're informed and can make appropriate decisions.
                        Project communication will always involve more than one person, even on the tiniest of
                    projects. As such, communication network models have been devised to try to explain the rela-
                    tionships between people and the number or type of interactions needed between project par-
                    ticipants. What you need to remember for the exam is that network models consist of nodes
                    with lines connecting the nodes that indicate the number of communication channels, also
                    known as lines of communication. Figure 4.4 shows an example of a network communication
                    model with six channels of communication.
                        The nodes are the participants, and the lines show the connection between them all. You'll
                    need to know how to calculate the number of communication channels when you take the
                    exam. You could draw them out as in this example and count up the lines, but there's an easier
                    way. The formula for calculating the lines of communication is as follows:
                        (number of participants x (number of participants less one)) divided by two
                        Here's the calculation in mathematical terms:
                          n (n - 1) / 2
                       Figure 4.4 shows six participants, so let's plug that into the formula to determine the lines
                    of communication:
                          6 (6 - 1) / 2 = 15

                    I recommend you memorize the communications channel formula before taking the exam.

             Communications Technology
             The second tool and technique of this process is communications technology. This examines the
             methods (or technology) used to communicate the information to, from, and among the stake-
             holders. Methods of communicating can take many forms, such as written, spoken, e-mail, for-
             mal status reports, meetings, online databases, online schedules, and so on. This tool and
             technique examines the technology elements that may affect project communications. You
             should consider several factors before deciding what methods you'll choose to transfer infor-
             mation. The timing of the information exchange or need for updates is the first factor. The avail-
             ability of the technology you're planning on using to communicate project information is
             important as well. Do you need to procure new technology or systems, or are there systems
             already in place that will work? Staff experience with the technology is another factor. Are the
             project team members and stakeholders experienced at using this technology, or will you need
             to train them? Finally, consider the duration of the project and the project environment. Will the
             technology you're choosing work throughout the life of the project or will it have to be
             upgraded or updated at some point? And how does the project team function? Are they all
             located together or spread out across several campuses or locations?
                 The answers to these questions should be documented in the communications management
             plan. We'll cover that next.


             Communications Management Plan
             All projects require sound communication plans, but not all projects will have the same types of
             communication or the same methods for distributing the information. The communications man-
             agement plan, which is the only output of the Communications Planning process, documents the

                    types of information needs the stakeholders have, when the information should be distributed,
                    and how the information will be delivered. The answer to the pop quiz I opened this section with
                    is the communications management plan, which is a subsidiary plan of the project management
                    plan we talked about in Chapter 3.
                        The type of information you will typically communicate includes project status, project
                    scope statements and scope statement updates, project baseline information, risks, action items,
                    performance measures, project acceptance, and so on. We'll cover all of these topics in greater
                    detail in the remaining chapters of this book. What's important to know now is that the infor-
                    mation needs of the stakeholders should be determined as early in the Planning process group
                    as possible so that as you and your team develop project planning documents, you already know
                    who should receive copies of them and how they should be delivered.
                        According to A Guide to the PMBOK, the communications management plan typically
                    describes the following elements:
                          Name of the item to be communicated
                          Purpose for communication
                          Frequency of communications
                          Time frame for distribution, including starting and ending dates
                          Format of the communication and method of transmission
                          Person responsible for distributing the information
                       The information that will be shared with stakeholders and the distribution methods are
                    based on the needs of the stakeholders, the project complexity, and the organizational policies.
                    Some communications may be informal--a chat by the water cooler, for instance--while other
                    communications are written and a copy is filed with the project files.



                    Exam Spotlight

                    The communications management plan documents how the communication needs of the
                    stakeholders will be met, including the types of information that will be communicated, who
                    will communicate it, who receives the communication, the methods used to communicate, the
                    timing and frequency, the method for updating this plan as the project progresses, escalation
                    process, and a glossary of common terms.



                       You might consider setting up an intranet site for your project and posting the appropriate
                    project documentation there for the stakeholders to access any time they wish. If you use this
                    method, make sure to document it in the communications management plan and notify your
                    stakeholders when updates or new communication is posted.


                                          Chapter 8, "Developing the Project Team," discusses communication methods
                                          in more depth.

             Identifying Quality Standards
             Quality is affected by the triple constraints (project scope, schedule, and cost), and quality con-
             cerns are found in all projects. Quality typically defines whether stakeholder expectations were
             met. Being on time and on budget is one thing; if you deliver the wrong product or an inferior
             product, on time and on budget suddenly don't mean much.
                The Quality Planning process is concerned with targeting quality standards that are relevant
             to the project at hand and devising a plan to meet and satisfy those standards. The quality man-
             agement plan is an output of this process that describes how the quality policy will be imple-
             mented by the project management team during the course of the project. Another key output
             of this process is the process improvement plan, which documents the actions for analyzing pro-
             cesses to ultimately increase customer value. Everything discussed in this section, including the
             inputs and tools and techniques of this process, will be used to help develop these two primary
             outputs.



             Exam Spotlight

             Quality Planning is a key process performed during the Planning processes and when devel-
             oping the project management plan. It should be performed in conjunction with other Planning
             processes. According to A Guide to the PMBOK, "...quality is planned, designed, and built in--
             not inspected in."




             Quality Inputs
             The Quality Planning process has several inputs:
                  Enterprise environmental factors
                  Organizational process assets
                  Project scope statement
                  Project management plan
                The two key elements we'll cover regarding inputs are standards and regulations (which are
             part of the enterprise environmental factors input) and the quality policy (which is part of the
             organizational process assets input).

             Standards and Regulations
             The project manager should consider any standards, regulations, guidelines, or rules that exist
             concerning the work of the project when writing the quality plan. A standard is something that's
             approved by a recognized body and that employs rules, guidelines, or characteristics that should
             be followed. For example, the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) has established standards

                    144         Chapter 4         Creating the WBS and Communicating the Plan



                    for web page designers that outline alternative viewing options of web pages for people with dis-
                    abilities. PMI guidelines regarding project management are another example of standards.
                        Standards aren't mandatory, but it's a good idea to follow them. For example, if you're creating
                    a new software product that ignores standard protocols, your customers won't be able to use it.
                        Standards can be set by the organization, by independent bodies or organizations such as the
                    International Organization for Standardization (ISO), and so on.
                        A regulation is mandatory. Regulations are almost always imposed by governments or insti-
                    tutions like the American Medical Association. However, organizations may have their own
                    self-imposed regulations that you should be aware of as well. Regulations require strict adher-
                    ence, particularly in the case of government-imposed regulations, or stiff penalties and fines
                    could result--maybe even jail time if the offense is serious enough. Hmm, might be tough to
                    practice project management from behind bars--not a recommended career move.
                        If possible, it's a good idea to include information from the quality policy (we'll cover this in
                    the next section) and any standards, regulations, or guidelines that affect the project in the qual-
                    ity management plan. If it's not possible to include this information in the quality management
                    plan, then at least make reference to the information and where it can be found. It's the project
                    management team's responsibility to be certain all stakeholders are aware of and understand
                    the policy issues and standards or regulations that might impact the project.


                                          Contracts might have certain provisions for quality requirements that you
                                          should account for in the quality management plan. These provisions will also
                                          be discussed during the Procurement Planning processes. If the quality man-
                                          agement plan has already been written by the time these processes are per-
                                          formed, you should update the quality plan to reflect it.



                    Quality Policy
                    The quality policy is part of the organizational process assets input. It's a guideline published
                    by executive management that describes what quality policies should be adopted for projects
                    the company undertakes. It's up to the project manager to understand this policy and incorpo-
                    rate any predetermined company guidelines into the quality plan. If a quality policy does not
                    exist, it's up to the project management team to create one for the project.


                    Quality Planning Tools and Techniques
                    The Quality Planning process has five tools and techniques used to help construct the quality
                    management plan:
                          Cost-benefit analysis
                          Benchmarking
                          Design of experiments
                          Cost of quality
                          Additional quality planning tools

                Make sure you understand each of these tools and techniques and its purpose for the exam.
             Let's take a look them now.

             Cost-Benefit Analysis
             You've seen the cost-benefit analysis technique before in the Initiating process group. In the case
             of quality management, you'll want to consider the trade-offs of the cost of quality. It's cheaper
             and more efficient to prevent defects in the first place than to have to spend time and money fix-
             ing them later. The benefits of meeting quality requirements are as follows:
                  Stakeholder satisfaction is increased.
                  Costs are lower.
                  Productivity is higher.
                  There is less rework.
                A Guide to the PMBOK notes that the primary cost of meeting quality requirements for a
             project are the expenses incurred while performing project quality management activities.

             Benchmarking
             Benchmarking is a process of comparing previous similar activities to the current project activ-
             ities to provide a standard to measure performance against. This comparison will also help you
             derive ideas for quality improvements on the current project. For example, if your current
             printer can produce 8 pages per minute and you're considering a new printer that produces 14
             pages per minute, the benchmark is 8 pages per minute.

             Design of Experiments
             Design of experiments (DOE) is a statistical technique that identifies the elements--or vari-
             ables--that will have the greatest effect on overall project outcomes. It is used most often con-
             cerning the product of the project but can also be applied to project management processes to
             examine trade-offs. DOE designs and sets up experiments to determine the ideal solution for a
             problem using a limited number of sample cases. It analyzes several variables at once, allowing
             you to change all (or some of) the variables at the same time and determine which combination
             will produce the best result at a reasonable cost.



             Exam Spotlight

             For the exam, remember that the key to DOE is that it equips you with a statistical framework
             that allows you to change all the important variables at once instead of changing one variable
             at a time.

                    Cost of Quality
                    The cost of quality (COQ) is the total cost to produce the product or service of the project
                    according to the quality standards. These costs include all the work necessary to meet the prod-
                    uct requirements whether the work was planned or unplanned. It also includes the costs of work
                    performed due to nonconforming quality requirements.
                       There are three costs associated with the cost of quality:
                    Prevention costs Prevention means keeping defects out of the hands of customers. Prevention
                    costs are the costs associated with satisfying customer requirements by producing a product
                    without defects. These costs are manifested early on in the process and include things like qual-
                    ity planning, training, design review, and contractor and supplier costs.
                    Appraisal costs Appraisal costs are the costs expended to examine the product or process and
                    make certain the requirements are being met. Appraisal costs might include costs associated
                    with things like inspections and testing. Prevention and appraisal costs are often passed on to
                    the acquiring organization due to the limited duration of the project.
                    Failure costs Failure costs are what it costs when things don't go according to plan. Failure
                    costs are also known as cost of poor quality. There are two types of failure costs:
                          Internal failure costs These result when customer requirements are not satisfied while the
                          product is still in the control of the organization. Internal failure costs may include corrective
                          action, rework, scrapping, and downtime.
                          External failure costs These occur when the product has reached the customer and they
                          determine that their requirements have not been met. Costs associated with external failure
                          costs may include inspections at the customer site, returns, and customer service costs.


                                          The cost of quality can be affected by project decisions. Let's say you're produc-
                                          ing a new product. Unfortunately, the product scope description and/or project
                                          scope statement were inadequate to describe the functionality of the product.
                                          And, the project team produced the product exactly as specified in the project
                                          scope statement, WBS, and other planning documents. Once the product hit the
                                          store shelves, the organization was bombarded with returns and warranty
                                          claims because of the poor quality. Therefore, your project decisions impacted
                                          the cost of quality. Recall of products can also impact the cost of quality.

                       Cost of quality is a topic you'll likely encounter on the exam. This section will discuss some
                    of the pioneers in this field. Quality must be planned into the project, not inspected in after the
                    fact to make certain the product or service meets stakeholders' expectations.
                       Three people in particular are responsible for the rise of the quality management movement
                    and the theories behind the cost of quality: Philip B. Crosby, Joseph M. Juran, and W. Edwards
                    Deming. Each of these men developed steps or points that led to commonly accepted quality
                    processes that we use today and either developed or were the foundation for the development
                    of quality processes such as Total Quality Management, Six Sigma, Cost of Quality, and Con-
                    tinuous Improvement. We'll also look at a quality technique called the Kaizen approach that
                    originated in Japan.

             Philip B. Crosby
             Philip B. Crosby devised the zero defects practice, which means, basically, do it right the first
             time. (Didn't your dad use to tell you this?) Crosby says that costs will increase when quality
             planning isn't performed up front, which means you'll have to engage in rework, thus affecting
             productivity. Prevention is the key to Crosby's theory. If you prevent the defect from occurring
             in the first place, costs are lower, conformance to requirements is easily met, and the cost mea-
             surement for quality becomes the cost of nonconformance rather than the cost of rework.

             Joseph M. Juran
             Joseph M. Juran is noted for his fitness for use premise. Simply put, this means the stakeholders'
             and customers' expectations are met or exceeded. This says that conformance to specifica-
             tions--meaning the product of the project that was produced is what the project set out to pro-
             duce--is met or exceeded. Fitness for use specifically reflects the customers' or stakeholders'
             view of quality and answers the following questions:
                "Did the product or service produced meet the quality expectation?"
                "Did it satisfy a real need?"
                "Is it reliable and safe?"
                Juran also proposed that there could be grades of quality. However, you should not confuse
             grade with quality. Grade is a category for products or services that are of the same type but
             have differing technical characteristics. Quality describes how well the product or service (or
             characteristics of the product or service) fulfills the requirements. Low quality is usually not an
             acceptable condition; however, low grade might be. For example, your new Dad's Dollars
             Credit Card software tracking system might be of high quality, meaning there are no bugs and
             the product performs as advertised, but of low grade, meaning there are few features. You'll
             almost always want to strive for high quality, regardless of the acceptable grade level.

             W. Edwards Deming
             W. Edwards Deming suggested that as much as 85 percent of the cost of quality is a manage-
             ment problem. Once the quality issue has hit the floor, or the worker level, the workers have lit-
             tle control. For example, if you're constructing a new highway and the management team that
             bid on the project proposed using inferior-grade asphalt, the workers laying the asphalt have lit-
             tle control over its quality. They're at the mercy of the management team that purchased the
             supplies.
                 Deming also proposed that workers cannot figure out quality on their own and thus cannot
             perform at their best. He believed that workers need to be shown what acceptable quality is and
             that they need to be made to understand that quality and continuous improvement are necessary
             elements of any organization--or project in your case.

                        Many consider Deming to be the founder (or major contributor) of Total Quality Manage-
                    ment (TQM). TQM, like Deming, says that the process is the problem, not people. Every person
                    and all activities the company undertakes are involved with quality. TQM stipulates that qual-
                    ity must be managed in and that quality improvement should be a continuous way of doing
                    business, not a one-time performance of a specific task or process.
                        Six Sigma is a quality management approach that is similar to TQM and is typically used in
                    manufacturing and service-related industries. Six Sigma is a measurement-based strategy that
                    focuses on process improvement and variation reduction by applying Six Sigma methodologies
                    to the project. There are two Six Sigma methodologies. The first is known as DMADV (define,
                    measure, analyze, design, and verify) and is used to develop new processes or products at the Six
                    Sigma level. The second is called DMAIC (define, measure, analyze, improve, and control) and
                    is used to improve existing processes or products. Another tidbit you should understand about
                    Six Sigma is that it aims to eliminate defects and stipulates that no more than 3.4 defects per mil-
                    lion are produced.

                    Kaizen Approach
                    The Kaizen approach is a quality technique from Japan. In fact, Kaizen means continuous
                    improvement in Japanese. With this technique, all project team members and managers should
                    be constantly watching for quality improvement opportunities. The Kaizen approach states that
                    you should improve the quality of the people first, then the quality of the products or service.
                       Continuous improvement involves everyone in the organization watching for ways to
                    improve quality, whether incrementally or by incorporating new ideas into the process. This
                    involves taking measurements, improving processes by making them repeatable and systemized,
                    reducing variations in production or performance, reducing defects, and improving cycle times.
                    TQM and Six Sigma are examples of continuous improvement.



                    Exam Spotlight

                    Understand each of these men's theories on the cost of quality for the exam. Here's a key to
                    help you remember:

                          Crosby = zero defects and prevention or rework results.

                          Juran = fitness for use, conformance.

                          Deming = quality is a management problem.

                          TQM = quality must be managed in and must be a continuous process.

                          Six Sigma = Six Sigma is a measurement based strategy; no more than 3.4 defects per
                          million.

                          Kaizen = continuous improvement, improve quality of people first.

                          Continuous improvement = watch continuously for ways to improve quality.

             Additional Quality Planning Tools
             The last tool and technique of the Quality Planning process is additional quality planning tools.
             A Guide to the PMBOK lists these additional tools as follows:
                  Brainstorming and nominal group techniques (We'll cover both of these in Chapter 5,
                  "Risk Planning.")
                  Flowcharts (We'll cover this one in Chapter 10, "Measuring and Reporting Project Objectives.")
                  Affinity diagrams
                  Force field analysis
                  Matrix diagram
                  Prioritization matrices
                I would memorize the names of these additional quality planning tools for the exam, but
             more importantly, you should understand both the names and concepts of the other tools and
             techniques we've already talked about in this section.


             Quality Planning Outputs
             Quality Planning uses many techniques to determine the areas of quality improvement that can
             be implemented, controlled, and measured throughout the rest of the project, as you've seen.
             These are recorded in the primary output of this process, which is called the quality manage-
             ment plan. The following list includes other outputs of this process:
                  Quality metrics
                  Quality checklists
                  Process improvement plan
                  Quality baseline
                  Project management plan updates
                Project management plan updates may come about as a result of changes to the quality man-
             agement plan, which in turn may come about as result of changes or corrections resulting from
             the Perform Quality Assurance process. We'll talk about Perform Quality Assurance in Chapter 9.
             We'll look at the remaining outputs of Quality Planning next.

             Quality Management Plan
             The quality management plan describes how the project management team will enact the qual-
             ity policy. It should document the resources needed to carry out the quality plan, the responsi-
             bilities of the project team in implementing quality, and all the processes and procedures the
             project team and organization should use to satisfy quality requirements, including quality con-
             trol, quality assurance techniques, and continuous improvement processes.
                 The quality management plan is written by the project manager in cooperation with the
             project staff. You can assign quality actions to the activities listed on the work breakdown struc-
             ture (WBS) based on the quality plan requirements. Isn't that WBS a handy thing? Later in the

                    Perform Quality Control process, measurements will be taken to determine if the quality to date
                    is on track with the quality standards outlined in the quality management plan.



                    Exam Spotlight

                    The Quality Management knowledge area, which includes the Quality Planning, Perform Qual-
                    ity Assurance, and Perform Quality Control processes, involves the quality management of the
                    project as well as the quality aspects of the product or service the project was undertaken to
                    produce. We'll discuss Quality Assurance and Quality Control in later chapters.



                    Quality Metrics
                    A quality metric, also known as operational definition, describes what is being measured and
                    how it will be measured by the Perform Quality Control process. For example, let's say you're
                    managing the opening of a new restaurant in July of next year. Perhaps one of the deliverables
                    is the procurement of flatware for 500 place settings. The operational definition in this case
                    might include the date the flatware must be delivered and a counting or inventory process to
                    ensure you received the number of place settings you ordered. Measurements consist of actual
                    values, not yes or no results. In our example, receiving the flatware is a yes or no result (you have
                    it or you don't), but the date it was delivered and the number of pieces delivered are actual val-
                    ues. Failure rates are another type of quality metric that is measurable, as are reliability, avail-
                    ability, test coverage, and defect density measurements.

                    Quality Checklists
                    If you're like me, you start your day at the office with a big to-do list that has so many items on
                    it you won't be able to finish them all. Nevertheless, you faithfully write the list every day and
                    check off the things that you accomplish throughout the day. Checklists are like this in that they
                    provide a means to determine if the required steps in a process have been followed. As each step
                    is completed, it's checked off the list. Checklists can be activity specific or industry specific and
                    might be very complex or easy to follow. Sometimes, organizations may have standard checklists
                    they use for projects. You might also be able to obtain checklists from professional associations.



                    Exam Spotlight

                    Be aware that checklist shows up as both a process output and tool and technique. Quality
                    checklists are an output of the Quality Planning process and checklist analysis is a tool and
                    technique of the Risk Identification process.

             Candy Works

             Juliette Walters is a contract project manager for Candy Works. It has introduced a new line of
             hard candy drops in various exotic flavors: caffe latte, hot buttered popcorn, and jalapeno
             spice, just to name a few.

             Juliette is writing the quality management plan for this project. After interviewing stakeholders
             and key team members, she's found several quality factors of importance to the organization.
             Quality will be measured by the following criteria:

             Candy size      Each piece should measure 3 mm.

             Appearance       No visible cracks or breaks should appear in the candy.

             Flavor    Flavor must be distinguishable when taste-tested.

             Number produced The production target is 9,000 pieces per week. The current machine has
             been benchmarked at 9,200 candies per week.

             Intensity of color     There should be no opaqueness in the darker colors.

             Wrappers Properly fitting wrappers cover the candies, folding over twice in back and twisted
             on each side. There is a different wrapper for each flavor of candy, and they must be matched
             exactly.

             The candy is cooked and then pulled into a long cylinder shape roughly 6 feet long and 2 feet
             in diameter. This cylinder is fed into the machine that molds and cuts the candy into drops. The
             cylinders vary a little in size, because they're hand-stretched by expert candy makers prior to
             feeding them into the drop maker machine. As a result, the end of one flavor batch--the caffe
             latte flavor--and the beginning of the next batch--the hot buttered popcorn flavor--merge.
             This means the drops that fall into the collection bins are intermingled during the last run of the
             first flavor batch. In other words, the last bin of the caffe latte flavor run has some hot buttered
             popcorn drops mixed in. And, there isn't a way to separate the drops once they've hit the bin.
             From here, the drops go on to the candy-wrapping machine, where brightly colored wrappers
             are matched to the candy flavor. According to the quality plan, hot buttered popcorn drops can-
             not be wrapped as caffe latte drops. Juliette ponders what to do.

             As she tosses and turns that night thinking about the problem, it occurs to her to present this
             problem as an opportunity to the company rather than as a problem. In order to keep produc-
             tion in the 9,000 candies per week category, the machines can't be stopped every time a new
             batch is introduced. So Juliette comes up with the idea to wrap candies from the intermixed
             bins with wrappers that say "Mystery Flavor." This way, production keeps pace with the plan,
             and the wrapper/flavor quality problem is mitigated.

                    152         Chapter 4         Creating the WBS and Communicating the Plan



                    Process Improvement Plan
                    The process improvement plan focuses on finding inefficiencies in a process or activity and elim-
                    inating them. The idea here is that if you're doing activities or performing processes that don't
                    add any value, you'll want to either stop doing what you're doing or modify the process so that
                    you are adding value. You should note that the process improvement plan is a subsidiary plan
                    of the project management plan. Some of the elements you should consider when thinking about
                    process improvement are the process boundaries, which describes the purpose for the process
                    and its expected start and end dates; the process configuration so that you know what processes
                    are performed when and how they interact; the process metrics; and any specific elements you
                    want to target for improvement.

                    Quality Baseline
                    Almost everything you've done throughout this process culminates in the quality baseline. The
                    quality baseline is the quality objective of the project. It's what you'll use to measure and report
                    quality against as you perform the remaining Quality processes.


                                          One of the results of the Quality Planning process is that your product or pro-
                                          cess may require adjustments to conform to the quality policy and standards.
                                          These changes may result in cost changes and schedule changes. You may
                                          also discover that you'll need to perform risk analysis techniques for problems
                                          you uncover or when making adjustments as a result of this process.




                    Project Case Study: New Kitchen Heaven Retail Store

                    You're just finishing a phone conversation with Jill, and you see Dirk headed toward your
                    office.

                    Dirk walks in, crosses his arms over his chest, and stands next to your desk with an "I'm here
                    for answers" look.

                    "I thought I'd drop by and see if you have signed a lease and gotten Jake started on that build-
                    out yet," says Dirk.

                    "I just got off the phone with Jill," you reply. "The realtor found a great location and we've set
                    up a tour at the end of this week."

                    "What's been the holdup?" Dirk asks. "I thought we'd be ready to start the build-out about now."

                    "I've been working on the project plans."

                    "Project plans," Dirk interrupts. "We already have a plan. That scope thing you drew up last
                    week spelled things out pretty clearly."
3601.book Page 153 Wednesday, July 13, 2005 1:39 PM




                                                                                  Identifying Quality Standards     153




             "The charter was the project kickoff, and the project scope statement listed all the deliverables
             and requirements. From there I had to break the work of the project down into manageable
             units of work. So, I've drawn up a work breakdown structure with all the deliverables shown in
             a tree structure that I'd like to go over with you before showing it to the project team."

             "We aren't building trees; we're building a new store. I don't understand why you're wasting
             all this time planning. We all know what the objectives are."

             "Dirk," you reply, "if we put the right amount of effort and time into planning, the actual work
             of the project should go pretty smoothly. Planning is probably one of the most important things
             we can do on this project. If we don't plan correctly, we might miss something very important
             that could delay the store opening. That date is pretty firm, I thought."

             "Yes, the date is firm. But I don't see how we could miss anything. You and I have met several
             times, and I know you've met with Jill and Jake. They're the other key players on this."

             "You're right. I have met with Jill and Jake. And that's a perfect example of why we need to
             plan. When I met with Jill, she told me how all the store's data is communicated via a satellite
             network connection on a nightly basis. That means we need to involve the IT group."

             You glance down at your notes. "Ricardo Ramirez heads up IT. I spoke with him last week about
             his deliverables, and I've included his group as a subproject on the work breakdown structure."

             "Oh," Dirk replies. "I forgot about IT. You're right, that's an important part of the project, and
             we can't leave them out. Don't tell Ricardo I said this, but I'm not very technical myself and
             don't really know what you're going to need from him. I do know he also takes care of wiring
             and installing the point-of-sale terminals, but you'll have to work all that out with him. Okay, I'm
             beginning to see why you're taking planning seriously. Let's have a look at this work break-
             down structure."

                    "Looks good to me."

                    "Great. Two more items, Dirk. After meeting with Jake, Ricardo, and Jill, I've also drafted a
                    communication plan and a quality management plan. The communication plan describes the
                    kind of information they need to receive, when, and how. And the quality management
                    plan...well you know the old saying, `Do it right the first time.' It describes the plan for imple-
                    menting our quality policy. I also took the time to write down the specific quality metrics we're
                    looking for, including the lease signing date (this one must start and finish on time) and the IT
                    equipment specifications, and Jill's documented the gourmet products and the cookware line
                    specifications.

                             Decomposed deliverables into a WBS

                             WBS includes:

                               Level one is subprojects or deliverables.

                               Level two is deliverables or activities.

                               Remaining levels are activities.

                               Last level of WBS is the work package level, where time and cost estimates can be
                               defined in the next process.

                             Documented the communications management plan, including:

             Summary
             A WBS is a deliverable-oriented group of project essentials. The highest levels of the WBS are
             described using nouns, and the lowest levels are described with verbs. Each element in the WBS
             has its own set of objectives and deliverables that must be met in order to fulfill the deliverables
             of the next highest level and ultimately the project itself. In this way, the WBS validates the com-
             pleteness of the work.
                 The lowest level of the WBS is known as work packages. This breakdown allows the project
             manager to determine cost estimates, time estimates, resource assignments, and quality controls.
                 The purpose of the communications management plan is determining the communication
             needs of the stakeholders by defining the types of information needed, the format for commu-
             nicating the information, how often it's distributed, and who prepares it. This plan is a subsid-
             iary plan of the project management plan.
                 Quality Planning targets the quality standards that are relevant to your project. The quality
             management plan outlines how the project team will enact the quality policy.
                 You need to consider the cost of quality when considering stakeholder needs. Three men led
             to the rise of the cost of quality theories. Crosby is known for his zero defects theory, Juran for
             the fitness for use theory, and Deming for contributing 85 percent of cost of quality to the man-
             agement team. The Kaizen approach says that the project team should continuously be on the
             lookout for ways to improve the process and that people should be improved first, then the
             quality of the products or services. TQM and Six Sigma are examples of continuous improve-
             ment techniques.
                 Cost-benefit analysis considers trade-offs in the Quality Planning process. Benchmarking
             compares previous similar activities to the current project activities to provide a standard to
             measure performance against. Design of experiments is an analytical technique that determines
             what variables have the greatest effect on the project outcomes. This technique equips you with
             a statistical framework, allowing you to change all the important variables at once instead of
             changing one variable at a time.
                 Cost of quality involves three types of costs: prevention, appraisal, and failure costs; the latter
             is also known as the cost of poor quality. Failure costs include both internal and external costs.
                 The process improvement plan is a subsidiary plan of the project management plan and tar-
             gets inefficiencies in a process or activity. The quality baseline is used to document the quality
             objectives of the project and is used as a basis for future Quality processes.



             Exam Essentials
             Be able to define a WBS and its components. The WBS is a deliverable-oriented hierarchy. It
             uses the deliverables from the project scope statement or similar documents and decomposes
             them into logical, manageable units of work. Level one is the major deliverable level or

                    subproject level, level two is a further elaboration of the deliverables, and so on. The lowest level
                    of any WBS is called a work package.
                    Be able to describe the purpose of the communications management plan. The communica-
                    tions management plan determines the communication needs of the stakeholders. It documents
                    what information will be distributed, how it will be distributed, to whom, and the timing of the
                    distribution.
                    Be able to identify the benefits of meeting quality requirements The benefits of meeting qual-
                    ity requirements include increased stakeholder satisfaction, lower costs, higher productivity,
                    and less rework and are discovered during the Quality Planning process.
                    Be able to define the cost of quality The COQ is the total cost to produce the product or ser-
                    vice of the project according to the quality standards. These costs include all the work necessary
                    to meet the product requirements. The three costs associated with cost of quality are prevention,
                    appraisal, and failure costs (also known as cost of poor quality).
                    Be able to name three people associated with COQ and some of the techniques they helped
                    establish Crosby, Juran, and Deming. Some of the techniques they helped to establish are
                    TQM, Six Sigma, cost of quality, and continuous improvement. The Kaizen approach concerns
                    continuous improvement and says people should be improved first.
                    Be able to name the tools and techniques of the Quality Planning process Cost benefit anal-
                    ysis, benchmarking, design of experiments, cost of quality, additional quality planning tools.

             4.   Your company, Kick That Ball Sports, has appointed you project manager for its new Cricket
                  product line introduction. This is a national effort, and all the retail stores across the country
                  need to have the new products on the shelves before the media advertising blitz begins. The prod-
                  uct line involves three new products, two of which will be introduced together and a third one
                  that will follow within two years. Product number three will be elaborated in more detail closer
                  to the product's release date, while the first two products will be elaborated in great detail now.
                  The scope management plan has just been completed. Which of the following is true? (Choose
                  the best response.)
                  A. Only the deliverables associated with the work of the project should be listed on the WBS.
                     Since product number three isn't being released until a later date it should not yet be included
                     on the WBS.
                  B. The WBS template from a previous project, a tool and technique of the Create WBS process,
                     was used to create the WBS for this project. The WBS encompasses the major deliverables
                     for the project.
                  C. The WBS should be created next, and it encompasses the full scope of work for the project.
                     Only the work of the project is listed on the WBS.
                  D. The WBS encompasses the full scope of work for the project and the technique in the ques-
                     tion is called rolling wave planning.

             5.   You work for a large manufacturing plant. You are working on a new project to release an over-
                  seas product line. This is the company's first experience in the overseas market, and it hopes to
                  make a big splash with the introduction of this product. The project entails producing your
                  product in a concentrated formula and packaging it in smaller containers than the U.S. product
                  uses. A new machine is needed in order to mix the ingredients into a concentrated formula. In
                  order to complete the Create WBS process sufficiently, you decide to do which of the following?
                  A. Use the organizational breakdown structure and the WBS together and present this scope
                     baseline to stakeholders.
                  B. Record the code of account identifier, an SOW, responsible organization, and milestone
                     schedule in the WBS dictionary for the components of the WBS.
                  C. Elaborate the WBS to the point where the new machine specifications are clear and highly
                     detailed.
                  D. Record the approved change requests as one of the outputs of this process.

                          western band performances. Your newest project is in the Planning processes group. You are
                          working on the WBS. The finance manager has given you a numbering system to assign to the
                          WBS. Which of the following is true?
                          A. The numbering system is a unique identifier known as the code of accounts, which is used
                             to track the costs of the WBS elements.
                          B. The numbering system is a unique identifier known as the WBS dictionary, which is used to
                             track the descriptions of individual work elements.
                          C. The numbering system is a unique identifier known as the code of accounts, which is used
                             to track time and resource assignments for individual work elements.
                          D. The numbering system is a unique identifier known as the WBS dictionary, which is used to
                             assign quality control codes to the individual work elements.

                    8.    You've constructed the WBS for your recent project. You've requested that the subproject man-
                          agers report back to you in three weeks with each of their individual WBSs constructed. Which
                          statement is not true regarding the subproject managers' WBS?

                          A. Decomposition involves structuring and organizing the WBS so that deliverables are always
                             listed at level one.
                          B. Decomposition requires a degree of expert judgment and also requires close analysis of the
                             project scope statement.
                          C. Decomposition is a tool and technique used to create a WBS.
                          D. Decomposition subdivides the major deliverables into smaller components until the work
                             package level is reached.

                    10. Which of the following is not a major step of decomposition?

                    19. You work for a furniture manufacturer. You're project is going to design and produce a new
                        office chair. The chair will have the ability to function as a normal chair and also the ability to
                        transform its occupant into an upright, kneeling position. The design team is trying to determine
                        the combination of comfort and ease of transformation to the new position that will give the
                        chair the best characteristics while keeping the costs reasonable. Several different combinations
                        have been tested. This is an example of which of the following tools and techniques of Quality

                                                                        Answers to Review Questions             163




             Answers to Review Questions
             1.   C. The scope baseline consists of the project scope statement, the WBS, and the WBS dictionary.

             2.   C. WBSs from previous projects can be used as templates on projects that are producing similar
                  products or services. Some companies write WBS templates to be used for projects of similar
                  scope.

             3.   A. Each of the three products may have different amounts of elaboration and levels. The ques-
                  tion said the third product would not be introduced until two years after the first two. This WBS
                  entry may contain only one level stating the product name.

             4.   D. There isn't enough information in the question to know if option B is correct, although it
                  could be. Option C is not correct because the next process after the scope management plan is
                  created is the Scope Definition process. The WBS details the entire scope of the project and
                  includes all deliverables. It is an output of the Create WBS process and the technique of elabo-
                  rating some deliverables at a later date is called rolling wave planning.

             5.   B. The WBS dictionary should be documented with the code of account identifier, an SOW, the
                  responsible organization, and a milestone schedule for the WBS components. Option C is not
                  correct because the amount of elaboration and detail the question describes would make the
                  WBS inefficient. You need only enough detail to make it easier for the project team to plan, man-
                  age, and control the work. Approved change requests are inputs to this process. Requested
                  changes are the output.

             6.   B. The communications management plan documents what information will be distributed,
                  how it will be distributed, to whom, by whom, and the timing of the distribution.

             7.   A. Each element in the WBS is assigned a unique identifier. These are collectively known as the
                  code of accounts. Typically, these codes are associated with a corporate chart of accounts and
                  are used to track the costs of the individual work elements in the WBS.

             8.   C. The work package level is the lowest level in the WBS and facilitates resource assignment and
                  cost and time estimates. The agreed-upon deliverables in option C would consist of the higher
                  levels in the WBS.

             9.   A. Decomposition subdivides the major deliverables into smaller components. It is a tool and
                  technique of the Create WBS process, along with WBS templates, and is used to create a WBS.
                  Level two components may be deliverables, phases, subprojects, or some combination.

             10. C. The steps of decomposition include identify major deliverables, organize and determine the
                 structure, identify lower-level components, assign identification codes, and verify correctness of
                 decomposition.

             11. B. There are 28 channels of communication, which is considered when using the communica-
                 tions requirements analysis tool and technique.

             12. D. Communications requirements analysis and communications technology are the tools and
                 techniques of the Communications Planning process.

                    13. A. Design of experiments is a tool and technique of the Quality Planning process that provides
                        statistical analysis for changing key product or process elements all at once (not one at a time)
                        to optimize the process.

                    14. C. Philip Crosby devised the zero defects theory, meaning do it right the first time. Proper Qual-
                        ity Planning leads to less rework and higher productivity. Joseph Juran's fitness for use says that
                        stakeholders' and customers' expectations are met or exceeded.

                    15. A. W. Edwards Deming conjectured that the cost of quality is a management problem 85 percent
                        of the time and that once the problem trickles down to the workers, it is outside their control.

                    16. C. The benefits of meeting quality requirements are increased stakeholder satisfaction, lower
                        costs, higher productivity, and less rework.

                    17. A. Internal failure costs are costs associated with not meeting the customer's expectations while
                        you still had control over the product. This results in rework, scrapping, and downtime.

                    18. B. Quality checklists are an output of the Quality Planning process.

                    19. D. This is an example of design of experiments.

                    20. B. Six Sigma is a measurement-based strategy that focuses on process improvement and varia-
                        tion reduction by applying Six Sigma methodologies to the project.

                                                    We're going to take breather from defining scope and breaking
                                                    down the work of the project to look at the potential for threats
                                                    or opportunities on your project, otherwise known as risk. The
                    processes we're going to discuss here have outputs that become inputs to the Planning processes
                    we'll discuss in the coming chapters.
                       Risk is evident in everything we do. When it comes to project management, understanding
                    risk and knowing how to minimize its impacts (or take full advantage of its opportunities) on
                    your project is essential for success. This entire chapter is dedicated to project risk. Five of the
                    six risk processes (all contained in the Risk Management knowledge area) fall in the Planning
                    process group. We'll cover Risk Management Planning, Risk Identification, Qualitative Risk
                    Analysis, Quantitative Risk Analysis, and Risk Response Planning in this chapter. We'll follow
                    up with the last risk process, Risk Monitoring and Control, in Chapter 9, "Monitoring and
                    Controlling Project Performance."
                       Hold on to your hats! We're going to cover a lot of material in this chapter, but it will go fast,
                    I promise.



                    Planning for Risks
                    Every one of us takes risks on a daily basis. Just getting out of bed in the morning is a risk. You
                    might stub your toe in the dark on the way to the light switch or trip over the dog and break a
                    leg. These things don't usually happen, but the possibility exists. The same is true for your
                    project. Risk exists on all projects, and the potential that a particular risk will occur depends on
                    the nature of the risk.
                       Risk, like most of the elements of the other Planning processes, changes as the project
                    progresses and should be monitored throughout the project. As you get close to a risk event,
                    that's the time to reassess your original assumptions about the risk and your plans to deal with
                    the risk and to make any adjustments as required.
                       Not all risks are bad. Risks can present opportunities as well as threats to a project. All risks
                    have causes, and if the risk event occurs during a project, there are consequences as a result of
                    that risk. Those consequences will likely impact one or more of the project objectives, and you'll
                    need to know if the consequences have positive or negative impacts.
                       Risk is, after all, uncertainty. The more you know about risks and their impacts, the better
                    equipped you are to handle a risk when it occurs. The processes that involve risk, probably more
                    than any other project Planning process, concerns balance. You want to find that point where you
                    and the stakeholders are comfortable taking the risk based on the benefits you can potentially

             gain. In a nutshell, you're balancing the action of taking a risk against avoiding the consequences
             or impacts of a risk. The rest of this chapter will deal with finding out what risks may occur (and
             how to deal with those risks that are unknown), determining an organization's tolerance for risk
             taking, and developing action plans for those risks we've determined have hefty impacts. The first
             step is performing the Risk Management Planning process. Here, you determine the approach
             you'll use for risk management activities and document your plans for them in a risk management
             plan. Let's look at that process now.



             Risk Management Planning
             Risks come about for many reasons. Some are internal to the project, and some are external.
             The project environment, the planning process, the project management process, inadequate
             resources, and so on can all contribute to risk. Some risks you'll know about in advance and
             plan for during this process; others will occur unannounced during the project. The Risk Man-
             agement Planning process determines how you'll plan for risks on your project.



             Exam Spotlight

             A Guide to the PMBOK states that the Risk Management Planning process is an important foun-
             dation for all the risk processes that follow "...to ensure that the level, type, and visibility of risk
             management are commensurate with both the risk and importance of the project to the orga-
             nization, to provide sufficient resources and time for risk management activities, and to estab-
             lish an agreed-upon basis for evaluating risk [emphasis mine]." Understand this concept,
             particularly that you're developing an agreed-upon basis for risk evaluation, for the exam.



                In order to document the risk management plan, we need to gather some inputs that will help
             us determine our organizations risk policies and tolerance for risk. We'll look at those inputs next.

             Risks associated with a project generally concern the project objectives, which in turn impact
             time, cost, scope, or quality or any combination of the four. As you might have guessed, the
             project scope statement is an input to this process since it spells out your project objectives. The
             inputs of this process are as follows:
                  Enterprise environmental factors
                  Organizational process assets
                  Project scope statement
                  Project management plan

                    168         Chapter 5         Risk Planning



                       One of the key elements of the enterprise environmental factors to consider as in input in this
                    process is the risk tolerance levels of the organization and the stakeholders. Risk tolerance is
                    that balance we talked about earlier where stakeholders are comfortable taking a risk because
                    the benefits to be gained outweigh what could be lost--or just the opposite. They will avoid tak-
                    ing a risk because the cost or impact is too great given the amount of benefit that can be derived.
                    Here's an example to describe risk tolerance: Suppose you're a 275-pound brute who's sur-
                    rounded by three body guards of equal proportion everywhere you go. Chances are, walking
                    down a dark alley in the middle of the night doesn't faze you in the least. That means your risk
                    tolerance for this activity is high. However, if you're a petite 90-pounder without benefit of
                    body guards or karate lessons, performing this same activity might give you cause for concern.
                    Your risk tolerance is low, meaning you wouldn't likely do this activity. The higher your toler-
                    ance for risk, the more you're willing to take on risk and their consequences.


                                          Organizations and stakeholders, as well as individuals, all have different toler-
                                          ances for risk. One organization might believe that the risk of a potential 17 per-
                                          cent cost overrun is high, while another might think it's low. However, either
                                          one of these organizations may decide to accept the risk if they believe it's in
                                          balance with the potential rewards. It's important for the project manager to
                                          understand the tolerance level the organization and the stakeholders have for
                                          risk before evaluating and ranking risk.

                        Remember that organizational process assets include policies and guidelines that may
                    already exist in the organization. Your organization's risk management policies are any policies
                    it might have that you should consider when planning for risks. Defined roles and responsibil-
                    ities that outline what authority levels the stakeholders and/or project manager have for making
                    decisions regarding risk planning may exist in these policies. (Do consider that these decisions
                    can affect other planning processes.) Your organization may also have preexisting templates
                    that you can use during this process. These templates should be updated on a regular basis and
                    examined for their appropriateness on this project.
                        The project scope statement, as mentioned earlier, contains the project objectives and deliv-
                    erables. This is the first place you'll start looking when identifying risks and should be consid-
                    ered when determining the process you'll use to evaluate risks. The risk management plan (the
                    only output of this process) will become part of the project management plan, so obviously,
                    other project management processes and guidelines should be considered when performing this
                    process so that the risk management plan is in line with the overall direction and management
                    of the project.


                    Tools and Techniques for Risk Management Planning
                    There is only one tool and technique of the Risk Management Planning process: planning meet-
                    ings and analysis. The purpose of these meetings, which are held with project team members,
                    stakeholders, functional managers, and others who may have involvement in the risk management
                    process, is to contribute to the risk management plan. During these meetings, the fundamental
3601.book Page 169 Wednesday, July 13, 2005 1:39 PM




                                                                            Risk Management Planning            169




             plans for performing risk management activities will be discussed and determined and then doc-
             umented in the risk management plan.
                The key outcomes of performing these planning meetings are as follows:
                  Risk cost elements are developed for inclusion in the project budget.
                  Schedule activities are developed for inclusion in the project schedule.
                  Risk responsibilities are assigned.
                  Templates for risk categories are defined or modified for this project.
                  Definitions of terms (probability, impact, risk types, risk levels, and so on) are developed
                  and documented.
                  The probability and impact matrix is defined or modified for this project.


                                   We'll discuss risk responsibilities, define the terms in the preceding list, and
                                   construct our own probability and impact matrix in the remaining sections of
                                   this chapter.

                Ultimately, our goal for this process concerns documenting the risk management plan (the
             output of this process). This document contains the basis for understanding the remaining risk
             processes. Since the risk management plan encompasses a wealth of information, I've given this
             topic its own section. Let's get to it.


             Creating the Risk Management Plan
             The purpose of the Risk Management Planning process is to create a risk management plan,
             which describes how you will define, monitor, and control risks throughout the project. The
             risk management plan is a subsidiary of the project management plan and it's the only output
             of this process.
                 The risk management plan details how risk management processes (including Risk Identifi-
             cation, Qualitative Risk Analysis, Quantitative Risk Analysis, Risk Response Planning, and
             Risk Monitoring and Control) will be implemented, monitored, and controlled throughout the
             life of the project. It details how you will manage risks but does not attempt to define responses
             to individual risks.


                                   We'll talk about how to develop those response plans in the section "Develop-
                                   ing a Risk Response Plan" later in this chapter.

                According to A Guide to the PMBOK, the risk management plan should include the follow-
             ing elements:

                    Exam Spotlight

                    It's very important to spend time developing the risk management plan because it's an input to
                    every other risk-planning process and enhances the probability of risk management success.



                      We'll take a look at most of these elements next. However, risk categories, probability and
                    impact, and probability and impact matrix are pretty meaty topics, so we'll cover those in their
                    own sections following this one.
                    Methodology Methodology is a description of how you'll perform risk management, including ele-
                    ments like methods, tools, and where you might find risk data that you can use in the later processes.
                    Roles and responsibilities Roles and responsibilities describe the team of people who are respon-
                    sible for managing the identified risks and their responses and for each type of activity identified in
                    the risk management plan. These risk teams might not be the same as the project team. Risk analysis
                    should be unbiased, which may not be possible when project team members are involved.
                    Budgeting The budget for risk management is included in the plan as well. In this section,
                    you'll assign resources and estimate the costs of risk management and its methods. These costs
                    will then be included in the project cost baseline. (We'll talk about that in Chapter 7, "Creating
                    the Project Schedule and Budget.")
                    Timing Timing documents the timing of the risk management processes (including when and
                    how often they'll be performed on the project) and includes the activities associated with risk
                    management in the project schedule.
                    Revised stakeholder tolerances This is just as it implies. As you proceed through the risk
                    management processes, you may find that risk tolerances will change. Document those new tol-
                    erance levels in the risk management plan.
                    Reporting formats Reporting formats describe the content of the risk register and the format
                    of this document. (We'll talk more about the risk register later in this chapter.) Reporting for-
                    mats also detail how risk management information will be maintained, updated, analyzed, and
                    reported to project participants.
3601.book Page 171 Wednesday, July 13, 2005 1:39 PM




                                                                          Risk Management Planning             171




             Tracking This includes a description of how you'll document the history of the risk activities
             for the current project and how the risk processes will be audited. You can reference this infor-
             mation when you're performing risk-planning processes later in the current project or on future
             projects. This information is also helpful for lessons learned, which we'll cover in Chapter 11,
             "Closing Out the Project."

             Risk Categories
             Risk categories are a way to systematically identify risks and provide a foundation for under-
             standing. When determining and identifying risks, the use of risk categories helps improve the
             process by giving everyone involved a common language or basis for describing risk.
                Risk categories should be identified during this process and documented in the risk manage-
             ment plan. You will use these categories during the next process, Risk Identification, to help
             identify risks. The following list includes some of the categories you might identify during this
             process (or modify based on previous project information):
                  Technical, quality, or performance risks
                  Project management risks
                  Organizational risks
                  External risks
                 There are a couple of ways you can go about describing categories of risk. One way is simply
             listing them. You could, and should, review prior projects for risk categories and then tailor
             them for this project.
                 You could also construct a risk breakdown structure (RBS), which lists the categories and
             subcategories. A sample of an RBS is shown in Figure 5.1.


                                   Remember that the organizational process assets input may include an RBS
                                   that you can reference for this project. And don't forget your PMO. They may
                                   have templates or an RBS already developed.

                Risk categories may reflect the type of industry or application area in which the project
             exists. For example, Information Technology projects will likely have many risks that fall into
             the technical category, whereas construction projects may be more subject to risks that fall into the
             external risks category. The categories do not have to be industry specific, however. Keep in
             mind that project management, for example, is a risk on every project in every industry. A
             description of each of the categories is shown next:
             Technical/quality/performance risks Technical, quality, or performance risks include risks
             associated with unproven technology, complex technology, or changes to technology antici-
             pated during the course of the project. Performance risks may include unrealistic performance
             goals. Perhaps one of the project deliverables concerns a component manufactured to specific
             performance standards that have never been achieved. That's a performance risk.
             Project management risks The project management risk category includes improper schedule
             and resource planning, poor project planning, and improper or poor project management dis-
             ciplines or methodologies.

                    Organizational risks The organizational risk category can include resource conflicts due to
                    multiple projects occurring at the same time in the organization; scope, time, and cost objectives
                    that are unrealistic given the organization's resources or structure; and lack of funding for the
                    project or diverting funds from this project to other projects.
                    External risks The external risk category includes those things external to the project, such as
                    new laws or regulations, labor issues, weather, changes in ownership, and foreign policy for
                    projects performed in other countries. Catastrophic risks--known as force majeure--are usu-
                    ally outside the scope of risk management planning and instead require disaster recovery tech-
                    niques. Force majeure includes events like earthquakes, meteorites, volcanoes, floods, civil
                    unrest, terrorism, and so on.

                    Defining Probability and Impact
                    When you're writing the risk management plan, you'll want to document how probability and
                    impact will be defined on the project. Probability describes the potential for the risk event occur-
                    ring, while impact describes the impact, or consequences, the project will experience if the risk
                    event occurs. This definition can be very sophisticated or simple. For example, you may use
                    numeric values to define probability and impact or simply assign a high-medium-low rating to
3601.book Page 173 Wednesday, July 13, 2005 1:39 PM




                                                                               Identifying Potential Risk        173




             each risk. What's important to note now is that you don't use these probability and impact def-
             initions here. You use these definitions later in the Qualitative Risk Analysis process. (We'll talk
             in depth about probability and impact in the section "Analyzing Risk Using Qualitative Tech-
             niques" later in this chapter.) But you should define and document them here in the risk man-
             agement plan.

             Probability and Impact Matrix
             A probability and impact matrix defines the combination of probability and impact that helps
             you determine which risks need detailed risk response plans. For example, a risk with a high
             probability of occurring and a high impact will likely need a response plan. This matrix is typ-
             ically defined by the organization, but if you don't have one, you'll need to develop this now--
             during your planning meeting and analysis (the tool and technique of this process). You'll use
             this matrix in the Qualitative Risk Analysis process, and we'll talk more in depth in the section
             about this technique. Again, you want to define (or modify) the probability and impact matrix
             in the risk management plan


                                   The key thing to note about this process is that you'll define what the probabil-
                                   ity and impact tools look like now during Risk Management Planning so that the
                                   team has an agreed-upon basis for evaluating the identified risks later during
                                   the Qualitative Risk Analysis process.

                To recap, the steps associated with these last few elements of the risk management plan are
             as follows:
                  Define the risk categories (to be used in the Risk Identification process).
                  Determine how probability and impact will be defined (to be used in the Qualitative Risk
                  Analysis process).
                  Define or modify the probability and impact matrix (to be used in the Qualitative Risk
                  Analysis process).
                All these things, together with the other elements of the risk management plan, give you and
             the risk management team a common understanding for evaluating risks throughout the
             remainder of the project.



             Identifying Potential Risk
             The Risk Identification process involves identifying all the risks that might impact the project,
             documenting them, and documenting their characteristics. Risk Identification is an iterative
             process that continually builds on itself. As you progress through the project, more risks may
             present themselves (those you didn't identify early on in the Planning process). Once you've
             identified or discovered a potential new risk, you should analyze it to determine if a response
             plan is needed. You can see that the risk management cycle starts again with Risk Identification
             and progresses through the remaining risk processes to determine what to do about them.

                       You can include several groups of folks to help identify risks, including project team mem-
                    bers, stakeholders, subject matter experts, users, and anyone else who you think may help in the
                    process. Perhaps in the first round of Risk Identification, you include just the project team and
                    subject matter experts, and then you bring in the stakeholders or risk management team to fur-
                    ther flesh out risks during the second round of identification.


                                          We'll talk more about the techniques you can use to identify risks in the section
                                          titled "Tools and Techniques Used to Identify Risk."

                       Risks may or may not adversely affect the project. Some risks have positive consequences,
                    while others have negative consequences. However, all risk events and their consequences
                    should be identified. Here's a partial list to get you thinking about where risk may be found:
                          Budgets/funding
                          Schedules
                          Scope or requirements changes
                          Project plan
                          Project management processes
                          Technical issues
                          Personnel issues
                          Hardware
                          Contracts
                          Political concerns
                          Business risk
                          Legal risk
                          Environmental risk
                       This is by no means an exhaustive list. Remember that risk is uncertainty and realize that risk
                    (uncertainty) is lurking almost anywhere on your project. It's your job to discover as many of the
                    potential risks as possible using the tools and techniques of this process and to document these risks.


                    Risk Identification Inputs
                    The inputs to the Risk Identification process are as follows:
                          Enterprise environmental factors
                          Organizational process assets
                          Project scope statement
                          Risk management plan
                          Project management plan

                                                                               Identifying Potential Risk       175




                 As usual, the enterprise environmental factors input concerns things from outside the project
             that may help you determine or influence project outcomes. Be certain to check for industry
             information (commercial databases, checklists, benchmarking studies, and so on) or academic
             research that might exist for your application areas regarding risk information.
                 As always, don't forget about historical information like previous project experiences via the
             project files. Project team knowledge is another form of historical information.
                 The project scope statement contains a list of project assumptions. Assumptions are things
             believed to be true. It's imperative during the risk-planning stages of your project and through-
             out the work of the project to revisit and revalidate your project assumptions. At the time you
             recorded an assumption about vendor deliveries, for example, the vendor had a great track
             record and never missed a date. Months later on the project, that vendor merges with one of its
             competitors. Now you'll need to reexamine your assumptions about delivery times and deter-
             mine if the assumption is still valid or whether you have a risk on your hands.
                 You should pay particular attention to the roles and responsibilities section of the risk man-
             agement plan and the budget and schedule for risk activities, and don't forget to examine the
             categories of risks. This is a great place to start when you get the team together and begin brain-
             storming your list of risks.
                 The project management plan contains several other management plans (like schedule, qual-
             ity, and cost) that can be helpful sources also when identifying risks.


                                   Although A Guide to the PMBOK doesn't mention it, I've found that other ele-
                                   ments of your project are helpful when identifying risk, such as the work break-
                                   down structure (WBS), cost and schedule estimates, the staffing management
                                   plan, project staff assignments, and resource availability. You should really
                                   examine the outputs of most of the processes.




             Tools and Techniques Used to Identify Risk
             The Risk Identification process is undertaken using five tools and techniques:
                  Documentation reviews
                  Information-gathering techniques
                  Checklist analysis
                  Assumptions analysis
                  Diagramming techniques
                Documentation reviews involve reviewing project plans, assumptions, and historical infor-
             mation from a total project perspective as well as at the individual deliverables or activities level.
             This review helps the project team identify risks associated with the project objectives. Pay
             attention to the quality of the plans (is the content complete or does it seem to be lacking detail?)
             and the consistency between plans. An exceptionally documented schedule is great, but if the
             budget isn't as well documented, you may have some potential risks. Let's look at the remaining
             tools and techniques of this process, starting with information gathering.

                    Information Gathering
                    Information gathering encompasses several techniques, including brainstorming, the Delphi
                    technique, interviewing, root cause identification, and strength and weakness analysis. The goal
                    of these techniques is to end up with a comprehensive list of risks at the end of the meeting. Let's
                    take a quick look at each of these techniques.

                    Brainstorming
                    Brainstorming is probably the most often used technique of the Risk Identification process. You've
                    probably used this technique many times for many purposes. Brainstorming involves getting subject
                    matter experts, team members, risk management team members, and anyone else who might benefit
                    the process in a room and asking them to start identifying possible risk events. The trick here is that
                    one person's idea might spawn another idea and so on, so that by the end of the session you've iden-
                    tified all the possible risks. The facilitator could start the group off by going through the categories
                    of risks to get everyone thinking in the right direction.

                    Delphi Technique
                    The Delphi technique is a lot like brainstorming, only the people participating in the meeting
                    don't necessarily know each other. In fact, the people participating in this technique don't all
                    have to be located in the same place and can participate anonymously. You can use e-mail to
                    facilitate the Delphi technique very easily.
                        What you do is assemble your experts, from both inside and outside the company, and ask
                    them via a questionnaire to identify potential risks. They in turn send their responses back to
                    you (or to the facilitator of this process). All the responses are organized by content and sent
                    back to the Delphi members for further input, additions, or comments. The participants then
                    send their comments back one more time, and a final list of risks is compiled by the facilitator.
                        The Delphi technique is a great tool that allows consensus to be reached very quickly. It also
                    helps prevent one person from unduly influencing the others in the group and thus prevents bias
                    in the outcome because the participants are usually anonymous and don't necessarily know how
                    others in the group responded.

                    Nominal Group Technique
                    Another technique that is similar to the Delphi technique is the nominal group technique. It isn't
                    a named tool and technique of this process, but it is a technique you might find useful and that
                    you may find on the exam.
                       This technique requires the participants to be together in the same room. Each participant
                    has paper and pencil in front of them, and they are asked to write down what risks they think
                    the project faces. Using sticky-backed notes is a good way to do this. Each piece of paper should
                    contain only one risk. The papers are given to the facilitator, who sticks them up to the wall or
                    a white board. The panel is then asked to review all the risks posted on the board; rank them
                    and prioritize them, in writing; and submit the ranking to the facilitator. Once this is done, you
                    should have a complete list of risks.

             Interviewing
             Interviews are question-and-answer sessions held with others, including other project manag-
             ers, subject matter experts, stakeholders, customers, the management team, project team mem-
             bers, and users. These folks provide you with possible risks based on their past experiences with
             similar projects.
                This technique involves interviewing those folks with previous experience on projects similar
             to yours or those with specialized knowledge or industry expertise. Ask them to tell you about any
             risks that they've experienced or that they think may happen on your project. Show them the WBS
             and your list of assumptions to help get them started thinking in the right direction.

             Root Cause Identification
             Did you ever hear someone say you're looking at the symptoms and not at the problem? That's
             the idea here. Root cause identification involves digging deeper than the risk itself and looking
             at what the cause of the risk is. This helps define the risk more clearly and it also helps you later
             when it's time to develop the response plan for the risk.

             Strengths, Weaknesses, Opportunities, and Threats (SWOT)
             Strengths, weaknesses, opportunities, and threats (also known as SWOT analysis) is an analysis
             technique that examines through each of these viewpoints (SWOT) the project itself, project
             management processes, resources, the organization, and so on. It also helps broaden your per-
             spective of where to look for risks.



             Exam Spotlight

             Not all of the techniques listed here are detailed in A Guide to the PMBOK. Be aware that there
             might be questions on any of the techniques I've shown here. Understand the difference
             between the various information-gathering techniques for the exam.



             Checklist Analysis
             Checklists used during the Risk Identification process are usually developed based on historical
             information and previous project team experience. If you typically work on projects that are
             similar in nature, begin to compile a list of risks. You can then convert this to a checklist that
             will allow you to identify risks on future projects quickly and easily. You can also use the lowest
             level of the RBS as a checklist. However, don't rely solely on checklists for Risk Identification
             because you might miss important risks. It isn't possible for a single checklist to be an exhaustive
             source for all projects. You can improve your checklists at the end of the project by adding the
             new risks that were identified.

                    Assumptions Analysis
                    Assumptions analysis is a matter of validating the assumptions you identified and documented
                    during the course of the project Planning processes. Assumptions should be accurate, complete,
                    and consistent. Examine all your assumptions for these qualities. Assumptions are also used as
                    a jumping-off point to further identify risks.
                       The important thing to note about the project assumptions is that all assumptions are tested
                    against two factors:
                           The strength of the assumption or the validity of the assumption
                           The consequences that may impact the project if the assumption turns out to be false
                          All assumptions that turn out to be false should be evaluated and scored just as risks.

                    Diagramming Techniques
                    There are three types of diagramming techniques used in Risk Identification: cause-and-effect,
                    system or process flowcharts, and influence diagrams. Cause-and-effect diagrams show the rela-
                    tionship between the effects of problems and their causes. This diagram depicts every potential
                    cause and subcause of a problem and the effect that each proposed solution will have on the
                    problem. This diagram is also called a fishbone diagram, or Ishikawa diagram after its devel-
                    oper, Kaoru Ishikawa. Figure 5.2 shows an example cause-and-effect diagram.
                       The system or process flowchart shows the logical steps needed to accomplish an objective,
                    how the elements of a system relate to each other, and what actions cause what responses. This
                    flowchart is probably the one you're most familiar with. It's usually constructed with rectangles
                    and parallelograms that step through a logical sequence and allow for "yes" and "no" branches
                    (or some similar type of decision). Figure 5.3 shows a flowchart to help determine if risk response
                    plans should be developed for the risk (we'll talk about response plans in the Developing a Risk
                    Response Plan section later in this chapter).

                                    Cause-and-effect diagrams and system or process flowcharts are used in the
                                    Risk Identification process as well as in the Perform Quality Control process.

               A third diagramming technique used during Risk Identification is called influence diagrams.

                    among project variables, the timing or time ordering of events, and the relationships among
                    other project variables and their outcomes. Simply put, they visually depict risks (or decisions),
                    uncertainties or impacts, and how they influence each other. Figure 5.4 shows an influence dia-
                    gram for a product introduction decision. The weather is a variable that could impact delivery
                    time and delivery time is a variable that can impact when revenues will occur.

                        Each of these techniques provides a way for you to help identify project risks. It's important
                    that you identify all the risks early on. The better job you do of identifying the project's risks
                    at the Planning stage, the more comprehensive the risk response plan will be. Risk Identification
                    is not an area of project Planning that you should skip.


                    Risk Identification Outputs
                    The output of the Risk Identification process is the risk register. Everything you've done in
                    this process up to this point will get documented here. The risk register contains the following
                    elements:
                          List of identified risks
                          List of potential responses
                          Root causes of risks
                          Updated risk categories
                       We'll take a look at each one next. Understand that all risks should be documented, tracked,
                    reviewed, and managed throughout the project.

                    List of Identified Risks
                    Risks are all the potential events and their subsequent consequences that could occur as iden-
                    tified by you and others during this process. You might want to consider logging your risks in
                    a risk database or tracking system to organize them and keep a close eye on their status. This
                    can easily be done in spreadsheet format or whatever method you choose. List the risks and
                    assign each risk a tracking number. This gives you a means to track the risks, their occurrence,
                    and the responses implemented.

             List of Potential Responses
             Potential responses to risk may be identified at the same time you're identifying the risks. Some-
             times just identifying the risk will tell you the appropriate response. Document those responses
             here. You'll refer to them again in the Risk Response Planning process a little later in this chapter.

             Root Causes of Risk
             We talked about this one before. When you're identifying risks, be sure you go further than that
             and try to identify the cause. Document those causes you've identified here in the risk register.

             Updated Risk Categories
             As a result of identifying and documenting your risks, you may well discover some categories
             of risk need changed or updated to reflect the risks for the current project. This might also
             include updating the RBS. It's a good practice to update those categories now, while you're in
             the midst of the process. Your next project will be all the better for it.

             Triggers
             If you've ever suffered from a hay fever attack, you can't mistake the itchy, runny nose and
             scratchy throat that can come on suddenly and send you into a sneezing frenzy. Signals like this
             are known as triggers and work the same way when determining if a risk event is about to occur.
             For example, if you're planning an outdoor gathering and rain clouds start rolling in from the
             north on the morning of the activity, you probably have a risk event waiting to happen. A key
             team member hinting about job hunting is a warning sign that they may be thinking of leaving,
             which in turn can cause schedule delays, increased costs, and so on. This is another example of
             a trigger.
                 Triggers are not listed as one of the risk register elements, but in practice, this is an appro-
             priate place to list them. You will likely encounter questions on the exam about triggers, so
             don't say I didn't warn you. Also, throughout the remainder of the project, be on the alert for
             triggers that might signal that a risk event is about to occur.



             Analyzing Risks Using Qualitative
             Techniques
             The Qualitative Risk Analysis process involves determining what impact the identified risks will
             have on the project objectives and the probability they'll occur. It also ranks the risks in priority
             order according to their effect on the project objectives. This helps the team determine if Quan-
             titative Risk Analysis should be performed or if you can skip right to developing response plans.
             The Qualitative Risk Analysis process also considers risk tolerance levels, especially as they
             relate to the project constraints (scope, time, cost, and quality) and the time frames of the poten-
             tial risk events.

                    182         Chapter 5         Risk Planning



                        The Qualitative Risk Analysis process should be performed throughout the project. This pro-
                    cess is the one you'll find you'll use most often when prioritizing project risk because it's fast,
                    relatively easy to perform, and cost effective. A Guide to the PMBOK mentions two techniques
                    you can use during this process to help correct biases that can occur in the data you've gathered:
                    definitions of probability and impact (this is part of the risk management plan we discussed ear-
                    lier in this chapter) and expert interviewing (we talked about this in the Risk Identification sec-
                    tion of this chapter).


                    Qualitative Risk Analysis Inputs
                    The Qualitative Risk Analysis process has four inputs:
                          Organizational process assets
                          Project scope statement
                          Risk management plan
                          The risk register
                        As with the Risk Identification process, you should examine historical information and les-
                    sons learned from past projects as a guide for prioritizing the risks for this project. As we've
                    discussed before, these are part of the organizational process assets input. The project scope
                    statement describes the deliverables of the project, and from there you should be able to deter-
                    mine if you're dealing with a high level of uncertainty or a project that's similar in size and
                    scope to one you've performed before. Projects with high levels of uncertainty or that are
                    more complex than what the team has undertaken before require more diligence during the
                    Qualitative Risk Analysis process.
                        The risk management plan documented the roles and responsibilities of risk team members,
                    budget and schedule factors for risk activities, the stakeholder risk tolerances, the definitions for
                    probability and impact, and the probability and impact matrix, all of which should be consid-
                    ered when prioritizing risks. We'll examine probability and impact more closely in the next sec-
                    tion, "Using the Tools and Techniques of Qualitative Risk Analysis."
                        The critical element in this process, as with most of the processes you'll find where risk reg-
                    ister is an input, is the list of risks.
                        The real key to this process lies in the tools and techniques you'll use to prioritize risks. Hold
                    on tight because we're going in the deep end.


                    Using the Tools and Techniques of Qualitative
                    Risk Analysis
                    The Qualitative Risk Analysis process's tools and techniques are primarily concerned with dis-
                    covering the probability of a risk event and determining the impact (or consequences) the risk
                    will have if it does occur. The output of this process is a risk register update where you'll doc-
                    ument the prioritized risks you've scored using these tools and techniques. All of the informa-
                    tion you gather regarding risks and probability needs to be as accurate as possible. It's also

             important that you gather unbiased information so that you don't unintentionally overlook
             risks with great potential or consequences.
                The purpose of this process is to determine risk event probability and risk impact. You'll use
             the tools and techniques of this process to establish risk scores, which is a way of categorizing the
             probability and risk impact. The Qualitative Risk Analysis process includes the following tools
             and techniques:
                  Risk probability and impact assessment
                  Probability and impact matrix
                  Risk data quality assessment
                  Risk categorization
                  Risk urgency assessment
                We'll look at each of these tools and techniques next.

             Risk Probability and Impact Assessment
             This tool and technique assess the probability that the risk events you've identified will occur
             and it determines the effect their impacts have on the project objectives, including time, scope,
             quality, and cost. Analyzing risks in this way allows you to determine which risks require the
             most aggressive management. When determining probabilities and impacts, you'll refer back to
             the risk management plan element called "definitions of risk probability and impact."

             Probability
             Probability is the likelihood that an event will occur. The classic example is flipping a coin.
             There is a .50 probability of getting heads and a .50 probability of getting tails on the flip. One
             thing to note is that the probability that an event will occur plus the probability that the event
             will not occur always equals 1.0. In this coin-flipping example, there is a .50 chance that you'll
             get heads on the flip. There is also, therefore, a .50 chance you will not get heads on the flip. The
             two responses added together equal 1.0. Probability is expressed as a number from 0.0--which
             means there is no probability of the event occurring--to 1.0--which means there is 100 percent
             certainty the risk will occur.
                 Determining risk probability can be difficult because it's most commonly accomplished using
             expert judgment. In non-PMP terms, this means you're guessing (or asking other experts to guess)
             at the probability a risk event will occur. Granted, you're basing your guess on past experiences
             with similar projects or risk events, but no two risk events (or projects) are ever the same. It's best
             to fully develop the criteria for determining probability and get as many experts involved as you
             can. Carefully weigh their responses to come up with the best probability values possible.

             Impact
             Impact is the amount of pain (or the amount of gain) the risk event poses to the project. The risk
             impact scale can be a relative scale that assigns values such as high-medium-low (or some com-
             bination of these) or a numeric scale known as a cardinal scale. Cardinal scale values are actual
             numeric values assigned to the risk impact. Cardinal scales are expressed as values from 0.0 to
             1.0 and may be stated in equal (linear) or unequal (nonlinear) increments.

                       Table 5.1 shows a typical risk impact scale for cost, time, and quality objectives based on a
                    high-high to low-low scale. You'll notice that each of the "high-medium-low" value combina-
                    tions on this impact scale have been assigned a cardinal value. We'll use these in the next section
                    when we talk about the probability and impact matrix.

                       When you're using a high-medium-low scale it's important that your risk team understands
                    what criteria was used to determine a high score versus a medium or low score and how these
                    should be applied to the project objectives.

                    Assessing Probability and Impact
                    The idea behind both probability and impact values is to develop predefined measurements that
                    describe what value to place on a risk event.



                    Exam Spotlight

                    For the exam, don't forget that you defined probability and impact values during the Risk Man-
                    agement Planning process.



                       If these scales have not yet been determined, develop them as early on in the project as pos-
                    sible. You can use any of the techniques we talked about earlier in the section "Tools and Tech-
                    niques Used to Identify Risk," such as brainstorming or the Delphi technique, to come up with
                    the values for probability and impact.

                                                      Analyzing Risks Using Qualitative Techniques             185




                During the Qualitative Risk Analysis process, you'll determine and assess probability and
             impact for every risk identified during the Risk Identification process. You could interview or
             hold meetings with project team members, subject matter experts, stakeholder or others to help
             assess these factors. During this process, you should document not only the probability and
             impact but also the assumptions your team members used to arrive at these determinations. The
             next technique--probability and impact matrix--take the probability and impact values one
             step further by assigning an overall risk score.

             Probability and Impact Matrix
             A probability and impact matrix assigns an overall risk rating to each of the project's identified
             risks. The combination of probability and impact results in a classification usually expressed as
             high, medium, or low. According to A Guide to the PMBOK, high risks are considered a red
             condition, medium risks are considered a yellow condition, and low risks are considered a green
             condition. This type of ranking is known as an ordinal scale because the values are rank-ordered
             from high to low. (In practice, ordinal values may also include ranking by position. In other
             words, the risks are listed in rank order as the first, the second, the third, and so on.)



             Exam Spotlight

             A Guide to the PMBOK notes that the probability and impact matrix values are usually set by
             the organization and are a part of the organizational process assets.



                Now let's look at an example. You have identified a risk event that could impact project
             costs, and your experts believe costs could increase by as much as 9 percent. According to the
             risk impact rating matrix in Table 5.1, this risk carries a medium impact, with a value of 0.40.
             Hold onto that number because you're going to plug it into the probability impact matrix--
             along with the probability value--to determine an overall risk value next.
                You'll remember from our discussion previously that probability values should be assigned num-
             bers from 0.0 to 1.0. In this example, the team has determined that there is a 0.2 probability of this
             risk event occurring. The risk impact scale shows a medium or 0.4 impact should the event occur.
                Now, to determine whether the combination of the probability and impact of this risk is
             high, medium, or low, you'll need to check the probability impact matrix. Table 5.2 shows a
             sample probability and impact matrix.
                First look at the probability column. Your risk event has a probability of .2. Now follow that
             row until you find the impact score of .04. According to your probability and impact matrix val-
             ues, this risk carries a score of 0.08 and falls in the low threshold, so this risk is assigned a low
             (or green condition) value.
                The values assigned to the risks determine how Risk Response Planning is carried out for the
             risks later during the risk-planning processes. Obviously, risks with high probability and high

                    impact are going to need further analysis and formal responses. Remember that the values for this
                    matrix (and the probability and impact scales discussed earlier) are determined prior to the start
                    of this process and documented in the Risk Management Plan. Also keep in mind that probability
                    and impact do not have to be assigned the same values as I've done here. You may use 0.8, 0.6,
                    0.4, and 0.2 for probability, for example, and assign .05, 0.1, .03, 0.5, and 0.7 for impact scales.

                                                       Analyzing Risks Using Qualitative Techniques                187




             Screen Scrapers, Inc.

             Screen Scrapers is a software-manufacturing company that produces a software product that
             looks at your mainframe screens, commonly called green screens, and converts them to
             browser-based screens. The browser-based screens look like any other Windows-compatible
             screens with buttons, scroll bars, and drop-down lists.

             Screen Scrapers devised this product for companies that use mainframe programs to update and
             store data because many of the entry-level workers beginning their careers today are not familiar
             with green screens. They're cumbersome and difficult to learn, and no consistency exists from
             screen to screen or program to program. An F5 key in one program might mean go back one page,
             while an F5 key in another program might mean clear the screen. New users are easily confused,
             make a lot of mistakes, and have to write tablets full of notes on how to navigate all the screens.

             Your company has purchased the Screen Scraper product and has appointed you the project
             manager over the installation. There are lots of issues to address on this project, and you've
             made great headway. You're now at the risk identification and qualitative risk analysis stage. You
             decide to use the Delphi technique to assist you in identifying risk and assigning probability and
             impact rankings. There are some experts available in your company who can serve on the Delphi
             panel, as well as some folks in industry organizations you belong to outside the company.

             You assemble the group, and set up a summary of the project and send it out via e-mail, request-
             ing responses to your questions about risk. After the first pass, you compile the list of risks as fol-
             lows (this list is an example and isn't exhaustive because your list will be project specific):

                  Vendor viability--will the software company stay in business?

                  Vendor responsiveness with problems after implementation

                  Software compatibility risks with existing systems

                  Hardware compatibility risk

                  Connection to the mainframe risk

                  Training IT staff members to maintain the product

             You send this list back to the Delphi members and ask them to assign a probability of 0.0-1.0
             and an impact of high-high, high, medium, low, or low-low to each risk. The Delphi members
             assign probability and impact based on a probability scale and an impact scale designed by the
             risk management team. The values of the impact scale are as follows:

                  High-high = 0.8

                  High = 0.6

                    188         Chapter 5         Risk Planning




                          Medium = 0.4

                          Low = 0.2

                          Low-low = 0.05

                    The team sends you back the following probability and impact values:

                          Vendor viability = .6 probability, high impact

                          Vendor responsiveness = .4 probability, medium impact

                          Software compatibility = .4 probability, medium impact

                          Hardware compatibility = .6 probability, high-high impact

                          Mainframe connection = .2 probability, high-high impact

                          Training = .2 probability, low-low impact

                    The probability and impact matrix you used to assign the overall risk scores were derived from
                    the probability and impact matrix shown in Table 5.3.

                    Based on the probability and impact matrix thresholds, the project risks are assigned the fol-
                    lowing overall probabilities:

                          Vendor viability = high

                          Vendor responsiveness = medium

                          Software compatibility = medium

                          Hardware compatibility = high

                          Mainframe connection = high

                          Training = low



                    Risk Data Quality Assessment
                    The data quality assessment involves determining the usefulness of the data gathered to evaluate
                    risk. Most importantly, the data must be unbiased and accurate. You will want to examine ele-
                    ments like the following when performing this tool and technique:
                          The quality of the data used
                          The availability of data regarding the risks
                          How well the risk is understood
                          The reliability and integrity of the data
                          The accuracy of the data

                Low-quality data will render the Qualitative Risk Analysis process's findings almost useless.
             Spend the time to validate and verify the information you've collected about risks so that your
             prioritization and analysis is as accurate as it can be. If you find that the quality of the data is
             questionable, you guessed it, go back and get better data.

             Risk Categorizations
             This tool and technique is used to determine the effects risk has on the project. You can examine
             not only the categories of risk determined during the Risk Management Planning process (and
             described in the RBS) but also the project phase and the WBS to determine the elements of the
             project that are affected by risk.

             Risk Urgency Assessment
             Using this tool you'll determine how soon the potential risks may occur and quickly determine
             responses for those risks that could occur soon. You should consider the risk triggers, the time
             to develop and implement a response, and the overall risk rating when determining how quickly
             responses are needed.


             Ranking Risks in the Risk Register
             The goal of the Qualitative Risk Analysis process is to rank the risks and determine which ones
             need further analysis and, eventually, risk response plans. The output of this process is risk register
             updates. As you can probably guess, you'll update the register with the following information:
                  Risk ranking (or priority) for the identified risks
                  Risks grouped by categories
                  List of risks requiring near-term responses
                  List of risks for additional analysis and response
                  Watch list of low-priority risks
                  Trends in Qualitative Risk Analysis results
                 Each of these elements become new entries in the risk register. For example, risk ranking
             assigns the risk score or priority you determined using the probability and impact matrix to the
             list of identified risks previously recorded in the risk register. We've discussed the categories and
             the list of risks requiring near-term responses earlier. Note these in the risk register.
                 You'll also note those risks that require further analysis (including using the Quantitative
             Risk Analysis process), you'll create a list of risks that have low risk scores to review periodi-
             cally, and you should note any trends in qualitative risk analysis that become evident as you per-
             form this process.

                    Quantifying Risk
                    The Quantitative Risk Analysis process evaluates the impacts of risk prioritized during the Qual-
                    itative Risk Analysis process and quantifies risk exposure for the project by assigning numeric
                    probabilities to each risk and their impacts on project objectives. This quantitative approach is
                    accomplished using techniques like Monte Carlo simulation and decision tree analysis. To para-
                    phrase A Guide to the PMBOK, the purpose of this process is to perform the following:
                          Quantify the project's possible outcomes and probabilities.
                          Determine the probability of achieving the project objectives.
                          Identify risks that need the most attention by quantifying their contribution to overall
                          project risk.
                          Identify realistic and achievable schedule, cost, or scope targets.
                          Determine the best project management decisions possible when outcomes are uncertain.
                       Quantitative Risk Analysis--like Qualitative Risk Analysis--examines each risk and its
                    potential impact on the project objectives. You may choose to use both of these processes to
                    assess risk or only one of them, depending on the complexity of the project and the organiza-
                    tional policy regarding risk planning. The Quantitative Risk Analysis process can follow either
                    the Risk Identification process or the Qualitative Risk Analysis process. If you do use this pro-
                    cess, be certain to repeat it every time the Risk Response Planning process is performed and as
                    part of the Risk Monitoring and Control process.
                       We have already covered many of the inputs to the Quantitative Risk Analysis process in pre-
                    vious sections of this chapter. They are as follows:
                          Organizational process assets
                          Project scope statement
                          Risk management plan
                          Risk register
                          Project management plan
                       The elements of the project management plan you'll want to pay close attention to as an
                    input to this process are the project schedule management plan and the project cost manage-
                    ment plan.


                    Quantitative Risk Analysis Tools and Techniques
                    There are two sets of tools and techniques for the Quantitative Risk Analysis process: data gath-
                    ering and representation techniques, and quantitative risk analysis and modeling techniques.
                    Each of these sets of techniques include three techniques that we'll examine next.
3601.book Page 191 Wednesday, July 13, 2005 1:39 PM




                                                                                         Quantifying Risk         191




             Data Gathering and Representation Techniques
             The data gathering techniques includes interviewing techniques, probability distributions, and
             expert judgment. Let's look at each of them.

             Interviewing
             This technique is like the interviewing technique discussed earlier in the section "Identifying
             Potential Risk." Project team members, stakeholders, and subject matter experts are prime can-
             didates for risk interviews. Ask them about their experiences on past projects and about work-
             ing with the types of technology or processes you'll use during this project.


                                   For the exam, remember that interviewing is a tool and technique of the Quan-
                                   titative Risk Analysis process. Although you can use this technique in the Risk
                                   Identification process, it isn't an "official" tool and technique of that process.

                When using this technique, you should first determine what methods of probability distribu-
             tion (described next) you'll use to analyze your information. The technique you chose will dictate
             the type of information you need to gather. For example, you might use a three-point scale that
             assess the optimistic, pessimistic, and most likely risk scenarios or take it a step further and use
             standard deviations calculations. We'll talk more about three-point estimates in Chapter 7.
                Make certain you document how the interviewees decided upon the risk ranges, the criteria
             they used to place risks in certain categories, and the results of the interview. This will help you
             later in developing risk responses as well.



             Exam Spotlight

             For the exam, you should know that there are several types of probability distributions that are
             useful in determining and displaying risk information. The type of distribution you use deter-
             mines the type of information you should gather during the interviewing process.



             Probability Distributions
             It's beyond the scope of this book to delve into probability distributions and calculations, so I'll
             point out a few things you should remember for the exam regarding them.
                 Continuous probability distributions (particularly beta and triangular distributions) are
             commonly used in Quantitative Risk Analysis. According to A Guide to the PMBOK, contin-
             uous probability distributions include normal, lognormal, triangular, beta, and uniform distri-
             butions. Distributions are graphically displayed and represent both the probability and time or
             cost elements.
                 Triangular distributions use estimates based on the three-point estimate (the pessimistic, most
             likely, and optimistic values). This means that during your interviews, you'll gather these pieces
             of information from your experts. Then you'll use them to quantify risk for each WBS element.

                    192         Chapter 5          Risk Planning



                      Normal and lognormal distributions use mean and standard deviations to quantify risk,
                    which also require gathering the optimistic, most likely, and pessimistic estimates.

                    Expert Judgment
                    We've talked about this tool and technique before. Experts can come from inside or outside the
                    organization and should have experience that's applicable to your project. For example, if your
                    project involves manufacturing a new product or part, you might want to consider experts like
                    engineers or statisticians. If you're dealing with sensitive data in an information technology
                    project, consider bringing on a security expert.

                    Quantitative Risk Analysis and Modeling Techniques
                    There are four techniques encompassed in this tool and technique: sensitivity analysis, expected
                    monetary value analysis, decision tree analysis, and modeling and simulation. Let's take a brief
                    look at each of them.

                    Sensitivity Analysis
                    Sensitivity analysis is a quantitative method of analyzing the potential impact of risk events on
                    the project and determining which risk event (or events) has the greatest potential for impact by
                    examining all the uncertain elements at their baseline values. One of the ways sensitivity anal-
                    ysis data is displayed is a tornado diagram. Figure 5.5 shows a sample tornado diagram.

                        You can see by the arrangement of horizontal bars (each representing a sensitivity variable)
                    how the diagram gets its name. The idea is that each sensitivity bar displays the low and high value
                    possible for that element. (It's beyond the scope of this book to explain how these values are deter-
                    mined. The questions you may encounter on the exam are focused on the context of this type of
                    analysis.) The variables with the greatest effect on the project are displayed at the top of the graph
                    and decrease in impact as you progress down through the graph. This gives you a quick overview
                    of how much the project can be affected by uncertainty in the various elements. It also allows you
                    to see at a glance which risks may have the biggest impacts on the project and will require carefully

             crafted, detailed response plans. You can use tornado diagrams to determine sensitivity in cost,
             time, and quality objectives or for risks you've identified during this process.
                Sensitivity analysis can also be used to determine stakeholder risk tolerance levels.

             Expected Monetary Value (EMV) Analysis
             Expected monetary value (EMV) analysis is a statistical technique that calculates the average,
             anticipated impact of the decision. EMV is calculated by multiplying the probability of the risk
             times its impact and then adding them together. EMV is used in conjunction with the decision
             tree analysis technique, which is covered next. I'll give you an example of the EMV formula in
             the next section. Positive results generally mean the risks you're assessing pose opportunities to the
             project while negative results generally indicate a threat to the project.

             Decision Tree Analysis
             Unfortunately, this isn't a tree outside your office door that produces "Yes" and "No" leaves
             that you can pick to help you make a decision. Decision trees are diagrams that show the
             sequence of interrelated decisions and the expected results of choosing one alternative over the
             other. Typically, more than one choice or option is available when you're faced with a decision
             or, in this case, potential outcomes from a risk event. The available choices are depicted in a tree
             form starting at the left with the risk decision branching out to the right with possible outcomes.
             Decision trees are usually used for risk events associated with time or cost.
                 Figure 5.6 shows a sample decision tree using expected monetary value (EMV) as one of
             its inputs.
                 The expected monetary value of the decision is a result of the probability of the risk event
             multiplied by the impact and then adding their results. The squares in this figure represent deci-
             sions to be made, and the circles represent the points where risk events may occur.

                       The decision with an expected value of $7,000 is the correct decision to make because the
                    resulting outcome has the greatest value.

                    Modeling and Simulation
                    Modeling and simulation techniques are often used for schedule risk analysis and cost analysis.
                    For example, modeling allows you to translate the potential risks at specific points in the project
                    into their impacts so you can determine how the project objectives are affected. Simulation tech-
                    niques compute the project model using various inputs such as cost or schedule duration, to
                    determine a probability distribution for the variable chosen. (Cost risks typically use either a
                    work breakdown structure or cost breakdown structure as the input variable. Schedule risks
                    always use the precedence diagramming method as the input variable. We we'll cover schedule
                    diagramming methods in Chapter 7.) If you used simulation techniques to determine project
                    cost and use the cost of the project elements as the input variable, a probability distribution for
                    the total cost of the project would be produced after running the simulation numerous times.
                    Modeling and simulation techniques examine the identified risks and their potential impacts to
                    the project objectives from the perspective of the whole project.
                       Monte Carlo analysis is an example of a simulation technique. Monte Carlo analysis is per-
                    formed many times, typically using cost or schedule variables. Every time the analysis is per-
                    formed, the values for the variable are changed using a probability distribution for each
                    variable. Monte Carlo analysis can also be used during the Schedule Development process.



                    Exam Spotlight

                    According to A Guide to the PMBOK, simulation techniques are recommended for predicting
                    schedule or cost risks because they're more powerful then EMV and less likely to be misused.
                    For the exam, remember that simulation techniques are used to predict schedule or cost risks.
                    Schedule simulations are usually performed using the precedence diagramming method,
                    while cost simulation typically uses the WBS as its basis.




                    Quantitative Risk Analysis Outputs
                    The output of the Quantitative Risk Analysis process is--I'll bet you can guess--risk register
                    updates. As with the Qualitative Risk Analysis process, there are new elements you'll record in
                    the risk register:
                    Probabilistic analysis of the project Probabilistic analysis of the project is the forecasted results
                    of the project schedule and costs as determined by the outcomes of risk analysis. These results
                    include projected completion dates and costs, along with a confidence level associated with each.
                    According to A Guide to the PMBOK, this output is often expressed as a cumulative distribution
                    and you'll use these results along with stakeholder risk tolerances to quantify the time and cost
                    contingency reserves. (We'll talk about contingency reserves in the section "Developing a Risk
                    Response Plan" later in this chapter.)

             Confidence levels can also be used to describe the level of confidence placed on the outcome of
             the forecasted results. For example, suppose the projected schedule completion date is July 12
             and the confidence level is .85. This says that you believe the project will finish on or before
             July 12 and that you have an 85 percent level of confidence that this date is accurate.
             Probability of achieving the cost and time objectives Using the tools and techniques of Quan-
             titative Risk Analysis allows you to assign a probability of achieving the cost and time objectives
             of the project. This output documents those probabilities and as such requires a thorough
             understanding of the current project objectives and knowledge of the risks.
             Prioritized lists of quantified risks The prioritized list in this process is similar to the list pro-
             duced during the Qualitative Risk Analysis process. The list of risks includes those that present
             the greatest risk or threat to the project and their impacts. It also lists those risks that present the
             greatest opportunities to the project. This list should also indicate which risks are most likely to
             impact the critical path and those that have the largest cost contingency.
             Trends in Quantitative Risk Analysis results Trends in Quantitative Risk Analysis will likely
             appear as you repeat the risk analysis processes. This information is useful as you progress,
             making those risks with the greatest threat to the project more evident, which allows you the
             opportunity to perform further analysis or go on to develop risk response plans.

             Developing a Risk Response Plan
             The Risk Response Planning process is the last process covered in this chapter. (I hear you cheer-
             ing out there!) Risk Response Planning is a process of deciding what actions to take to reduce
             threats and take advantage of the opportunities discovered during the risk analysis processes.
             This process also includes assigning departments or individual staff members the responsibility
             of carrying out the risk response plans you'll outline in this process. These folks are known as
             risk owners.


                                   The more effective your risk response plans are, the better your chances for a
                                   successful project. Well-developed and well-written risk response plans will
                                   decrease overall project risk.

                Generally, you'll want to develop risk response plans for those risks with a combination of
             high probability of occurrence and significant impact to the project. Developing risk response

                    plans for risks of low severity or insignificant impact is not efficient or a good use of the project
                    team's time. Spend your time planning responses that are appropriate given the impact the risk
                    itself poses (or the opportunity the risk presents) and don't spend more time, money, or energy
                    to produce a response than the risk event itself would produce if it occurred.
                        Several strategies are used in this process to reduce or control risk. It's important that you
                    choose the right strategy for each risk so that the risk and its impacts are dealt with effectively.
                    After deciding on which strategy to use, you'll develop an action plan to put this strategy into play
                    should the risk event occur. You may also choose to designate a secondary or backup strategy.



                    Exam Spotlight

                    The severity of the risk will dictate the level of risk response planning that should be performed.
                    For example, a risk with low severity wouldn't warrant the time it takes to develop a detailed
                    risk response plan. Risk responses should be cost effective--if the cost of the response is more
                    than the consequences of the risk, you might want to examine a different risk response. Risk
                    responses should also be timely, agreed to by all the project stakeholders, and assigned to an
                    individual (risk owner) who is responsible for monitoring and carrying out the risk response
                    plan if needed.




                    Risk Response Planning Tools and Techniques
                    There are four tools and techniques for the Risk Response Planning process and each one of
                    them involves a strategy. The tools and techniques are as follows:
                           Strategies for negative risks or threats
                           Strategies for positive risks or opportunities
                           Strategies for both threats and opportunities
                           Contingence response strategy
                          We'll take a look at each.

                    Strategies for Negative Risks or Threats
                    There are three strategies to deal with negative risks or threats to the project objectives. They
                    are avoid, transfer, and mitigate.

                    Avoid
                    To avoid a risk means you'll evade it altogether, eliminate the cause of the risk event, or change
                    the project plan to protect the project objectives from the risk event. Let's say you're going to take
                    a car trip from your home to a point 800 miles away. You know--because your friends who just
                    took the same trip told you--that there is a long stretch of construction on one of the highways
                    you're planning on using. To avoid the risk of delay, you plan the trip around the construction
                    work and use another highway for that stretch of driving. In this way, you change your plans,
                    avoid the risk of getting held up in construction traffic, and arrive at your destination on time.
3601.book Page 197 Wednesday, July 13, 2005 1:39 PM




                                                                    Developing a Risk Response Plan             197




                With risk avoidance, you essentially eradicate the risk by eliminating its cause. Here's
             another example: Suppose your project was kicked off without adequate scope definition and
             requirements gathering. You run a high probability of experiencing scope creep--ever-changing
             requirements--as the project progresses, thus impacting the project schedule. You can avoid
             this risk by adequately documenting the project scope and requirements during the Planning
             processes and taking steps to monitor and control changes to scope so it doesn't get out of hand.
                Risks that occur early in the project might easily be avoided by improving communications,
             refining requirements, assigning additional resources to project activities, refining the project
             scope to avoid risk events, and so on.

             Transfer
             The idea behind a risk transfer is to transfer the risk and the consequences of that risk to a third
             party. The risk hasn't gone away, but the responsibility for the management of that risk now
             rests with another party. Most companies aren't willing to take on someone else's risk without
             a little cash thrown in for good measure. This strategy will impact the project budget and should
             be included in the cost estimate exercises if you know you're going to use it.
                 Transfer of risk can occur in many forms but is most effective when dealing with financial
             risks. Insurance is one form of risk transfer. You are probably familiar with how insurance
             works. Car insurance is a good example. You purchase car insurance so that if you come upon
             an obstacle in the road and there is no way to avoid hitting it, the cost to repair the damage to
             the car is paid by the insurance company. Okay, minus the deductible and all the calculations
             for the age of the car, the mileage, the color and make of the car, the weather conditions the day
             you were driving--but I digress.
                 Another method of risk transfer is contracting. Contracting transfers specific risks to the ven-
             dor, depending on the work required by the contract. The vendor accepts the responsibility for
             the cost of failure. Again, this doesn't come without a price. Contractors charge for their ser-
             vices, and depending on the type of contract you negotiate, the cost might be quite high. For
             example, in a fixed-price contract, which we'll talk more about in the Procurement Planning
             section, the vendor (or seller) increases the cost of the contract to compensate for the level of risk
             they're accepting. A cost reimbursable contract, however, leaves the majority of the risk with
             you, the buyer. This type of contract may reduce costs if there are project changes midway
             through the project.
                 Keep in mind that contracting isn't a cure-all. You might just be swapping one risk for
             another. For example, say you hire a driver to go with you on your road trip and their job is to
             do all the driving. If the driver becomes ill or in some way can't fulfill their obligation, you aren't
             going to get to your destination on time. You've placed the risks associated with the drive on
             the contract driver; however, you've taken on a risk of delay due to nonperformance, which
             means you've just swapped one risk for another. You'll have to weigh your options in cases like
             this and determine which side of the risk coin your organization can more readily accept.
                 Other forms of transference include warranties, guarantees, and performance bonds.

             Mitigate
             When you mitigate a risk, you attempt to reduce the probability of a risk event and its impacts
             to an acceptable level. This strategy is a lot like defensive driving. You see an obstacle in the road

                    ahead, survey your options, and take the necessary steps to avoid the obstacle and proceed
                    safely on your journey. Seeing the obstacle ahead (identifying risk) allows you to reduce the
                    threat by planning ways around it or planning ways to reduce its impact if the risk does occur
                    (mitigation strategies).
                        According to A Guide to the PMBOK, the purpose of mitigation is to reduce the probability
                    that a risk will occur and reduce the impact of the risk to a level where you can accept the risk
                    and its outcomes. It's easier to take actions early on that will reduce the probability of a risk or
                    its consequences than it is to fix the damage once it's occurred. Some examples of risk mitigation
                    include performing more tests, using less-complicated processes, creating prototypes, and
                    choosing more reliable vendors.



                    Exam Spotlight

                    Understand all of the strategies and their characteristics in each tool and technique for
                    the exam.



                    Strategies for Positive Risk or Opportunities
                    There are three strategies for dealing with opportunities or positive risks that may present them-
                    selves on the project: exploit, share, and enhance.

                    Exploit
                    When you exploit a risk event, you're looking for opportunities for positive impacts. This is the
                    strategy of choice when you've identified positive risks that you want to make certain will occur
                    on the project. Examples of exploiting a risk include reducing the amount of time to complete
                    the project by bringing on more qualified resources or by providing even better quality than
                    originally planned.

                    Share
                    The share strategy is similar to transferring because you'll assign the risk to a third-party owner
                    who is best able to bring about the opportunity the risk event presents. For example, perhaps
                    what your organization does best is investing. However, it isn't so good at marketing. Forming
                    a joint venture with a marketing firm to capitalize on a positive risk will make the most of the
                    opportunities.

                    Enhance
                    The enhance strategy closely watches the probability and or impact of the risk event to assure
                    that the organization realizes the benefits. This entails watching for and emphasizing risk trig-
                    gers and identifying the root causes of the risk to help enhance impacts or probability.

                                                                     Developing a Risk Response Plan              199




             Strategies for Both Threats and Opportunities
             The third tool and technique of the Risk Response Planning process, strategies for both threats
             and opportunities, is called the acceptance strategy. Acceptance of a risk event is a strategy that
             can be used for risks that pose either threats or opportunities to the project. Passive acceptance
             is a strategy that means that you won't make any plans to try to avoid or mitigate the risk.
             You're willing to accept the consequences of the risk should it occur. Acceptance may also mean
             the project team was unable to come up with an adequate response strategy and must accept the
             risk and its consequences. Active acceptance may include developing contingency reserves to
             deal with risks should they occur. (We'll look at contingency reserves in the next section.)
                 Let's revisit the road trip example. You could plan the trip using the original route and just accept
             the risk of running into construction. If you get to that point and you're delayed, you'll just accept
             it. This is passive acceptance. You could also go ahead and make plans to take an alternate route but
             not enact those plans until you actually reach the construction and know for certain that it is going
             to impede your progress. This is active acceptance and may involve developing a contingency plan.

             Contingency Planning
             The last tool and technique of the Risk Response Planning process is called the contingent response
             strategy, better known as contingency planning. Contingency planning involves planning alterna-
             tives to deal with the risks should they occur. This is different than mitigation planning in that mit-
             igation looks to reduce the probability of the risk and its impact whereas contingency planning
             doesn't necessarily attempt to reduce the probability of a risk event or its impacts. Contingency plan-
             ning says the risk may very well occur and we better have plans in place to deal with it.
                 Contingency comes into play when the risk event occurs. This implies you need to plan for
             your contingencies well in advance of the threat. After the risks have been identified and quan-
             tified, contingency plans should be developed and kept at the ready.
                 Contingency allowances or reserves are a common contingency response. Contingency
             reserves include project funds that are held in reserve to offset any unavoidable threats that
             might occur to project scope, schedule, cost, or quality. It also includes reserving time and
             resources to account for risks. You should consider stakeholder risk tolerances when determin-
             ing the amount of contingency reserves.
                 Fallback plans should be developed for risks with high impact or for risks with identified
             strategies that may not be the most effective.
                 In practice, you'll find that identifying, prioritizing, quantifying, and developing responses for
             potential threats may happen simultaneously. In any case, you don't want to be taken by surprise,
             and that's the point of the risk processes. If you know about potential risks early on, you can very
             often mitigate them or prepare appropriate response plans or contingency plans to deal with them.


             Risk Response Planning Outputs
             As you've no doubt concluded, the purpose of the Risk Response Planning process is to develop
             risk responses for those risks with the highest probability and impact on the project objectives.
             There are three outputs of the Risk Response Planning process: risk register updates, project
             management plan updates, and risk-related contractual agreements.

                    200         Chapter 5         Risk Planning




                                          Remember that you might need to revisit other Planning processes after per-
                                          forming Risk Response Planning to modify project plans as a result of risk
                                          responses.



                    Risk Register Updates
                    Again, the risk register is updated at the end of this process with the information you've dis-
                    covered during this process. The response plans are recorded in the risk register. You'll recall
                    that the risk register lists the risk in order of priority (those with the highest potential for threat
                    or opportunity first), so it makes sense that the response plans you have for these risks will be
                    more detailed than the remaining lists. Some risks may not require response plans at all, but you
                    should put them on a watch list and monitor them throughout the project.
                       Let's take a look at what the risk register should contain at this point. According to A Guide
                    to the PMBOK, after Risk Identification, Qualitative Risk Analysis, and Quantitative Risk
                    Analysis are preformed, the following elements should appear in the risk register:
                          List of identified risks, including their descriptions, what WBS element they impact (or area
                          of the project), categories (RBS), root causes, and how the risk impacts the project objectives
                          Risk owners and their responsibility
                          Risk triggers
                          Response plans and strategies, including the steps to take to implement the strategy
                          Cost and schedule activities needed to implement risk responses
                          Contingency reserves for cost and time
                          Contingency plans
                          Fallback plans
                          List of residual and secondary risks
                          Probabilistic analysis of the project and other outputs of the Qualitative and Quantitative
                          Risk Analysis processes
                       The only elements in the preceding list we haven't talked about so far are residual and sec-
                    ondary risks. A residual risk is a leftover risk so to speak. After you've implemented a risk
                    response strategy--say mitigation, for example--some minor risk may still remain. The contin-
                    gency reserve is set up to handle situations like this.
                       Secondary risks are risks that come about as a result of implementing a risk response. The
                    example given previously where you transferred risk by hiring a driver to take you to your des-
                    tination but they became ill along the way is an example of a secondary risk. Their illness
                    delayed your arrival time, which is risk directly caused by hiring the driver or implementing a
                    risk response. When planning for risk, identify and plan responses for secondary risks that could
                    occur as well.

                                                                      Developing a Risk Response Plan                 201




             Risk-Related Contractual Agreements
             If you're planning on using strategies such as transference or sharing, for example, you may
             need to purchase services or items from third parties. The contracts for those services can be pre-
             pared now and discussed with the appropriate parties.
                 Risks exist on all projects, and risk planning is an important part of the project Planning pro-
             cesses. Just the act of identifying risks and planning responses can decrease their impact if they
             occur. Don't take the "What I don't know won't hurt me" approach to risk planning. This is def-
             initely a case where not knowing something can be devastating. Risks that are easily identified and
             have planned responses aren't likely to kill projects or your career. Risks that you should have
             known about but ignored could end up costing the organization thousands or millions of dollars,
             causing schedule delays, or ultimately killing the project. There could be a personal cost as well,
             as cost and schedule overruns due to poor planning on your part are not easily explained.



             Project Case Study: New Kitchen Heaven Retail Store

             Ricardo knocks on your office door and asks if you have a few minutes to talk. "Of course," you
             reply, and he takes a seat on one of the comfy chairs at the conference table. You have a feeling
             this might take a while.

             "I think you should know that I'm concerned about the availability of the T1 line. I've already put
             in the call to get us on the list because, as I said last week, there's a 30- to 45-day lead time on
             these orders."

             "We're only midway through the Planning processes. Do you need to order the T1 so soon? We
             don't even know the store location yet," you say.

             "Even though they say lead time is 30 to 45 days, I've waited as much as five or six months to
             get a T1 installed in the past. I know we're really pushing for the early February store opening,
             so I thought I'd get the ball rolling now. What I need from you is the location address, and I'll
             need that pretty quick."

             "We're narrowing down the choices between a couple of properties, so I should have that for
             you within the next couple of weeks. Is that soon enough?"

             "The sooner the better," Ricardo replies.

             "Great. I'm glad you stopped by, Ricardo. I wanted to talk with you about risk anyway, and you
             led us right into the discussion. Let me ask you, what probability would you assign to the T1 line
             installation happening six months from now?"

             "I'd say the probability for six months is low. It's more likely that if there is a delay, it would be
             within a three- to four-month time frame."

                    "If they didn't get to it for six months, would it be a showstopper? In other words, is there some
                    other way we could transfer Jill's data until the T1 did get installed?"

                    "Sure, there are other methods we could use. Jill won't want to do that for very long, but there
                    are workarounds available."

                    "Good. Now, what about the risk for contractor availability and hardware availability and deliv-
                    ery schedules?" you ask.

                    You and Ricardo go on to discuss the risks associated with the IT tasks. Later, you ask Jill and
                    Jake the same kinds of questions and compile a list of risks. In addition, you review the project
                    information for the Atlanta store opening, as it's very similar in size and scope to this store. You
                    add those risks to your list as well. You divide some of the risks into the following categories:
                    IT, Facilities, and Retail. A sample portion of your list appears as follows, with overall assign-
                    ments made based on Qualitative Risk Analysis and the probability and impact matrix:

                             Category: IT

                                T1 line availability and installation. Risk score: Low

                                Contractor availability for Ethernet installation. Risk score: Medium

                                POS and server hardware availability. Risk score: Medium

                             Category: Facilities

                                Desirable location in the right price range. Risk score: High

                                Contractor availability for build-out. Risk score: Low

                                Availability of fixtures and shelving. Risk score: Low

                             Category: Retail

                                Product availability. Risk score: Medium

                                Shipment dates for product. Risk score: Medium

                    After examining the risks, you decide that response plans should be developed for the last two
                    items listed under the IT source, the first item under Facilities, and both of the risks listed under
                    Retail.

                    Ricardo has already mitigated the T1 connection and installation risk by signing up several
                    months ahead of when the installation is needed. The contractor availability can be handled
                    with a contingency plan that specifies a backup contractor should the first choice not be avail-
                    able. For the POS terminals and hardware, you decide to use the transfer strategy. As part of
                    the contract, you'll require these vendors to deliver on time, and if they cannot, they'll be
                    required to provide and pay for rental equipment until they can get your gear delivered.

             The Facilities risk and Retail risks will be handled with a combination of acceptance, contin-
             gency plans, and mitigation.

             You've calculated the expected monetary value for several potential risk events. Two of them
             are detailed here.

             Desirable location has an expected monetary value of $780,000. The probability of choosing an
             incorrect or less-than-desirable location is 60 percent. The potential loss in sales is the differ-
             ence between $2.5 million in sales per year a high-producing store generates versus $1.2 mil-
             lion in sales per year an average store generates.

             The expected monetary value of the product availability event is $50,000. The probability of the
             event occurring is 40 percent. The potential loss in sales is $125,000 for not opening the store
             in conjunction with the Garden and Home Show.

                    204         Chapter 5         Risk Planning




                    Summary
                    Congratulations! You've completed another fun-filled, action-packed chapter and all of it on a
                    single topic--risk. Risk is inherent in all projects and risks pose both threats and opportunities
                    to the project. Understanding the risks facing the project better equips you to determine the
                    appropriate strategies to deal with those risks and helps you determine the response plans for
                    the risks (and the level of effort you should put into preparing those plans).
                       The Risk Management Planning process determines how you will plan for risks on your
                    project. Its only output is the risk management plan, which details how you'll define, monitor,
                    and control risks throughout the project. The risk management plan is a subsidiary of the
                    project management plan.
                       The Risk Identification process seeks to identify and document the project risks using brain-
                    storming, the Delphi technique, interviewing, root cause identification, and SWOT. This list of
                    risks gets recorded in the risk register, the only output of this process.
                       Qualitative Risk Analysis and Quantitative Risk Analysis involve evaluating risks and
                    assigning probability and impact values to the risks. Many tools and techniques are used during
                    these processes, including risk probability and impact, probability and impact matrix, inter-
                    viewing, probability distributions, expert judgment, sensitivity analysis, decision tree analysis,
                    and simulation.
                       A probability and impact matrix uses the probability multiplied by the impact value to determine
                    the risk score. The threshold of risk based on high, medium, and low tolerances is determined by
                    comparing the risk score based on the probability level to the probability and impact matrix.
                       Monte Carlo simulation is a technique used to quantify schedule or cost risks. Decision trees
                    graphically display decisions and their various choices and outcomes and is typically used in
                    combination with earned monetary value.
                       The Risk Response Planning process is the last Planning process and culminates with an
                    update to the risk register documenting the risk response plans. The risk response plans detail
                    the strategies you'll use to respond to risk and assign individuals to manage each risk response.
                    Risk response strategies for negative risks include avoidance, mitigation, and transference. Risk
                    strategies for positive risks include exploit, share, and enhance. Acceptance is a strategy for both
                    negative and positive risks.
                       Contingency planning involves planning alternatives to deal with risk events should they
                    occur. Contingency reserves are set aside to deal with risks associated with cost and time
                    according to the stakeholder tolerance levels.

                    Be able to define the purpose of the risk management plan The risk management plan
                    describes how you will define, monitor, and control risks throughout the project. It details how
                    risk management processes (including Risk Identification, Qualitative Risk Analysis, Quantita-
                    tive Risk Analysis, Risk Response Planning, and Risk Monitoring and Control) will be imple-
                    mented, monitored, and controlled throughout the life of the project. It describes how you will

                                                                                         Exam Essentials           205




             manage risks but does not attempt to define responses to individual risks. The risk management
             plan is a subsidiary of the project management plan and it's the only output of the Risk Man-
             agement Planning process.
             Be able to name the purpose of Risk Identification. The purpose of the Risk Identification
             process is to identify all risks that may impact the project, document them, and identify their
             characteristics.
             Be able to define the purpose of Qualitative Risk Analysis. Qualitative Risk Analysis deter-
             mines the impact the identified risks will have on the project and the probability they'll occur
             and puts the risks in priority order according to their effect on the project objectives.
             Be able to define the purpose of Quantitative Risk Analysis. Quantitative Risk Analysis
             evaluates the impacts of risk prioritized during the Qualitative Risk Analysis process and quan-
             tifies risk exposure for the project by assigning numeric probabilities to each risk and their
             impacts on project objectives.
             Be able to define the purpose of the Risk Response Planning process. Risk Response plan-
             ning is the process where risk response plans are developed using strategies such as avoid, trans-
             fer, mitigate, exploit, share, and enhance. The risk response plan describes the actions to take
             should the identified risks occur. It should include all the identified risks, a description of the
             risks, how they'll impact the project objectives, and the people assigned to manage the risk
             responses.
             Be able to define the risk register and some of its primary elements. The risk register is an
             output of the Risk Identification process, and updates to the risk register occur as an output of
             every risk process that follows this one. By the end of the Risk Response Planning process, the
             risk register contains these primary elements: identified list of risks, risk owners, risk triggers, risk
             strategies, contingency plans, and contingency reserves.

                  D. A cost breakdown structure can be used as an input variable for the cost analysis

             13. Your hardware vendor left you voicemail saying that a snowstorm in the Midwest will prevent
                 your equipment from arriving on time. You identified a risk response strategy for this risk and
                 have arranged for a local company to lease you the needed equipment until yours arrives. This
                 is an example of which risk response strategy?

                    15. You work for a large manufacturing plant. You are working on a new project to release an over-
                        seas product line. This is the company's first experience in the overseas market, and it hopes to
                        make a big splash with the introduction of this product. The stakeholders are a bit nervous about
                        the project and historically proceed cautiously and take a considerable amount of time to exam-
                        ine information before making a final decision. The project entails producing your product in a
                        concentrated formula and packaging it in smaller containers than the U.S. product uses. A new
                        machine is needed in order to mix the ingredients into a concentrated formula. After speaking
                        with one of your stakeholders, you discover this will be the first machine your organization has
                        purchased from your new supplier. Which of the following statements is true given the infor-
                        mation in this question?
                          A. The question describes risk tolerance levels of the stakeholders, which should be considered
                             as an input to the Risk Management Planning process.
                          B. This question describes the interviewing tool and technique used during the Risk Identifica-
                             tion process.
                          C. This question describes risk triggers that are derived using interviewing techniques and
                             recorded in the risk register during the Qualitative Risk Analysis process.
                          D. This question describes a risk that requires a response strategy from the positive risk category.

                    16. Your project team has identified several potential risks on your current project that could have
                        a significant impact if they occurred. They examined the impact of the risks by keeping all the
                        uncertain elements at their baseline values. What type of diagram will the team use to display
                        this information?
                          A. Fishbone diagram

                          B. It describes risk categories, which are a systematic way to identify risks and provide a foun-
                             dation for understanding for everyone involved on the project.
                          C. The lowest level of the RBS can be used as a checklist, which is a tool and technique of the
                             Risk Identification process.
                          D. The RBS is similar to the WBS in that the lowest level of both are easily assigned to a respon-
                             sible party or owner.

                                                                                      Review Questions          211




             19. Your team has identified the risks on the project and determined their risk score. They're in the
                 midst of determining what strategies to put in place should the risks occur. After some discus-
                 sion, they've determined that the risk of losing their network administrator is a risk they'll just
                 deal with if and when it occurs. While they think it's a possibility and the impact would be sig-
                 nificant, they've decided to simply deal with it after the fact. Which of the following is true
                 regarding this question?
                  A. This is a negative response strategy.
                  B. This is a positive response strategy.
                  C. This is a response strategy for either positive or negative risk known as contingency planning.
                  D. This is a response strategy for either positive or negative risks known as passive acceptance.

             20. All of the following are true regarding the Qualitative Risk Analysis process except which one?
                  A. Probability and impact and expert interview are used to help correct biases that occur in the
                     data you've gathered during this process.
                  B. The probability and impact matrix is used during this process to assign red, yellow, and
                     green conditions to risks.
                  C. Qualitative Risk Analysis is an easy method of determining risk probability and impact that
                     usually takes a good deal of time to perform.
                  D. Risk urgency assessment is a tool and technique of this process used to determine which risks
                     need near-term response plans.

                    212         Chapter 5         Risk Planning




                    Answers to Review Questions
                    1.    B. The cause-and-effect flowcharts--also called fishbone diagrams or Ishikawa diagrams--
                          show the relationship between the causes and effects of problems.

                    2.    C. The purpose of Qualitative Risk Analysis is to determine what impact the identified risks will
                          have on the project and the probability they'll occur. It also puts risks in priority order according
                          to their effect on the project objectives and assigns a risk score for the project.

                    3.    B. The risk management plan details how risk management processes will be implemented, mon-
                          itored, and controlled throughout the life of the project. The risk management plan does not
                          include responses to risks or triggers. Responses to risks are detailed in the Risk Response Plan-
                          ning process.

                    4.    C. Distributions graphically display the probability of risk to the project objectives as well as the
                          time and or cost elements.

                    5.    D. The information-gathering techniques in the Risk Identification process are brainstorming,
                          Delphi technique, interviewing, root cause identification, and SWOT analysis.

                    6.    C. Quantitative Risk Analysis analyzes the probability of risks and their consequences using a
                          numerical rating. Qualitative Risk Analysis may use numeric ratings but can use a high-medium-low
                          scale as well.

                    7.    C. Probability of achieving time and cost estimates is an update that is produced from the Quan-
                          titative Risk Analysis process.

                    8.    B. This risk event has the potential to save money on project costs so it's an opportunity and the
                          appropriate strategy to use in this case is the exploit strategy.

                    9.    D. This risk event has the potential to save money on project costs. Sharing involves using a third
                          party to help assure that the opportunity comes about.

                    10. A. The best answer is A. Triggers are warning signs of an impending risk.

                    11. C. The probability and impact matrix multiplies the probability, which falls from 0.0 to 1.0, and
                        impact to determine a risk score. A high, medium, or low designation is assigned to the risk
                        based on a predetermined threshold.

                    12. B. Monte Carlo analysis is a simulation technique.

                    13. C. Mitigation attempts to reduce the impact of a risk event should it occur. Making plans to
                        arrange for the leased equipment reduces the consequences of the risk.

                    14. A. Assumptions analysis is a tool and technique of the Risk Identification process.

                    15. A. This question describes risk tolerance levels of the stakeholders. Risk triggers are recorded in
                        the risk register during the Risk Response Planning process. The risk of buying a machine from
                        a new supplier would pose a threat to the project, not an opportunity. Interviewing may have
                        been used but this question wasn't describing the Risk Identification process.

             16. B. The question describes sensitivity analysis, which is a tool and technique of the Quantitative
                 Risk Analysis process. Tornado diagrams are often used to display sensitivity analysis data.

             17. B. Decision tree diagrams are used during the Quantitative Risk Analysis process. All the other
                 options are diagramming techniques of the Risk Identification process.

             18. D. The RBS describes risk categories and the lowest level can be used as a checklist to help iden-
                 tify risks. Risk owners are not assigned from the RBS; they're assigned during the Risk Response
                 Planning process.

             19. D. This is a response strategy known as passive acceptance because the team has decided to take
                 no action and make no plans for the risk. This is a strategy that can be used for either positive
                 or negative risks.

             20. C. Qualitative Risk Analysis is a fast and easy method of determining probability and impact.

                                                     We're closing in on finishing up the Planning group processes. We're
                                                     at a place where we need to talk about some processes that aren't
                                                     necessarily related to each other but need to be completed before
                    we can construct the project schedule and budget. So we'll start out this chapter with two pro-
                    curement processes--Plan Purchases and Acquisitions and Plan Contracting--and then move
                    on to Human Resource Planning, where we will develop the staffing management plan. This
                    plan will help guide us later on in acquiring our project team members.
                        Then we'll get back on track with a theme by finishing up the chapter with two processes that
                    will start us off on the right foot toward estimating and scheduling activities. They are the Activ-
                    ity Definition process and the Activity Sequencing process.
                        All of the processes we'll talk about in this chapter are used to develop both the project sched-
                    ule and budget, which are two of the most important documents in our project plan (we'll dis-
                    cuss those in the next chapter). Let's get going.



                    Understanding Purchases
                    and Acquisitions
                    Plan Purchases and Acquisitions is a process of identifying what goods or services you're going to
                    purchase from outside of the organization and which project needs can be met by the project team.
                    Part of what you'll accomplish in this process is determining whether you should purchase the
                    goods or services and, if so, how much and when. Keep in mind that we're discussing the pro-
                    curement from the buyer's perspective, as this is the approach used in A Guide to the PMBOK.
                        The Plan Purchases and Acquisitions process can influence the project schedule and the project
                    schedule can influence this process. For example, availability of a contractor or special order mate-
                    rials may have a significant impact on the schedule. And conversely, your organization's business
                    cycle may have an impact on the Plan Purchases and Acquisitions process if the organization is depen-
                    dent on seasonal activity. The Activity Resource Estimating process, which we'll cover in Chapter 7,
                    also can be influenced by this process, as will make-or-buy decisions (we'll get to those shortly).


                                          You need to perform each process in the Project Procurement Management
                                          knowledge area (beginning with Plan Purchases and Acquisitions and ending
                                          with Contract Closure) for each product or service that you're buying outside
                                          of the organization. Obviously, if you're procuring all your resources from
                                          within the organization, the only process you'll perform in this knowledge area
                                          is the Plan Purchases and Acquisitions process.

                                                           Understanding Purchases and Acquisitions            217




                Sometimes, your entire project will be procured from a vendor. In cases like these, the vendor
             will have a project manager assigned to the project. Your organization may choose to have an
             internal project manager assigned as well to act as the conduit between your company and the
             vendor and to provide information and monitor your organization's deliverables. When this
             happens, the vendor or contracting company is responsible for fulfilling all of the project man-
             agement processes as part of the contract. In the case of an outsourced project, the seller--also
             known as the vendor, supplier, or contractor--manages the project and the buyer becomes the
             stakeholder. If you're hiring a vendor, don't forget to consider permits or professional licenses
             that may be required for the type of work you need them to perform.
                Several inputs are needed when planning for purchases. We'll look at them next.


             Plan Purchases and Acquisitions Inputs
             The Plan Purchases and Acquisitions process has six inputs:
                  Enterprise environmental factors
                  Organizational process assets
                  Project scope statement
                  Work breakdown structure
                  WBS dictionary
                  Project management plan


                                   The project management plan can include risk register, risk-related contractual
                                   agreements, resource requirements, project schedule, activity cost estimates,
                                   and cost baseline.

                Marketplace conditions are the key element of enterprise environmental factors you should
             consider for this process. The organization's guidelines, policies, and organizational policies
             (including any procurement policies) are the elements of the organizational process assets you
             should pay attention to here.


                                   Many organizations have procurement departments that are responsible for
                                   procuring goods and services and writing and managing contracts. Some
                                   organizations also require all contracts be reviewed by their legal department
                                   prior to signing. These are organizational process assets that you should con-
                                   sider when procuring goods and services is necessary.

                It's important for the project manager to understand organizational policies because they
             may impact many of the Planning processes, including the Procurement Planning processes. For
             example, the organization may have purchasing approval processes that must be followed. Per-
             haps orders for goods or services that exceed certain dollar amounts need different levels of
             approval. As the project manager, you need to be aware of policies like this so you're certain you

                    218         Chapter 6         Resource Planning



                    can execute the project smoothly. It's very frustrating to find out after the fact that you should
                    have followed a certain process or policy and now, because you didn't, you've got schedule
                    delays or worse. You could consider using the "Sin now, ask forgiveness later" technique in
                    extreme emergencies, but you didn't hear that from me. By the way, that's not a technique that's
                    authorized by A Guide to the PMBOK.
                       The project manager and the project team will be responsible for coordinating all the orga-
                    nizational interfaces for the project, including technical, human resource, purchasing, and
                    finance. It will serve you well to understand the policies and politics involved in each of these
                    areas in your organization.


                                          My organization is steeped in policy. (A government organization steeped in pol-
                                          icy? Go figure!) It's so steeped in policy we have to request the funds for large
                                          projects at least two years in advance. There are mounds and mounds of request
                                          forms, justification forms, approval forms, routing forms--you get the idea. But
                                          my point is if you miss one of the forms or don't fill out the information correctly,
                                          you can set your project back by a minimum of a year, if not two. Then once the
                                          money is awarded, there are more forms to fill out and policies to follow. Again,
                                          if you don't follow the policies correctly, you can jeopardize future project funds.
                                          Many organizations have a practice of not giving you all the project money up
                                          front in one lump sum. In other words, you must meet major milestones or com-
                                          plete a project phase before they'll fund your next phase. Know what your orga-
                                          nizational policies are well ahead of time. Talk to the people that can walk you
                                          through the process and ask them to check your work to avoid surprises.

                       The project scope statement lists the deliverables and the acceptance criteria for the product
                    or service of the project. Obviously, you'll want to consider these when thinking about procur-
                    ing goods and services. You'll also want to consider the constraints (things like availability and
                    timing of funds, availability of resources, delivery dates, vendor availability) and assumptions
                    (things such as reliability of the vendor, assuming availability of key resources, adequate stake-
                    holder involvement). The product scope description is included in the project scope statement
                    as well and may alert you to special considerations (services, technical requirements, skills)
                    needed to produce the product of the project.
                       The WBS and WBS dictionary identify the deliverables and describe the work required for each
                    element of the WBS. The project management plan will provide you with guidance for procuring
                    goods and services. For example, the risk-related contractual agreements component of this plan
                    describes the types of services of goods needed for risk management. The transference strategy may
                    require the purchase of insurance. Each of these elements should be reviewed when determining
                    which goods and services will be performed within the project and which will be purchased.


                    Tools and Techniques for Plan Purchases and Acquisitions
                    There are three tools and techniques of the Plan Purchases and Acquisitions process. They are
                    make-or-buy analysis, expert judgment, and contract types. We've already covered expert judg-

             Make-or-Buy Analysis
             The main decision you're trying to get to in make-or-buy analysis is whether it's more cost effec-
             tive to buy the products and services or more cost effective for the organization to produce the
             goods and services needed for the project. Costs should include both direct costs--in other
             words, the actual cost to purchase the product or service--and indirect costs, such as the salary
             of the manager overseeing the purchase process or ongoing maintenance costs. Costs don't nec-
             essarily mean the cost to purchase. In make-or-buy analysis, you might weigh the cost of leasing
             items versus buying them. For example, perhaps your project requires the use of a specialized
             piece of hardware that you know will be outdated by the end of the project. In a case like this,
             leasing may be a better option so that when the project is ready to be implemented, a newer ver-
             sion of the hardware can be tested and put into production during rollout.
                Other considerations in make-or-buy analysis might include things like capacity issues,
             skills, availability, and trade secrets. Strict control might be needed for a certain process, and
             thus the process cannot be outsourced. Perhaps your organization has the skills in-house to
             complete the project but your current project list is so backlogged that you can't get to the new
             project for months, so you need to bring in a vendor.
                Make-or-buy analysis is considered a general management technique and concludes with the
             decision to do one or the other.

             Contract Types
             A contract is a compulsory agreement between two or more parties and is used to acquire prod-
             ucts or services from outside the organization. Typically, money is exchanged for the goods or
             services. Contracts are enforceable by law and require an offer and an acceptance.
                There are different types of contracts for different purposes. A Guide to the PMBOK divides
             contracts into three categories:
                  Fixed price or lump sum
                  Cost reimbursable
                  Time and materials (T&M)
                Within the fixed price and cost reimbursable categories there are different types of contracts.
             We'll look at each in the following sections. Keep in mind that several things will impact the
             type of contract you should use. The product requirements (or service criteria) may drive the
             contract type. The market conditions may drive availability and price--remember back in the
             Year 2000 when there wasn't a programmer to be found for under $200 an hour? And the
             amount of risk, for the seller, the buyer, and the project itself, will help determine contract type.



             Exam Spotlight

             There may be an exam question or two regarding contract types, so spend some time getting
             familiar with them.

                    220         Chapter 6         Resource Planning



                    Fixed Price or Lump Sum Contracts
                    Fixed price contracts (also referred to as lump sum contracts) set a specific, firm price for the
                    goods or services rendered. The buyer and seller agree on a well-defined deliverable for a set
                    price. In this kind of contract, the biggest risk is borne by the seller. The seller--or contractor--
                    must take great strides to assure they've covered their costs and will make a comfortable profit
                    on the transaction. The seller assumes the risks of increasing costs, nonperformance, or other
                    problems. However, to counter these unforeseen risks, the seller builds in the cost of the risk to
                    the contract price.
                        Fixed price contracts can be disastrous for both the buyer and the seller if the scope of the
                    project is not well defined or the scope changes dramatically. It's important to have accurate,
                    well-defined deliverables when you're using this type of contract. Conversely, fixed price con-
                    tracts are relatively safe for both buyer and seller when the original scope is well defined and
                    remains unchanged. They typically reap only small profits for the seller and force the con-
                    tractor to work productively and efficiently. This type of contract also minimizes cost and
                    quality uncertainty.
                        Fixed price plus incentive contracts are another type of fixed price contract. The difference
                    here is that the contract includes an incentive--or bonus--for early completion or for some
                    other agreed-upon performance criterion that's exceeded according to contract specifications.
                    The criteria for early completion, or other performance enhancements, must be spelled out in
                    the contract so both parties understand the terms and conditions.
                        Another thing to note with fixed price plus incentive contracts is that some of the risk is borne
                    by the buyer as opposed to the firm fixed price contract, where most all of the risk is borne by the
                    seller. The buyer takes some risk, albeit minimal, by offering the incentive to, for example, get the
                    work done earlier. Suppose the buyer really would like the product delivered 30 days prior to
                    when the seller thinks they can deliver. In this case, the buyer assumes the risk for the early delivery
                    via the incentive.

                    Cost Reimbursable Contracts
                    Cost reimbursable contracts are as the name implies. The allowable costs--allowable is defined
                    by the contract--associated with producing the goods or services are charged to the buyer. All
                    the costs the seller takes on during the project are charged back to the buyer; thus the seller is
                    reimbursed.
                       Cost reimbursable contracts carry the highest risk to the buyer because the total costs are
                    uncertain. As problems arise, the buyer has to shell out even more money to correct the prob-
                    lems. However, the advantage to the buyer with this type of contract is that scope changes are
                    easy to make and can be made as often as you wish--but it will cost you.
                       Cost reimbursable contracts have a lot of uncertainty associated with them. There is little
                    incentive for the contractor to work efficiently or be productive. This type of contract protects
                    the contractor's profit because increasing costs are passed back to the buyer rather than taken
                    out of profits as would be the case with a fixed price contract. Be certain to audit your state-
                    ments when using a contract like this so that charges from some other project the vendor is
                    working on don't accidentally end up on your bill.
                       Cost reimbursable contracts are used most often when there is a lot of uncertainty regarding
                    the project scope, such as for cutting-edge projects and research and development. They are also

                                                         Understanding Purchases and Acquisitions               221




             used for projects that have large investments early in the project life. Let's discuss the three kinds
             of cost reimbursable contracts:
             Cost plus fee (CPF) or cost plus percentage of cost (CPPC) In the cost plus fee (CPF) con-
             tract, also called cost plus percentage of cost (CPPC), the seller is reimbursed for allowable costs
             plus a fee that's calculated as a percentage of the costs. The percentage is agreed upon before-
             hand and documented in the contract. Since the fee is based on costs, the fee is variable. The
             lower the costs, the lower the fee, so the seller doesn't have a lot of motivation to keep costs low.
             Cost plus fixed fee (CPFF) Cost plus fixed fee (CPFF) contracts charge back all allowable
             project costs to the seller and include a fixed fee upon completion of the contract. This is how
             the seller makes money on the deal; the fixed fee portion is the seller's profit. The fee is always
             firm in this kind of contract, but the costs are variable. The seller doesn't necessarily have a lot
             of motivation to control costs with this type of contract, as you can imagine. And the only moti-
             vation to complete the project is driven by the fixed fee portion of the contract.
             Cost plus incentive fee (CPIF) The next category of cost reimbursable contract is cost plus
             incentive fee (CPIF). This is the type of contract in which the buyer reimburses the seller for the
             seller's allowable costs and includes an incentive for exceeding the performance criteria laid out
             in the contract. An incentive fee actually encourages better cost performance by the seller, and
             there is a possibility of shared savings between the seller and buyer if performance criteria are
             exceeded. The qualification for exceeded performance must be written into the contract and
             agreed to by both parties, as should the definition of allowable costs; the seller can possibly lose
             the incentive fee if agreed-upon targets are not reached.
             There is moderate risk for the buyer under the cost plus incentive fee contract, and if well-writ-
             ten, it can be more beneficial for both the seller and buyer than a cost reimbursable contract.

             Time and Materials (T&M) Contracts
             Time and materials (T&M) contracts are a cross between the fixed price and cost reimbursable
             contracts. The full amount of the material costs is not known at the time the contract is
             awarded. This resembles a cost reimbursable contract because the costs will continue to grow
             during the contract's life and are reimbursable to the contractor.
                T&M contracts can resemble fixed price contracts when unit rates are used, for example. Unit
             rates may be used to preset the rates of certain elements or portions of the project. For example,
             a contracting agency might charge you $135 per hour for a Java programmer, or a leasing com-
             pany may charge you $2,000 per month for the hardware you're renting during the testing phase
             of your project. These rates are preset and agreed upon by the buyer and seller ahead of time.



             Exam Spotlight

             Understand the difference between a fixed price contract and a cost reimbursable contract for
             the exam. Also know when each type of contract should be used and which party bears the
             most risk under each type of contract.

                    Plan Purchases and Acquisitions Outputs
                    There are four outputs of the Plan Purchases and Acquisitions process. The first is the procure-
                    ment management plan. We've seen a lot of other outputs whose names end with the words
                    management plan, so you're probably already ahead of me on this one. But hold the phone--
                    let's make sure we touch on the important points. The other outputs are the contract statement
                    of work, make-or-buy decisions, and requested changes.

                    Procurement Management Plan
                    The procurement management plan details how the procurement process will be managed. It
                    includes the following information:
                          The types of contract to use
                          The authority of the project team
                          How the procurement process will be integrated with other project processes
                          Where to find standard procurement documents (provided your organization uses standard
                          documents)
                          How many vendors or contractors are involved and how they'll be managed
                          How the procurement process will be coordinated with other project processes, such as per-
                          formance reporting and scheduling
                          How the constraints and assumptions may be impacted by purchasing
                          How multiple vendors or contractors will be managed
                          Coordination of purchasing lead times with the development of the project schedule
                          The schedule dates that are determined in each contract
                          Identification of prequalified sellers (if known)
                    The procurement management plan, like all the other management plans, becomes a subsidiary
                    of the project management plan.

                    Contract Statement of Work
                    A contract statement of work (SOW) contains the details of the procurement item in clear, con-
                    cise terms. It includes the following elements:
                          The project objectives
                          A description of the work of the project and any postproject operational support needed
                          Concise specifications of the product or services required
                          The project schedule, time period of services, and work location
                       The contract SOW may be prepared by either the buyer or the seller. Buyers might prepare
                    the contract SOW and give it to the sellers, who in turn rewrite it so that they can price the work
                    out properly. If the buyer does not know how to prepare a contract SOW or the seller would
                    be better at creating the SOW due to their expertise about the product or service, the seller may
3601.book Page 223 Wednesday, July 13, 2005 1:39 PM




                                                                                       Plan Contracting       223




             prepare it and then give it to the buyer to review. In either case, the contract statement of work
             is developed from the project scope statement and the WBS and WBS dictionary.
                 The seller uses the contract SOW to determine whether they are able to produce the goods
             or services as specified. In addition, it wouldn't hurt to include a copy of the WBS with the con-
             tract SOW. Any information the seller can use to properly price the goods or services helps both
             sides understand what's needed and how it will be provided.
                 Projects may require some or all of the work of the project to be provided by a vendor. The
             Plan Purchases and Acquisitions process determines if goods or services should be produced
             within the organization or procured from outside, and if goods or services are procured from
             outside, it describes what will be outsourced and what kind of contract to use and then docu-
             ments the information in the contract SOW and procurement management plan.


                                   You prepared a SOW during the Develop Project Charter process. You can use
                                   that SOW as the contract SOW during this process if you're contracting out the
                                   entire project. Otherwise, you can use just those portions of the SOW that
                                   describe the work you're contracting for.



             Make-or-Buy Decisions
             The make-or-buy decision is a document that outlines the decisions made during the process
             regarding which goods and or services will be produced by the organization and which will be
             purchased. This can include any number of items, including services, products, insurance poli-
             cies, performance, and performance bonds.

             Requested Changes
             Like many of the other processes we've discussed so far, requested changes may come about as
             a result of the Plan Purchases and Acquisitions process. Those changes, like all the others,
             should be processed through the Integrated Change Control process.
                Once we've determine which goods and services we're going to procure and decided on the
             best type of contract to use for our situation, we'll move into the Plan Contracting processes to
             prepare the information needed for choosing a vendor.



             Plan Contracting
             The purpose of Plan Contracting is to prepare the documents you'll use in the Request Seller
             Responses and Select Sellers processes. We'll discuss these processes in Chapter 9, "Measuring
             and Controlling Project Performance." The inputs to this process are the procurement manage-
             ment plan, contract statement of work, make-or-buy decisions, and the project management
             plan (with special attention to the risk register, risk-related contractual agreements, resource
             requirements, project schedule, activity cost estimates, and cost baseline). We've covered all
             these inputs previously.

                       The tools and techniques of Plan Contracting are standard forms and expert judgment. Stan-
                    dard forms are used to facilitate the procurement process. These are forms that are standardized
                    for your organization and for the types of goods or services typically procured by the organi-
                    zation. Your organization may or may not have standard forms. They are usually found in orga-
                    nizations that write a lot of contracts and procure a significant number of goods and services.
                    They may include standard contract forms, nondisclosure agreements, proposal evaluation cri-
                    teria, and so on.


                    Plan Contracting Outputs
                    The three outputs of the Plan Contracting process are procurement documents, evaluation cri-
                    teria, and contract statement of work updates. Let's take a quick look at each.

                    Procurement Documents
                    Procurement documents are used to solicit vendors and suppliers to bid on your procurement
                    needs. You're probably familiar with some of the titles of procurement documents. They might
                    be called request for proposal (RFP), request for information (RFI), invitation for bid (IFB),
                    request for quotation (RFQ), and so on.
                       Procurement documents should clearly state the description of the work requested, they should
                    include the contract SOW, and they should explain how sellers should format and submit their
                    responses. These documents are prepared by the buyer to assure as accurate and complete a response
                    as possible from all potential bidders. Any special provisions or contractual needs should be spelled
                    out as well. For example, many organizations have data concerning their marketing policies, new
                    products introductions planned for the next few years, trade secrets, and so on. The vendor will have
                    access to this private information, and in order to ensure they maintain confidentiality, you should
                    require that they sign a nondisclosure agreement.
                       A few terms are used during this process--usually interchangeably--that you should be
                    aware of. When your decision is going to be made primarily on price, the terms bid and quo-
                    tation are used, as in IFB or RFQ. When considerations other than price (such as technology or
                    specific approaches to the project) are the deciding factor, the term proposal is used, as in RFP.
                    These terms are used interchangeably in practice, even though they have specific meanings in A
                    Guide to the PMBOK.


                                          In my organization, all solicitation requests are submitted as RFPs, even though
                                          our primary deciding factor is price.

                                                                                    Plan Contracting        225




               Procurement documents are posted or advertised according to your organizational policies.
             This may include ads in newspapers and magazines or Internet posting.

             Evaluation Criteria
             Evaluation criteria refers to the method your organization will use to choose a vendor from
             among the proposals you receive. The criteria may be subjective or objective. In some cases,
             price may be the only criteria, and that means the vendor that submits the lowest bid will win
             the contract. You should only use purchase price (which should include costs associated with
             purchase price, like delivery and setup charges) as the sole criteria when there are multiple qual-
             ified sellers to choose from.
                 Other projects may require more extensive criteria than price alone. In this case, scoring
             models might be used as well as rating models, or purely subjective methods of selection might
             be utilized. An example weighted scoring method was described in Chapter 2, "Creating the
             Project Charter and Preliminary Scope Statement," in the section "Benefit Measurement Meth-
             ods." This method can easily be used to score vendor proposals.
                 Sometimes, the evaluation criteria are made public in the procurement process so that ven-
             dors know exactly what you're looking for. There are pros and cons to this approach. If the
             organization typically makes known the evaluation criteria, you'll find that almost all the ven-
             dors that bid on the project meet every criteria you've outlined (in writing that is). When it
             comes time to perform the contract, however, you may encounter some surprises. The vendor
             might have done a great job of writing up the bid based on your criteria, but in reality they don't
             know how to put the criteria into practice. On the other hand, having all the criteria publicly
             known beforehand gives ground to great discussion points and discovery later on in the pro-
             curement processes.
                 The following list includes some of the criteria you can consider using for evaluating pro-
             posals and bids:
                 Comprehension and understanding of the needs of the project as documented in the contract SOW
                 Technical ability of vendor and their proposed team
                 Experience on projects of similar size and scope, including references
                 Project management approach
                 Management approach
                 Financial stability and capacity
                 Intellectual and proprietary rights
                 You could include these in a weighted scoring model and rate each vendor on how well they
             responded to these issues.

             Contract SOW Updates
             You may find that changes to the contract statement of work are needed as a result of develop-
             ing the procurement documents. These updates are usually made at the end of the Plan Con-
             tracting process.
                Let's switch gears now and take a look at how we plan for the types of resources we'll need
             on the project in the Human Resource Planning process.

                    The Customer Relationship Management System Response

                    Ryan Hunter is preparing the evaluation criteria for an RFP for a customer relationship man-
                    agement (CRM) software system. After meeting with key stakeholders and other project man-
                    agers in the company who've had experience working on projects of this size and scope, he
                    devised the first draft of the evaluation criteria. A partial list is shown here.

                          Successful bidder's response must detail how business processes (as documented in the
                          RFP page 24) will be addressed with their solution.

                          Successful bidder must document their project management approach, which must follow
                          PMI's A Guide to the PMBOK project practices. Must provide an example project manage-
                          ment plan based on a previous project experience of similar size and scope to the one doc-
                          umented in the RFP.

                          Successful bidder must document previous successful implementations, including inte-
                          gration with existing organization's PBX and network operating system, and must provide
                          references.

                          Successful bidder must provide financial statements for the previous three years.




                    Human Resource Planning
                    All projects require human resources, from the smallest project to the largest. The Human
                    Resource Planning process documents the roles and responsibilities of individuals or groups for
                    various project elements and then documents the reporting relationships for each. Reporting
                    relationships can be assigned to groups as well as to individuals, and the groups or individuals
                    may be internal or external to the organization or a combination of both. Communications
                    Planning goes hand in hand with Human Resource Planning, because the organizational struc-
                    ture affects the way communications are carried out among project participants and the project
                    interfaces.
                       The three outputs of this process include documenting roles and responsibilities, creating and
                    documenting the staffing management plan, and creating the organization chart.


                    Human Resource Planning Inputs
                    Human Resource Planning has three inputs: enterprise environmental factors, organizational
                    process assets, and project management plan (particularly the activity resource requirements).
                    We'll take a look at the key elements of each of these next.
3601.book Page 227 Wednesday, July 13, 2005 1:39 PM




                                                                          Human Resource Planning            227




             Key Environmental Factors for Human Resource Planning
             Enterprise environmental factors play a key role in determining human resource roles and
             responsibilities. The type of organization you work in, the reporting relationships, and the tech-
             nical skills needed to complete the project work are a few of the factors you should consider
             when developing the staffing management plan. Let's briefly look at the factors A Guide to the
             PMBOK details:
             Organizational factors Consider what departments or organization units will have a role on
             the project, the interactions between and among departments, and the level of formality in these
             working relationships.
             Technical factors Consider the types of specialized skills needed to complete the work of the
             project (for example, programming languages, engineering skills, knowledge of pharmaceuti-
             cals) and any technical considerations during hand-off from phase to phase or from project
             completion to production.
             Interpersonal factors Interpersonal factors have to do with potential project team members.
             You should consider their experience, skills, current reporting relationships, cultural consider-
             ations, and perceptions regarding their levels of trust and respect for coworkers and superiors.
             Location and logistics Consider where the project team is physically located and whether they
             are all located together or at separate facilities (or cities or countries).
             Political factors Political factors involve your stakeholders. Consider the amount of influence
             the stakeholders have, their interactions and influence with each other, and the power they can
             exert over the project.
                In addition to these factors, you should also consider project constraints. The topic of con-
             straints seems to come up a lot, so you probably remember that constraints are things that limit
             the options available to the project team. These typically involve time, costs, scope, and quality.
             However, there are a few new constraints regarding project teams that you should know about:
             Organizational structures Organizational structures can be constraints. For example, a strong
             matrix organization provides the project manager with much more authority and power than
             the weak matrix organization does. Functional organizations typically do not empower their
             project managers with the proper authority to carry out a project. If you work in a functional
             organization as I do, it's important to be aware that you'll likely face power struggles with other
             managers and, in some cases, a flat-out lack of cooperation. Don't tell them I said this, but func-
             tional managers tend to be territorial and aren't likely to give up control easily. The best advice
             I have for you in this case is as follows:
                      Establish open communications early on in the project.
                      Include all the functional managers with key roles in important decisions.
                      Get the support of your project sponsor to empower you (as the project manager) with
                      as much authority as possible. It's important that the sponsor makes it clear to the other
                      managers that their cooperation on project activities is expected.

                    Collective bargaining agreements Collective bargaining agreements are actually contractual
                    obligations of the organization. Collective bargaining is typically associated with unions and
                    organized employee associations. Other organized employee associations or groups may require
                    specialized reporting relationships as well--especially if they involve contractual obligations.
                    You will not likely be involved in the negotiations of collective bargaining agreements, but if
                    you have an opportunity to voice opinions regarding employee duties or agreements that would
                    be helpful to your project or future projects, by all means take it.
                    Economic conditions These conditions refer to the availability of funds for the project team to
                    perform training, hire staff, and travel. If funds are severely limited and your project requires
                    frequent trips to other locations, you have an economic constraint on your hands.



                    Exam Spotlight

                    Understand the key environmental factors and the three constraints that can impact the Human
                    Resource Planning process for the exam.



                    Organizational Process Assets in Human Resource Planning
                    There are two primary elements of the organizational process assets input you should consider
                    during this process. They are templates and checklists.
                       Templates, in this case, refers to documentation like project descriptions, organizational
                    charts, performance appraisals, the organization's conflict management process, and so on.
                       Checklists may include elements like training requirements, project roles and responsibilities,
                    skills and competency levels, safety issues, and so on.



                    Exam Spotlight

                    According to A Guide to the PMBOK, using templates and checklists is one way to ensure that
                    you don't miss any key responsibilities when planning the project and will help reduce the
                    amount of time spent on project planning.



                    Project Management Plan
                    We've examined the project management plan as an input to other Planning processes. In the
                    Human Resource Planning process, you'll want to pay particular attention to the activity resource
                    requirements because they outline the types and quantities of resources needed for project activ-
                    ities. (Activity resource requirements are an output of the Activity Resource Estimating process,
                    which we'll talk about in Chapter 7, "Creating the Project Schedule and Budget.")
3601.book Page 229 Wednesday, July 13, 2005 1:39 PM




                                                                         Human Resource Planning            229




             Human Resource Planning Tools and Techniques
             There are three tools and techniques in the Human Resource Planning process. Remember that
             our goal is to produce the organizational chart, roles and responsibilities, and staffing manage-
             ment plan outputs at the end of this process. You'll see that the tools and techniques directly
             contribute to these outputs. They are organization charts and position descriptions, network-
             ing, and organizational theory. We'll look at each of these in the following sections.

             Organization Charts and Position Descriptions
             We've all seen an organization chart. It usually documents your name, your position, your boss,
             your boss's boss, your boss's boss's boss, and so on. The important thing to note in this tool and
             technique is that there are three ways this information may be presented: hierarchical (which
             describes most organization charts), matrix, and text.

             Hierarchical Charts
             Hierarchical charts, like a WBS, are designed in a top-down format. The head boss is at the top,
             the directors that report to the head boss are shown next, and so on descending down the struc-
             ture. An organization breakdown structure (OBS) is a form of organization chart that shows
             how the WBS elements relate to the organization's departments, work units, or teams rather
             than individuals.
                A resource breakdown structure (RBS) is another type of hierarchical chart that breaks down
             the work of the project according to the types of resources needed. (RBS also stands for risk
             breakdown structure as we learned in the last chapter.) For example, you may have program-
             mers, database analysts, and network analysts as resource types on the RBS. However, they
             won't all necessarily work on the project team. You may have programmers reporting to the
             project team, the finance department, and the customer service department, for example. An
             RBS can help track project costs because it ties to the organization's accounting system. Let's
             suppose you have programming resources in the RBS at the junior, advanced, and senior levels.
             Each of these levels of programmer has an average hourly salary recorded in the accounting sys-
             tem that makes it easy for you to track project costs. Ten senior programmers, 14 advanced, and
             25 junior-level programmers are easy to calculate and track.

             Matrix-Based Charts
             Matrix-based charts are used to show the type of resource and the responsibility they have on
             the project. Many times a project manager will use a Responsibility Assignment Matrix (RAM)
             to graphically display this information. A RAM is usually depicted as a chart with resource
             names listed in each row (for example, programmers, testers and trainers) and project phases or
             WBS elements listed as the columns. (It can also be constructed using team member names.)
             Indicators in the intersections show where the resources are needed. However, the level of detail
             is up to you. One RAM might be developed showing only project phases. Another RAM may
             show level 2 WBS elements for a complex project, with more RAMs subsequently produced for
             the additional WBS levels. Or a RAM might be constructed with level 3 elements only.

                    Exam Spotlight

                    According to A Guide to the PMBOK, the RAM relates the OBS to the WBS to assure that every
                    component of the work of the project is assigned to an individual.



                       Table 6.1 shows a sample portion of a type of RAM called a RACI chart for a software devel-
                    opment team. In this example, the RACI chart shows the level of accountability each of the partic-
                    ipants has on the project. The letters in the acronym RACI are the designations shown in the chart:
                       R = Responsible for performing the work
                       A = Accountable, the one who approves or signs off on the work
                       C = Consult, someone who has input to the work or decisions
                       I = Inform, someone who must be informed of the decisions or results

                    TABLE 6.1              Sample RAM


                                            Karen                Rae                    Melinee      JoJo

                    Design                  R                    A                      C            C

                    Test                    I                    R                      C            A

                    Implement               C                    I                      R            A

                    Legend: R = Responsible, A = Accountable, C = Consult, I = Inform




                       In this example, Karen is responsible for design, meaning she does the work, but Rae is
                    accountable and the one who must approve design. This a great tool because it shows at a glance
                    not only where a resource is working but what that resource's responsibility level is on the project.

                    Text-Oriented Formats
                    Text-oriented formats are used when you have a significant amount of detail to record. These
                    are also called position descriptions or role-responsibility-authority forms. These forms detail
                    (as the name implies) the role, responsibility, and authority of the resource and they make great
                    templates to use for future projects.
                       Don't forget that other subsidiary plans of the project management plan may also describe
                    roles and responsibilities. For example, you'll recall from Chapter 5 that the risk register lists the
                    risk owners and their responsibility, so be certain to check these documents when outlining roles
                    and responsibilities as well.

                    Networking
                    Networking in this process doesn't refer to the technical kind of networking with servers,
                    switches, and fiber. It means human resource networking; that is, you know someone who
3601.book Page 231 Wednesday, July 13, 2005 1:39 PM




                                                                         Human Resource Planning            231




             knows someone who knows someone. According to A Guide to the PMBOK, there are several
             types of networking activities: proactive communication, lunch meetings (my personal favor-
             ite), informal conversations (ah...the information you learn by hanging out at the water cooler),
             and trade conferences (another favorite because they get you out of the office).

             Organizational Theory
             Organizational theory refers to all the theories that attempt to explain what makes people,
             teams, and work units perform the way they do. We'll talk more about motivation techniques
             (which are a type of organizational theory) in Chapter 8, "Developing the Project Team." Orga-
             nizational theory improves the probability that planning will be effective and helps shorten the
             amount of time it takes to produce the Human Resource Planning outputs.


             Human Resource Planning Outputs
             The Human Resource Planning process has three outputs: roles and responsibilities, project
             organizational charts, and the staffing management plan. We've already covered organization
             charts in detail, so we'll take a look at the other two outputs now.

             Roles and Responsibilities
             This output is the list of roles and responsibilities for the project team. It can take the form of
             the RAM or RACI chart we talked about earlier or the roles and responsibilities can be recorded
             in text format. The key elements you should include in the roles and responsibilities documen-
             tation are the following:
             Roles Describes what part of the project the individuals or teams are accountable for. This
             should also include a description of authority levels, responsibilities, and what work is not
             included as part of the role.
             Authority Describes the amount of authority the resource has to make decisions, dictate direc-
             tion, and approve the work.
             Responsibility Describes the work required to complete the project activities.
             Competency Describes the skills and ability needed to perform the project activities.

             Staffing Management Plan
             The staffing management plan documents how and when human resources are introduced to
             the project and the criteria for releasing them. As with the other management plans we've dis-
             cussed, the level and amount of detail contained in this plan are up to you. It can be formal or
             informal, and it can contain lots of detail or only high-level detail.
                The staffing management plan is a subsidiary plan to the project management plan and
             should be updated throughout the project. There are several elements that should be considered
             for inclusion in the staffing management plan, including the following:
             Staff acquisition This describes how team members are acquired (from inside or outside the
             organization), where they're located, and the costs for specific skills and expertise. We'll talk
             more about staff acquisition in Chapter 8.

                    Timetable This describes the time frames in which the resources will be needed on the project
                    and when the recruitment process should begin. The resources can be described individually, by
                    teams, or by function (programmers, testers, etc.). Many staffing management plans make use
                    of a resource histogram. This is usually drawn in chart form, with project time along the hori-
                    zontal axis and hours needed along the vertical axis. The following example histogram shows
                    the hours needed for an asphalt crew on a construction project:
                                                                        Resource Histogram for Asphalt Crew

                    Release criteria Attention should be given to how you'll release project team members at the end
                    of their assignment. You should have reassignment procedures in place to move folks on to other
                    projects or back to assignments they had before the project. This reduces overall project costs
                    because you pay them only for the time they work and then release them. You won't have a ten-
                    dency to simply keep them busy between assignments or until the end of their scheduled end date
                    if they complete their activities early. Having these procedures in place will also improve morale
                    because everyone will be clear about how reassignment will occur. This should reduce anxiety
                    about their opportunity for employment at the conclusion of the project or their assignment.
                    Training needs This describes any training plans needed for team members who don't have
                    the required skills or abilities to perform project tasks.
                    Recognition and rewards This describe the systems you'll use to reward and reinforce desired
                    behavior. We'll talk more about recognition and rewards in Chapter 8.
                    Compliance If your project involves regulations that must be met or contractual obligations
                    (such as union contracts), the staffing management plan should detail these and any human
                    resource policies the organization has in place that deal with compliance issues.
                    Safety Any safety policies and procedures that are applicable to the project or industry you
                    work in should be included in the staffing management plan.

                                                                               Defining Activity Definition          233




             Defining Activity Definition
             Now we're off and running toward the development of our project schedule. In order to develop the
             schedule, we first need to define the activities, sequence them in the right order, estimate resources,
             and estimate the time it will take to complete the tasks. We'll cover the Activity Definition here, cover
             Activity Sequencing processes next, and pick up with the estimating processes in the next chapter.


                                   Activity Definition, Activity Sequencing, Activity Resource Estimating, Activity
                                   Duration Estimating, and Schedule Development are separate processes, each
                                   with inputs, tools and techniques, and outputs. In practice, especially for small-
                                   to medium-sized projects, these processes can be combined into one process
                                   or step. We'll take a look at the first two activity-related processes now. Chapter 7
                                   describes the Activity Resource Estimating, Activity Duration Estimating, and
                                   Schedule Development processes.

                 The Activity Definition process is a further breakdown of the work package elements of the WBS.
             It documents the specific activities needed to fulfill the deliverables detailed on the WBS. This process
             may be performed by the project manager, or when the WBS is broken down to the subproject level,
             this process (and all the "Activity" processes that follow) might be assigned to a subproject manager.


             Activity Definition Process Inputs
             The inputs to the Activity Definition process and the key elements you should consider as inputs
             to this process are shown in the following list:
                  Enterprise environmental factors (project management information systems and scheduling
                  software tools)
                  Organizational process assets (existing guidelines and policies)
                  Project scope statement (deliverables, constraints, and assumptions)
                  WBS (this is the primary input to this process)
                  WBS dictionary
                  Project management plan (schedule management plan)


             Tools and Techniques for Defining Activities
             The tools and techniques of the Activity Definition process are as follows:
                  Decomposition
                  Templates
                  Rolling wave planning
                  Expert judgment
                  Planning component
3601.book Page 234 Wednesday, July 13, 2005 1:39 PM




                    234         Chapter 6         Resource Planning



                       Decomposition is the process of breaking the work packages into smaller, more manageable
                    units of work called schedule activities. These are not deliverables but the individual units of
                    work that must be completed to fulfill the deliverables. Activity lists (which are one of the out-
                    puts of this process) from prior projects can be used as templates in this process. Rolling wave
                    planning involves planning near-term work in more detail than future-term work. Expert judg-
                    ment, in the form of project team members with prior experience developing project scope state-
                    ments and WBSs, can help you define activities.
                       The planning component is a new tool and technique we haven't seen before. Two of the plan-
                    ning components discussed in A Guide to the PMBOK are the control account and the planning
                    package. The idea with this tool and technique is that you may have WBS elements that really
                    can't be broken down much further. In that case, the work package level in those branches of
                    the WBS can be used to develop high-level schedules and plan future work at higher levels of the
                    WBS. You can use a control account within the WBS to assign a management control point any-
                    where above the work package level to use as a basis for planning when the work package level
                    hasn't been planned. The planning package is any element on the WBS that's below the control
                    account but still above the work package level used for planning purposes.



                    Exam Spotlight

                    The purpose of the Activity Definition process is to decompose the work packages into sched-
                    ule activities where the basis for estimating, scheduling, executing, and monitoring and con-
                    trolling the work of the project are easily supported and accomplished.




                    Activity Definition Outputs
                    Activity Definition has four outputs:
                          Activity list
                          Activity attributes
                          Milestone list
                          Requested changes
                       You'll be happy to know that we aren't going to create an Activity Definition management
                    plan at the end of this process. We've looked at requested changes before. We'll examine the rest
                    of the outputs here.

                    Activity List
                    One primary output of the Activity Definition process is called an activity list. The activity list should
                    contain all the schedule activities that will be performed for the project, with a scope of work
                    description of each activity and an identifier (such as a code or number) so that team members
                    understand what the work is and how it is to be completed. The schedule activities are individual ele-
                    ments of the project schedule, and the activity list is a subsidiary of the project management plan.

                                   In practice, when you're working on a small project or projects that aren't that
                                   complex, Activity Definition might be accomplished during the construction of
                                   the WBS and the activities themselves become the work package level. How-
                                   ever, for the exam, remember that activities are elements of the project sched-
                                   ule but they are not a part of the WBS.



             Activity Attributes
             Activity attributes describe the characteristics of the activities and are an extension of the activ-
             ity list. Activity attributes may describe information such as the activity identifier or code,
             descriptions, constraints and assumptions associated with the activity, activities that come
             before this activity (predecessor activities) and after this activity (successor activities), resource
             requirements, the individual responsible for completing the work, and so on. The activity
             attributes are used in the schedule model tool and technique of the Schedule Development pro-
             cess (we'll talk about this in the next chapter).

             Milestone Lists
             Milestones are typically major accomplishments of the project and mark the completion of
             major deliverables or some other key event in the project. For example, approval and sign-
             off on project deliverables might be considered milestones. Other examples might be com-
             pletion of a prototype, system testing, contract approval, and so on. The milestone list
             records these accomplishments and documents whether the milestone is mandatory or
             optional. The milestone list is part of the project management plan and is also used to help
             develop the project schedule.



             Understanding the Activity Sequencing
             Process
             Now that you've identified the schedule activities, you need to sequence them in a logical order
             and find out if dependencies exist among the activities. The interactivity of logical relationships
             must be sequenced correctly in order to facilitate the development of a realistic, achievable
             project schedule in a later process.
                 Consider a classic example. Let's say you're going to paint your house but, unfortunately, it's
             fallen into a little disrepair. The old paint is peeling and chipping and will need to be scraped before
             a coat of primer can be sprayed on the house. After the primer dries, the painting can commence. In
             this example, the primer activity depends on the scraping. You can't--okay, you shouldn't--prime
             the house before scraping off the peeling paint. The painting activity depends on the primer activity
             in the same way. You really shouldn't start painting until the primer has dried.

                    236         Chapter 6         Resource Planning



                       During Activity Sequencing, you will use a host of inputs and tools and techniques to pro-
                    duce the primary output, project schedule network diagrams. We've already seen all of the
                    inputs. They are project scope statement, activity list, activity attributes, milestone list, and
                    approved change requests. These were discussed in this and other chapters. There are several
                    new tools and techniques that we'll look at now.


                    Activity Sequencing Tools and Techniques
                    Activity Sequencing has five tools and techniques, all of which are new to us:
                          Precedence diagramming method (PDM)
                          Arrow diagramming method (ADM)
                          Schedule network templates
                          Dependency determination
                          Applying leads and lags
                       I'm going to switch the order of these and look at dependency determination first. In practice,
                    you'll define dependencies either before or while you're using the PDM or ADM methods to
                    draw your network templates, so to make sure we're all on the same page with A Guide to the
                    PMBOK terminology regarding dependencies, we'll cover them first and then move on to the
                    other tools and techniques.

                    Dependency Determination
                    Dependencies are relationships between the activities in which one activity is dependent on
                    another to complete an action or perhaps an activity is dependent on another to start an action
                    before it can proceed. Dependency determination is a matter of determining where those depen-
                    dencies exist. Thinking back to the house-painting example, we couldn't paint until the scraping
                    and priming activities were completed. There are three types of dependencies you'll want to
                    know about for the exam:
                          Mandatory dependencies
                          Discretionary dependencies
                          External dependencies
                      As you've probably guessed, A Guide to the PMBOK defines dependencies differently
                    depending on their characteristics.
                      Let's look at each of these in more detail.
                    Mandatory dependencies Mandatory dependencies, also known as hard logic or hard depen-
                    dencies, are defined by the type of work being performed. The scraping, primer, painting
                    sequences are examples of mandatory dependencies. The nature of the work itself dictates the
                    order in which the activities should be performed. Activities with physical limitations are a tell-
                    tale sign that you have a mandatory dependency on your hands.

                                                           Understanding the Activity Sequencing Process      237




             Discretionary dependencies Discretionary dependencies are defined by the project manage-
             ment team. Discretionary dependencies are also known as preferred logic, soft logic, or prefer-
             ential logic. These are usually process or procedure driven or "best practices" techniques based
             on past experience. For example, both past experience and best practices on house-painting
             projects has shown that all trim work should be hand-painted while the bulk of the main paint-
             ing work should be done with a sprayer.
             External dependencies External dependencies are, well, external to the project. This may seem
             obvious, but A Guide to the PMBOK points out that even though the dependency is external
             to the project (and therefore a non-project activity), it impacts project activities. For example,
             perhaps your project is researching and marketing a new drug. The FDA must approve the drug
             before your company can market it. This is not a project activity, but the project cannot move
             forward until approval occurs. That means FDA approval is an external dependency.
                Once you've identified the dependencies and assembled all the other inputs for the Activity
             Sequencing process, you'll take this information and produce a diagram--or schematic dis-
             play--of the project activities. The project schedule network diagram shows the dependencies--
             or logical relationships--that exist among the activities. You can use one of the other tools and
             techniques of this process to produce this output. Let's examine each in detail.

             Precedence Diagramming Method (PDM)
             The precedence diagramming method (PDM) is what most project management software pro-
             grams use to do activity sequencing today. Precedence diagrams use boxes or rectangles to rep-
             resent the activities (called nodes). The nodes are connected with arrows showing the
             dependencies between the activities. This method is also called activity on node (AON).
                The minimum information that should be displayed on the node is the activity name, but you
             may put as much information about the activity on the node as you'd like. Sometimes the nodes
             are displayed with activity name, activity number, start and stop dates, due dates, slack time,
             and so on. (We'll cover slack time in Chapter 7. For the exam, remember that the PDM uses only
             one time estimate to determine duration.)
                The following graphic shows a PDM--or AON--of the house-painting example.

                                Start             Scrape          Prime               Paint   Finish

                The PDM is further defined by four types of logical relationships (also known as dependen-
             cies; precedence relationships is another term used to describe these relationships).You may
             already be familiar with these if you've used Microsoft Project or similar project management
             software program. The four dependencies, or logical relationships, are as follows:
             Finish-to-start (FS) The finish-to-start relationship is the most frequently used relationship. This
             relationship says that the independent--or from activity--must finish before the dependent--or to
             activity--can start. In PDM diagrams, this is the most often used logical relationship.

                    Start-to-finish (SF) The start-to-finish relationship says that the independent activity must
                    start before the dependent activity can finish. This logical relationship is seldom used.
                    Finish-to-finish (FF) The finish-to-finish relationship says that the independent activity must
                    finish before the dependent activity finishes.
                    Start-to-start (SS) I think you're getting the hang of this. The start-to-start relationship says
                    that the independent activity must start before the dependent activity can start.
                       Keep these logical relationships (or dependencies) in mind when constructing your project
                    schedule network diagram. Remember that finish-to-start is the most commonly used depen-
                    dency in the PDM method. This is also the dependency type you should employ when you're
                    using project management software to diagram your activities. Using the other dependencies in
                    most project management software programs will likely produce unpredictable results.

                    Arrow Diagramming Method (ADM)
                    The arrow diagramming method (ADM) is visually the opposite of the PDM. The arrow diagram-
                    ming method places activities on the arrows, which are connected to dependent activities with
                    nodes. This method is also called activity on arrow (AOA). This technique isn't used nearly as
                    often as PDM, but there are some industries that prefer the ADM to the PDM. For the record, note
                    that ADM allows for more than one time estimate to determine duration and uses only the finish-
                    to-start dependency. And there's one more unique note about ADM to tuck away: Sometimes
                    dummy activities must be plugged into the diagram to accurately display the dependencies.
                       The following example shows the ADM method applied to the house-painting example:
                                             Start       Scrape        Prime    Paint        Finish


                                                          Clean Equipment         Remove Masking




                    Schedule Network Templates
                    Schedule network templates are like the templates we've talked about in other processes. Per-
                    haps the project you're working on is similar to a project that's been completed in the past. You
                    can use a previous project schedule network diagram as a template for the current project. Or
                    you may be working on a project with several deliverables that are fairly identical. You can use
                    the first network diagram as a template and then modify it for each of the other deliverables.

                    Applying Leads and Lags
                    Leads and lags should be considered when determining dependencies. Lags delay successor
                    activities (those that follow a predecessor activity) and require time added either to the start date
                    or to the finish date of the activity you're scheduling. Leads, conversely, speed up the successor
                    activities and require time to be subtracted from the start date or the finish date of the activity
                    you're scheduling.

             Exam Spotlight

             I recommend you memorize the following graphic to help you remember the tools and tech-
             niques of the Activity Sequencing process and their characteristics for the exam. This may look
             a little strange, but I think it will work for you now that you understand what each of these dia-
             gramming methods is about. This is information you need to know for the exam. If this graphic
             isn't useful for you, come up with your own mnemonic or sample that will help you remember
             which of these is which. Don't say I didn't warn you.

                                                      PDM = AON = 1 Time Estimate


                                                        Activity        On Node



                                                      ADM = AOA => 1 Time Estimate

                                                         Activity     On Arrow




                 Let's revisit the house-painting example to put all this in perspective. In order to paint, you
             first need to scrape the peeling paint and then prime. However, you can't begin painting until
             the primer has dried, so you shouldn't schedule priming for Monday and painting for Tuesday
             if you need the primer to dry on Tuesday. Therefore, the priming activity requires lag time, so
             you need to add time to the end of this activity to allow for the drying time needed before you
             can start painting.
                 Lead time works just the opposite. Suppose, for this example, you could start priming before
             the scraping is finished. Maybe there are areas on the house that don't require scraping, so you
             don't really need to wait until the scraping activity finishes to begin the priming activity. Prim-
             ing in this example has lead time subtracted from the beginning of the activity so that this activ-
             ity begins prior to the previous activity finishing.

             Here are the outputs of the Activity Sequencing process:

                    240         Chapter 6         Resource Planning



                        We've just spent a good deal of time describing the different types of project schedule network
                    diagrams you can construct using PDM or ADM techniques. Project schedule network diagrams
                    can be generated on a computer, or you can draw them out by hand. Like the WBS, these diagrams
                    may contain all the project details or may contain only summary-level details, depending on the
                    complexity of the project. Summary-level activities are a collection of related activities also known
                    as hammocks. Think of hammocks as a group of related activities rolled up into a summary head-
                    ing that describes the activities likely to be contained in that grouping.
                        Keep in mind that the construction of these project schedule network diagrams might bring
                    activities to light that you missed when defining your activity list, or it might make you break
                    an activity down into two activities in places where you thought one activity might work. If this
                    is the case, you will produce both activity list updates based on this new information as well as
                    activity attributes updates.
                        After the activities are sequenced, the next steps involve estimating the resources and esti-
                    mating the durations of the activities so that they can be plugged into the project schedule. We'll
                    look at these topics in the next chapter.



                    Project Case Study: New Kitchen Heaven Retail Store

                    "Thanks everyone for your timely responses. I'll look over your list of roles and responsibilities,
                    skills needed for the activities, and your activity lists." The meeting adjourns, and you head
                    back to your office to review the documents. You'd like to get the project schedule constructed
                    soon and go over it with Dirk.

                    Ricardo Ramirez from the IT department has outlined his resource needs and activity list. He reminds
                    you that data is sent from each store over a T1 connection, not over satellite as Jill told you originally.
                    Ricardo's activities are as follows. He's also taken the trouble to write them in sequential order:

                    1.    Procure the T1 connection. This can be done concurrently with the other activities listed
                          here. Ricardo will work on the procurement documents for this activity.

                    2.    Run Ethernet cable throughout the building. This activity depends on the lease being
                          signed and must finish before the build-out can start. Ricardo has one person on staff who
                          can complete this specialized activity. His first available date is October 5.

                    3.    Purchase the router, switch, server, and rack for the equipment room and four point-of-
                          service terminals. Delivery time is two weeks. Ricardo will prepare the procurement doc-
                          uments for these items.

                    4.    Install the router and test the connection. Testing depends on the T1 installation at demar-
                          cation. Ricardo's staff will do this activity.

                    5.    Install the switch. Ricardo's staff will do this activity.

                    6.    Install the server and test. The testing depends on the T1 connection installation. Ricardo's
                          staff will do this activity.

             7.      The web team will add the new store location and phone number to the lookup function on
                     the Internet site. Ricardo will assign his applications-programming manager to this activ-
                     ity. This activity depends on the lease being signed.

             Jake and Jill give you similar activity lists with human resource needs. You use a project man-
             agement software tool to create a first draft of the project schedule network diagram. As you're
             staring at the screen, Dirk walks into your office.

             "You look worried," Dirk says.

             "Yes, I think we may have a problem. Jill mentioned she needs some lead time to stock shelves
             and that might interfere with the store build-out activity assigned to Jake's team. I don't have
             enough information yet to finish this. I need to get some time and cost estimates from everyone
             before I know for sure if there's a problem."

             "I'd rather know sooner than later if there's a problem, so get right on those estimates."

             You toggle over to the calendaring system and see all three stakeholders are free Thursday
             morning. You set up a meeting time so you can explain to each of them what information you
             need next.

                    Exam Spotlight

                    You may find that the Activity Sequencing process gets a lot of coverage on the exam. Be cer-
                    tain you understand its inputs and tools and techniques well. Then again, remember the exam
                    is randomly generated from a pool of questions, so don't ever concentrate all your memoriza-
                    tion efforts on only one or two processes.




                    Summary
                    This chapter's focus was on planning for project resources. There are several aspects involved
                    in these planning activities, including procurement of goods and services, human resource plan-
                    ning, and defining the activities human resources will be involved in.
                        We started out with the Plan Purchases and Acquisitions process. This process identifies the
                    goods or services you're going to purchase from outside of the organization and determines
                    which project needs can be met by the project team. This involves tools and techniques like
                    make-or-buy decisions, expert judgment, and contract types. The procurement management
                    plan is one of the outputs of this process and describes how procurement services will be man-
                    aged throughout the project. The contract statement of work (another output of this process)
                    describes the work that will be contracted out.
                        Plan Contracting creates the documents you'll use to procure the goods and services needed
                    from outside the organization.
                        The Human Resource Planning process identifies and assigns roles and responsibilities and
                    reporting relationships. Many times the roles and responsibilities assignments are depicted in a
                    Responsibility Assignment Matrix (RAM) or a RACI chart. The staffing management plan
                    describes how and when project team members will be acquired is an output of the Human
                    Resource Planning process.
                        The Activity Definition process involves decomposing the work packages into individual
                    units of work called schedule activities that can be easily assigned and estimated. The output of
                    this process is the activity list, activity attributes, milestone list, and requested changes.
                        The Activity Sequencing process takes the activities and puts them in a logical, sequential
                    order based on dependencies. Dependencies exist when the current activity is reliant on some
                    action from a predecessor activity or it impacts a successor activity. There are three types of
                    dependencies: mandatory, discretionary, and external. PDM (also known as AON) and ADM
                    (also known as AOA) are two methods for displaying project schedule network diagrams. PDM
                    has four logical relationships, or dependencies: finish-to-start, start-to-finish, finish-to-finish,
                    and start-to-start.

             Exam Essentials
             Be able to name the purpose for the Plan Purchases and Acquisitions process. The purpose
             of the Plan Purchases and Acquisitions process is to identify which project needs should be
             obtained from outside the organization. Make-or-buy analysis is used as a tool and technique
             to help determine this.
             Be able to identify the contract types and their usage. Contract types are a tool and technique
             of the Plan Purchases and Acquisitions process and include fixed price and cost reimbursable con-
             tracts. Use fixed price contracts for well-defined projects with a high value to the company, and
             use cost reimbursable contracts for projects with uncertainty and large investments early in the
             project life. The three types of cost reimbursable contracts are CPF (or CPPC), CPFF, and CPIF.
             Time and materials contracts are a cross between fixed and cost reimbursable contracts.
             Be able to name the outputs of the Plan Contracting process. The outputs of Plan Contract-
             ing are procurement documents, evaluation criteria, and contract statement of work updates.
             Be able to name the purpose of the Human Resource Planning process. Human Resource
             Planning involves determining roles and responsibilities, reporting relationships for the project,
             and creating the staffing management plan, which describes how team members are acquired and
             the criteria for their release.
             Be able to name the purpose of the Activity Definition process. The Activity Definition pro-
             cess decomposes the work packages into schedule activities and creates an activity list, activity
             attributes, a milestone list, and requested changes as its outputs.
             Be able to identify the tools and techniques of Activity Sequencing. The tools and techniques
             of Activity Sequencing are the precedence diagramming method (PDM), the arrow diagram-
             ming method (ADM), schedule network templates, dependency determination, and applying
             leads and lags.
             Be able to discuss the difference between PDM and ADM. PDM (also known as AON) dis-
             plays activity on nodes with connecting arrows showing dependencies. PDM has four logical
             relationships and uses the finish-to-start relationship most often. ADM (also known as AOA)
             displays activities on arrows with connecting nodes showing dependencies and uses only the
             finish-to-start relationship.

                    You've learned a lot of new key words in this chapter. PMI has worked hard to develop and

                          The price of this machine is particularly critical to this project. The budget is limited and there's
                          not a chance of securing additional funds if the bids for the machine come in higher than bud-
                          geted. She's developing the evaluation criteria for the bidders' responses and knows all of the fol-

                    Answers to Review Questions
                    1.    D. Make-or-buy analysis is determining whether it's more cost effective to purchase the goods
                          or services needed for the project or more cost effective for the organization to produce them
                          internally.

                    2.    C. Fixed price contracts have the highest risk to the seller and the least amount of risk to the
                          buyer. However, the price the vendor charges for the product or service will compensate for the
                          amount of risk they're taking on.

                    3.    B. The SOW can be written by either the buyer or the seller. Sometimes the buyer will write the
                          SOW and the seller may modify it and send it back to the buyer for verification and approval.

                    4.    A. The cost plus incentive fee contract is one that the buyer reimburses the seller for the seller's
                          allowable costs and includes an incentive or bonus for exceeding the performance criteria laid
                          out in the contract.

                    5.    D. The RAM and RACI charts are tools and techniques of this process.

                    6.    C. Evaluation criteria can be based on price alone when there are several vendors who can
                          readily supply the good or services. The question states that only three vendors make the
                          machine, which means evaluation criteria should be based on more than price.

                    7.    A. Constraints can be anything that limits the option of the project team. Organizational struc-
                          tures, collective bargaining agreements, and economic conditions are all constraints that might
                          be encountered during this process.

                    8.    D. The Responsibility Assignment Matrix (RAM) links project resources with project activities.

                    9.    C. The activity list is a component of the project schedule, not the WBS. The activity list includes
                          all the project activities, an identifier, and a description of the activity. The activity list is an out-
                          put of the Activity Definition process.

                    10. A. The precedence diagramming method is also known as the activity on node (AON) diagram-
                        ming method.

                    11. D. PDM uses one time estimate to determine duration, while ADM can use more than one time
                        estimate.

                    12. B. The Activity Sequencing process produces project schedule network diagrams, updates to the
                        activity list, updates to the activity attributes, and requested changes. The purpose of this process
                        is to identify all activity dependencies.

                    13. B. The arrow diagramming method uses only finish-to-start dependencies.

                    14. D. This is an example of a mandatory dependency, also known as hard logic. Mandatory depen-
                        dencies are inherent in the nature of the work. Discretionary dependencies, also called preferred
                        logic, preferential logic, and soft logic, are defined by the project management team.

                    15. D. Finish-to-start (FS) is the most commonly used logical relationship in PDM and most project
                        management software packages.

             16. A. Standard forms are a tool and technique of the Plan Contracting process. Standard forms can
                 be nondisclosure agreements, standardized contracts, and so on.

             17. A. RACI stands for responsible, accountable, consult, and inform.

             18. B. Plan Purchases and Acquisitions can directly influence the project schedule and the project
                 schedule can directly influence this process.

             19. B. This is a cost reimbursable contract that includes a fee as a percentage of allowable costs. This
                 type of contract is known as a cost plus fee (CPF) or a cost plus percentage of cost (CPPC) con-
                 tract. A CPIF is a cost plus incentive fee contract that reimburses allowable costs and adds an
                 incentive for exceeding the performance criteria laid out in the contract.

             20. A. This question is describing the Activity Definition process. The purpose of this project is to
                 decompose the work package elements of the WBS into activities. The WBS is the primary input
                 of this process.

                                                     The Planning process group has more processes than any other
                                                     process group. As a result, a lot of time and effort goes into the
                                                     Planning processes of any project. You'll find on some projects
                    that you may spend almost as much time planning the project as you do executing and control-
                    ling it. This isn't a bad thing. The better planning you do up front, the more likely you'll have
                    a successful project. Speaking of planning...the Planning, Executing, and Monitoring and Con-
                    trolling process groups together account for almost 70 percent of the PMP exam questions, so
                    plan on spending about the same percentage of your study time on these areas.
                        We have another fun-filled, action-packed chapter. We're going to pick up from where we
                    left off last chapter and create estimates for our project activities and then wrap up the remain-
                    ing Planning processes. We'll spend a good deal of time on developing the project schedule and
                    discussing the project budget. These two documents are two of your most important planning
                    documents. Everything we've done up to this point will help us create an accurate schedule and
                    budget. You'll use these documents throughout the Executing and Monitoring and Controlling
                    processes (along with several other documents we've created along the way) to help measure the
                    progress of the project.
                        We'll start the Executing process group in the next chapter. But before we do that, let's get
                    a good grasp of the project schedule and budget.



                    Activity Resource Estimating
                    All projects, from the smallest to the largest, require resources. The term resources in this case does
                    not mean just people; it means all the physical resources required to complete the project. A Guide
                    to the PMBOK defines resources as people, equipment, and materials. In reality, this includes peo-
                    ple, equipment, supplies, materials, software, hardware--the list goes on depending on the project
                    you're working on. Activity Resource Estimating is concerned with determining the types of
                    resources needed (both human and materials) and in what quantities for each schedule activity
                    within a work package. You might be asking, "Didn't we already do the people part in the Human
                    Activity Resource Estimating process?" The answer is...no. Remember that Human Activity
                    Resource Estimating determines roles and responsibilities and describes reporting relationships.
                    Activity Resource Estimating determines what types or resources are needed and how many.


                                          Remember, the activity resource output from this process is an input into the
                                          Human Activity Resource Estimating process.

                                                                          Activity Resource Estimating         255




                A Guide to the PMBOK notes that Activity Resource Estimating should be closely coordi-
             nated with the Cost Estimating process (we'll talk about Cost Estimating later in this chapter).
             That's because resources--whether people or material or both--are typically the largest
             expense you'll have on any project. Identifying the resources becomes a critical component of
             the project planning process so estimates--and ultimately the project budget--can be accurately
             derived. We'll look at the inputs and tools and techniques that will help you document these
             requirements next.


             Activity Resource Estimating Inputs
             The Activity Resource Estimating process has several inputs you are already familiar with:
                  Enterprise environmental factors
                  Organizational process assets
                  Activity list
                  Activity attributes
                  Resource availability
                  Project management plan
             The only one we haven't seen before is resource availability.


                                   Resource availability is an output of the Acquire Project Team process. The
                                   Acquire Project Team process isn't performed until the Executing process
                                   group, so we're a little out of order. In practice, you'll likely perform both
                                   Human Resource Planning and Acquire Project Team during the Planning
                                   stages of the project. For the exam, remember that resource availability isn't
                                   determined until the Executing stage and becomes an input to the Activity
                                   Resource Estimating process.

                The resource availability output describes, believe it or not, the time frames in which resources
             (both human and material) are available. This will help you estimate the types of resources you
             may need for the project. For example, if you are working on a project that requires the use of spe-
             cialized equipment during one of the project phases and the resource availability document shows
             that this equipment isn't available until sometime after the time frame in which you need it, you
             know you'll need to either make schedule adjustments or find another supplier who can provide
             the equipment when you need it. The same is true for human resources.


             Tools and Techniques for Estimating Activities
             Our goal with the Activity Resource Estimating process is to determine the activity resource
             requirements, including quantity and availability. This process has five tools and techniques to
             help accomplish this output: expert judgment, alternatives analysis, published estimating data,
3601.book Page 256 Wednesday, July 13, 2005 1:39 PM




                    256         Chapter 7         Creating the Project Schedule and Budget



                    project management software, and bottom-up estimating. We already know what expert judg-
                    ment entails, so let's take a look at the remaining tools:
                    Alternatives analysis Alternatives analysis is used when thinking about the methods you
                    might use to accomplish the activities your resources have been assigned. Many times, there's
                    more than one way to accomplish an activity, and alternatives analysis helps decide among the
                    possibilities. For example, a subcompact car drives on the same roads a six-figure sports car
                    travels. The sports car has a lot more features than the subcompact, it's faster, it's probably
                    more comfortable, and it has a visual appeal that the subcompact doesn't. The sports car may
                    be the valid resource choice for the project, but there are alternatives you should consider. The
                    same idea applies to human resources in that you might apply senior-level resources versus
                    junior-level or you could add resources to speed up the schedule. You can also consider make-
                    or-buy analysis when determining alternatives.
                    Published estimating data Estimating data may include organizational guidelines, industry
                    rates or estimates, production rates, and so on. For example, your organization may have estab-
                    lished price agreements with vendors that outline rates by resource type, or there may be indus-
                    try estimates for production rates for your particular activity.
                    Project management software Here we see project management software named as a tool and
                    technique rather than as an organizational asset input. Project management software can help
                    estimate resource needs and document resource availability. It may also produce an RBS,
                    resource rates, calendars, and availability.
                    Bottom-up estimating Bottom-up estimating is a process of estimating individual activities or costs
                    and then adding these up together to come up with a total estimate. Here you estimate every schedule
                    activity individually and then roll up that estimate, or add them all together, to come up with a total.
                    This is a very accurate means of estimating provided the estimates at the schedule activity level are
                    accurate. However, it takes a considerable amount of time to perform bottom-up estimating because
                    every activity must be assessed and estimated accurately to be included in the bottom-up calculation.
                    The smaller and more detailed the activity, the greater the accuracy and cost of this technique.


                    Activity Resource Estimating Outputs
                    As mentioned, the purpose of the Activity Resource Estimating process is to develop the activity
                    resource requirements output that describes the types of resources and the quantity needed for
                    each schedule activity. Work package estimates are derived from the cumulative total of each
                    schedule activity within the work package. You should also prepare a narrative description for
                    this output that describes how you determined the estimate and the assumptions you made
                    about the resources and their availability.
                       We'll use the information from this output in the next process (Activity Duration Estimates)
                    to determine the length of time each activity will take to complete. That, of course, depends on
                    the quantity and skill level of the resources assigned, which is the reason we estimate resources
                    before we try to determine duration.
                       The remaining outputs of this process are activity attribute updates, resource breakdown
                    structure, resource calendar updates, and requested changes. We've covered each of these out-
                    puts previously with the exception of resource calendar updates.
3601.book Page 257 Wednesday, July 13, 2005 1:39 PM




                                                                        Estimating Activity Durations          257




                 Resource calendars look at a particular resource or groups of resources and their skills, abil-
             ities, quantity, and availability. Perhaps your project calls for a marketing resource and the per-
             son assigned to the marketing activities is on an extended vacation in October. The resource
             calendar would show this person's vacation schedule. It also shows holidays the company rec-
             ognizes. Resource calendars also examine the quantity, capability, and availability of equip-
             ment and material resources that have a potential to impact the project schedule. For example,
             suppose your project calls for a hydraulic drill and your organization owns only one. The
             resource calendar will tell you if it's scheduled for another job at the same time it's needed for
             your project. The updates portion of this output refer to updating the resource calendar with
             changes to any of the elements you've recorded here.
                 You can see how these "Activity" processes have built upon each other. First we defined the
             activities, then we determined dependencies and sequenced them in the correct order, and next
             we determined what types and quantities of resources are required to complete the activities.
             Now we're ready to begin estimating the duration of these activities so that we can plug them
             into the project schedule.



             Estimating Activity Durations
             The Activity Duration Estimating process attempts to estimate the work effort, resources, and
             number of work periods needed to complete each schedule activity. The primary output of this
             process is the activity duration estimates. These are quantifiable estimates expressed as the num-
             ber of work periods needed to complete a schedule activity. Work periods are usually expressed
             in hours or days. However, larger projects might express duration in weeks or months. Work
             periods are the activity duration estimates, and they become inputs to the project schedule in a
             later process.
                 When you're estimating activity duration, you are estimating the length of time the activity will
             take to complete, including any elapsed time needed from the beginning to the ending of the activ-
             ity. For example, let's look at the house-painting project. You estimate that it will take three days,
             including drying time, to prime the house. Now, let's say priming is scheduled to begin on Satur-
             day, but your crew doesn't work on Sunday. The activity duration in this case is four days, which
             includes the three days to prime and dry plus the Sunday the crew doesn't work. Most project
             management software programs will handle this kind of situation automatically.
                 Progressive elaboration comes into play during this process also. Estimates typically start out
             at a fairly high level, and as more and more details are known about the deliverables and their
             associated activities, the estimates become more accurate. You should rely on those folks who
             have the most knowledge of the activities you're trying to estimate to help you with this process.


             Activity Duration Estimating Inputs
             The inputs to this process include enterprise environmental factors, organization process assets,
             project scope statement, activity list, activity attributes, activity resource requirements, resource
             calendars, and the project management plan including the risk register and activity cost estimates.

                    258         Chapter 7         Creating the Project Schedule and Budget



                       A few of the important elements regarding these inputs apply here as we've seen in past pro-
                    cesses, including databases, historical information, constraints, and assumptions. The project
                    calendars (considered a part of the organizational process assets) and activity resource require-
                    ments are especially useful during this process.


                    Activity Duration Estimating Tools and Techniques
                    There are several new tools and techniques in the Activity Duration Estimating process:
                           Expert judgment
                           Analogous estimating
                           Parametric estimating
                           Three-point estimates
                           Reserve analysis
                          We'll take a look at each of these tools and techniques next.

                    Expert Judgment
                    Activities are most accurately estimated by the staff members who will perform them. In this
                    case, expert judgment is used by team members because of their experience with similar activ-
                    ities in the past. You should be careful with these estimates, though, as they are subject to bias
                    and aren't based on any scientific means. Your experts should consider that resource levels,
                    resource productivity, resource capability, risks, and other factors can impact estimates. It's
                    good practice to combine expert judgment with historical information and use as many experts
                    as you can.

                    Analogous Estimating aka Top-down Estimating
                    Analogous estimating, also called top-down estimating, is a form of expert judgment. With this
                    technique, you will use the actual duration of a similar activity completed on a previous project
                    to determine the duration of the current activity--provided the information was documented
                    and stored with the project information on the previous project. This technique is most useful
                    when the previous activities you're comparing are similar to the activity you're estimating and
                    don't just appear to be similar. And you want the folks who are working on the estimate to have
                    experience with these activities so they can provide reasonable estimates. This technique is espe-
                    cially helpful when detailed information about the project is not available, such as in the early
                    phases of the project.
                       Top-down estimating techniques are also used to estimate total project duration, particularly
                    when you have a limited amount of information about the project. The best way to think about top-
                    down techniques is to look at the estimate as a whole. Think about being on a mountaintop where
                    you can see the whole picture as one rather than all the individual items that make up the picture.
                       For instance, let's go back to the house-painting example. You would compare a previous
                    house-painting project to the current house-painting project, where the houses are of similar
                    size and the paint you're using is the same quality. The first house-painting project can be used

                                                                            Estimating Activity Durations           259




             to estimate the project duration for the second house-painting project because of the similarities
             in the project.
                Top-down techniques are useful when you're early on in the project Planning processes and
             are only just beginning to flesh out all the details of the project. Sometimes during the project
             selection process, the selection committee may want an idea of the project's duration. You can
             derive a project estimate at this stage by using top-down techniques.



             Exam Spotlight

             A Guide to the PMBOK states that you can also use analogous estimating to determine overall
             project duration. However (this is the key word), calculating overall project duration is performed
             during the Schedule Development process, not the Activity Duration Estimating process.



             Parametric Estimating
             Parametric estimating is a quantitatively based estimating method that multiplies the quantity
             of work by the rate. The best way to describe it with is with an example. Suppose you are work-
             ing on a companywide network upgrade project. This requires you to run new cable to the
             switches on every floor in the building. Parametric estimates can be used to determine activity
             duration estimates by taking a known element--in this case, the amount of cable needed--and
             multiplying it by the amount of time it takes to install a unit of cable to come up with an esti-
             mate. In other words, suppose you have 10,000 meters of new cable to run. You know from
             past experience it takes one hour to install 100 meters. Using this measurement, you can deter-
             mine an estimate for this activity of 100 hours to run the new cable. Therefore, the cable activity
             duration estimate is 100 hours.

             Three-Point Estimates
             Three-point estimates, as you can probably guess, use three estimates that are averaged to come
             up with a final estimate. The three estimates are the most likely, optimistic, and pessimistic.
             You'll want to rely on experienced folks to give you these estimates. The most likely estimate
             assumes there are no disasters and the activity can be completed as planned. The optimistic esti-
             mate is the fastest time frame in which your resource can complete the activity. And the pessi-
             mistic estimate assumes the worst happens and it takes much longer than planned to get the
             activity completed. These three estimates are averaged to come up with an overall estimate.


                                   We'll look more closely at this tool and technique later in this chapter in the sec-
                                   tion "Schedule Development Tools and Techniques."

                    260         Chapter 7         Creating the Project Schedule and Budget



                    Reserve Analysis
                    Reserve time--also called buffer or contingency time in A Guide to the PMBOK-- means add-
                    ing a portion of time to the activity to account for schedule risk. You might choose to add a per-
                    centage of time or a set number of work periods to the activity or the overall schedule. For
                    example, you know it will take 100 hours to run new cable based on the quantitative estimate
                    you came up with earlier. You also know that sometimes you hit problem areas when running
                    the cable. To make sure you don't impact the project schedule, you build in a reserve time of
                    10 percent of your original estimate to account for the problems you might encounter. This
                    brings your activity duration estimate to 110 hours for this activity.




                    Desert State University (DSU)

                    DSU has hired a contract agency to create its new registration website. The website will allow
                    students in good academic standing to register for classes over the Internet. You have been
                    appointed the project manager for the DSU side of this project. You'll be working with Henry
                    Lu from Web Sites International to complete this project.

                    Henry has given you an activity list and asked for time estimates that he can plug into the
                    project plan.

                    Your first stop is Mike Walter's desk. He's the expert on the mainframe registration system and
                    will be writing the interface programs to accept registration data from the new website. Mike will
                    also create the download that the Internet program will use to verify students' academic stand-
                    ing. Mike has created other programs just like this in the past. His expertise and judgment are
                    very reliable.

                    The next stop is Kate Langdon. She's the new team leader over the testing group. Kate has been
                    with DSU for only one month. Since she has no experience working with DSU data and staff
                    members, she tells you she'll get back to you within a week with estimates for the testing activ-
                    ities. She plans to read through the project binders of some similar projects and base her esti-
                    mates against the historical information on similar projects. She'll run the estimates by her lead
                    tester before giving them to you.

                    You've asked both of your resources to provide you with three-point estimates. Mike Walter's
                    estimates are an example of using the tool and technique of expert judgment to derive activity
                    duration estimates. The estimates expected from Kate Langdon will be derived using historical
                    information (implied by the research she's going to do into past similar projects) and expert
                    judgment because she's involving her lead tester to verify the estimates.

                                                                       Developing the Project Schedule           261




             Activity Duration Estimating Outputs
             Everything we've talked about up to this point has brought us to the primary output of this pro-
             cess: the activity duration estimates. The inputs and tools and techniques are used to establish
             these estimates. As mentioned in the opening of this section, activity duration estimates are an
             estimate of the required work periods needed to complete the activity. This is a quantitative
             measure usually expressed in hours, weeks, days, or months.
                One thing to note about your final estimates as an output to this process is that they should
             contain a range of possible results. In the cable-running example, you would state the activity
             duration estimates as "100 hours  10 hours" to show that the actual duration will take at least
             90 hours and may go as long as 110 hours. Or you could use percentages to express this range.
                The other output of Activity Duration Estimating is activity attribute updates. You will
             update the activity attributes with the duration estimate and the assumptions you used when
             deriving the estimates.
                Now that we have all the activity information in hand, along with a host of other inputs,
             we're ready to develop the project schedule.



             Developing the Project Schedule
             The Schedule Development process is the heart of the Planning process group. This is where you
             lay out the schedule for your project activities, determine their start and finish dates, and finalize
             activity sequences and durations. This process, along with Activity Resource Estimating and
             Activity Duration Estimating, is repeated several times before you actually come up with the project
             schedule. The project schedule, once it's approved, serves as the schedule baseline for the project that
             you can track against in later processes.
                You'll learn later in this section that project management software comes in very handy dur-
             ing this process. In fact, it is one of the tools and techniques of this process.


                                   Although there are no exam questions regarding the order in which the processes
                                   are performed, it might help to understand that Schedule Development cannot be
                                   performed until all of the following processes of project Planning are completed:
                                   Scope Planning, Scope Definition, Create WBS, Risk Identification, Risk Response
                                   Planning, Plan Purchases and Acquisitions, Activity Resource Estimating, Activity
                                   Definition, Activity Sequencing, and Activity Duration Estimating.

                It's interesting to note that there is a schedule management plan but it isn't created during
             this process, nor is it an output of this process as other management plans have been. A Guide
             to the PMBOK notes that the schedule management plan (a subsidiary of the project manage-
             ment plan) is produced as part of the Develop Project Management Plan process and contains
             the criteria for formatting, developing, and controlling the project schedule.

                    262         Chapter 7         Creating the Project Schedule and Budget



                       We've got a lot of material to cover in this process. We'll start out with the inputs to the
                    Schedule Development process and then follow up with an in-depth discussion of the tools and
                    techniques of the process. These techniques will help you get to the primary output of this pro-
                    cess, which is the project schedule.


                    Schedule Development Inputs
                    Schedule Development has nine inputs, seven of which are outputs from other Planning pro-
                    cesses. The inputs are as follows:
                          Organizational process assets
                          Project scope statement
                          Activity list
                          Activity attributes
                          Project schedule network diagrams
                          Activity resource requirements
                          Resource calendars
                          Activity duration estimates
                          Project management plan (risk register)
                       You can see how important it is to perform all of the Planning processes accurately because
                    the information you derive from almost every process in the Planning group is used somewhere
                    else in Planning, many of them here. Your project schedule will reflect the information you
                    know at this point in time. If you have incorrectly estimated activity durations or didn't identify
                    the right dependencies, for example, the inputs to this process will be distorted and your project
                    schedule will not be correct. It's definitely worth the investment of time to correctly plan your
                    project and come up with accurate outputs for each of the Planning processes.
                       As with several other processes, constraints and assumptions are highlighted as the elements
                    of the project scope statement to pay particular attention to. Constraints are with you through-
                    out the life of the project. The most important constraints to consider in the Schedule Develop-
                    ment process are time constraints. According to A Guide to the PMBOK, the time constraints
                    in this process fall into two categories: imposed dates and key events or major milestones.
                       Imposed dates are used to restrict the start or finish date of activities. The two most common
                    constraints used to restrict dates are enforced by most computerized project management soft-
                    ware programs. They are "start no earlier than" and "finish no later than" constraints. For
                    example, let's go back to Chapter 6's house-painting example. The painting activity cannot start
                    until the primer has dried. If the primer takes 24 hours to dry and is scheduled to be completed
                    on Wednesday, this implies the painting activity can start no earlier than Thursday. This is an
                    example of an imposed date.
                       Key events or milestones refer to the completion of specific deliverables by a specific date. Stake-
                    holders, customers, or management staff may request that certain deliverables be completed or deliv-
                    ered by specific dates. Once you've agreed to those dates (even if the agreement is only verbal), it's
                    often cast in stone and very difficult to change. These dates, therefore, become constraints.
3601.book Page 263 Wednesday, July 13, 2005 1:39 PM




                                                                       Developing the Project Schedule            263




                                   Be careful of the delivery dates you commit to your stakeholders or customers.
                                   You may think you're simply discussing the matter or throwing out ideas, while
                                   the stakeholder may take what you've said as fact. Once the stakeholder
                                   believes the deliverable or activity will be completed by a specific date, there's
                                   almost no convincing them that the date needs changing.




             Schedule Development Tools and Techniques
             The primary output of Schedule Development is the project schedule. You can employ several
             tools and techniques in order to produce this output. The tools and techniques you choose will
             depend on the complexity of the project. For the exam, however, you'll need to know them all.
                There are 10 tools and techniques used in Schedule Development:
                  Schedule network analysis
                  Critical path method
                  Schedule compression
                  What-if scenario analysis
                  Resource leveling
                  Critical chain method
                  Project management software
                  Applying calendars
                  Adjusting leads and lags
                  Schedule model
                A lot of information is packed into some of these tools and techniques, and you should dedicate
             study time to each of them for the exam. A few of these inputs were discussed earlier but they have
             new twists in the Schedule Development process so we'll take a look at each of them next.

             Schedule Network Analysis
             Schedule network analysis produces the project schedule. It involves calculating early and late
             start dates and early and late finish dates for project activities (as does the critical path method).
             It uses a schedule model and other analytical techniques such as critical path and critical chain
             method, what-if analysis, and resource leveling (all of which are other tools and techniques in
             this process) to help calculate these dates and create the schedule. These calculations are per-
             formed without taking resource limitations into consideration, so the dates you end up with are
             theoretical. What you're attempting to establish at this point is the time periods within which
             the activities can be scheduled. Resource limitations and other constraints will be taken into
             consideration when you get to the outputs of this process.

                    264         Chapter 7         Creating the Project Schedule and Budget



                    Critical Path Method
                    Critical path method (CPM) is a schedule network analysis technique. It determines the amount
                    of float, or schedule flexibility, for each of the network paths by calculating the earliest start
                    date, earliest finish date, latest start date, and latest finish date for each activity. This is a sched-
                    ule network analysis technique that relies on sequential networks (one activity occurs before the
                    next, or a series of activities occurring concurrently are completed before the next series of activ-
                    ities, and so on) and on a single duration estimate for each activity. Keep in mind that CPM is
                    a method to determine schedule durations without regard to resource availability.
                        The critical path (CP) is generally the longest full path on the project. Any project activity
                    with a float time that equals zero is considered a critical path task. The critical path can end
                    under a few conditions. When activities with float time use up all their float, they can become
                    critical path tasks. Or you may have a milestone midway through the project with a finish-no-
                    later-than constraint that can change the critical path if it isn't met.
                        Float time is also called slack time, and you'll see these terms used interchangeably. There are
                    two types of float: total float and free float. Total float (TF) is the amount of time you can delay
                    the earliest start of a task without delaying the ending of the project. Free float (FF) is the amount
                    of time you can delay the start of a task without delaying the early start of a successor task.
                        In the following section, you'll calculate the CP for a sample project and illustrate how all the
                    dates, the CP, and the float times are derived.

                    Gathering Activity and Dependency Information
                    Let's say you are the project manager for a new software project. The company you are working
                    for is venturing into the movie rental business over the Web. You need to devise a software sys-
                    tem that tracks all the information related to rentals and also supplies the management team
                    with reports that will help them make good business decisions. For purposes of illustration, I'm
                    showing only a limited portion of the tasks that you would have on a project like this.
                       You'll start this example by plugging information from the processes you've already com-
                    pleted into a table (a complete example is shown later in Table 7.1 in the section "Calculating
                    the Critical Path"). The list of activities comes from the Activity Definition process. The dura-
                    tions for each activity are listed in the Duration column and were derived during the Activity
                    Duration Estimating process. The duration times are listed in days.
                       The Dependency column lists the activities that require a previous activity to finish before the
                    current activity can start. You're using only finish-to-start relationships. For example, you'll see
                    that activity number 2 and activity number 4 each depend on activity 1 to finish before they can
                    begin. The dependency information came from the Activity Sequencing process. Now, you'll
                    proceed to calculating the dates.

                    Calculating the Forward and Backward Pass
                    Project Deliverables is the first activity and, obviously, where the project starts. This activity
                    begins on April 1. Project Deliverables has a 12-day duration. So take April 1 and add 12 days
                    to this to come up with an early finish date of April 12. Watch out, because you need to count
                    day one, or April 1, as a full work day. The simplest way to do this calculation is to take the
                    early start date, add the duration, and subtract one. Therefore, the early finish date for the first

                                                                      Developing the Project Schedule             265




             activity is April 12. By the way, we are ignoring weekends and holidays for this example. Activ-
             ity 2 depends on activity 1, so it cannot start until activity 1 has finished. Its earliest start date
             is April 13. Add the duration to this date minus one to come up with the finish date.
                 You'll notice that activity 4 depends on activity 1 finishing, so its earliest start date is also
             April 13. Continue to calculate the remaining early start and early finish dates in the same man-
             ner. This calculation is called a forward pass.
                 To calculate the late start and late finish dates, you begin with the last activity. The late finish
             for activity 9 is July 10. Since the duration is only one day, July 10 is also the late start date. You
             know that activity 8 must finish before activity 9 can begin, so activity 8's late finish date, July
             9, is one day prior to activity 9's late start date, July 10. Subtract the duration of activity 8 (three
             days) from July 9 and add one to get the late start date of July 7. You're performing the opposite
             calculation that you did for the forward pass. This calculation is called a backward pass, as you
             might have guessed. Continue calculating the late start and late finish through activity 4.
                 Activity 3 adds a new twist. Here's how it works. Activity 7 cannot begin until activity 3 and
             activity 6 are completed. No other activity depends on the completion of activity 3. If activity
             7's late start date is June 29, activity 3's late finish date must be June 28. June 28 minus eight
             days plus one gives you a late start date of June 21. Activity 3 depends on activity 2, so activity
             2 must be completed prior to beginning activity 3. Calculate these dates just as you did for activ-
             ities 9 through 4.
                 Activity 1 still remains. Activity 4 cannot start until activity 1 is completed. If activity 4's late
             start date is April 13, the late finish date for activity 1 must be April 12. Subtract the duration
             of activity 1 and add one to come up with a late start date of April 1. Alternatively, the forward
             pass and backward pass can be calculated by saying the first task starts on day zero and then
             adding the duration to this. For example, activity number 1's early start date is April 1, which
             is day zero. Add 12 days to day zero and you come up with an early finish date of April 12.
                 The calculation for float/slack time is determined by subtracting the early start date from the
             late start date. If the float time equals zero, the activity is on the critical path.

             Calculating the Critical Path
             To determine the CP duration of the project, add up the duration of every activity with zero
             float. You should come up with 101 days because you're adding the duration for all activities
             except for activity 2 and activity 3. A critical path task is any task that cannot be changed with-
             out impacting the project end date. By definition, these are all tasks with zero float.
                Another way to determine the critical path is by looking at the network diagram. If the dura-
             tion is included with the information on the node, or if start and end dates are given, you simply
             calculate the duration and then add up the duration of the longest path in the diagram to deter-
             mine the CP. However, this method is not as accurate as what's shown in Table 7.1. Figure 7.1
             shows the same project in diagram form. Duration is printed in the top-right corner of each
             node. Add up the duration of each path to determine which one is the critical path.
                Remember that CP is usually the path with the longest duration. In Figure 7.1, path
             1-2-3-7-8-9 equals 34 days. Path 1-4-5-6-7-8-9 equals 101 days; therefore, this path is the
             critical path.

                    Expected Value Using PERT
                    Program Evaluation and Review Technique (PERT) is a method that isn't discussed in A
                    Guide to the PMBOK but you may encounter on the exam. The PERT was developed in the
                    1950s by the United States Navy. They were working on one of the most complex engineering
                    projects in history at the time--the Polaris Missile Program--and needed a way to manage the
                    project and forecast the project schedule with a high degree of reliability. PERT was devel-
                    oped to do just that.
                       PERT and CPM are similar techniques. The difference is that CPM uses the most likely
                    duration to determine project duration, while PERT uses what's called expected value (or the
                    weighted average). Expected value is calculated using the three-point estimates for activity
                    duration (we talked about three-point estimates earlier in this chapter) and then finding the
                    weighted average of those estimates. If you take this one step further and determine the stan-
                    dard deviation of each activity, you can assign a confidence factor to your project estimates.
                    Without getting too heavily involved in the mathematics of probability, understand that for

             Calculating Expected Value
             The three-point estimates used to calculate expected value are the optimistic estimate, the pes-
             simistic estimate, and the most likely estimate. Going back to the software example, let's find
             out what these three time estimates might look like for the activity called Write Programs. You
             get these estimates by asking the lead programmer, or key team member, to estimate the opti-
             mistic, pessimistic, and most likely duration for the activity based on their past experience.
             Other historical information could be used to determine these estimates as well. Say in this case
             that you're given 38 days for the optimistic time, 57 days for the pessimistic, and 45 days for
             the most likely. (45 days was derived from the Activity Duration Estimating process and is the
             estimate you used to calculate CPM.)
                The formula to calculate expected value is as follows:
                  (optimistic + pessimistic + (4 x most likely)) / 6
                The expected value for the Write Programs activity is as follows:
                  (38 + 57 + (4 x 45)) / 6 = 45.83

                          The formula for standard deviation, which helps you determine confidence level, is as follows:
                           (pessimistic - optimistic) / 6
                          The standard deviation for your activity is as follows:
                           (57 - 38) / 6 = 3.17
                          You could say the following given the information you now have:
                           There is a 68.26 percent chance that the Write Programs activity will be completed in 42.66
                           days to 49 days.
                           There is a 95.44 percent chance that the Write Programs activity will be completed in 39.49
                           days to 52.17 days.
                       You calculated the range of dates for the 68.26 percent chance by adding and subtracting one
                    standard deviation, 3.17, from the expected value, 45.83. The 95.44 percent chance was calcu-
                    lated by multiplying the standard deviation times 2, which equals 6.34, and adding and sub-
                    tracting that result from the expected value to come up with the least number of days and the
                    most number of days it will take to finish the activity. Generally speaking, two standard devi-
                    ations, or 95.44 percent, is a close enough estimate for most purposes.


                                          The higher the standard deviation is for an activity, the higher the risk. Since
                                          standard deviation measures the difference between the pessimistic and the
                                          optimistic times, a greater spread between the two, which results in a higher
                                          number, indicates a greater risk. Conversely, a low standard deviation means
                                          less risk.


                    Determining Date Ranges for Project Duration
                    Let's bring your table of activities back and plug in the expected values and the standard devi-
                    ation for each (please see Table 7.2).
                       Now let's look at the total project duration using PERT and the standard deviation to deter-
                    mine a range of dates for project duration. You should add only the tasks that are on the critical
                    path. Remember from the CPM example that tasks 2 and 3 are not on the critical path, so their
                    expected value and standard deviation calculations have been left blank in this table. When you
                    add all the remaining tasks, the total expected value duration is 102.99 days, or 103 days
                    rounded to the nearest day.
                       Your next logical conclusion might be to add the Standard Deviation column to get the stan-
                    dard deviation for the project. Unfortunately, you cannot add up the standard deviations
                    because you will come out with a number that is much too high. Totaling the standard devia-
                    tions assumes that all of the tasks will run over schedule, and that's not likely. It is likely that
                    a few tasks will run over, but not every one of them. So now you're probably wondering how
                    to calculate the magic number.
                       You might have noticed an extra column at the right called SD Squared. This is the standard
                    deviation squared--or for those of you with math phobias out there, the standard deviation
                    multiplied by itself.

                Once you have calculated the standard deviation squared for each activity, add up the squares,
             for a total of 14.98. There's one more step and you're done. Take the square root of 14.98 (you'll
             need a calculator) to come up with 3.87. This is the standard deviation you will use to determine
             your range of projected completion dates. Here's a recap of these last few calculations:
                  Total expected value = 103.00
                  Sum of SD Squared = 14.98
                  Square root of SD Squared = 3.87
                 You can now make the following predictions regarding your project:
                  There is a 68.26 percent chance that the project will be completed in 99.13 days to 106.87 days.
                  There is a 95.44 percent chance that the project will be completed in 95.26 days to 110.74 days.

                    270         Chapter 7         Creating the Project Schedule and Budget




                    Exam Spotlight

                    For the exam, I recommend that you know that one standard deviation gives you a 68 percent
                    (rounded) probability and two standard deviations gives you a 95 percent (rounded) probability.
                    Also know how to calculate the range of project duration dates based on the expected value and
                    standard deviation calculation. You probably don't need to memorize how to calculate the standard
                    deviation, because I believe most of the questions give you this information. You should, however,
                    memorize the PERT formula and know how it works. It wouldn't hurt to go ahead and memorize the
                    standard deviation formula as well--you never know what might show up on the exam.



                       PERT is not used very often today. When it is, it's used for very large, highly complex
                    projects. However, PERT is a useful technique to determine project duration when your activity
                    durations are uncertain. It's also useful for calculating the duration for individual tasks in your
                    schedule that may be very complex or risky. You might decide to use PERT for a handful of the
                    activities, those with the highest amount of risk for example, and use other techniques to deter-
                    mine duration for the remaining activities.

                    Schedule Compression
                    Schedule compression is a form of mathematical analysis that's used to shorten the project schedule
                    without changing the project scope. Compression is simply shortening the project schedule to
                    accomplish all the activities sooner than estimated.
                       Schedule compression might happen when the project end date has been predetermined or if
                    after performing the CPM or PERT techniques, you discover that the project is going to take
                    longer than the original promised date. In the CPM example, you calculated the end date to be
                    July 10. What if the project was undertaken and a July 2 date was promised? That's when you'll
                    need to employ one of two duration compression techniques called crashing and fast tracking.

                    Crashing
                    Crashing is a compression technique that looks at cost and schedule trade-offs. One of the
                    things you might do to crash the schedule is add resources--from either inside or outside the
                    organization--to the critical path tasks. It wouldn't help you to add resources to noncritical
                    path tasks, as these tasks don't impact the schedule end date anyway because they have float
                    time. You might also limit or reduce the project requirements. Ask stakeholders if the features
                    or functions are "nice to have" or necessary. You might also try changing the sequence of tasks.
                    This sometimes shortens the schedule but isn't always possible.

                    Fast Tracking
                    We talked about fast tracking in Chapter 1, "What Is a Project?" Fast tracking is starting at the same
                    time two tasks that were previously scheduled to start sequentially. Fast tracking can increase project
                    risk and might cause the project team to have to rework tasks. For example, fast tracking is often
                    performed in object-oriented programming. The programmers might begin writing code on several
                    modules at once, out of sequential order and prior to the completion of the design phase.

                                   Be certain to check the critical path when you've used the crashing technique
                                   because crashing might have changed the critical path. Also consider that
                                   crashing doesn't always come up with a reasonable result. It often increases
                                   the costs of the project as well. The idea with crashing is to try to gain the great-
                                   est amount of schedule compression with the least amount of cost.



             What-If Scenario Analysis
             What-if scenario analysis uses different sets of activity assumptions to produce multiple project
             durations. For example, what would happen if a major deliverable was delayed or the weather
             prevents you from completing a deliverable on time? What-if analysis weighs these questions and
             their assumptions and determines the feasibility of the project schedule under these conditions.
             Simulation techniques such as Monte Carlo analysis use a range of probable activity durations for
             each activity, and those ranges are then used to calculate a range of probable duration results for
             the project itself. Monte Carlo runs the possible activity durations and schedule projections many,
             many times to come up with the schedule projections and their probability, critical path duration
             estimates, and float time.



             Exam Spotlight

             For the exam, remember that Monte Carlo is a simulation technique that shows the probability
             of all the possible project completion dates.

             Resource leveling can cause the original critical path to change.



             Resource Leveling
             Earlier, I said that CPM and PERT do not consider resource availability. Now that you have a
             schedule of activities and have determined the critical path, it's time to plug in resources for
             those activities and adjust the schedule according to any resource constraints you discover.
                Resource leveling--also called the resource-based method--is used when resources are lim-
             ited or time constrained (especially those assigned to critical path activities) and when specific
             schedule dates need to be met.
                Remember that you identified resources and resource estimates during the Human Resource
             Planning and Activity Resource Estimating processes. Now during Schedule Development,
             resources are assigned to specific activities. Usually, you'll find that your initial schedule has
3601.book Page 272 Wednesday, July 13, 2005 1:39 PM




                    272         Chapter 7         Creating the Project Schedule and Budget



                    periods of time with more activities than you have resources to work on them. You will also find
                    that it isn't always possible to assign 100 percent of your team members' time to tasks. Some-
                    times your schedule will show a team member who is overallocated, meaning they're assigned
                    to more work than they can physically perform in the given time period. Other times, they might
                    not be assigned enough work to keep them busy during the time period. This problem is easy
                    to fix. You can assign underallocated resources to multiple tasks to keep them busy.

                    Resource Assignments
                    Having overallocated resources is a little more difficult problem to resolve. Resource leveling
                    attempts to smooth out the resource assignments to get tasks completed without overloading
                    the individual while trying to keep the project on schedule. This typically takes the form of allo-
                    cating resources to critical path tasks first.
                        There are several ways the project manager can accomplish resource leveling. You might
                    delay the start of a task to match the availability of a key team member. Or you might adjust
                    the resource assignments so that more tasks are given to team members who are underallocated.
                    You could require the resources to work mandatory overtime--that one always goes over well!
                    Perhaps you can split some tasks so that the team member with the pertinent knowledge or skill
                    performs the critical part of the task and the noncritical part of the task is given to a less-skilled
                    team member. All of these methods are forms of resource leveling.
                        Generally speaking, resource leveling of overallocated team members extends the project end
                    date. If you're under a date constraint, you'll have to go back and rework the schedule after
                    assigning resources to keep the project on track with the committed completion date. This might
                    include moving key resources off of noncritical tasks and assigning them to critical path tasks
                    or adjusting assignments as previously mentioned. Reallocating those team members with slack
                    time to critical path tasks to keep them on schedule is another option. Don't forget, fast tracking
                    is an option to keep the project on schedule also.

                    Reverse Resource Allocation Scheduling
                    Reverse resource allocation scheduling is a technique used when key resources--like a thermo-
                    dynamic expert, for example--are required at a specific point in the project and they are the
                    only resource, or resources, available to perform these activities. This technique requires the
                    resources to be scheduled in reverse order (that is, from the end date of the project rather than
                    the beginning) in order to assign this key resource at the correct time.

                    Critical Chain Method
                    Critical chain method is a schedule network analysis technique that accounts for limited or
                    restricted resources when modifying the project schedule. This method typically schedules high
                    risk tasks early in the project so that problems can be identified and addressed right away. It
                    allows for combining several tasks into one task when one resource is assigned to all the tasks.
                       Critical chain uses both deterministic (step-by-step) and probabilistic approaches. There are
                    a few steps involved in the critical chain process:
                          Construct the schedule network diagram using activity duration estimates (you'll use non-
                          conservative estimates in this method).

                  Calculate critical path.
                  Enter resource availability into the schedule.
                Often, the critical path will change once you've entered the resource availability. That's
             because the critical chain method adds non-work activities where needed as duration buffers to
             help manage the planned activity durations. After the buffers are added, the planned activities
             are then scheduled at their latest start and finish dates.



             Exam Spotlight

             CPM manages the total float of schedule networks paths, whereas critical chain manages buffer
             activity durations and resources.



             Project Management Software
             Given the examples you've worked through on Schedule Development and resource leveling,
             you probably already have concluded how much project management software might help you
             with these processes. Project management software automates the mathematical calculations
             (like forward and backward pass) and performs resource-leveling functions for you. Obviously,
             you can then print the schedule that's been produced for final approval and ongoing updates.
             It's common practice to e-mail updated schedules with project notes so that stakeholders know
             what activities are completed and which ones remain to be done.
                 It's beyond the scope of this book to go into all the various software programs available to
             project managers. Suffice it to say that project management software ranges from the very sim-
             ple to the very complex. The level of sophistication and the types of project management tech-
             niques that you're involved with will determine which software product you should choose.
             Many project managers that I know have had great success with Microsoft Project software and
             use it exclusively. It contains a robust set of features and reporting tools that will serve most
             projects well.
                 Don't forget that you are the project manager, and your good judgment should never be
             usurped by the recommendation of a software product. Your finely tuned skills and experience
             will tell you if relationship issues between team members might cause bigger problems than
             what the resource-leveling function indicates. Constraints and stakeholder expectations are dif-
             ficult for a software package to factor in. Rely on your expertise when in doubt. If you don't
             have the experience yet to make knowledge-based decisions, seek out another project manager
             or a senior stakeholder, manager, or team member and ask them to confirm if you're on the
             right track. And a word of caution: don't become so involved with the software that you're
             managing the software instead of managing the project. Project management software is a won-
             derful tool, but it is not a substitute for sound project management practices or experience.

                    274         Chapter 7         Creating the Project Schedule and Budget




                    Sunny Surgeons, Inc.

                    Kate Newman is a project manager for Sunny Surgeons, Inc. Sunny Surgeons is a software
                    company that produces software for handheld display devices for the medical profession. The
                    software allows surgeons to keep notes regarding patients, upcoming surgeries, and ideas
                    about new medicines and techniques to research. Kate's latest project is to write an enhanced
                    version of the patient-tracking program with system integration capabilities to a well-known
                    desktop software product used by the medical industry.

                    There has been some recent turnover in the programming department. Fortunately, Stephen,
                    the senior programmer who led the development effort on the original version of the patient
                    tracker, still works for Sunny. His expertise with handheld technologies as well as his knowl-
                    edge of the desktop software product make him an invaluable resource for this project.

                    Kate discovered a problem during the development of the project schedule. Stephen is over-
                    allocated for three key activities. Kate decides to see what his take is on the situation before
                    deciding what to do.

                    Stephen, the eternal optimist programmer who loves his job and does all but sleep in his office
                    at night, says he can easily complete all the activities and that Kate shouldn't give it a second
                    thought. He also suggests to Kate that Karen Wong, a junior programmer on his team who
                    worked on the last project with him, might be able to handle the noncritical path task on her
                    own, with a little direction from Stephen.

                    Kate thinks better of the idea of overallocating her key project resource, even if he does think
                    he can do the entire thing single-handed. She decides to try some resource leveling to see what
                    that turns up.

                    Kate discovers that rearranging the order of activities, along with assigning Karen to handle the
                    noncritical path activity, might be a possible solution. However, this scenario lengthens the
                    project by a total of eight days. Since Kate knows the primary constraint on this project is qual-
                    ity, she's fairly sure she can get buy-off from the project sponsor and stakeholders on the later
                    schedule date. She can also sell the resource-leveled schedule as a low-risk option as opposed
                    to assigning Stephen to all the activities and keeping the project end date the same. Overallo-
                    cating resources can cause burnout and stress-related illnesses, which will ultimately have a
                    negative impact on the project schedule.



                    Applying Calendars
                    Calendars are divided into two types: project calendars and resource calendars. Project calendars
                    concern all the resources involved in the project and specify the working periods for those resources.
                    For example, if your project work will be completed during normal working hours, the project
3601.book Page 275 Wednesday, July 13, 2005 1:39 PM




                                                                    Developing the Project Schedule           275




             calendar shows work periods from Monday through Friday between the hours of 8 AM and 5 PM.
             Project calendars are also a part of the organizational process input for this process.
                Resource calendars look at a particular resource or groups of resources and their availability,
             which were discussed earlier in this chapter. Perhaps your project calls for a marketing resource
             and the person assigned to the marketing activities is on an extended vacation in October. The
             resource calendar would show this person's vacation schedule.

             Adjusting Leads and Lags
             We talked about leads and lags in Chapter 6. You'll recall that lags delay successor activities and
             require time added either to the start date or to the finish date of the activity you're scheduling.
             Leads require time to be subtracted from the start date or the finish date of the activity. Keep
             in mind that as you go about creating your project schedule, you may need to adjust lead and
             lag time to come up with a workable schedule.

             Schedule Model
             Schedule model is a tool that you use to create your project schedule. You can think of this as
             a template. After you've determined activities, estimates, durations, dependencies, and
             resources, you use the schedule model in combination with your project management software
             to create the schedule.


             Schedule Development Process Outputs
             The Schedule Development process has eight outputs:
                  Project schedule
                  Schedule model data
                  Schedule baseline
                  Resource requirement updates
                  Activity attributes updates
                  Project calendar updates
                  Requested changes
                  Project management plan updates (updates to the schedule management plan)
                We'll take a look at the first three outputs of this process. We've covered all the other outputs
             previously. Take note that the two primary outputs from this process that will carry forward
             throughout the rest of the project are the project schedule and the schedule baseline.

                    276         Chapter 7         Creating the Project Schedule and Budget



                    Project Schedule
                    The purpose of the Schedule Development process is to determine the start and finish dates for
                    each of the project activities. One of the primary outputs of this process is the project schedule,
                    which details this information as well as the resource assignments. However, depending on the
                    size and complexity of your project or your organization's culture, the resource assignments and
                    start and finish dates may not be completed yet. If that's the case, the project schedule is con-
                    sidered preliminary until the resources are assigned to the activities.


                                          In A Guide to the PMBOK terms, the project schedule is considered preliminary
                                          until resources are assigned. In reality, beware that once you've published the
                                          project schedule (even though it's in a preliminary state), some stakeholders
                                          may regard this as the actual schedule and expect you to manage to the dates
                                          shown. Use caution when publishing schedules in their preliminary form.

                        The project schedule should be approved and signed off by stakeholders and functional man-
                    agers. This assures you that they have read the schedule, understand the dates and resource
                    commitments, and will likely cooperate. You'll also need to obtain confirmation that resources
                    will be available as outlined in the schedule when you're working in a functional organization.
                    The schedule cannot be finalized until you receive approval and commitment for the resource
                    assignments outlined in it.
                        Once the schedule is approved, it will become your baseline for the remainder of the project.
                    Project progress and task completion will be monitored and tracked against the project schedule
                    to determine if the project is on course as planned.
                        The schedule can be displayed in a variety of ways, some of which are variations on what
                    you've already seen. Project schedule network diagrams, like the ones discussed in Chapter 6,
                    will work as schedule diagrams when you add the start and finish dates to each activity. These
                    diagrams usually show the activity dependencies and critical path. Figure 7.2 shows a sample
                    portion of a project schedule network diagram highlighting the programming activities.
                        Gantt charts are easy to read and commonly used to display schedule activities. Depending
                    on the software you're using to produce the Gantt chart, it might also show activity sequences,
                    activity start and end dates, resource assignments, activity dependencies, and the critical path.
                    Figure 7.3 is a simple example that plots various activities against time. These activities do not
                    relate to the activities in the tables or other figures shown so far. Gantt charts are also known
                    as bar charts.
                        Milestone charts are another way to depict schedule information. Milestones mark the com-
                    pletion of major deliverables or some other key event in the project. For example, approval and
                    sign-off on project deliverables might be considered a milestone. Other examples might be com-
                    pletion of a prototype, system testing, contract approval, and so on.
                        Milestone charts might show the key events and their start or completion dates in a bar chart
                    form similar to a Gantt chart. Or they can be written in a simple table format with milestones
                    listed in the rows and expected schedule dates in one column and actual completion dates in
                    another, as in the following example. As the milestones are met, the Actual Date column is filled
                    in. This information can be included with the project status reports.

                    278         Chapter 7         Creating the Project Schedule and Budget



                    Schedule Model Data
                    The schedule model data refers to documenting the supporting data for the schedule. The min-
                    imum amount of information in this output includes the milestones, schedule activities and
                    activity attributes, and documenting the assumptions and constraints regarding the schedule.
                    Other information that should be documented but doesn't necessarily fit into the other catego-
                    ries would get documented here. Always err on the side of too much documentation rather than
                    not enough.
                       You will have to be the judge of what other information to include here, as it will depend on
                    the nature of the project. A Guide to the PMBOK suggests that you might include resource his-
                    tograms. There is an example resource histogram in Chapter 6 if you need to review. Resource
                    histograms typically display hours needed on one axis and period of time (days, weeks, months,
                    years) on the other axis. You might also include alternative schedules or contingency schedule
                    reserves in this section.

                    Schedule Baseline
                    I think of the schedule baseline as the final, approved version of the project schedule with base-
                    line start and baseline finish dates and resource assignments. A Guide to the PMBOK notes that
                    you derive this baseline from a schedule network analysis of the schedule model.
                        As I've noted during discussions of some of the other Planning processes, project planning
                    and project management are an iterative process. Rarely is anything cast in cement. You will
                    continue to revisit processes throughout the project to refine and adjust. Eventually, processes
                    do get put to bed. You wouldn't want to come back to the Planning process at the conclusion
                    of the project, for example, but keep in mind that the Planning, Executing, and Monitoring and
                    Controlling process groups are iterative, and it's not unusual to have to revise processes within
                    these process groups as you progress on the project.
                        In practice for small to medium-sized projects, Activity Definition, Activity Sequencing,
                    Activity Resource Estimating, Activity Duration Estimating, and Schedule Development are
                    easily completed at the same time with the aid of good project management software. Gantt
                    charts, critical path, resource allocation, activity dependencies, what-if analysis, and various
                    reports are easily produced after plugging your scheduling information in to most project man-
                    agement software tools. Regardless of your methods, be certain to obtain sign-off of the project
                    schedule and provide your stakeholders and project sponsor with regular updates. And keep
                    your schedule handy--there will likely be changes and modifications as you go. While you're at
                    it, make certain to save a schedule baseline for comparative purposes. Once you get into the
                    Executing and Monitoring and Controlling processes you'll be able to compare what you
                    planned to do against what actually happened.
                        Now we're ready to prepare our last planning document, the project budget. First, we'll look
                    at some cost estimating techniques, and then we'll plug those estimates into the project budget.

                                                                                    Cost Estimating        279




             Cost Estimating
             You now have an exhaustive breakdown of project activities, and you have some pretty good dura-
             tion estimates. Now the question that's forever on the mind of the executive management staff: How
             much is it going to cost? The purpose of the Cost Estimating process is to answer that question.
                Every project has a budget, and part of completing a project successfully is completing it
             within the approved budget. Sometimes project managers are not responsible for the budget
             portion of the project. This function is assigned instead to a functional manager who is respon-
             sible for tracking and reporting all the project costs. I believe project mangers will have more
             and more responsibility in this area as the project management discipline evolves. Keep in mind
             that if you, as the project manager, don't have responsibility for the project budget, your per-
             formance evaluation for the project should not include budget or cost measurements.
                Before we dive into the Cost Estimating and Cost Budgeting process particulars, you should
             know that these processes are governed by a cost management plan that is created when you per-
             form the Project Management Plan process. Just like the schedule management plan, the cost man-
             agement plan isn't developed during these processes and it isn't an output of any of the Cost
             processes. There are a couple of things you should know about this plan for the exam. Like all the
             other management plans, it's a subsidiary of the project management plan. According to A Guide
             to the PMBOK, some of the elements of this plan include, but aren't limited to, the following:
                  Precision levels, or the rounding you'll use for project costs (hundreds, thousands,
                  and so on)
                  Units of measure for resources such has hours for staff resources and hourly rates for con-
                  tractor staff
                  Control account links so that cost estimates for WBS elements can be linked directly to the
                  accounting system
                  Variance thresholds for costs
                  Earned value rules (We'll talk about this in the tools and techniques section.)
                  Reporting formats
                  Process descriptions
                As with time estimates, the work breakdown structure (WBS) is the key to determining accu-
             rate cost estimates. The Cost Estimating process develops a cost estimate for the resources
             (human and material) required for each schedule activity. This includes weighing alternative
             options and examining trade-offs.
                Let's look at an example. Many times software development projects take on a life of their
             own. The requested project completion dates are unrealistic; however, the project team commits
             to completing the project on time and on budget anyway. How do they do this? By cutting
             things like design, analysis, and documentation. In the end, the project might get completed on
             time and on budget, but was it really? The costs associated with the extended support period
             due to a lack of design and documentation and the hours needed by the software programmers
             to fix the reported bugs aren't included in the original cost of the project (but they should have
3601.book Page 280 Wednesday, July 13, 2005 1:39 PM




                    280         Chapter 7         Creating the Project Schedule and Budget



                    been). Therefore, the costs actually exceed what was budgeted. You should examine trade-offs
                    such as these when determining cost estimates.
                       When you are determining cost estimates, be certain to include all the costs of the project
                    over its entire life cycle. As in the preceding example, software projects often have warranty
                    periods that guarantee bug fixes or problem resolution within a certain time frame. This is a
                    legitimate cost that should be included in your estimates.


                                          Don't confuse pricing with Cost Estimating. If you are working for a company
                                          that performs consulting services on contract, for example, the price you will
                                          charge for your services is not the same thing as the costs to perform the
                                          project. The costs are centered on the resources needed to produce the product
                                          or service of the project. The price your company might charge for the service
                                          includes not only these costs, but a profit margin as well.




                    Cost Estimating Inputs
                    You are already familiar with all of the Cost Estimating inputs. They are as follows:
                          Enterprise environmental factors
                          Organizational process assets
                          Project scope statement
                          WBS
                          WBS dictionary
                          Project management plan (including the schedule management plan, staffing management
                          plan, and risk register)
                       As with several other processes we've covered, keep in mind organizational policies (such as
                    cost estimating policies or templates), historical information, previous project files, constraints,
                    and assumptions when deriving your cost estimates.


                    Cost Estimating Tools and Techniques
                    Cost Estimating has eight tools and techniques used to derive estimates:
                          Analogous estimating
                          Determine resource cost rates
                          Bottom-up estimating
                          Parametric estimating
                          Project management software
                          Vendor bid analysis
3601.book Page 281 Wednesday, July 13, 2005 1:39 PM




                                                                                     Cost Estimating            281



                  Reserve analysis
                  Cost of quality
                We covered analogous, parametric estimating, and reserve analysis techniques in the Activity
             Duration Estimating section. All of the information talked about there applies here as well, except
             we're using the tools and techniques to derive cost estimates. And, in the case of reserve anal-
             ysis, we're adding cost reserves (or contingencies) during this process, not schedule reserves. You
             could aggregate these cost contingencies and assign them to a schedule activity or work package
             level. The Project management software is a tool that can help you establish project cost estimates
             and helps you quickly determine estimates given different variables and alternatives. We talked
             about cost of quality way back in Chapter 4. We'll look at the remaining techniques next.

             Determine Resource Rates
             Resource rates are determined a number of ways. Your organization may have a vendor list
             with published rates that you'll use. These are usually updated once or twice a year. You could
             request quotes from vendors or do some Internet searching to find rates. Don't forget to include
             the resource rates of the folks who work within the organization as well. These rates apply to
             both human resources and materials.

             Bottom-Up Estimating
             We discussed this technique in the Activity Resource Estimating process. This technique esti-
             mates costs associated with every activity individually and then rolls them up to derive a total
             project estimate. You wouldn't choose this technique to provide a cost estimate for the project
             during Initiating if one were requested because you don't have enough information at that stage
             to use the bottom-up technique. Instead, use the top-down estimation technique (analogous
             estimating) when a project cost estimate is needed early on in the project selection stage.

             Vendor Bid Analysis
             As the name implies, this is a process of gathering information from vendors to help you estab-
             lish cost estimates. You can accomplish this by requesting bids or quotes or working with some
             of your trusted vendor sources for estimates. You should compare vendor bids when using this
             tool and technique and not rely solely on one vendor to provide you with estimates.



             Exam Spotlight

             For the exam, make sure you're familiar with all the cost estimating tools and techniques, their
             benefits, and under what conditions you use them.

                    Cost Estimating Process Outputs
                    Obviously, one of the outputs of the Cost Estimating process is the activity cost estimates. These are
                    quantitative amounts--usually stated in monetary units--that reflect the cost of the resources
                    needed to complete the project activities. The tools and techniques we just described help you derive
                    these estimates. Resources in this case include human resources, material, equipment, information
                    technology needs, and so on as well as any contingency reserve amounts and inflation factors (if
                    you're using them).
                       Activity Cost Estimating supporting detail, requested changes, and cost management plan
                    updates are the remaining Cost Estimating outputs. Supporting detail is just as you've seen in
                    other processes. Any information that supports how the estimates were developed, what
                    assumptions were made during the Cost Estimating process, and any other details you think
                    need to be documented go here. According to A Guide to the PMBOK, the supporting detail
                    should include the following:
                          A description of the work that was estimated.
                          A description of how the estimate was developed or the basis for the estimate.
                          A description of the assumptions made about the estimates or the method used to deter-
                          mine them.
                          A description of the constraints.
                          A range of possible results. Like the time estimates, the cost estimates should be stated
                          within ranges such as "$500  $75."
                       Cost variances will occur and estimates will be refined as you get further into your project. As
                    a result, you'll update cost estimates and ultimately the project budget to reflect these changes.
                       Cost Estimating uses several techniques to make an accurate assessment of the project costs.
                    In practice, using a combination of techniques is your best bet to come up with the most reliable
                    cost estimates. The activity cost estimates will become an input to the Cost Budgeting process,
                    which allows you to establish a baseline for project costs to track against.



                    Establishing the Cost Budget Baseline
                    Our next process concerns determining the cost baseline, which is the primary output of the
                    Cost Budgeting process. The Cost Budgeting process aggregates the cost estimates of activities
                    and establishes a cost baseline for the project that is used to measure performance of the project
                    throughout the remaining process groups. Only the costs associated with the project become
                    part of the project budget. For example, future period operating costs are not project costs and
                    therefore aren't included in the project budget.
                       The cost baseline is the expected cost for the project. Remember that costs are tied to the
                    financial system through the chart of accounts--or code of accounts--and are assigned to
                    project activities at the work package level of the WBS.
                       The budget will be used as a plan for allocating costs to project activities.

             Cost Budgeting Inputs
             The Schedule Development and Cost Estimating processes must be completed prior to working
             on Cost Budgeting because some of their outputs become the inputs to this process. The inputs
             for Cost Budgeting are as follows:
                  Project scope statement
                  Work breakdown structure
                  WBS dictionary
                  Activity cost estimates
                  Activity cost estimate supporting detail
                  Project schedule
                  Resource calendars
                  Contract
                  Cost management plan
                We've covered all these inputs before. As usual, don't forget to look at project constraints,
             particularly funding limitations in this case.


             Cost Budgeting Tools and Techniques
             There are four tools and techniques in the Cost Budgeting process, including two that we
             haven't seen before:
                  Cost aggregation
                  Reserve analysis
                  Parametric estimating
                  Funding limit reconciliation
               Reserve analysis and parametric estimating have been covered previously. Note that reserve
             analysis in this process also takes into consideration management contingency reserves for
             unplanned changes to project scope and project costs.
             Cost aggregation Cost aggregation is the process of tallying the schedule activity cost esti-
             mates at the work package level and then totaling the work package levels to higher-level WBS
             component levels (such as the control accounts).
             Funding limit reconciliation Funding limit reconciliation involves reconciling the amount of
             funds spent with the amount of funds budgeted for the project. These limits are set by the orga-
             nization or by the customer. Reconciling the project expenses will require adjusting the schedule
             so that the expenses can be smoothed. This is done by placing imposed date constraints (we
             talked about these in the Schedule Development process) on work packages or other WBS com-
             ponents in the project schedule.

                    284         Chapter 7         Creating the Project Schedule and Budget




                    Cost Budgeting Process Outputs
                    The goal of Cost Budgeting is to develop a cost baseline (an output of this process) for the
                    project that you can use in the Executing and Monitoring and Controlling processes to measure
                    performance. We now have all of the information we need to create the cost baseline. In addi-
                    tion, we'll establish the project funding requirements.
                       The following are all of the outputs of the Cost Budgeting process:
                          Cost baseline
                          Project funding requirements
                          Cost management plan updates
                          Requested changes
                       The cost management plan updates and requested changes outputs have been covered pre-
                    viously. We'll look at the cost baseline in the following sections.

                    Documenting the Cost Baseline
                    The cost baseline, the first output of Cost Budgeting, is developed by adding up the costs of the
                    WBS elements (remember, these costs were aggregated with the cost aggregation tool and tech-
                    nique) according to time periods. Most projects span some length of time and most organiza-
                    tions time the funding with the project. In other words, you won't get all the funds for the
                    project at the beginning of the project; they'll likely be disbursed over time. The cost baseline
                    provides the basis for measurement, over time, of the expected cash flows (or funding disburse-
                    ments) against the requirements.
                        Cost baselines can be displayed graphically, with time increments on one axis and dollars
                    expended on the other axis, as shown in Figure 7.4. The costs shown on this graph are cumu-
                    lative costs, meaning that what you spent this period is added to what was spent last period and
                    then charted. Many variations of this graph exist showing dollars budgeted against dollars
                    expended to date and so on. Cost budgets can be displayed using this type of graph as well, by
                    plotting the sum of the estimated costs excepted per period.

             Exam Spotlight

             For the exam, remember that cost baselines are displayed as an S curve. The reason for this is
             that project spending starts out slowly, gradually increases over the project's life until it
             reaches a peak, and then tapers off again as the project wraps up. Large projects are difficult
             to graph in this manner because the timescale isn't wide enough to accurately show fluctua-
             tions in spending. There are other methods that more accurately graph costs that we'll look at
             in the Cost Control process.



                The cost baseline should contain the costs for all of the expected work on the project. You
             would have identified most of these costs in the Cost Estimating process. You'll find most
             projects' largest expense is resource costs (as in labor costs). In the case of projects where you're
             purchasing the final product, the purchase price is the largest cost.
                Schedule Development might have uncovered additional activities that need to be added to
             the budget as well, so don't forget to add them to your budget.


                                   Large projects may have more than one cost baseline. For example, you may
                                   be required to track human resource costs, material costs, and contractor costs
                                   separately.

                The cost baseline should also contain appropriations for risk response. We covered several
             categories and tools of Risk Response Planning in Chapter 5, "Risk Planning," including avoid-
             ance, mitigation, insurance, and contingency plans. Some of the budget should be allocated to
             each of the techniques that you identified in your risk management plan. Additionally, you'll
             want to set aside money for contingency reserves. This is for the unforeseen, unplanned risks
             that may occur. Even with all of the time and effort you spend on planning, unexpected things
             do crop up. Better to have the money set aside and not need it than to need it and not have it.
                We'll revisit the cost baseline when we talk about the Cost Control process and examine dif-
             ferent ways to measure costs.

             Project Funding Requirements
             Project funding requirements (which are also known as the project budget) are the total amount of
             money spent on the project. They are determined from the cost baseline and may include a manage-
             ment contingency reserve that's used to manage cost overruns, particularly early on in the project.
             As I said earlier, spending usually starts out slowly on the project and picks up speed as you progress.
             Sometimes, the expected cash flows don't match the pace of spending. Project funding requirements
             accounts for this by using a management reserve contingency (usually a margin or percentage of the
             cost baseline) that's released in increments with the project budget. Figure 7.5 shows the cost base-
             line, the funding requirements, and the expected cash flows plotted on the S curve. This example
             shows a negative amount of management reserve because the difference between the funding
             requirements and the cost baseline at the end of project is the management reserve.

                    Bringing It All Together
                    Believe it or not, we have officially completed the Planning process group. Along the way, I've
                    mentioned gaining approvals for portions of the project plan like the schedule and budget.
                       The project plan is the approved, formal, documented plan that's used to guide you through-
                    out the project Executing process group. The plan is made up of all the outputs of the Planning
                    process groups, including the Project Management Plan. It's the map that tells you where you're
                    going and how to perform the activities of the project plan during the Project Plan Execution
                    process. It serves several purposes, the most important of which is tracking and measuring
                    project performance through the Executing and Monitoring and Controlling processes and
                    making future project decisions. The project plan is critical in all communications you'll have
                    from here forward with the stakeholders, management, and customers. The project plan also
                    documents all project planning assumptions, all project planning decisions, and important man-
                    agement reviews needed.
                       The project plan encompasses everything we've talked about up to now and is represented
                    in a formal document, or collection of documents. This document contains the project scope
                    statement, deliverables, assumptions, risks, WBS, milestones, project schedule, resources, and
                    more. It becomes the baseline you'll use to measure and track progress against. It's also used to
                    help you control the components that tend to stray from the original plan so you can get them
                    back in line.
                       The project plan is used as a communication and information tool for stakeholders, team
                    members, and the management team. They will use the project plan to review and gauge
                    progress as well.

             Exam Spotlight

             Performance measurement baselines are management controls that should change only infre-
             quently. Examples of the performance measurement baselines we've looked at so far are Cost
             Budgeting baselines and schedule baselines. However, the project plan itself also becomes a
             baseline. If changes in scope or schedule do occur after Planning is complete, there's a formal-
             ized process that you should go through to implement the changes, which we'll cover in a
             Chapter 10, "Monitoring and Controlling Change."



                Don't forget that sign-off is an important part of this process. Your last step in the Planning
             process group is obtaining sign-off of the project plan from stakeholders, the sponsor, and the
             management team. If they've been an integral part of the Planning processes all along (and I
             know you know how important this is), obtaining sign-off of the project plan should simply be
             a formality.
                The important thing to note here is that all the management plans we discussed during the
             Planning processes--the project management plan and its subsidiary plans, including the scope
             management plan, the schedule management plan and so on, plus the cost budgeting baseline
             and the schedule baseline--are used throughout the Executing process group to manage the
             project and keep the performance of the project on track with the project objectives. If you don't
             have a project plan, you'll have no way of managing the process. You'll find that even with a
             project plan, project scope has a way of changing. Stakeholders and others tend to sneak in a
             few of the "Oh, I didn't understand that before" statements and hope that they slide right by
             you. With that signed, approved project plan in your files, you are allowed to gently remind

             The stakeholders provided you with an activity list the last time you met. After creating a com-
             plete activity list and the first draft of the project schedule network diagram, you went back to
             each of them to ask for time and cost estimates for each of the activities. Ricardo's estimates
             are shown below with the activities he gave you last time:

             1.   Procure the T1 connection. This takes 30 to 45 days and will have ongoing costs of $300 per
                  month. This can be done concurrently with the other activities listed here. Ricardo will han-
                  dle this activity.

             2.   Run Ethernet cable throughout the building. This activity depends on the lease being
                  signed and must finish before the build-out can start. The estimated time to complete is 16
                  hours, which was figured using parametric estimating techniques. Ricardo has one person
                  on staff who can complete this specialized activity. His first available date is October 5.

                    3.    Purchase the router, switch, server, and rack for the equipment room and four point-of-
                          service terminals. The estimated costs are $17,000. Delivery time is two weeks. Ricardo will
                          do this activity.

                    4.    Install the router and test the connection. Testing depends on the T1 installation at demar-
                          cation. The time estimate to install is eight hours. Ricardo's staff will do this activity.

                    5.    Install the switch. Based on past experience, the time estimate to install is two hours.
                          Ricardo's staff will do this activity.

                    6.    Install the server and test. The testing depends on the T1 connection installation. Based on
                          past experience, the time estimate to install is six hours. Ricardo's staff will do this activity.

                    7.    The web team will add the new store location and phone number to the lookup function on
                          the Internet site. The time estimate is eight hours. Ricardo will assign his applications-
                          programming manager to this activity. This activity depends on the lease being signed.

                    Jake and Jill have each written similar lists with estimates and resource assignments. You
                    begin to align all the activities in sequential order and discover a problem. Jill needs 14 days
                    to hire personnel and stock shelves, meaning that the build-out must be finished by January 16.
                    Build-out takes approximately 120 days and can't start before September 20 due to the con-
                    tractor's availability. This is a problem because Ricardo's Ethernet cable expert isn't available
                    until October 5, and he needs 2 days to complete the cabling. This pushes out the build-out start
                    date by almost 2 weeks, which means the project completion date, or store-opening date, is
                    delayed by 2 weeks.

                    After gathering more information from Ricardo, you head to Dirk's office.

                    "So, Dirk," you conclude after filling him in on all the details, "We have two options. Hire a con-
                    tractor to perform the cable run since Ricardo's person isn't available, or push the store open-
                    ing out by two weeks."

                    Dirk asks, "How much will the contractor charge to run the cable, and are they available within
                    the time frame you need?"

                    "Yes, they are available, and I've already requested Ricardo book the week of September 18 to
                    hold this option open for us. They've quoted a price of $10,000."

                    "Okay, let's bring in the contractor. At this point, $10,000 isn't going to break the budget. How
                    is that planning coming anyway? Signed a lease yet?"

                    "Yes, we've signed the lease. Jake has been meeting with Gomez construction on the build-out.
                    We've used Gomez on three out of the last five new stores and have had good luck with them."

             You spend the next couple of days working on the project schedule in Microsoft Project, clari-
             fying tasks and activities with Jake, Ricardo, and Jill. You decide that a Gantt chart will work
             excellently for reporting status for this project. A portion of your first draft of the Gantt chart
             shows the following at the end of the project:

                    290         Chapter 7         Creating the Project Schedule and Budget




                    You stare intensely at the problem you see on the screen. The Grand Opening task (number 18)
                    is scheduled to occur 13 days later than when you need it! Grand opening must happen February
                    1 and 2, not February 14 and 15 as the schedule shows. You trace the problem back and see that
                    Grand Opening depends on Train Store Personnel, which itself depends on several other tasks,
                    including Hire Store Personnel and Install and Test Hardware. Digging deeper, build-out can't
                    begin until the Ethernet cable is run throughout the building. Ricardo already set up the time with
                    the contractor to run the cable September 18. This date cannot move, which means build-out can-
                    not start any sooner than September 20, which works with Gomez's availability.

                    You pick up the phone and dial Jake's number. "Jake," you say into the receiver, "I'm working
                    on the project schedule, and I have some issues with the Gomez activity."

                    "Shoot," Jake says.

                    "Gomez Construction can't start work until the Ethernet cable is run. I've already confirmed
                    with Ricardo that there is no negotiation on this. Ricardo is hiring a contractor for this activity,
                    and the earliest they can start is September 18. It takes them two days to run the cable, which
                    puts the start date for build-out at September 20."

                    "What's the problem with the September 20th date?" Jake asks.

                    "Jill wants to have the build-out finished prior to hiring the store personnel. During the last
                    store opening, those activities overlapped, and she said it was unmanageable. She wants to
                    hire folks and have them stock the shelves in preparation for store opening but doesn't want
                    contractors in there while they're doing it. A September 20 start date for Gomez puts us at a fin-
                    ish date of January 26, which is too late to give Jill time to hire and stock shelves. My question
                    is this, is 120 days to finish a build-out a firm estimate?"

                    "Always--I've got this down to a science. Gomez has worked with me on enough of these
                    build-outs that we can come within just a couple of days of this estimate either way," Jake says.

                    You pick up your schedule detail and continue, "I've scheduled Gomez's resource calendar as
                    you told me originally. Gomez doesn't work Sundays and neither do we. Their holidays are
                    Labor Day, a couple of days at Thanksgiving, Christmas, and New Year's, but this puts us too
                    far out on the schedule. We must have our February 1 opening coincide with the Garden and
                    Home Show dates."

                    "I can't change the 120 days. Sounds like you have a problem."

                    "I need to crash the schedule," you say. "What would the chances be of Gomez agreeing to
                    split the build-out tasks? We could hire a second contractor to come in and work alongside
                    Gomez's crew to speed up this task. That would shorten the duration to 100 days, which means
                    we could meet the February 1 date."

                                                                              Bringing It All Together           291




             "Won't happen. I know Gomez. They're a big outfit and have all their own crews. We typically
             work with them exclusively. If I brought another contractor into the picture, I might have a hard
             time negotiating any kind of favors with them later if we get into a bind."

             "All right," you say. "How about this? I'm making some changes to the resource calendar while
             we're talking. What if we authorize Gomez's crew to work six 10-hour days, which still leaves
             them with Sundays off, and we ask them to work Labor Day and take only one day at Thanks-
             giving instead of two?"

             The detail showing these changes is as follows:

                    "I think Gomez would go for that. You realize it's going to cost you?"

                    "Project management is all about trade-offs. We can't move the start date, so chances are the
                    budget might take a hit to accommodate schedule changes or risk. Fortunately, I'm just now
                    wrapping up the final funding requirements, or the cost budget, so if you can get me the
                    increased cost from Gomez soon, I'd appreciate it. This change will keep us on track and resolve
                    Jill's issues too."

                    "I don't think Gomez's crew will mind the overtime during the holiday season. Everyone can
                    use a little extra cash at that time of year, it seems. I'll have the figures for you in a day or two."

             Summary
             Great job, you've made it through the entire Planning process group. We covered several pro-
             cesses in this chapter, including Activity Resource Estimating, Activity Duration Estimating,
             Schedule Development, Cost Estimating, and Cost Budgeting.
                The Activity Resource Estimating process considers all the resources needed and the quantity
             of resources needed to perform project activities. This information is determined for each sched-
             ule activity and is documented in the activity resource requirements output.
                Duration estimates are produced as a result of the Activity Duration Estimating process.
             Activity duration estimates document the number of work periods needed for each activity,
             including their elapsed time. Analogous estimating--also called top-down estimating--is one
             way to determine activity duration estimates. Top-down techniques can also be used to estimate
             project durations and total project costs. Parametric estimating techniques multiply a known
             element--like the quantity of materials needed--by the time it takes to install or complete one
             unit of materials. The result is a total estimate for the activity. Three-point estimates average the
             most likely estimate, a pessimistic estimate, and an optimistic estimate. Reserve analysis takes
             schedule risk into consideration by adding an additional percentage of time or another work
             period to the estimate just in case you run into trouble.
                Schedule Development is the process in which you assign beginning and ending dates to
             activities and determine their duration. You might use CPM to accomplish this. CPM calculates
             early start, early finish, late start, and late finish dates. It also determines float time. All tasks
             with zero float are critical path tasks. The critical path is usually the longest path in the project.
                PERT calculates a weighted average estimate for each activity by using the optimistic, pes-
             simistic, and most likely times and then determines variances, or standard deviations, to come
             up with a total project duration within a given confidence range. Work will finish within plus
             or minus one standard deviation 68.26 percent of the time. Work will finish within plus or
             minus two standard deviations 95.44 percent of the time.
                Schedules sometimes need to be compressed to meet promised dates or to shorten the sched-
             ule times. Crashing looks at cost and schedule trade-offs. Adding resources to critical path tasks
             and limiting or reducing the project requirements or scope are ways to crash the schedule. Fast
             tracking involves beginning at the same time two tasks that were originally scheduled to start
             one after the other. Fast tracking increases project risk.
                Monte Carlo analysis can be used in the Schedule Development process to determine multi-
             ple, probable project durations.
                Resource leveling attempts to smooth out the schedule and properly allocate resources to
             critical path tasks. This may require updates to the resource management plan.
                The project schedule details the activities in graphical form through the use of project sched-
             ule network diagrams with dates, Gantt charts, milestone charts, or project schedule network
             diagrams.
                The Cost Estimating process determines how much the project resources will cost and these
             costs are usually stated in monetary amounts. Analogous estimating is one technique that can
             be used to determine cost estimates. Another technique is parametric estimating. Bottom-up

                    estimating can be used for project cost estimates. This involves estimating the cost of each
                    schedule activity and then rolling these up to come up with a total work package cost.
                       The Cost Budgeting baseline will be used throughout the project to measure project expendi-
                    tures, variance, and project performance. The cost baseline is graphically displayed as an S curve.



                    Exam Essentials
                    Be able to name the purpose of the Activity Resource Estimating process. The purpose of
                    Activity Resource Estimating is to determine the types of resources needed (human, equipment,
                    and materials) and in what quantities for each schedule activity within a work package.
                    Be able to name the tools and techniques of Activity Duration Estimating. The tools and
                    techniques of Activity Duration Estimating are expert judgment, analogous estimating, para-
                    metric estimating, three-point estimates, and reserve analysis.
                    Be able to define the difference between analogous estimating and bottom-up estimating.
                    Analogous estimating is a top-down technique that uses expert judgment and historical informa-
                    tion. Bottom-up estimating performs estimates for each work item and rolls them up to a total.
                    Be able to calculate the critical path. The critical path includes the activities whose durations
                    add up to the longest full path of the project schedule network diagram. Critical path is calcu-
                    lated using the forward pass, backward pass, and float calculations.
                    Be able to define a critical path task. A critical path task is a project activity with zero float.
                    Be able to describe and calculate PERT duration estimates. This is a weighted average tech-
                    nique that uses three estimates: optimistic, pessimistic, and most likely. The formula is as fol-
                    lows: (optimistic + pessimistic + (4 x most likely)) / 6.
                    Be able to name the duration compression techniques. The duration compression techniques
                    are crashing and fast tracking.
                    Be able to identify and describe the primary output of the Cost Estimating process. The pri-
                    mary output of Cost Estimating is activity cost estimates. These estimates are quantitative
                    amounts--usually stated in monetary units--that reflect the cost of the resources needed to
                    complete the project activities.
                    Be able to describe the cost baseline. The cost baseline is the expected cost of the project and
                    is used to measure performance. It's displayed as an S curve.

                    Answers to Review Questions
                    1.    C. The tools and techniques for Activity Duration Estimating are expert judgment, alternatives
                          analysis, published estimating data, project management software, bottom-up estimating.

                    2.    A. Analogous--or top-down--estimating techniques are a form of expert judgment. Since
                          this project is similar to another recent project, you can use the cost estimates from the previous
                          project to help you quickly determine estimates for the current project.

                    3.    C. Reserve analysis takes schedule risk into consideration and adds a percentage of time or addi-
                          tional work periods to the estimate to prevent schedule delays.

                    4.    C. Parametric estimating multiplies a known element--like the quantity of materials needed--
                          by the time it takes to install or complete one unit of materials. The result is a total estimate for
                          the activity. In this case, 10 servers multiplied by 16 hours per server gives you a 160-hour total
                          duration estimate.

                    5.    B. Bottom-up techniques are the most time-consuming and the most accurate estimates you can use.
                          With bottom-up estimating, each work item is estimated and rolled up to a project total.

                    6.    A. The project schedule determines the start and ending dates of activities, determines float times,
                          generally shows resource assignments, and details the activity sequences and durations.

                    7.    C. The CPM calculates a single early and late start date and a single early and late finish date for
                          each activity. Once these dates are known, float time is calculated for each activity to determine
                          the critical path. The other answers contain elements of PERT calculations.

                    8.    B. The only information you have for this example is activity duration, therefore the critical path
                          is the path with the longest duration. Path A-D-E-H with a duration of 34 days is the critical path.

                    9.    D. The only information you have for this example is activity duration, so you must calculate the
                          critical path based on the durations given. The duration of A-B-C-E-H increased by 3 days for
                          a total of 35 days. The duration of A-F-G-H and A-F-G-E-H each increased by 3 days. A-F-G-
                          E-H totals 36 days and becomes the new critical path.

                    10. D. The critical path is calculated by adding together the durations of all the tasks with zero float.
                        The critical path can be compressed using crashing techniques.

                    11. C. The calculation for PERT is the sum of optimistic time plus pessimistic time plus four times
                        the most likely time divided by 6. The calculation for this example is as follows:
                        (48 + 72 + (4 x 60)) / 6 = 60.

                    12. D. The standard deviation is calculated by subtracting the optimistic time from the pessimistic
                        time and dividing the result by 6. The calculation for this example is as follows:
                        (72 - 48) / 6 = 4.

                    13. D. There is a 95 percent probability that the work will finish within plus or minus two standard
                        deviations. The expected value is 500, and the standard deviation times 2 is 24, so the activity
                        will take from 476 to 524 days.

             14. B. A 68 percent probability is calculated using plus or minus one standard deviation, a 95 per-
                 cent probability uses plus or minus two standard deviations, and a 99 percent probability uses
                 plus or minus three standard deviations.

             15. A. Crashing the schedule includes things like adding resources to the critical path tasks or lim-
                 iting project requirements.

             16. C. Resource leveling attempts to smooth out resource assignments by splitting tasks, assigning
                 underallocated team members to more tasks, or delaying the start of tasks to match team mem-
                 bers' availability.

             17. A. Project management software is a very useful tool for the project manager, and it automates
                 project scheduling, allowing for what-if analysis and easy changes. But if you focus too much on
                 the tool and ignore the project, the tool becomes a hindrance.

             18. A. Stakeholders ordinarily will not have much say in the project Planning methodology used by
                 the project manager. The methodology employed is usually determined by the organization, the
                 project office, or the project manager.

             19. C. Future period operating costs are considered ongoing costs and are not part of project costs.

             20. B. The cost baseline is displayed as an S curve because of the way project spending occurs.
                 Spending begins slowly, picks up speed until the spending peak is reached, and then tapers off
                 as the project winds down.

                                                    This chapter begins the project Executing process group. We'll
                                                    cover four of the processes in this chapter: Direct and Manage
                                                    Project Execution, Acquire Project Team, Develop Project Team,
                    and Distributing Information. We'll jump around a bit in this chapter as you can tell from the
                    processes we'll cover. Many of these processes are extensions, so to speak, of the Planning pro-
                    cesses leading up to them. We'll cover the remaining Executing processes in the next chapter.
                        Direct and Manage Project Execution is the action process. This is where you'll put the plans
                    into action and begin working on the project activities. Execution also involves keeping the project
                    in line with the original project plan and bringing wayward activities back into alignment.
                        Several things happen during the Executing processes. The majority of the project budget will
                    be spent during this process group, and often the majority of the project time is expended here
                    as well. The greatest conflicts you'll see during the project Executing processes are schedule con-
                    flicts. In addition, the product description will be finalized here and contain more detail than it
                    did in the Planning processes.
                        Hang with me during this chapter, because there are several references to the next process--
                    the Monitoring and Controlling process group--that are inputs to the Executing process group.
                    These are the only two process groups that serve as inputs to each other. Since we can't discuss
                    both of them at the same time, we'll tell you when there's something specific from the Moni-
                    toring and Controlling process group that will be discussed in a later chapter.
                        There might be several exam questions from every process within the Executing process
                    group. You'll find the majority of questions are about the Direct and Manage Project Execution,
                    the Acquire Project Team, and Develop Project Team processes. Don't skip studying the other
                    processes, however, as roughly a quarter of the exam questions concern the entire Executing
                    process group. Are you ready to dive into Executing? Let's go.



                    Executing the Project Plan
                    The purpose of the Direct and Manage Project Execution process is to carry out the project
                    plan. This is where your project comes to life and the work of the project happens. The work
                    is authorized to begin and activities are performed. Resources are committed and carry out their
                    assigned activities to create the product or service of the project. Funds are spent to accomplish
                    project objectives. Performing project activities, training, selecting sellers, collecting project
                    data, utilizing resources, and so on are all integrated with or a part of this process.
                        Direct and Manage Project Execution is where the rubber meets the road. If you've done a
                    good job planning the project, things should go relatively smoothly for you during this process.
3601.book Page 307 Tuesday, July 12, 2005 11:17 PM




                                                                             Executing the Project Plan        307




             The deliverables and requirements are agreed to, the resources have been identified and are
             ready to go, and the stakeholders know exactly where you're headed because you had them
             review, agree to, and approve the project plan.
                 Some project managers think this is the time for them to kick back and put their feet up. After
             all, the project plan is done, everyone knows what to do and what's expected of them, and the
             work of the project should almost carry itself out because your project plan is a work of genius,
             right? Wrong! You must stay involved. Your job now is a matter of overseeing the actual work,
             staying on top of issues and problems, and keeping the work lined up with the project plan.



             Exam Spotlight

             The project plan serves as the project baseline. During the Executing processes, you should
             continually compare and monitor project performance against the baseline so that corrective
             actions can be taken and implemented at the right time to prevent disaster. This information
             will also be fed into the Monitoring and Controlling processes for further analysis.



                One of the most difficult aspects of this process is coordinating and integrating all the ele-
             ments of the project. While you do have the project plan as your guide, there are still a lot of
             balls in the air. You'll find yourself coordinating and monitoring many project elements--occa-
             sionally all at the same time--during the course of the Direct and Manage Project Execution
             process. You may be negotiating for team members at the same time you're negotiating with
             vendors at the same time you're working with another manager to get a project component
             completed so your deliverable stays on schedule. Risks and risk triggers should be monitored
             closely. The Plan Purchases and Acquisitions process may need intervention or cause you
             delays. The organizational, technical, and interpersonal interfaces may require intense coordi-
             nation and oversight. And of course, you should always be concerned about the pulse of your
             stakeholders. Are they actively involved in the project? Are they throwing up roadblocks now
             that the work has started?
                According to A Guide to the PMBOK, this process also requires implementing corrective actions
             to bring the work of the project back into alignment with the project plan, preventive actions to
             reduce the probability of negative consequences, and defect repairs to correct product defects dis-
             covered during the quality processes.
                As you can see, your work as project manager is not done yet. There are many elements to
             the project that require your attention, so let's get to work.


                                   Later in this chapter we'll also talk about Develop Project Team because this
                                   is an integral part of the Direct and Manage Project Execution process as well.
                                   You'll want to monitor the team's performance, the status of their work, and
                                   their interactions with you and other team members as you execute the
                                   project plan.

                    308         Chapter 8         Developing the Project Team




                    Executing Inputs
                    Direct and Manage Project Execution has seven inputs:
                          Project management plan
                          Approved corrective actions
                          Approved preventive actions
                          Approved change requests
                          Approved defect repair
                          Validated defect repair
                          Administrative closure procedure
                       The project management plan documents the collection of outputs of the Planning processes
                    and describes and defines how the project should be executed, monitored, controlled, and
                    closed. We'll take a brief look at each of the other inputs next.

                    Approved Corrective Actions
                    In my organization, a corrective action means an employee has big trouble coming. Fortunately,
                    this isn't what's meant here. Corrective actions are taken to get the anticipated future project
                    outcomes to align with the project plan. Maybe you've discovered that one of your program-
                    mers is adding an unplanned feature to the software project because he's friends with the user.
                    You'll have to redirect him to the activities assigned to him originally to avoid schedule delays.
                    Perhaps your vendor isn't able to deliver the laboratory equipment needed for the next project
                    phase. You'll want to exercise your contract options (hopefully there's a clause in the contract
                    that says they must provide rental equipment until they can deliver your order), put your con-
                    tingency plan into place, and get the lab the equipment that's needed to keep the project on
                    schedule.


                                           Corrective actions are outputs of processes in the Monitoring and Controlling
                                           process group, but they serve as inputs to the Direct and Manage Project Exe-
                                           cution process. We'll talk more about corrective actions in Chapter 10, "Moni-
                                           toring and Controlling Change."



                    Approved Preventive Action
                    Preventive action involves anything that will reduce the potential impacts of risk events should
                    they occur. Contingency plans and risk responses are examples of preventive action. These and
                    other risk responses are described in the Risk Response Planning process discussed in Chapter 5,
                    "Risk Planning." You should be aware of contingency plans and risk responses so that you're
                    ready to implement them at the first sign of trouble. Approved preventive actions are an output
                    of processes in the Monitoring and Controlling process group.
3601.book Page 309 Tuesday, July 12, 2005 11:17 PM




                                                                          Executing the Project Plan         309




             Approved Change Requests
             Approved change requests, another output of the Monitoring and Controlling process group,
             are changes that either expand or reduce project scope. Approved changes may also cause revi-
             sions to project budgets, schedules, procedures, project management plans, and so on. Change
             requests can be internal or external to the project or organization. For example, a new law that's
             passed that affects your project may require changes.

             Approved Defect Repairs
             Okay, it's your turn to figure it out: Defect repairs are an output of what process? Approved
             defect repairs authorize corrections to product defects that are discovered during the Perform
             Quality Assurance process (primarily during product inspection or during quality audits).
             Approved defect repairs are an output of the Integrated Change Control process.

             Validated Defect Repair
             The difference between a validated defect repair and a defect repair is that the validated defect
             repair is the result of a reinspection of the original defect repair. In other words, you found a
             problem with the product during the Quality processes, you corrected the problem (defect
             repair), and now you're reinspecting that repair (validated defect repair) to make certain the fix
             is accurate, correct, and fixed the problem.

             Administrative Closure Procedure
             The administrative closure procedure is a document that outlines how administrative closure
             will occur on the project, the activities needed to perform this procedure, and the essential roles
             and responsibilities.



             Exam Spotlight

             For the exam, remember that the outputs of the Executing and Monitoring and Controlling pro-
             cess groups are also inputs to each other.




             Tools and Techniques of Direct and Manage
             Project Execution
             The tools and techniques of the Direct and Manage Project Execution process are project man-
             agement methodology and project management information system. We've looked at both of
             these before. Remember that in the Executing processes, you'll be actively using both of these
             tools (employing the methodology you've developed in Planning and referring to the PMIS to
             update and track progress).

                    310         Chapter 8         Developing the Project Team




                                           A curious thing happens here. While A Guide to the PMBOK no longer lists
                                           work authorization systems as a tool and technique of the Direct and Manage
                                           Project Execution process, it's still listed in its glossary as a tool. That's curious
                                           because it's also part of the enterprise environmental factors input. Even
                                           though this isn't listed in A Guide to the PMBOK, I recommend understanding
                                           what a work authorization system is for the exam and how you use it. And for
                                           the record, you'll use these during the Executing processes.

                       Work authorization systems clarify and initiate the work of each work package or activity.
                    This is a formal procedure that authorizes work to begin in the correct sequence and at the right
                    time. Work authorization systems are usually written procedures defined by the organization.
                    They might include e-mail, intranet-based, or paper-based systems. Verbal instructions may
                    work well with small projects. Understand the complexity of the project and balance the cost
                    of instituting a work authorization system against the benefit you'll receive from it. This may
                    be overkill on small projects, and as stated earlier, verbal instructions might work just as well.
                       Work is usually authorized using a form that describes the task, the responsible party, antic-
                    ipated start and end dates, special instructions, and whatever else is particular to the activity or
                    project. Depending on the organizational structure, the work is assigned and authorized by
                    either the project manager or the functional manager.
                       Some of the outputs of this process are going to look familiar. Let's examine them next.


                    Outputs of Direct and Manage Project Execution
                    Most of the outputs of the Planning process group, and some of the outputs of the Monitoring
                    and Controlling process group, are utilized by the Direct and Manage Project Execution pro-
                    cess. The outputs of the Direct and Manage Project Execution process are as follows:
                          Deliverables
                          Requested changes
                          Implemented change requests
                          Implemented corrective actions
                          Implemented preventive actions
                          Implemented defect repairs
                          Work performance information
                       The two primary outputs are deliverables, meaning actually accomplishing the activities
                    leading to completion of the product or service you set out to produce, and work performance
                    information. Without having completed the prior processes, you wouldn't know what the work
                    of the project should look like.
                       The outputs starting with implemented were covered in the tools and techniques section. The
                    only difference between the tools and techniques and the output is that during the output, the

                                                                          Executing the Project Plan        311




             action or request is implemented. Because I haven't mentioned it in a while, now's a good time
             for a documentation reminder--it's not a bad idea to record all of the approved and imple-
             mented actions for future reference. Let's take a look at the other three outputs.

             Deliverables
             During Direct and Manage Project Execution, you'll gather and record information regarding
             the outcomes of the work, including activity completion dates, milestone completions, the sta-
             tus of the deliverables, the quality of the deliverables, costs, schedule progress and updates, and
             so on. Deliverables aren't always tangible. For example, perhaps your team members require
             training on a piece of specialized equipment. Completion of the training is recorded as a work
             result. Capabilities required to perform a service that's described in the project management
             plan are also considered a deliverable. All of this information gets used during the Performance
             Reporting process, which we'll discuss during the Monitoring and Controlling processes.
                Executing and Monitoring and Controlling are two process groups that work hand in hand.
             As you gather the information from work results, you'll measure the outputs and take corrective
             actions where necessary. This means you'll loop back through the Executing processes to put
             the corrections into place. A Guide to the PMBOK breaks these processes up for ease of expla-
             nation, but in practice, you'll work through several of the Executing and Monitoring and Con-
             trolling processes together.

             Requested Changes
             As a result of working through activities and producing your product or service, you will inev-
             itably come upon things that need to be changed. This might encompass schedule changes,
             scope changes, or requirements or resource changes. The list really could go on. Your job as
             project manager, if you choose to accept it, is to collect the change requests and make determi-
             nations about their impact to the project.
                We'll discuss change requests in the coming chapters. Requested changes are an output of
             several process, including the Direct and Manage Project Execution process and the Perfor-
             mance Reporting process in the Monitoring and Controlling process group. Remember that
             Executing and Monitoring and Controlling outputs feed each other as inputs.



             Exam Spotlight

             Direct and Manage Project Execution is where the work of the project is performed and the
             project plan is put into action and carried out. In this process, the project manager is like an
             orchestra conductor signaling the instruments to begin their activities, monitoring what should
             be winding down, and keeping that smile going to remind everyone that they should be enjoy-
             ing themselves. I recommend that you know the outputs of the Direct and Manage Project Exe-
             cution process for the exam.

                    312         Chapter 8         Developing the Project Team



                    Work Performance Information
                    Work performance information concerns gathering, documenting, and recording the status of
                    project activities. According to A Guide to the PMBOK, these are the types of information you
                    might gather during this process:
                          Schedule status and progress
                          Status of deliverable completion
                          Progress and status of schedule activities
                          Adherence to quality standards
                          Status of costs (those authorized and costs incurred to date)
                          Schedule activity completion estimates for those activities started
                          Schedule activities percent complete
                          Lessons learned
                          Resource consumption and utilization
                       Work performance information becomes an input to a few of the Monitoring and Control-
                    ling processes where you'll perform further analysis on the data. It's important that you docu-
                    ment this information so that when you get to the Monitoring and Controlling processes, you
                    don't have to backtrack.
                       We're going to switch topics now. I told you the Executing process group is about perform-
                    ing the work of the project, and in order to do that, we need resources. We'll look at two pro-
                    cesses, Acquire the Project Team and Develop the Project Team, in the next few sections.



                    Acquiring the Project Team
                    The Acquire Project Team process involves attaining and assigning human resources to the
                    project. Project staff may come from inside the company or from outside the company in the
                    form of full-time employees hired specifically for the project or as contract help. In any case, it's
                    your job as the project manager to ensure that resources are available and skilled in the project
                    activities they're assigned to. However, in practice you may find that you don't always have
                    control over the selection of team members. Someone else, the big boss for example, may hand-
                    pick the folks they want working on the project and it's up to you to assess their skills and decide
                    where they best fit on the project.
                       The Acquire Project Team process inputs are as follows: enterprise environmental factors,
                    organizational process assets, roles and responsibilities, project organization charts, and staff-
                    ing management plan.
                       Some project activities may require special skills or knowledge in order to be completed. The
                    enterprise environmental factors input involves taking this information into account as well
                    as considering personal interests, characteristics, and availability of potential team members
                    before making assignments. For example, consider the previous experience of the staff member
3601.book Page 313 Tuesday, July 12, 2005 11:17 PM




                                                                            Acquiring the Project Team            313




             you're thinking of assigning to a specific activity. Have they performed this function before? Do
             they have the experience necessary for the level of complexity this project activity calls for? Are they
             competent and proficient at these skills?
                Personal interests and personal characteristics play a big role as well. If the person you're
             thinking of just isn't interested in the project, they aren't likely to perform at their best. If you
             can, think about assigning someone else in a case like this. Unfortunately, some people just
             don't play well with others. When you're assigning staff, if at all possible, don't put the only
             two people in the whole company who can't get along together on the same project. If the staff
             member you need has a skill no one else has or they can perform a function like no one else
             can, you might not have a choice. In this case, you'll have to employ other techniques to keep
             the team cohesive and working well together despite the not-so-friendly characteristics of the
             vital team member.
                One final consideration: Check on the availability of key team members. If the team member
             you must have for the activity scheduled in February is on their honeymoon, you probably
             aren't going to win the toss.



             Exam Spotlight

             Even though the availability, experience levels, interests, cost, and abilities of your resources
             are considered part of the enterprise environmental factors input, you should understand these
             inputs and their importance to the Acquire Project Team process for the exam.



                Recruitment practices are an example of the organizational process assets to watch for in this
             process. This is a matter of making certain you consult any organizational procedures or poli-
             cies currently in place when hiring and assigning staff. Organizational policies that dictate
             recruitment practices are constraints.
                We've looked at the other inputs in previous processes, so we'll move on to the tools and
             techniques of this process.


             Tools and Techniques of Acquire Project Team
             Preassignment, negotiation, acquisitions, and virtual teams are tools and techniques of the
             Acquire Project Team process. As the project manager, you will use the negotiation technique
             a lot. You'll have to negotiate with functional managers and other organizational department
             managers--and sometimes with the vendor to get some of their best people--for resources for
             your project and for the timing of those resources.
                Preassignment can happen when the project is put out for bid and specific team members are
             promised as part of the proposal or when internal project team members are promised and
             assigned as a condition of the project. When staff members are promised as part of the project
             proposal--particularly on internal projects--they should be identified in the project charter.

                    314         Chapter 8         Developing the Project Team



                        Availability is one part of the negotiating equation. You'll have to work with the functional
                    manager or other project managers to ensure that the staff member you're requesting is avail-
                    able when the schedule says they're needed.
                        The second part of the equation is the competency level of the staff member they're assigning
                    to your project. I remember hearing someone say once that availability is not a skill set. Be wary
                    of functional managers who are willing to offer up certain individuals "anytime" while others
                    are "never available." Be certain your negotiations include discussions about the skills and per-
                    sonal characteristics of the team members you're asking for.
                        Acquisition is another tool and technique of the Acquire Project Team process. It involves
                    hiring individuals or teams of people for certain project activities, either as full-time employees
                    or as contract help during the course of the project or project phase or for specific project activ-
                    ities. Procurement is usually required when the organization does not have employees with the
                    required skills and competencies available to work on the project.


                                           Chapter 6, "Resource Planning," covers the Plan Purchases and Acquisitions
                                           process in more detail.

                       Virtual teams are teams that don't necessarily work in the same location but all share the goals
                    of the project and have a role on the project. This type of team allows you to include folks from
                    different geographic locations, those who work different hours or shifts than the other team mem-
                    bers, those with mobility limitations, and so on. According to A Guide to the PMBOK, "Virtual
                    teams can be defined as groups of people with a shared goal, who fulfill their roles with little or
                    no time spent meeting face to face." In today's wonderful world of technology, team members can
                    use the Internet, e-mail, videoconferencing, and teleconferencing to meet and communicate on a
                    regular basis. This of course brings to light the importance of communication. Make certain all
                    team members are aware of the protocols for communicating in a virtual team environment,
                    understand the expectations, and are clear regarding decision making processes. It's vital in this
                    type of team structure that you as the project manager give credit to the appropriate team mem-
                    bers for their performance and actions on the project.


                    Outputs of Acquire Project Team
                    The resulting outputs of the Acquire Project Team process are project staff assignment, resource
                    availability, and staffing management plan updates.
                        Your ability to influence the selection of resources (using the negotiating technique) will
                    impact the project staff assignment output. After determining elements like the roles and
                    responsibilities, reviewing recruitment practices, and negotiating for staff, you assign project
                    team members to project activities. Along with this output, a project team directory is published
                    listing the names of all project team members and stakeholders. Don't forget to also include
                    team member names in project organization charts, RAM charts, and other planning docu-
                    ments if their assignments or names weren't known when you created those documents.

                                                                       Developing the Project Team           315




             The Only Candidate

             "Hey, did you hear?" your friend Story asks. "Roger has been assigned to the project team."

             "Over my dead body," you reply, pushing away from your computer screen. You head straight
             for the project manager's office and don't wait for a response from Story.

             Ann seats the phone into the cradle just as you walk through the door. Fortunately for you,
             Ann's door is always open and she welcomes drop-ins.

             "Seems like something is on your mind," Ann says. "What can I help with?"

             "Story just told me that Roger has been assigned to the project team. I can't work with Roger.
             He's arrogant and doesn't respect anyone's work but his own. He belittles me in front of others,
             and I don't deserve that. I write good code copy, and I don't need Roger looking over my shoul-
             der. I want to be on this team, but not if Roger is part of it."

             Ann thinks for a minute and replies, "I want you to have the opportunity to work on this project;
             it's a great opportunity for you. But there isn't anyone else who can work on the analysis phase
             of this project except Roger. He's the only one left who has a solid understanding of the main-
             frame legacy code. Unfortunately, those old programs were never documented well, and
             they've evolved over the years into programs on top of programs. Without Roger's knowledge
             of the existing system, we'd blow the budget and time estimates already established for this
             project. What would you say to a meeting with you and Roger and me to talk about these issues
             and see if we can't work this out?"



                The time periods your project staff are available are documented in the resource availability
             output. This document comes in handy when you're creating the final schedule and assigning
             resources to activities.
                The staffing management plan may require updates to document the project roles and
             responsibilities of the staff assigned to the project. This document may require updates through-
             out the project if you have staff members leave due to promotion or, heaven forbid, if they leave
             for employment in another company (unless you want them to leave--that's another story).
                Now we have the team, what do we do with them? We'll look at topics like motivation,
             rewards, and recognition in the next process, Develop Project Team.



             Developing the Project Team
             Projects exist to create a unique product or service within a limited time frame. Projects are per-
             formed by people, and most projects require more than one person to perform all of the activities.
3601.book Page 316 Tuesday, July 12, 2005 11:17 PM




                    316         Chapter 8         Developing the Project Team



                    If you've got more than one person working on your project, you've got a team. And if you've got
                    a team, you've got a wide assortment of personalities, skills, needs, and issues in the mix. Couple
                    this with part-time team members, teams based in functional organizations whose loyalty lies with
                    the functional manager, or teams based in matrix organizations that report to you for project-
                    related activities and another manager for their functional duties and you could have some real
                    challenges on your hands. Good luck--okay, I won't leave you hanging like that.
                        The Develop Project Team process is about creating an open, encouraging environment for
                    your team and developing it into an effective, functioning, coordinated group. Projects are per-
                    formed by individuals, and the better they work together, the smoother and the more efficient
                    the execution of the project will be. I'm sure you all have had the experience of working with
                    a team that pitched in and shared workloads when the work became unbalanced. I'm also sure
                    you all have worked with teams that didn't do this, teams whose members took on a "me first"
                    attitude and could care less about the plight of their fellow team members. I'd much rather work
                    with a team like the first example.


                                           Proper development of the team is critical to a successful project. Since teams are
                                           made up of individuals, individual development becomes a critical factor to project
                                           success. Individual team members need the proper development and training to
                                           perform the activities of the project or to enhance their existing knowledge and
                                           skills. The development needed will depend on the project. Perhaps you have a
                                           team member who's ready to make the jump into a lead role but they don't have
                                           any experience at lead work. Give them some exposure by assigning them a lim-
                                           ited amount of activities in a lead capacity, provide them with some training if
                                           needed, and be available to coach and mentor where needed. The best option is to
                                           work with the management team to provide this person with the development
                                           they need prior to the start of the project (if you're lucky enough to know that early
                                           on who your resources might be and what their existing skills are).

                      Develop Project Team inputs include project staff assignments, staffing management plan,
                    and resource availability. Funny thing, these inputs are all outputs that we discussed in the
                    Acquire Project Team process, so we'll move on.


                    Tools and Techniques for Develop Project Team
                    The tools and techniques of Develop Project Team are as follows:
                           General management skills
                           Training
                           Team building activities
                           Ground rules
                           Collocation
                           Recognition and rewards
                          We'll cover all these tools and techniques next.

             General Management Skills
             You learned about general management skills back in Chapter 1, "What Is a Project?" These
             include skills like general business knowledge, budgeting, organizational skills, problem solving
             skills, and so on. What's important to note here is that the general management skills of lead-
             ership, influence negotiation, communications, empathy, and creativity are especially useful
             during this process and others in the Executing process group.
                One other thing to consider regarding this tool and technique is that you'll have resources
             from other departments who have assignments on the project that you're responsible for over-
             seeing. For example, the finance department and the marketing department may have assigned
             project activities, and as the project manager, you'll manage their progress. This implies that
             you'll need general knowledge management skills to understand what the assignments entail
             and strong leadership skills to influence the departments to stay on schedule.

             Training
             Training is a matter of assessing your team's skills and abilities, assessing the project needs, and
             providing the training necessary for the team members to carry out their assigned activities.
             Training can sometimes be a reward as well. In the software industry, programmers seek out
             positions that offer training on the latest and greatest technologies, and they consider it a benefit
             or bonus to attend training on the company dollar and time. If you know early in the Planning
             processes that training is necessary, include the details of this in the staffing management plan.
             During the course of the project, you might observe team members that need training or they
             may ask for training. Update the staffing management plan with this information.

             Team-Building Activities
             Many times, project teams are made up of folks who don't know each other. They aren't neces-
             sarily aware of the project objectives and may not even want to be a part of the team. The project
             manager may not have worked with the people assigned to the project team before either. Sound
             like a recipe for disaster? It's not. Thousands of projects are started with team members and
             project managers who don't know each other and come to a successful completion. How is that
             done? It's a result of the project manager's team-building and communication skills.
                The project manager's job is to bring the team together, get its members all headed in the
             right direction, and provide motivation, reward, and recognition to keep the team in tip-top
             shape. This is done using a variety of team-building techniques and exercises. Team building is
             simply getting a diverse group of people to work together in the most efficient and effective
             manner possible. This may involve management events as well as individual actions designed to
             improve team performance. There are entire volumes on this subject, and it's beyond the scope
             of this book to go into all the team-building possibilities. The exam tends to focus more on the
             theories behind team building and the characteristics of effective teams, so that's what we'll
             spend our time looking at.
                All newly formed teams go through four stages of development:
                  Forming
                  Storming

                    318         Chapter 8         Developing the Project Team



                          Norming
                          Performing
                      You've probably seen this elsewhere, but since these stages may show up on the exam, you'll
                    want to memorize them. Let's take a brief look at each of them.
                    Forming This one's easy. Forming is the beginning stage of team formation, when all the mem-
                    bers are brought together, introduced, and told the objectives of the project. This is where team
                    members learn why they're working together. During this stage, team members tend to be for-
                    mal and reserved and take on an "all-business" approach.
                    Storming Storming is where the action begins. Team members become confrontational with
                    each other as they're vying for position and control during this stage. They're working through
                    who is going to be the top dog and jockeying for status.
                    Norming Now things begin to calm down. Team members know each other fairly well by
                    now. They're comfortable with their positions in the team, and they begin to deal with project
                    problems instead of people problems. In the norming stage, they confront the project concerns
                    and problems instead of each other. Decisions are made jointly at this stage, and team members
                    exhibit affection and familiarity with one another.
                    Performing Ahh, perfection. Well, almost, anyway. This is where great teams end up. This
                    stage is where the team is productive and effective. The level of trust among team members is
                    high, and great things are achieved. This is the mature development stage.



                    Exam Spotlight

                    Different teams progress through the stages of development at different rates. When new
                    team members are brought onto the team, the development stages start all over again. It
                    doesn't matter where the team is in the forming process--a new member will start the cycle
                    all over again.



                      Let's take a closer look at focusing your team members throughout these stages of develop-
                    ment, along with some of the characteristics of effective teams.

                    Team Focus
                    Have you ever watched any of those old pirate movies on late-night TV? Remember the scenes
                    where the captain goes down into the bowels of the ship to check on the teams of rowers? He
                    scrutinizes the crew and literally whips the rowers who aren't pulling their weight into shape.
                    I don't recommend this as a team-building technique, but imagine for a minute that your project
                    team members are like those rowing teams. If the members on the left are rowing one way and
                    the members on the right are rowing another, you're creating a lot of energy and looking very
                    busy, but in the end you aren't making any progress.
3601.book Page 319 Tuesday, July 12, 2005 11:17 PM




                                                                       Developing the Project Team          319




                 It's paramount that the team members know and understand the goals and objectives of the
             project. They should all understand the direction you're headed and work toward that end.
             After all, that's the reason they've been brought together in the first place. Keep in mind that
             people see and hear things from their own perspective. A room full of people attending a speech
             will each come away with something a little different because what was said speaks to their par-
             ticular situation in life at the time. In other words, their own perceptions filter what they hear.
             It's your job as project manager to make certain the team members understand the project goals
             and their own assignments correctly. The whip was effective for the captain in the old movies,
             but I suggest you use solid communication skills to get your point across. Ask your team mem-
             bers to tell you in their own words what they believe the project goals are. This is a great way
             to know if you've got everyone on board and a great opportunity for you to clarify any misun-
             derstandings regarding the project goals.

             Effective Team Characteristics
             Effective teams are typically very energetic teams. Their enthusiasm is contagious, and it feeds
             on itself. They generate a lot of creativity and become good problem solvers. Teams like this are
             every project manager's dream. Investing yourself in team building as well as relationship build-
             ing--especially when you don't think you have the time to do so--will bring many benefits.
             Here's a sample of the benefits:
                  Better conflict resolution
                  Commitment to the project
                  Commitment to the project team members and project manager
                  High job satisfaction
                  Enhanced communication
                  A sense of belonging and purpose
                  A successful project
                 Dysfunctional teams will typically produce the opposite results of the benefits just listed.
             Dysfunctional teams don't just happen by themselves any more than great teams do. Sure, some-
             times you're lucky enough to get the right combination of folks together right off the bat. But
             usually, team building takes work and dedication on the part of the project manager. Even in
             the situations where you do get that dynamite combination of people, they will benefit from
             team-building exercises and feedback.
                 Unfortunately, sour attitudes are just as contagious as enthusiasm. Watch for these symp-
             toms among your team members and take action to correct the situation before the entire team
             is affected:
                  Lack of motivation or "don't care" attitudes
                  Project work that isn't satisfying
                  Status meetings that turn into whining sessions
                  Poor communication
                  Lack of respect and lack of trust for the project manager

                    320         Chapter 8         Developing the Project Team




                                           No amount of team building will make up for poor project planning or ineffec-
                                           tive project management techniques. Neglecting these things and fooling
                                           yourself into thinking that your project team is good enough to make up for the
                                           poor planning or poor techniques could spell doom for your project. And
                                           besides that, it's not fair to your project team to put them in that position.



                    Ground Rules
                    Ground rules are the expectations you as the project manager set describing acceptable behavior
                    from the team. For example, one of my pet peeves is team members who interrupt each other.
                    In this case, one of the ground rules is one person speaks at a time during a meeting. Another
                    ground rule might be reporting potential issues as soon as the team member becomes aware of
                    them. Outlining ground rules like this helps the team understand your expectations and
                    increases productivity.

                    Collocation
                    Team members are often in the same physical location--for example, the same office building or
                    office complex. This tool and technique is called collocation. Collocation enables teams to func-
                    tion more effectively than if they're spread out among different localities. Many times on large
                    projects, the project manager will make provisions in the project budget to bring the team together
                    at the same location. (It's difficult, but not impossible, to manage project team members who are
                    not physically located together.) One way to achieve collocation might be to set aside a common
                    meeting room, sometimes called a war room, for team members who are located in different build-
                    ings or across town to meet and exchange information.
                        Multiple locations can also be a big time waster for you as the project manager and for your
                    team members. If some team members are located in one part of town and another set of team
                    members are located across town, you'll find yourself in the car (or the bus) driving back and
                    forth to make face-to-face contact and get status updates. Conducting team meetings also
                    becomes a hassle as one set of team members or the other must drive to another location (or
                    both to a central location) to have a meeting.
                        There is a lot of value in face-to-face contact with your team members and stakeholders. I'm
                    a huge e-mail fan--it's one of my favorite forms of communication--but e-mail cannot reveal
                    tone of voice, facial expressions, and body language. Whenever possible, practice the technique
                    of collocation and get your team together.


                                           In reality, it's often difficult to get your team together physically. A good solu-
                                           tion in lieu of having people relocate is conference calling. Team members
                                           scattered across the country all have access to the telephone and it's relatively
                                           easy to find a time everyone can meet over the phone.

                                                                       Developing the Project Team           321




             Recognition and Rewards
             We have quite a bit of ground to cover with recognition and rewards. As I said earlier, there
             could be several exam questions regarding team building, so dig out all your favorite memori-
             zation techniques and put them to use.
                 Team building starts with project planning and doesn't stop until the project is completed.
             It involves employing techniques to improve your team's performance and keeping team mem-
             bers motivated. Motivation helps people work more efficiently and produce better results. If
             clear expectations, clear procedures, and the right motivational tools are used, project teams
             will excel.
                 Motivation can be extrinsic or intrinsic. Extrinsic motivators are material rewards and might
             include bonuses, the use of a company car, stock options, gift certificates, training opportuni-
             ties, extra time off, and so on.
                 Intrinsic motivators are specific to the individual. Some people are just naturally driven to
             achieve--it's part of their nature. (I suspect this is a motivator for you since you're reading this
             book.) Cultural and religious influences are forms of intrinsic motivators as well. Reward and
             recognition--a tool and technique of the Develop Project Team process--are examples of
             extrinsic motivators. We'll look at them next.
                 Recognition and rewards are an important part of team motivation. They are formal ways
             of recognizing and promoting desirable behavior and are most effective when carried out by the
             management team and the project manager.
                 Recognition and rewards should be proportional to the achievement. In other words, appro-
             priately link the reward to the performance. For example, a project manager who has respon-
             sibility for the project budget and the procurement process and keeps the costs in line with the
             budget should get rewarded for this achievement. However, if these functions are assigned to a
             functional manager in the organization, it wouldn't be appropriate to reward the project man-
             ager because they were not the one responsible for keeping the costs in line.
                 Team members should be rewarded for going above and beyond the call of duty. Perhaps
             they put in a significant amount of overtime to meet a project goal or spent nights round-the-
             clock babysitting ill-performing equipment. These types of behaviors should get rewarded and
             formally recognized by the project manager and the management team. On the other hand, if
             the ill-performing equipment was a direct result of mistakes made or if it happened because of
             poor planning, rewards would not be appropriate, obviously.
                 Consider individual preferences and cultural differences when using rewards and recogni-
             tions. Some people don't like to be recognized in front of a group; others thrive on it. Some
             people appreciate an honest thank-you with minimal fanfare, and others just won't accept
             individual rewards as their culture doesn't allow it. Keep this in mind when devising your
             reward system.
                 There are many theories on motivation. As a project manager, it's important to understand
             them so that you can tailor your recognition and rewards programs to take into account the rea-
             sons people do what they do. You may encounter questions on these theories on the exam, so
             I'll discuss their primary points in the following sections.

                    322         Chapter 8         Developing the Project Team




                    Baker's Gift Baskets

                    You're a contract project manager for Baker's Gift Baskets. This company assembles gift bas-
                    kets of all styles and shapes with every edible treat imaginable. The company has recently
                    experienced explosive growth, and you've been brought on board to manage its new project.
                    The owners of the company want to offer "pick-your-own" baskets that allow customers to pick
                    the individual items they want included in the basket. In addition, they're introducing a new line
                    of containers to choose from, including things like miniature golf bags, flowerpots, serving
                    bowls, and the like. This means changes to the catalog and the website to accommodate the
                    new offerings.

                    The deadline for this project is the driving constraint. The website changes won't cause any
                    problems with the deadline. However, the catalog must go to press quickly to meet holiday
                    mailing deadlines, which in turn are driving the project deadline.

                    Your team members put their heads together and came up with an ingenious plan to meet the
                    catalog deadline. It required lots of overtime and some weekend work on their part to pull it off,
                    but they met the date.

                    You decide this is a perfect opportunity to recognize and reward the team for their outstanding
                    efforts. You've arranged a slot on the agenda at the next all-company meeting to bring your
                    team up front and praise them for their cooperation and efforts to get the catalog to the printers
                    on time. You'll also present each of them with two days of paid time off and a gift certificate for
                    a dinner with their family at an exclusive restaurant in the city.



                    Motivational Theories
                    Motivational theories came about during the modern age. Prior to today's information and ser-
                    vice type jobs and yesterday's factory work, the majority of people worked the land and barely
                    kept enough food on the table to feed their family. No one was concerned about motivation at
                    work. You worked because you wouldn't have anything to eat if you didn't. Fortunately, that
                    isn't the case today.
                       Today we have a new set of problems in the workplace. Workers in the service and knowledge-
                    based industries aren't concerned with starvation--that need has been replaced with other needs
                    like job satisfaction, a sense of belonging and commitment to the project, good working condi-
                    tions, and so on. Motivational theories present ideas on why people act the way they do, and how
                    we can influence them to act in certain ways to get the results we want. Again, there are libraries
                    full of books on this topic. We'll cover four of them here.
                    MASLOW'S HIERARCHY OF NEEDS
                    You have probably seen this classic example of motivational theory. Abraham Maslow hypoth-
                    esized that humans have five basic needs arranged in hierarchical order. The first needs are
3601.book Page 323 Tuesday, July 12, 2005 11:17 PM




                                                                         Developing the Project Team            323




             physical needs, like the need for food, clothing, and shelter. The idea is that these needs must
             be met before the person can move to the next level of needs in the hierarchy, which includes
             safety and security needs. Here, the concern is for the person's physical welfare and the security
             of their belongings. Once that need is met, they progress to the next level, and so on.
                Maslow's hierarchy of needs theory suggests that once a lower-level need has been met, it no
             longer serves as a motivator and the next higher level becomes the driving motivator in a per-
             son's life. Maslow conjectures that humans are always in one state of need or another. Here is
             a recap of each of the needs, starting with the highest level and ending with the lowest:
             Self-actualization Performing at your peak potential
             Self-esteem needs Accomplishment, respect for self, capability
             Social needs A sense of belonging, love, acceptance, friendship
             Safety and security needs Your physical welfare and the security of your belongings
             Basic physical needs Food, clothing, shelter
                The highest level of motivation in this theory is the state of self-actualization. The United States
             Army had a slogan a few years ago that I think encapsulates self-actualization very well: "Be all
             that you can be." When all the physical, safety, social, and self-esteem needs have been met, a per-
             son reaches a state of independence where they're able to express themselves and perform at their
             peak. They'll do good work just for the sake of doing good work. Recognition and self-esteem is
             the motivator at lower levels; now the need for being the best they can be is reached.
             HYGIENE THEORY
             Frederick Herzberg came up with the Hygiene Theory, also known as the Motivation-Hygiene
             Theory. He postulates that there are two factors that contribute to motivation: hygiene factors
             and motivators. Hygiene factors deal with work environment issues. The thing to remember about
             hygiene factors is that they prevent dissatisfaction. Examples of hygiene factors are pay, benefits,
             the conditions of the work environment, and relationships with peers and managers. Pay is con-
             sidered a hygiene factor because Herzberg believed that over the long term, pay is not a motivator.
             Being paid for the work prevents dissatisfaction but doesn't necessarily bring satisfaction in and
             of itself. He believed this to be true as long as the pay system is equitable. If two workers perform-
             ing the same functions have large disparities in pay, then pay can become a motivator.
                 Motivators deal with the substance of the work itself and the satisfaction one derives from
             performing the functions of the job. Motivators lead to satisfaction. The ability to advance, the
             opportunity to learn new skills, and the challenges involved in the work are all motivators
             according to Herzberg.



             Exam Spotlight

             For the exam, remember that Herzberg was the inventor of the Hygiene Theory and that this
             theory claims that hygiene factors prevent dissatisfaction while motivators lead to satisfaction.

                    324         Chapter 8         Developing the Project Team



                    EXPECTANCY THEORY
                    The Expectancy Theory says that the expectation of a positive outcome drives motivation. Peo-
                    ple will behave in certain ways if they think there will be good rewards for doing so. Also note
                    that this theory says the strength of the expectancy drives the behavior. This means the expec-
                    tation or likelihood of the reward is linked to the behavior. For example, if you tell your two-
                    year-old to put the toys back in the toy box and you'll give her a cookie, chances are she'll put
                    the toys away. This is a reasonable reward for a reasonable action. However, if you promise
                    your project team members vacations in Hawaii if they get the project done early and they know
                    there is no way you can deliver that reward, there is little motivation to work toward it.
                       This theory also says that people become what you expect of them. If you openly praise your
                    project team members and treat them like valuable contributors, you'll likely have a high-
                    performing team on your hands. Conversely, when you publicly criticize people or let them
                    know that you have low expectations regarding their performance, they'll likely live up (or
                    down as the case may be) to that expectation as well.
                    ACHIEVEMENT THEORY
                    Achievement Theory says that people are motivated by the need for three things: achievement,
                    power, and affiliation. The achievement motivation is obviously the need to achieve or succeed.
                    The power motivation involves a desire for influencing the behavior of others. And the need for
                    affiliation is relationship oriented. Workers want to have friendships with their coworkers and
                    a sense of camaraderie with their fellow team members. The strength of your team members'
                    desire for each of these will drive their performance on various activities.

                       We'll cover two more theories in the leadership section, which is next. These deal specifically
                    with how leaders interact with their project team members.

                    Leadership versus Management
                    Chapter 1 talked about leaders versus managers. There's a bit more information to add here
                    regarding leadership theories and the types of power leaders possess. Let's recap leadership and
                    management first before we talk about those theories.
                       Recall that leadership is about imparting vision and rallying people around that vision. Lead-
                    ers motivate and inspire and are concerned with strategic vision. Leaders have a knack for get-
                    ting others to do what needs done.
                       Two of the techniques they use to do this are power and politics. Power is the ability to get
                    people to do what they wouldn't do ordinarily. It's also the ability to influence behavior. Politics
                    imparts pressure to conform regardless of whether people agree with the decision. Leaders
                    understand the difference between power and politics and when to employ each technique.
                    We'll talk more about power shortly.
3601.book Page 325 Tuesday, July 12, 2005 11:17 PM




                                                                          Developing the Project Team          325




                Good leaders have committed team members who believe in the vision of the leader. Leaders
             set direction and time frames and have the ability to attract good talent to work for them. Lead-
             ers inspire a vision and get things done through others by earning loyalty, respect, and cooper-
             ation from team members. They set the course and lead the way. Good leaders are directive in
             their approach but allow for plenty of feedback and input. Good leaders commonly have strong
             interpersonal skills and are well respected.
                Managers are generally task oriented and concerned with things like plans, controls, bud-
             gets, policies, and procedures. They're generalists with a broad base of planning and organiza-
             tional skills, and their primary goal is satisfying stakeholder needs. They also possess
             motivational skills and the ability to recognize and reward behavior.


                                   Project managers need to use the traits of both leaders and managers at differ-
                                   ent times during a project. On very large projects, a project manager will act
                                   more like a leader inspiring the sub-project managers to get on board with the
                                   objectives. On small projects, project managers will act more like managers
                                   because they're responsible for all the planning and coordinating functions.

                There are three theories that we'll discuss regarding leadership and management. They are
             Douglas McGregor's Theory X and Theory Y and the Contingency Theory. Then we'll end
             this section with a discussion of the types of power leaders use and the outputs of Develop
             Project Team.
             THEORY X AND THEORY Y
             Douglas McGregor defined two models of worker behavior, Theory X and Theory Y, that
             attempt to explain how different managers deal with their team members. Theory X managers
             believe most people do not like work and will try to steer clear of it; they believe people have
             little to no ambition, need constant supervision, and won't actually perform the duties of their
             job unless threatened. As a result, Theory X managers are like dictators and impose very rigid
             controls over their people. They believe people are motivated only by punishment, money, or
             position. Unfortunately for the team members, Theory X managers unknowingly also subscribe
             to the Expectancy Theory. If they expect people to be lazy and unproductive and treat them as
             such, their team members probably will be lazy and unproductive.
                 Theory Y managers believe people are interested in performing their best given the right
             motivation and proper expectations. These managers provide support to their teams, are con-
             cerned about their team members, and are good listeners. Theory Y managers believe people are
             creative and committed to the project goals, that they like responsibility and seek it out, and that
             they are able to perform the functions of their positions with limited supervision.
             CONTINGENCY THEORY
             The Contingency Theory builds on a combination of Theory Y behaviors and the Hygiene
             Theory. The Contingency Theory, in a nutshell, says that people are motivated to achieve
             levels of competency and will continue to be motivated by this need even after competency
             is reached.

                    326         Chapter 8         Developing the Project Team



                    The Power of Leaders
                    As stated earlier, power is the ability to influence others to do what you want them to do. This
                    can be used in a positive manner or a negative one. But that old saying of your grandmother's
                    about attracting more flies with honey than vinegar still holds true today.
                       Leaders, managers, and project managers use power to convince others to do things a specific
                    way. The kind of power they use to accomplish this depends on their personality, their personal
                    values, and the company culture.
                       There are several forms of power that a project manager might use. We've already talked
                    about reward power, which is the ability to grant bonuses or incentive awards for a job well
                    done. Let's look at a few more:
                    Punishment power Punishment, also known as coercive or penalty power, is just the opposite
                    of reward power. The employee is threatened with consequences if expectations are not met.
                    Expert power Expert power occurs when the person being influenced believes the manager, or
                    the person doing the influencing, is knowledgeable about the subject or has special abilities that
                    make them an expert. The person goes along just because they think the influencer knows what
                    they're doing and it's the best thing for the situation.
                    Legitimate power Legitimate, or formal, power comes about as a result of the influencer's
                    position. Because that person is the project manager, or executive vice president, or CEO, they
                    have the power to call the shots and make decisions.
                    Referent power Referent power is inferred to the influencer by their subordinates. Project
                    team members who have a great deal of respect and high regard for their project managers will-
                    ingly go along with decisions made by the project manager because of referent power.
                      Punishment power should be used as a last resort. There are times when you'll have to use this
                    method, but hopefully much less often than the other three forms of power. Sometimes, you'll
                    have team members who won't live up to expectations and their performance suffers as a result.
                    This is a case where punishment power is enacted to get the employee to correct their behavior.

                    Outputs of Develop Project Team
                    We're now ready to close out the Develop Project Team process. There is only one output of this pro-
                    cess: team performance assessment. As a result of positive team-building experiences, you'll see indi-
                    viduals improving their skills, team behaviors and relationships improving, conflict resolutions
                    going smoothly, and team members recommending ways to improve the work of the project. We
                    talked about effective team characteristics in an earlier section of this chapter. Assessing these char-
                    acteristics will help you determine where (or if) the project team needs improvements.

                                   Project managers wear a lot of hats. This is one of the things that make this job
                                   so interesting. You need organization and planning skills to plan the project. You
                                   need motivation and sometimes disciplinary skills to execute the project plans.
                                   You need to exercise leadership and power where appropriate. And all the while,
                                   you have a host of relationships to manage, involving team members, stakehold-
                                   ers, managers, and customers. It's a great job and brings terrific satisfaction.




             Distributing Project Information
             The Information Distribution process is concerned with getting stakeholders information about the
             project in a timely manner. This can come about in several ways: status reports, project meetings,
             review meetings, and so on. Status reports are actually a part of the work performance information
             we saw in the output of the Direct and Manage Project Execution process. Status reports inform
             stakeholders about where the project is today in regard to project schedule and budget, for example.
             They also describe what the project team has accomplished to date. This might include milestones
             completed to date, the percentage of schedule completion, and what remains to be completed. The
             Information Distribution process describes how this report is distributed and to whom.
                In the Information Distribution process, the communications management plan that was
             defined during the Communications Planning process is put into action and it's the only input
             to this process. Communication and Information Distribution work together to report the
             progress of the project team.
                There are several tools and techniques of Information Distribution and we'll look at each of
             them next.


             Information Distribution Tools and Techniques
             The tools and techniques of this process are as follows:
                  Communication skills
                  Information gathering and retrieval systems
                  Information distribution methods
                  Lessons learned process
               Communication skills are probably the single most important skill in your project manage-
             ment toolbox. We'll start with this tool and technique.

             Developing Great Communication Skills
             Every aspect of your job as a project manager will involve communications. It's been estimated
             that project managers spend as much as 90 percent of their time communicating in one form or
             another. Therefore, communication skills are arguably one of the most important skills a

                    328         Chapter 8         Developing the Project Team



                    project manager can have. They are even more important than technical skills. Good commu-
                    nication skills foster an open, trusting environment. The ability to communicate well is a project
                    manager's best asset.



                    Exam Spotlight

                    According to A Guide to the PMBOK, communications skills are not the same as project man-
                    agement communications. They're related, but not the same thing.



                       Chapter 1 talked about how important good communication skills are. This section discusses
                    the act of communication, listening behaviors, and conflict resolution. You'll employ each of
                    these techniques with your project team, stakeholders, customers, and management team.

                    Information Exchange
                    Communication is the process of exchanging information. There are three elements to all
                    communication:
                    Sender The sender is the person responsible for putting the information together in a clear and con-
                    cise manner. The information should be complete and presented in a way that the receiver will be able
                    to correctly understand it. Make your messages relevant to the receiver. Junk mail is annoying, and
                    information that doesn't pertain in any way whatsoever to the receiver is nothing more than that.
                    Message The message is the information being sent and received. It might be written, verbal,
                    nonverbal, formal, informal, internal, external, horizontal, or vertical. Horizontal communica-
                    tions are messages sent and received to peers. Vertical communications are messages sent and
                    received down to subordinates and up to executive management.


                                           Make your messages as simple as you can to get your point across. Don't compli-
                                           cate the message with unnecessary detail and technical jargon that others may not
                                           understand. A simple trick that helps clarify your messages, especially verbal mes-
                                           sages, is to repeat the key information periodically. Public speakers are taught that
                                           the best way to organize a speech is to first tell the audience what you're going to
                                           tell them; second, tell them; and third, tell them what you just told them.


                    Receiver The receiver is the person the message is intended for. They are responsible for under-
                    standing the information correctly and making sure they've received all of the information.
                    Keep in mind that receivers filter the information they receive through their knowledge of the
                    subject, culture influences, language, emotions, attitudes, and geographic locations. The sender
                    should take these filters into consideration when sending messages so that the receiver will
                    clearly understand the message that was sent.

                                   This book is an example of the sender-message-receiver model. I'm the sender
                                   of the information. The message concerns topics you need to know to pass the
                                   PMP exam (and if I've done my job correctly, is written in a clear and easily
                                   understood format). You, the reader, are the receiver.


             METHODS OF INFORMATION EXCHANGE
             Senders, receivers, and messages are the elements of communication. The way the sender pack-
             ages or encodes the information and transmits it and the way the receiver unpacks or decodes
             the message are the methods of communication exchange.
                Senders encode messages. Encoding is a method of putting the information into a format the
             receiver will understand. Language, pictures, and symbols are used to encode messages. Encod-
             ing formats the message for transmitting.
                Transmitting is the way the information gets from the sender to the receiver. Spoken words,
             written documentation, memos, e-mail, voicemail, and so on are all transmitting methods.
                Decoding is what the receiver does with the information when they get it. They convert it into
             an understandable format. Usually, this means they read the memo, listen to the speaker, read
             the book, and so on.
             FORMS OF COMMUNICATION
             Communication occurs primarily in written or verbal form. Granted, you can point to some-
             thing or indicate what you need with motions, but usually you use the spoken or written word
             to get your message across.
                Verbal communication is easier and less complicated than written communication, and it's
             usually a fast method of communication. Written communication, on the other hand, is an
             excellent way to get across complex, detailed messages. Detailed instructions are better pro-
             vided in written form because it gives the reader the ability to go back over information they're
             not quite sure about.
                Both verbal and written communications might take a formal or an informal approach.
             Speeches or lectures are an example of formal verbal communications. Most project status
             meetings take more of a formal approach, as do most written project status reports. Generally
             speaking, the project manager should take an informal approach when communicating with
             stakeholders and project team members outside of the status meetings. This makes you appear
             more open and friendly and easier to approach with questions and issues.

             Effective Listening Skills
             What did you say? Often we think we're listening when we really aren't. In all fairness, we can
             take in only so much information at one time. But it's important to perform active listening
             when someone else is speaking. As a project manager, you will spend the majority of your time
             communicating with team members, stakeholders, customers, vendors, and others. This means
             you should be as good a listener as you are a communicator.

                    330         Chapter 8         Developing the Project Team



                       There are several techniques you can use to improve your listening skills. There are books
                    devoted to this topic, so we'll try to highlight some of the most common techniques here:
                          Appear interested in what the speaker is saying. This will make the speaker feel at ease and
                          will benefit you as well. By acting interested, you become interested and thereby retain
                          more of the information being presented.
                          Making eye contact with the speaker is another effective listening tool. This lets the speaker
                          know you are paying attention to what they're saying and are interested.
                          Put your speaker at ease by letting them know beforehand that you're interested in what
                          they're going to talk about and that you're looking forward to hearing what they have to
                          say. While they're speaking, nod your head, smile, or make comments when and if appro-
                          priate to let the speaker know you understand the message. If you don't understand some-
                          thing and are in the proper setting, ask clarifying questions.
                          Another great trick that works well in lots of situations is to recap what the speaker said
                          in your own words and tell it back to them. Start with something like this, "Let me make
                          sure I understand you correctly, you're saying...," and ask the speaker to confirm that you
                          did understand them correctly.
                          Just as your mother always said, it's impolite to interrupt. Interrupting is a way of telling
                          the speaker that you aren't really listening and you're more interested in telling them what
                          you have to say than listening to them. Interrupting gets the other person off track, they
                          might forget their point, and it may even make them angry.
                       Not to disagree with Mom, but there probably are some occasions where interrupting is
                    appropriate. For example, if you're in a project status meeting and someone wants to take the
                    meeting off course, sometimes the only way to get the meeting back on track is to interrupt
                    them. You can do this politely. Start first by saying the person's name to get their attention.
                    Then let them know that you'd be happy to talk with them about their topic outside of the meet-
                    ing or add it to the agenda for the next status meeting if it's something everyone needs to hear.
                    Sorry, Mom.

                    Resolving Conflicts
                    I said earlier in this chapter that if you have more than one person working on your project, you
                    have a team. Here's another fact: If you have more than one person working on your project,
                    you'll have conflict. I put conflict resolution in the communication section because conflict res-
                    olution involves communication, as you'll see in a moment.
                        Everyone has desires, needs, and goals. Conflict comes into the picture when the desires,
                    needs, or goals of one party are incompatible with the desires, needs, or goals of another party
                    (or parties). Conflict, simply put, is the incompatibility of goals, which often leads to one party
                    resisting or blocking the other party from attaining their goals. Wait--this doesn't sound like
                    a party!
                        There are five ways of resolving conflict that may show up on the exam:
                    Forcing Forcing is just as it sounds. One person forces a solution on the other parties. This is
                    where the boss puts on the "Because I'm the boss and I said so" hat. While this is a permanent
                    solution, it isn't necessarily the best solution. People will go along with it because, well, they're
3601.book Page 331 Tuesday, July 12, 2005 11:17 PM




                                                                       Distributing Project Information           331




             forced to go along with it. It doesn't mean they agree with the solution. This isn't the best tech-
             nique to use when you're trying to build a team. This is an example of a win-lose conflict res-
             olution technique. The forcing party wins, and the losers are those who are forced to go along
             with the decision.
             Smoothing Smoothing does not lead to a permanent solution. It's a temporary way to resolve
             conflict where someone attempts to make the conflict appear less important than it is. Everyone
             looks at each other and scratches their head and wonders why they thought the conflict was
             such a big deal anyway. As a result, a compromise is reached and everyone feels good about the
             solution until they get back to their desk and start thinking about the issue again. When they
             realize that the conflict was smoothed over and really is more important than they were led to
             believe, they'll be back at it and the conflict will resurface. This is an example of a lose-lose con-
             flict resolution technique because neither side wins.
             Compromise Compromise is achieved when each of the parties involved in the conflict gives up
             something to reach a solution. Everyone involved decides what they will give on and what they
             won't give on, and eventually through all the give and take, a solution is reached. Neither side
             wins or loses in this situation. As a result, neither side is really gung ho about the decision that was
             reached. They will drag their feet and reluctantly trudge along. If, however, firm commitments are
             made by both parties to the resolution, then the solution becomes a permanent one.
             Confrontation Confrontation is also called problem solving and is the best way to resolve conflict.
             One of the key actions you'll perform with this technique is a fact-finding mission. The thinking here
             is that one right solution to a problem exists and the facts will bear out the solution. Once the facts
             are uncovered, they're presented to the parties and the decision will be clear. Thus the solution
             becomes a permanent one and the conflict expires. This is the conflict resolution approach project
             mangers use most often and is an example of a win-win conflict resolution technique.
             Withdrawal Withdrawal never results in resolution. This occurs when one of the parties gets
             up and leaves and refuses to discuss the conflict. It is probably the worst of all the techniques
             because nothing gets resolved. This is an example of a lose-lose conflict resolution technique.



             Exam Spotlight

             Know each of the conflict resolution techniques for the exam. Also remember that these tech-
             niques will not necessarily yield long-term results. The smoothing and withdrawal techniques
             have temporary results and aren't always good techniques to use to resolve problems. Forcing,
             compromise, and confrontation techniques tend to have longer-lasting results.



                Keep in mind that group size makes a difference when you're trying to resolve conflict or
             make decisions. Remember the channels of communication you learned about in Chapter 4?
             The larger the group, the more lines of communication and the more difficult it will be to reach
             a decision. Groups of 5 to 11 people have been shown to make the most accurate decisions.

                    332         Chapter 8         Developing the Project Team



                       Use communication, listening, and conflict resolution skills wisely. As a project manager,
                    you'll find that your day-to-day activities encompass these three areas the majority of the time.
                    Project managers with excellent communication skills can work wonders. Communication
                    won't take the place of proper planning and management techniques, but a project manager
                    who communicates well with their team and the stakeholders can make up for a lack of tech-
                    nical skills any day, hands down. If your team and your stakeholders trust you and you can
                    communicate the vision and the project goals and report on project status accurately and hon-
                    estly, the world is your oyster.

                    Information Gathering and Retrieval Systems
                    The Information gathering and retrieval systems tool and technique of the Information Distribution
                    process includes ways that project information is stored and shared among project team members.
                    You've probably used one or more of these gathering and retrieval systems such as project manage-
                    ment software, manual filing systems, intranet project sites, and electronic databases.

                    Information Distribution Methods
                    Information distribution methods are ways of getting the project information to the project
                    team or stakeholders. As the name implies, these are ways to distribute the information and
                    might include e-mail, hard copy, voicemail, videoconferencing, and so on.



                    Exam Spotlight

                    Don't confuse information gathering and retrieval systems with information distribution meth-
                    ods. Remember that retrieval systems are ways for the project team to get at project informa-
                    tion, while distribution methods are ways of getting the information into the hands of the
                    stakeholders or team members.



                    Lessons Learned Process
                    Lessons learned is information that you gather and document throughout the course of the project
                    that can be used to benefit the current project, future projects, or other projects currently being
                    performed by the organization. Lessons learned may include positive as well as negative lessons.
                       During the Information Distribution process, you'll begin conducting lessons learned meet-
                    ings focusing on many different areas depending on the nature of your project. These areas
                    might include project management processes, product development, technical processes, project
                    team performance, stakeholder involvement, and so on.
                       Lessons learned meetings should always be conducted at the end of project phases and at the
                    end of the project at minimum. Team members, stakeholders, vendors, and others involved on
                    the project should participate in these meetings. It's important to understand, and to make your
                    team members understand, that this is not a finger pointing meeting. The purpose of lessons
                    learned is to understand what went well and why--so you can repeat it on future projects--and
3601.book Page 333 Tuesday, July 12, 2005 11:17 PM




                                                                       Distributing Project Information        333




             what didn't go so well and why--so you can perform differently on future projects. These meet-
             ings make good team-building sessions because there is an atmosphere of trust and sharing and
             building on each other's strengths to improve performance.
                Some of the updates that may occur as a result of lessons learned meetings are updates to the
             lessons learned knowledge base, and to policies, procedures, processes, and business skills and
             updates to the risk management plan.



             Exam Spotlight

             According to A Guide to the PMBOK, it's a project manager's professional obligation to hold
             lessons learned meetings.




                                   We'll talk more about lessons learned in Chapter 11, "Closing Out the Project."




             Outputs of Information Distribution
             The first output of the Information Distribution process is organizational process assets
             updates. The updates here consist of six elements:
             Lessons learned documentation You'll document the lessons learned we talked about earlier
             as this output. You should document the reasons or causes for the issues, the corrective action
             taken and why, and any other information that future projects may benefit from.
             Project records Project records include, as you might guess, memos, correspondence, and other
             documents concerning the project. The best place to keep information like this is in a project note-
             book or in a set of project notebooks, depending on the size of the project. The project notebooks
             are ordinary three-ring binders where project information gets filed. They are maintained by the
             project manager or project office and contain all information regarding the project. You could
             also keep the information on a project website, the company intranet, or CDs. If you're keeping
             the information electronically, make certain it's backed up periodically. Individual team members
             may keep their own project records as well in notebooks or electronically. These records serve as
             historical information once the project is closed.
             Project reports Project reports include the project status reports and minutes from project meet-
             ings. If you're keeping an issues log, they would be included with the project reports as well.
             Project presentations Project presentations involve presenting project information to the
             stakeholders and other appropriate parties when necessary. The presentations might be formal
             or informal and depend on the audience and the information being communicated.

                    334          Chapter 8           Developing the Project Team



                    Feedback from stakeholders This one ties into lessons learned. Feedback you receive from the
                    stakeholders that can improve future performance on this project or future projects should be
                    captured and documented. If the information has an impact on the current project, distribute
                    it to the appropriate team members so that future project performance can be modified to
                    improve results.
                    Stakeholder notifications Remember that the focus of this process is distributing information
                    so this elements fits because you'll want to notify them when you have implemented solutions
                    and approved changes. This also involves informing them of project status. We'll cover project
                    status review meetings in the section "Establishing Performance Measurements" in Chapter 9.
                      The only other output of this process is requested changes, which we've talked about before.
                      In the next chapter, we'll examine the processes associated with finding and selecting ven-
                    dors, administering contracts, managing stakeholders and team members, quality assurance,
                    and reporting on performance.

             Section 3: Activity That Occurred in the Project This Week
             The Ethernet cable run was completed without a problem.

             Gomez construction started the build-out process. This task was fast-tracked with the Ethernet
             cable run as planned.

             Jill made initial calls regarding retail products order.

             Section 4: Progress Expected This Reporting Period Not Completed
             None. Project is on track to date.

             Section 5: Progress Expected Next Reporting Period
             Build-out will continue. Jake reports that Gomez expects to have electrical lines run and drywall
             started prior to the end of the next reporting period.

             Ricardo should have a T1 update. There's a slim possibility that the T1 connection will have
             occurred by next reporting period.

             Section 6: Issues
             We had to start the build-out on the last day of the cable run (this is called fast-tracking) to keep
             the project on schedule. Jake and Ricardo reported only minor problems with this arrangement
             in that the contractors got into each other's way a time or two. This did not impact the comple-
             tion of the cable run as most of day two this team was in the back room and Gomez's crew was
             in the storefront area.

             A key member of the Gomez construction crew was out last week due to a family emergency.
             Gomez assures us that it will not impact the build-out schedule. They replaced the team mem-
             ber with someone from another project, so it appears so far that build-out is on schedule.

             Ricardo is somewhat concerned about the T1 connection because the phone company won't
             return his calls inquiring about status. We're still ahead of the curve on this one because hard-
             ware isn't scheduled to begin testing until January 21. Hardware testing depends on the T1
             connection. This is a heads-up at this point, and we'll carry this as an issue in the status report
             going forward until it's resolved.

             One of the gourmet food item suppliers Jill uses regularly went out of business. She is in the
             process of tracking down a new supplier to pick up the slack for the existing stores and supply
             the gourmet food products for the new store.

             ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

             "Good job on the status," Dirk says as you pick up the phone. "I was beginning to wonder when
             we'd see some action on the project, but it looks like things are underway."

                    "A lot has happened in just the past two weeks, as you can see. I'll publish these project status
                    updates twice a month in conjunction with the regular project status meetings. Starting in Jan-
                    uary, I'll publish them once a week until project completion."

                    "Keep me posted on that T1 line. That isn't going to be a showstopper, is it?"

                    "We have a contingency plan in place," you reply. "We talked about that last week."

                    "Okay. I'll see you at the project meeting Friday."

                    "See you then," you say.

             Summary
             This chapter described four processes from the Executing process group: Direct and Manage
             Project Execution, Acquire Project Team, Develop Project Team, and Information Distribution.
                 In Direct and Manage Project Execution, the project plans come to life. Activities are autho-
             rized to begin and the product or service of the project is produced. Status review meetings are
             held to inform stakeholders of project progress and updates.
                 Acquire Project Team involves negotiation with other functional managers, project manag-
             ers, and organizational personnel to obtain human resources to complete the work of the
             project. The project manager may not have control over who will be a part of the team. Avail-
             ability, ability, experience, interests, and costs are all enterprise environmental factors that
             should be considered when you are able to choose team members.
                 Develop Project Team involves creating an open, inviting atmosphere where project team mem-
             bers will become efficient and cooperative, increasing productivity during the course of the project.
             It's the project manager's job to bring the team together into a functioning, productive group.
                 There are four stages of team development: forming, storming, norming, and performing. All
             groups proceed through these stages, and the introduction of a new team member will always
             start the process over again.
                 Collocation is physically placing team members together in the same location. This might
             also include a common meeting room or gathering area where team members can meet and col-
             laborate on the project.
                 Several motivational theories exist, including reward and recognition, Maslow's hierarchy of
             needs, the Hygiene Theory, the Expectancy Theory, and the Achievement Theory. These theo-
             ries conjecture that motivation is driven by several desires including needs, anticipation of
             expected outcomes, or needs for achievement, power, or affiliation. The Hygiene Theory pro-
             poses that hygiene factors prevent dissatisfaction.
                 Leaders inspire vision and rally people around common goals. Theory X leaders think most
             people are motivated only through punishment, money, or position. Theory Y leaders think
             most people want to perform the best job they can. The Contingency Theory says that people
             naturally want to achieve levels of competency and will continue to be motivated by the desire
             for competency even after competency is reached.
                 Leaders exhibit five types of power: reward, punishment, expert, legitimate, and referent power.
                 Communication skills are the most important skills a project manager exercises. People who
             send messages are responsible for making sure the messages are clear, concise, and complete.
             Receivers are responsible for understanding the messages correctly and making sure they've
             received all of the information.
                 Listening skills put speakers at ease. Several techniques tell your speaker you're listening
             attentively, including making eye contact, nodding, asking clarifying questions, and limiting
             interruptions.
                 Information Distribution is a matter of getting project information out to the stakeholders. Infor-
             mation retrieval systems generally store project information and include project management soft-
             ware, filing cabinets, and electronic databases. Information distribution methods are ways to get the
             information to the stakeholders and include e-mail, paper, voicemail, or videoconferencing.

                    Exam Essentials
                    Be able to identify the distinguishing characteristics of Direct and Manage Project Execution.
                    Direct and Manage Project Execution is where the work of the project is performed, and the
                    majority of the project budget is spent during this process.
                    Be able to name the four stages of group formation. The four stages of group formation are
                    forming, storming, norming, and performing.
                    Be able to define Maslow's highest level of motivation. Self-actualization occurs when a per-
                    son performs at their peak and all lower-level needs have been met.
                    Be able to name the five levels of power. The five levels of power are reward, punishment,
                    expert, legitimate, and referent.
                    Be able to differentiate between senders and receivers of information. Senders are responsi-
                    ble for clear, concise, complete messages, while receivers are responsible for understanding the
                    message correctly.
                    Be able to identify the five styles of conflict resolution. The five styles of conflict resolution
                    are forcing, smoothing, compromise, confrontation, and withdrawal.

                    1.    You are a project manager for an international marketing firm. You are ready to assign
                          resources to your new project using a work authorization system. Which of the following state-
                          ments is not true?
                          A. Work authorization systems clarify and initiate the work for each work package.
                          B. Work authorization systems are written procedures defined by the organization.
                          C. Work authorization systems are used throughout the project Execution processes.
                          D. Work authorization systems are used throughout the Execution processes and are a tool and
                             technique of the Direct and Manage Project Execution process.

                    2.    You are a project manager for a growing dairy farm. It offers its organic dairy products region-
                          ally and is expanding its operations to the West Coast. It is in the process of purchasing and leas-
                          ing dairy farms to get operations under way. You are in charge of the network operations part
                          of this project. An important deadline is approaching that depends on the successful completion of
                          the testing phase. You've detected some problems with your hardware in the testing phase and
                          discover that the hardware is not compatible with other network equipment. You take correc-
                          tive action and exchange the hardware for more compatible equipment. Which of the following
                          statements is true?
                          A. This is not a corrective action because corrective action involves human resources, not
                             project resources.
                          B. Corrective action is taken here to make sure the future project outcomes are aligned with the
                             project management plan.
                          C. Corrective action is not necessary in this case because the future project outcomes aren't
                             affected.
                          D. Corrective action serves as the change request to authorize exchanging the equipment.

                    8.    Your project team consists of 12 people in the same building you're located in, 4 people from
                          the West Coast office, 2 people from the Kansas City office, and 6 people from the London
                          office. Your office works different hours than all the other offices. Additionally, not all of the
                          resources in your building are available at the same times during the day. Three of the 12 team
                          members work swing shift hours. You use tools like web conferencing and e-mail to distribute
                          information to the team. Which of the following is true?
                          A. This question describes the staffing management plan from the Acquire Project Team pro-
                             cess and communication skills from the Information Distribution process.
                          B. This question describes resource availability from the Develop Project Team process and
                             information distribution methods from the Information Distribution process.
                          C. This question describes virtual teams from the Acquire Project Team process and informa-
                             tion distribution methods from the Information Distribution process.

                        are true regarding this situation except for which one?
                          A. The information learned from these meetings concerns processes and activities that have
                             already occurred, so it should be documented because the information is only useful for
                             future projects.
                          B. These meetings are called lessons learned meetings and they're a tool and technique of the
                             Information Distribution process. They're also a good team-building activity.

             Answers to Review Questions
             1.   D. Work authorization systems are a tool used during Project Execution processes but are not
                  a specific tool and technique listed in the Direct and Manage Project Execution process. They
                  formally initiate the work of each work package and clarify the assignments.

             2.   B. Corrective action brings anticipated future project outcomes back into alignment with the
                  project management plan. Since there is an important deadline looming that depends on a pos-
                  itive outcome of this test, the equipment is exchanged so that the project plan and project sched-
                  ule are not impacted.

             3.   A. The most difficult aspect of the Direct and Manage Project Execution process is coordinating
                  and integrating all the project elements. The clue to this question is in the next-to-last sentence.

             4.   A. The Executing process group and Monitoring and Controlling process group serve as inputs
                  to each other.

             5.   B. This question describes the deliverable output. Deliverables can be intangibles, such as the
                  completion of training.

             6.   D. Work performance information includes elements like schedule status, the status of deliver-
                  ables completion, lessons learned, and resource utilization.

             7.   C. The enterprise environmental factors input of the Acquire Project Team process considers ele-
                  ments like personal interests, characteristics, and availability of potential team members.

             8.   C. Virtual teams are teams that don't necessarily work in the same location or have the same
                  hours but all share the goals of the project and have a role on the project. The web conferencing
                  and e-mail references describe the information distribution methods tool and technique of the
                  Information Distribution process.

             9.   B. Teams in the norming stage of Develop Project Team exhibit affection and familiarity with
                  one another and make joint decisions. Smoothing and forcing are conflict resolution techniques,
                  not Develop Project Team stages.

             10. C. The introduction of a new team member will start the formation and development of the
                 team all over again with the forming stage.

             11. D. The performing stage is similar to Maslow's self-actualization. Both involve team members
                 at the peak of performance, concerned with doing good and being the best.

             12. C. Receivers filter information through cultural considerations, knowledge of the subject mat-
                 ter, language abilities, geographic location, emotions, and attitudes.

             13. B. The Expectancy Theory says that people are motivated by the expectation of good outcomes.
                 The outcome must be reasonable and attainable.

             14. B. Collocation would bring your team members together in the same location and allow them
                 to function more efficiently as a team. At a minimum, team members meeting in a common
                 room, such as a war room, for all team meetings would bring the team closer together.

                    15. C. Confronting is a problem-solving technique that seeks to determine the facts and find solu-
                        tions based on the facts. That results in a win-win resolution for all parties.

                    16. A. Referent power is power that is inferred on a leader by their subordinates as a result of the
                        high level of respect for the leader.

                    17. B. Theory Y managers believe that people will perform their best if they're provided with the
                        proper motivation and the right expectations.

                    18. A. Electronic databases are a type of information gathering and retrieval system, not a distribu-
                        tion method.

                    19. B. Group sizes of 5 to 11 participants make the most accurate decisions.

                    20. A. Lessons learned (which is what this question describes) are useful for future processes and
                        activities for the current project as well as future projects.

                                                    This chapter will wrap up the Executing process group and intro-
                                                    duce the Monitoring and Controlling process group. The Execut-
                                                    ing processes covered in this chapter are Request Seller
                    Responses, Select Sellers, and Perform Quality Assurance. Then we'll move into the Monitoring
                    and Controlling process group and examine several processes, including Monitor and Control
                    Project Work, Contract Administration, Manage Project Team, Manage Stakeholders, and Per-
                    formance Reporting.
                       Request Seller Responses and Select Sellers are both Executing processes. They are usually
                    performed in conjunction with the Contract Administration process, which belongs to the Mon-
                    itoring and Controlling process group. In order to keep the dividing line even, we'll talk about
                    Request Seller Responses and Select Sellers together and then finish up the Executing process
                    group with Perform Quality Assurance. Then we'll introduce the Monitor and Control Project
                    work process because it provides the framework for the Monitoring and Controlling process.
                    Then we'll cover the Contract Administration process.
                       The Monitoring and Controlling process group involves taking measurements and perform-
                    ing inspections to find out if there are variances in the plan. If variances are discovered, correc-
                    tive action is taken to get the project back on track and the affected project Planning processes
                    are repeated to make adjustments to the plan as a result of the variances.
                       During the Manage Team Project process, you'll monitor the performance of the team, pro-
                    vide feedback to team members, resolve issues, and take actions (when needed) to realign the
                    project team's performance with the goals of the project. The Manage Stakeholders process
                    involves communicating project status and issues and resolving stakeholder issues and con-
                    cerns. Performance Reporting also concerns communicating information about the project's
                    progress to the stakeholders.
                       Once again we have a lot of ground to cover. Grab your favorite beverage and dig in.



                    Requesting Seller Responses
                    Many times project managers must purchase goods or services to complete some or all of the work
                    of the project. Sometimes the entire project is completed on contract. The Request Seller Responses
                    process is concerned with obtaining responses to bids and proposals from potential vendors.
                        There are three inputs to this process:
                          Organizational process assets
                          Procurement management plan
                          Procurement documents
3601.book Page 349 Tuesday, July 12, 2005 11:17 PM




                                                                           Requesting Seller Responses             349




                We've talked about these in previous chapters. Organizational process assets were discussed
             in several of the Planning processes we've covered in previous chapters. The procurement doc-
             uments and procurement management plan were prepared during the Plan Contracting process.
             We talked about them in Chapter 6, "Resource Planning." Procurement documents include
             requests for proposals (RFPs), requests for information (RFIs), requests for quotations (RFQs),
             and so on. The vendors--or potential sellers--bear the majority of work in the Request Seller
             Responses process by preparing responses to the RFPs. Depending on the RFP and the effort
             needed to respond, costs to the vendor can become quite substantial.


                                   The Request Seller Responses process is only used if you're obtaining goods or
                                   services from outside your own organization. If you have all the resources you
                                   need to perform the work of the project within the organization, you won't use
                                   this process.

                In the following sections we'll examine some new tools and techniques that will help vendors
             give you a better idea of their responses and then we'll move on to the outputs of this process,
             one of which is the vendor proposal.


             Requesting Seller Responses Tools and Techniques
             Remember that the purpose of the Request Seller Responses process is to obtain responses to
             your RFP (or similar procurement document). The three tools and techniques of this process are
             actually designed to assist the vendors in getting their proposals to you:
             Bidder conferences Bidder conferences are meetings with prospective vendors or sellers that
             occur prior to the completion of their response proposal. A bidder conference is prearranged by
             you or someone from your procurement department. The purpose is to allow all prospective
             vendors to meet with the buyers to ask questions and clarify issues they have regarding the
             project and the RFP. The meeting is held once, and all vendors attend at the same time. The bid-
             der conference is held before the vendor prepares their responses so that they are sure their RFP
             response will address the project requirements.
             Advertising Advertising is letting potential vendors know that an RFP is available. The com-
             pany's Internet site, professional journals, or newspapers are examples of where advertising
             might appear.
             Develop qualified sellers lists Develop qualified seller lists is part of the organizational process
             asset input if they already exist in the organization. If the lists don't exist, you'll have to create
             them. They are lists of prospective sellers who have been preapproved or prequalified to provide
             contract services (or provide supplies and materials) for the organization. For example, your orga-
             nization might require vendors to register and maintain information regarding their experience,
             offerings, and current prices on a qualified seller list. Vendors must usually go through the pro-
             curement department to get placed on the list. Project managers are then required to choose their
             vendors from the qualified seller list published by the procurement department. However, not all
             organizations have qualified seller lists. If a list isn't available, you'll have to work with the project
             team to come up with your own requirements for selecting vendors.

                    350         Chapter 9         Measuring and Controlling Project Performance




                    Request Seller Responses Outputs
                    There are three outputs to the Request Seller Responses process: qualified sellers list, procure-
                    ment document package, and proposals. We talked about developing qualifying seller lists in the
                    last section. The output here can be the qualified seller lists you used as inputs (as part of the orga-
                    nizational process asset input) if they exist. If they don't exist, you'll need to develop them as
                    an input and use them as an output.
                       The procurement document package is prepared by the buyer. This is the formal request
                    that's posted, advertised, or otherwise sent to each of the sellers and is the basis for the seller's
                    bid. These might be an RFP, RFQ, IFB, and so on.
                       Proposals are the seller-prepared documents that describe how the vendor intends to meet
                    the needs of your project. And if they've done their job correctly, the proposal should detail
                    responses to each of the items as they were outlined in your RFP. These proposals become the
                    input to the next process, Select Sellers. After proposals are prepared and submitted, often ven-
                    dors are invited to an oral presentation where they provide additional information about their
                    product or service and buyers may ask questions about the seller's proposal.



                    Exam Spotlight

                    A Guide to the PMBOK makes a distinction between the Request Seller Responses process and
                    the Select Sellers process that you should know: Request Seller Responses obtains bids and
                    proposals; Select Sellers is the receipt of bids and proposals and evaluating each in order to
                    award a winner.




                    Selecting Sellers
                    In the Select Sellers process you evaluate the proposals you've received against your predefined
                    evaluation criteria. Evaluation criteria was defined in the Plan Contracting process.
                       Select Sellers has several inputs:
                          Organizational process assets
                          Procurement management plan
                          Evaluation criteria
                          Procurement document package
                          Proposals
                          Qualified sellers list
                          Project management plan (risk register and risk-related contractual agreements)
                       We've covered all of these inputs previously but there a few points you should be aware of.
                    Proposals, as mentioned, are obtained in the Request Seller Responses process and used as an
3601.book Page 351 Tuesday, July 12, 2005 11:17 PM




                                                                                    Evaluation Criteria       351




             input to the Select Sellers process. Proposals may be divided into sections, including a manage-
             ment section, technical approach, and pricing section. Remember that while cost might be the
             primary driver behind your decision, the low-cost provider may not end up being low cost in the
             end if they are unable to deliver the products or services as described and on time. Take the time
             to evaluate the proposals on more than cost alone.
                Evaluation criteria is what you'll use to compare proposals. You developed evaluation cri-
             teria as part of the Plan Contracting process in Chapter 6. However, let's take a little closer look
             at this topic now since you'll actually be using the criteria during this process.


                                   In practice, you will probably perform Plan Contracting, Request Seller
                                   Responses, and Select Sellers all as one process.




             Evaluation Criteria
             Evaluation criteria is one method of rating and scoring proposals. Keep in mind this is an input
             to the Select Sellers process, not a tool and technique, even though you'll be using it as you
             would a tool and technique.
                 The types of goods and services you're trying to procure will dictate how detailed your eval-
             uation criteria is. (Of course, if your organization has policies in place for evaluating proposals,
             then you'll use the format or criteria already established.) The selection of some goods and ser-
             vices may be price driven only. In other words, the bidder with the lowest price will win the bid.
             This is typical when the items you're buying are widely available.
                 When you're purchasing goods, you might request a sample from each vendor in order to
             compare quality (or some other criteria) against your need. For example, perhaps you need a
             special kind of paper stock for a project you're working on at a bank. This stock must have a
             watermark, it must have security threads embedded through the paper, and when the paper is
             used for printing, the ink must not be erasable. You can request samples of stock from the ven-
             dors with these qualities and then test them out to see if they'll work for your project.
                 It's always appropriate to ask the vendor for references, especially when you're hiring con-
             tract services. It's difficult to assess the quality of services because it's not a tangible product.
             References can tell you if the vendor delivered on time, if they had the technical capability to
             perform the work, and if their management approach was appropriate when troubles surfaced.
             Create a list of questions to ask the references before you call.
                 Financial records may be requested to assure you--the buyer--that the vendor has the fiscal
             ability to perform the services they're proposing and that they can purchase whatever equipment
             is needed to perform the services. If you examine the records of the company and find they're two
             steps away from bankruptcy, they may not be a likely candidate for your project. (Remember
             those general management skills? Here's another example where they come into play.)
                 One of the most important criteria is the evaluation of the response itself to determine if the
             vendor has a clear understanding of what you're asking them to do or provide. If they missed
3601.book Page 352 Tuesday, July 12, 2005 11:17 PM




                    352         Chapter 9         Measuring and Controlling Project Performance



                    the mark (remember, they had an opportunity at the bidder conferences to ask clarifying ques-
                    tions) and didn't understand what you were asking them to provide, you'll probably want to
                    rank them very low.
                        Now you can compare each proposal against the criteria and rate or score each proposal for
                    its ability to meet or fulfill these criteria. This can serve as your first step in eliminating vendors
                    that don't match your criteria. Let's say you received 18 responses to an RFP. After evaluating
                    each one, you discover that 6 of them don't match all the evaluation criteria. Those 6 vendors
                    are eliminated in this round. The next step is to apply the tools and techniques of this process
                    to further evaluate the remaining 12 potential vendors.



                    Tools and Techniques of Select Sellers
                    The following tools and techniques of Select Sellers are used to further evaluate vendors:
                          Weighting systems
                          Independent estimates
                          Screening systems
                          Contract negotiation
                          Seller rating systems
                          Expert judgment
                          Proposal evaluation techniques
                    Let's look at each one.


                    Weighting Systems
                    Weighting systems assign numerical weights to evaluation criteria and then multiply them by the
                    weights of each criteria factor to come up with total scores for each vendor. According to A Guide
                    to the PMBOK, this tool and technique quantifies the qualitative data to keep personal biases to
                    a minimum. Weighting systems are useful when you have multiple vendors to choose from
                    because they allow you to rank-order the proposals to determine the sequence of negotiations.
                       There is an example of a weighted scoring system in Chapter 2, "Creating the Project Charter and
                    Preliminary Scope Statement." These systems are commonly used to evaluate vendor proposals.


                    Independent Estimates
                    Your procurement department might conduct independent estimates (also known as should
                    cost estimates) of the costs of the proposal and use these to compare to the vendor prices. If there
                    are large differences between the independent estimate and the proposed vendor cost, one of
                    two things is happening: The statement of work (SOW), or the terms of the contract, was not
3601.book Page 353 Tuesday, July 12, 2005 11:17 PM




                                                             Tools and Techniques of Select Sellers           353




             detailed enough to allow the vendor to come up with an accurate cost, or the vendor simply
             failed to respond to all the requirements laid out in the contract or SOW.


             Screening Systems
             Screening systems use predefined performance criteria to screen out vendors. Perhaps your
             project requires board-certified engineers. One of the screening criteria would be that vendors
             propose project team members who have this qualification. If they don't, they're eliminated
             from the selection process.
                Weighting systems and screening systems are often used in combination to come up with a
             selection.


             Contract Negotiation
             In contract negotiation, both parties come to an agreement regarding the contract terms. Nego-
             tiation skills are put into practice here as the details of the contract are ironed out between the
             parties. At a minimum, contract language should include price, responsibilities, regulations or
             laws that apply, and the overall approach to the project.
                 You might see the term fait accompli show up on the exam. Fait accompli tactics are used
             during contract negotiation when one party tries to convince the other party discussing a par-
             ticular contract item that it is no longer an issue. It's a distraction technique, as the party prac-
             ticing fait accompli tactics is purposely trying to keep from negotiating an issue and claims the
             issue cannot be changed. For example, during negotiations the vendor tells you that the key
             resource they're assigning to your project must start immediately or you'll lose that resource and
             they'll get assigned work elsewhere. However, you don't know--because the vendor didn't tell
             you--that they can reserve this resource for your project and hold them until the start date.
             They used fait accompli tactics to push you into starting the project, or hiring this resource,
             sooner than you would have otherwise.


             Seller Rating Systems
             Seller rating systems use information about the sellers--such as past performance, delivery, con-
             tract compliance, and quality ratings--to determine seller performance. Your organization may
             have seller rating systems in place and you should check with your procurement department to
             see if they exist for the bidders on your project. Part of the Contract Administration process
             (we'll talk about this one later in this chapter) concerns gathering and recording this type of
             information. Don't use seller rating systems as your sole criteria for evaluating vendors.


             Expert Judgment
             Expert judgment applies here as it has on many of the other processes we've discussed. Include
             experts from all areas of the organization when evaluating proposals and selecting vendors.
             Don't forget your legal and financial folks, marketing, sales, engineering, and so on.

                    354         Chapter 9         Measuring and Controlling Project Performance




                    Proposal Evaluation Techniques
                    Proposal evaluation techniques are a combination of all the techniques we've just talked about.
                    All techniques use some form of expert judgment and evaluation criteria--whether it's objective
                    or subjective criteria. The evaluation criteria are usually weighted, much like a weighted scoring
                    system, and those participating as reviewers provide their ratings (usually to the project man-
                    ager) to compile into a weighted proposal to determine an overall score.
                        After all the RFPs are examined and scored, we move to the outputs of this process, where
                    sellers are selected and contracts awarded.




                    Vendor Selection for Fitness Counts HR System

                    Amanda Jacobson is the project manager for Fitness Counts, a nationwide chain of gyms con-
                    taining all the latest and greatest fitness equipment, aerobics classes, swimming pools, and such.

                    Fitness Counts is converting its human resources system. There are several requirements that
                    were specifically addressed in the RFP, including the following:

                          The new system must run on a platform that's compatible with the company's current
                          operating system.

                          Hardware must be compatible with company standards.

                          Data conversion of existing HR data must be included in the price of the bid.

                          Fitness Counts wants to have the ability to add its own custom modules using internal pro-
                          grammers.

                          Training of Fitness Counts programmers must be included in the bid.

                    The project team is in the Select Sellers process and has received bids based on the RFP pub-
                    lished earlier this month. Fitness Counts is using a combination of selection criteria and
                    weighted scoring model to choose a vendor.

                    One of the evaluation criteria said that the vendor must have prior experience with a project like
                    this. Four vendors met that criteria and proceeded to the weighted scoring selection process.

                    Amanda is one of the members of the selection committee. She and four other members on the
                    committee rated the four vendors who met the initial selection criteria. The results are shown
                    in Tables 9.1 and 9.2 (following this sidebar).

                    Vendor C is the clear winner of this bid. Based on the weighted scoring model, their responses
                    to the RFP came out ahead of the other bidders. Amanda calls them with the good news and
                    also calls the other vendors to thank them for participating in the bid. Vendor C is awarded the
                    contract, and Amanda moves on to the Contract Administration process.

                    356         Chapter 9         Measuring and Controlling Project Performance



                           Resource availability
                           Project management plan updates
                           Requested changes
                      Selected sellers is obvious; you choose the seller or sellers that you'll award the project to.
                    We'll talk more about the contract and the contract management plan next. The other outputs
                    have been discussed previously.


                    Elements of a Contract
                    You may recall that a contract is a legally binding agreement between two or more parties, typ-
                    ically used to acquire goods or services. Contracts have several names, including agreements,
                    memorandums of understanding (MOUs), subcontracts, and purchase orders.
                       The type of contract you'll award will depend on the product or services you're procuring
                    and your organizational policies. We talked about the types of contracts--fixed price, cost reim-
                    bursable, and so on--in Chapter 6 if you need a refresher. If your project has multiple sellers,
                    you'll award contracts for each of them.
                       The contract should clearly address the elements of the SOW, time period of performance,
                    pricing and payment plan, acceptance criteria, warranty periods, dispute resolution procedures,
                    and so on.
                       Since contracts are legally binding and obligate your organization to fulfill the terms, they'll
                    likely be subject to some intensive review, and often by several different people. Be certain you
                    understand your organization's policies on contract review and approval before proceeding.
                       Contracts, like projects, have a life cycle of their own. You might encounter questions on the
                    exam regarding the stages of the contract life cycles, so let's look at this topic next.


                    Contract Life Cycles
                    The contract life cycle consists of four stages:
                           Requirement
                           Requisition
                           Solicitation
                           Award
                       These stages are closely related to the following Project Procurement knowledge areas pro-
                    cesses from A Guide to the PMBOK:
                           Plan Purchases and Acquisitions
                           Plan Contracting
                           Request Seller Responses
                           Select Sellers
                          A description of each of the contract life cycles follows.
3601.book Page 357 Tuesday, July 12, 2005 11:17 PM




                                                                              Select Sellers Outputs       357




             Requirement
             The requirement stage is the equivalent of A Guide to the PMBOK's Plan Purchases and Acqui-
             sitions process, which was discussed in Chapter 6. The project and contract needs are estab-
             lished in this cycle, and the requirements of the project are defined. The SOW is used to define
             the work of the project, the objectives, and a high-level overview of the deliverables. A work
             breakdown structure (WBS) is developed, a make-or-buy analysis takes place, and cost esti-
             mates are determined.
                 The SOW is provided by the buyer when the project is performed under contract to describe
             the requirements of the project. The product description can serve as the SOW.

             Requisition
             The requisition stage is similar to A Guide to the PMBOK's Plan Contracting process, discussed
             in Chapter 6.
                In the requisition stage, the project objectives are refined and confirmed. Solicitation mate-
             rials such as the request for proposals (RFP), request for information (RFI), and request for quo-
             tations (RFQ) are prepared during this phase. Generally, the project manager is the one
             responsible for preparing the RFP, RFI, and RFQ. A review of the potential qualified vendors
             takes place, including checking references and reviewing other projects the vendor has worked
             on that are similar to your proposed project.

             Solicitation
             The solicitation stage is where vendors are asked to compete for the contract and respond to the
             RFP. You will use the tools and techniques of A Guide to the PMBOK's Request Seller
             Responses process during this contract stage. The resulting output is the proposals.

             Award
             Vendors are chosen, and contracts are awarded and signed during the award stage. The equiv-
             alent to the award stage in A Guide to the PMBOK is the Select Sellers process.
                The project manager--or the selection committee, depending on the organizational policy--
             receives the bids and proposals during the award phase and applies evaluation criteria to each
             in order to score or rank the responses. After ranking each of the proposals, an award is made
             to the winning vendor and the contract is written.
                Once you have a contract, someone has to administer it. In large organizations, this respon-
             sibility will fall to the procurement department. The project manager should still have a solid
             understanding of administering contracts because they'll work with the procurement depart-
             ment to determine the satisfactory fulfillment of the contract.


             Contract Management Plan
             The contract management plan describes the contract administrative activities of the project. The
             plan also outlines how the contract will be administered based on the SOW elements in the con-
             tract, delivery requirements, and performance requirements both the buyer and the seller must
             meet. The contract management plan is a subsidiary of the project management plan.

                    Laying Out Quality
                    Assurance Procedures
                    The Quality Planning process laid out the quality standards for the project and determined how
                    those standards are satisfied. The Perform Quality Assurance process involves performing sys-
                    tematic quality activities and uses quality audits to determine which processes should be used
                    to achieve the project requirements and to assure they are performed efficiently and effectively.
                        Project team members, the project manager, and the stakeholders are responsible for the
                    quality assurance of the project. It could be that a quality assurance department or organization
                    is assigned to the project to oversee these processes. In that case, quality assurance may be pro-
                    vided to (rather than part of) the project team, the stakeholders (whether they are involved in
                    the work of the project or not), the customer, the project sponsor, or the management team. The
                    project manager will have the greatest impact on the quality of the project during this process.
                        We'll review the inputs to this process next and then spend some time exploring a few new
                    tools and techniques for assuring a quality product and project.


                    Inputs to Perform Quality Assurance
                    The inputs to Perform Quality Assurance are what you use to measure the organizational
                    project quality management processes against. The quality management processes were defined
                    during Quality Planning. The inputs to the Perform Quality Assurance process are as follows:
                          Quality management plan
                          Quality metrics
                          Process improvement plan
                          Work performance information
                          Approved change requests
                          Quality control measurements
                          Implemented change requests
                          Implemented corrective actions
                          Implemented defect repair
                          Implemented preventive action
                       You've heard about the inputs to Perform Quality Assurance before so we'll move right into
                    the tools and techniques of this section.


                    Perform Quality Assurance Tools and Techniques
                    There are four tools and techniques of the Perform Quality Assurance process: quality planning
                    tools and techniques, quality audits, process analysis, and quality control tools and techniques.

             Exam Spotlight

             The most important thing to remember about Perform Quality Assurance is that quality man-
             agement processes are what you use to make certain the project satisfies the quality standards
             laid out in the project management plan.



                We discussed quality planning tools and techniques along with the Quality Planning process
             in Chapter 6. You'll recall that the tools and techniques are cost benefit analysis, benchmarking,
             design of experiments, and cost of quality. These tools can be used during this process as well
             to measure project performance.
                The quality control tools and techniques listed in this process are the same tools and tech-
             niques discussed in the Perform Quality Control process we'll talk about in Chapter 11, "Con-
             trolling Work Results and Closing Out the Project." We'll look at the remaining tools and
             techniques in the following sections.

             Quality Audits
             Quality audits are independent reviews performed by trained auditors or third-party reviewers.
             The purpose of a quality audit is the same as the purpose of the Perform Quality Assurance pro-
             cess, to identify ineffective and inefficient processes used on the project. These audits may exam-
             ine and uncover inefficient processes and procedures as well.
                Quality audits may be performed on a regular schedule or at random depending on the orga-
             nizational policies. Quality audits performed correctly will provide the following benefits:
                  The product of the project is fit for use and meets safety standards.
                  Applicable laws and standards are adhered to.
                  Corrective action is recommended and implemented where necessary.
                  The quality plan for the project is adhered to.
                  Quality improvements are identified.
                  The implementation of approved change requests, corrective actions, preventive actions,
                  and defect repairs are confirmed.
                Quality improvements come about as a result of the quality audits. During the course of the
             audit, you may discover ways of improving the efficiency or effectiveness of the project, thereby
             increasing the value of the project and more than likely exceeding stakeholder expectations.
                Quality improvements are implemented by submitting change requests or taking corrective
             action (two of the outputs of this process). Quality improvements interface with the Monitoring
             and Controlling processes because of the need to file change requests.


                                   We'll look at change requests and change request procedures in Chapter 10,
                                   "Measuring and Reporting Project Objectives."
3601.book Page 360 Tuesday, July 12, 2005 11:17 PM




                    360         Chapter 9         Measuring and Controlling Project Performance



                        Quality audits are generally performed by experienced specialists. The specialist's job is to
                    produce an independent evaluation of the quality process. Some organizations are large enough
                    to have their own quality assurance departments or quality assurance teams; others may have to
                    hire contract personnel to perform this function. Internal quality assurance teams report results
                    to the project team and management team of the organization. External quality assurance teams
                    report results to the customer.

                    Process Analysis
                    Process analysis looks at process improvement from an organizational and technical perspec-
                    tive. According to A Guide to the PMBOK, process analysis follows the steps in the process
                    improvement plan and examines the following:
                          Problems experienced while conducting the project
                          Constraints of the project
                          Inefficient and ineffective processes identified during process operation
                       One of the techniques of process analysis includes performing root cause analysis. (We talked
                    about root cause analysis in the Risk Identification process in Chapter 4.) While you're exam-
                    ining problems and constraints, for example, you should look for what's causing the problem.
                    The result of this exercise will allow you to develop preventive actions for problems that are
                    similar to the problem you're examining or that have the similar root causes.


                    Perform Quality Assurance Outputs
                    There are four outputs of the Perform Quality Assurance process:
                          Requested changes
                          Recommended corrective actions
                          Organizational process assets updates
                          Project management plan updates
                       None of these are new, but there is one new idea embedded in the recommended corrective
                    actions output. During this process, the recommended corrective actions, whether they are a
                    result of a quality audit or process analysis, should be acted upon immediately. Let's say you're
                    manufacturing parts for one of the deliverables of your project. Obviously, the moment you dis-
                    cover that the parts are not correct, you'd correct the process by calibrating the machine per-
                    haps, or using different raw materials, to make certain the parts are produced accurately.
                       We've completed the Executing process group with the Perform Quality Assurance process.
                    Remember that the Executing processes and Monitoring and Controlling processes serve as
                    inputs to each other and that Executing and Monitoring and Controlling are both iterative pro-
                    cess groups. As your project progresses and it becomes evident controls need to be exercised to
                    get the project back on track, you'll come back through the Executing process group and then
                    proceed back through the Monitoring and Controlling processes again. Let's move on to the
                    Monitoring and Controlling process group now and find out what it's all about.

                                                                   Monitor and Control Project Work               361




             Quality Improvements

             While it isn't stated as an output, one of the overarching goals of the Perform Quality Assurance
             process is to provide a foundation for continuous process improvements. As the name implies,
             continuous improvements are iterative. This process of continuous improvements sets the
             stage, so to speak, for improving the quality of all the project processes. This can mean project
             management processes, but it also means the processes involved in accomplishing the work
             of the project, or the organizational business processes.

             We talked about continuous improvement in Chapter 4; however, there a few more things you
             need to know about it. The advantage of continuous process improvement is that it reduces the
             time the project team spends on ineffective or inefficient processes. If the activities don't help
             you meet the goals of the project or, worse yet, hinder your progress, it's time to look at ways
             to improve them. A Guide to the PMBOK states that the organizational business processes are
             the objective for process improvement identification and review.




             Monitor and Control Project Work
             The processes in the Monitoring and Controlling process group concentrate on monitoring
             and measuring project performance to identify variances from the project plan and get it back
             on track.
                The Monitor and Control Project Work process is concerned with monitoring all the pro-
             cesses in the Initiating, Planning, Executing, and Closing process groups. Collecting data, mea-
             suring results, and reporting on performance information are some of the activities you'll
             perform during this process.
                According to A Guide to the PMBOK, the Monitor and Control Project Work process
             involves the following:
                  Reporting and comparing actual project results against the project management plan
                  Analyzing performance data and determining if corrective or preventive action should be
                  recommended
                  Monitoring the project for risks to make certain they're identified and reported, their status
                  is documented, and the appropriate risk response plans have been put into action
                  Documenting all appropriate product information throughout the life of the project
                  Gathering, recording, and documenting project information that provides project status,
                  measurements of progress, and forecasting to update cost and schedule information that is
                  reported to stakeholders, project team members, management, and others

                    Monitor and Control Project Work Inputs
                    The inputs of this process include project management plan, work performance information,
                    and rejected change requests. We've covered project management plan and work performance
                    information in previous chapters. Rejected change requests should be documented so that if a
                    request to perform the change comes up in the future, or there's a question about the disposition
                    of the request, there's a record of what the change request was about and why it was rejected.


                    Tools and Techniques of Monitor and
                    Control Project Work
                    We've seen most all of the tools and techniques of the Monitor and Control Project
                    Work process:
                          Project management methodology
                          Project management information system
                          Earned value technique
                          Expert judgment
                       We'll look more closely at the earned value technique during the discussion of the Cost Con-
                    trol process, which we'll cover in Chapter 10.


                    Monitor and Control Project Work Outputs
                    The outputs of the Monitor and Control Project Work process will also look familiar. They are
                    as follows:
                          Recommended corrective actions
                          Recommended preventive actions
                          Forecasts
                          Recommended defect repair
                          Requested changes
                       The forecasts output includes information that has been gathered concerning project perfor-
                    mance and used to predict future project outcomes. For example, the amount of time it's taken
                    to complete the project activities to date might be used to help predict how much longer the
                    project will take to complete.


                                           We'll examine several formulas that will help us do this in the next chapter.

                                                                            Administering the Contract         363




             Administering the Contract
             Let's shift our focus back to the procurement arena. We talked about Request Seller Responses
             and Select Sellers earlier in this chapter. Now that the contract has been awarded, we need to
             administer it.
                The Contract Administration process concerns monitoring the vendor's performance and
             ensuring that all the requirements of the contract are met. When there are multiple vendors pro-
             viding goods and services to the project, Contract Administration entails coordinating the inter-
             faces among all the vendors as well as administering each of the contracts. If vendor A has a due
             date that will impact whether or not vendor B can perform their service, the management and
             coordination of the two vendors become important. Vendor A's contract and due dates must be
             monitored closely because failure to perform could impact other vendor's ability to perform,
             not to mention the project schedule. You can see how this situation could multiply quickly when
             you have six or seven or more vendors involved.


                                   It's imperative that the project manager and project team are aware of any con-
                                   tract agreements that may impact the project so the team does not inadvert-
                                   ently take action that violates the terms of the contract.

                 Depending on the size of the organization, administering the contract might fall to someone
             in the procurement department. This doesn't mean that you're off the hook as the project man-
             ager. It's still your responsibility to oversee the process and make sure the project objectives are
             being met, regardless of whether a vendor is performing the activities or your project team mem-
             bers are performing the activities. You'll be the one monitoring the performance of the vendor
             and informing them when and if performance is lacking. You'll also monitor the contract's
             financial conditions. For example, the seller should be paid in a timely manner when they've sat-
             isfactorily met the conditions of the contract and it will be up to you to let the procurement
             department know it's okay to pay the vendor. If administering the contract is your responsibil-
             ity, you may have to terminate the contract when the vendor violates the terms or doesn't meet
             the agreed-upon deliverables. If the procurement department has this responsibility, you'll have
             to document the situation and provide this to the procurement department so that they can
             enforce or terminate the contract.
                 Administering the contract is closely linked with project management processes. You'll mon-
             itor the progress of the contract, execute plans, track costs, measure outputs, approve changes,
             take corrective action, and report on status, just as you do for the project itself. According to
             A Guide to the PMBOK, integration and coordination of the Direct and Manage Project Plan
             Execution, Performance Reporting, Perform Quality Control, Integrated Change Control, and
             Risk Monitoring and Control processes must be applied during Contract Administration.

                    Exam Spotlight

                    You might find several questions on the exam that involve the Request Seller Responses,
                    Select Sellers, and Contract Administration processes. While Contract Administration belongs
                    to the Monitoring and Controlling group, these processes are usually performed in the order
                    stated here.



                    Contracting Inputs
                    There are six inputs to Contract Administration:
                          Contract
                          Contract management plan
                          Selected sellers
                          Performance reports
                          Approved change requests
                          Work performance information
                       The contract, contract management plan, and selected sellers are outputs from the Select Sell-
                    ers process. We'll cover performance reports in more depth in Chapter 11, "Closing Out the
                    Project." Performance reports for the Contract Administration process includes information
                    related to the seller (or vendor).

                    Approved Change Requests
                    Sometimes as you get into the work of the project, you'll discover changes need to be made. This
                    could entail changes to the contract as well. Approved change requests are used to process the
                    project or contract changes and might include things like modifications to deliverables, changes
                    to the product or service of the project, changes in contract terms, or termination for poor per-
                    formance. Contracts can be amended at any time prior to contract completion provided the
                    changes are agreed to by all parties and conform to the change control processes outlined in the
                    contract.



                    Exam Spotlight

                    Work performance information is an output of the Direct and Manage Project Execution pro-
                    cess. The results you gather in the Contract Administration process are actually collected as
                    part of the Direct and Manage Project Execution work result output.
3601.book Page 365 Tuesday, July 12, 2005 11:17 PM




                                                                            Administering the Contract         365




             Work Performance Information
             Work performance information concerns monitoring work results and examining the vendor's
             deliverables. This includes monitoring their work results against the project management plan
             and making certain activities are performed correctly and in sequence. You'll need to determine
             which deliverables are complete and which ones have not been completed to date. You'll also
             need to consider the quality of the deliverables and the costs that have been incurred to date.
                Vendors request payment for the goods or services delivered in the form of seller invoices.
             Seller invoices should describe the work that was completed or the materials that were delivered
             and should include any supporting documentation necessary to describe what was delivered.
             The contract should state what type of supporting documentation is needed with the invoice.


                                   Remember that seller invoices are an element of the work performance infor-
                                   mation input to the Contract Administration process, not an output. Also, don't
                                   confuse seller invoices with the payment system, which is a tool and technique
                                   of this process.




             Administering Contracts with Tools and Techniques
             Administering the contract requires several tools and techniques:
                  Contract change control system
                  Buyer conducted performance review
                  Inspections and audits
                  Performance reporting
                  Payment system
                  Claims administration
                  Records management system
                  Information technology
             We will look at each of these in the following sections.

             Contract Change Control System
             Much like the management plans found in the Planning processes, the contract change control
             system describes the processes needed to make contract changes. Since the contract is a legal
             document, changes to it require the agreement of all parties. A formal process must be estab-
             lished to process and authorize (or deny) changes. (Authorization levels are defined in the orga-
             nizational policies.)
                 The purpose of the contract change control system is to establish a formal process for sub-
             mitting change requests. It documents how to submit changes, establishes the approval process,
             and outlines authority levels. It includes a tracking system to number the change requests and

                    record their status. The procedures for dispute resolution are spelled out in the change control
                    system as well.
                       The change control system, along with all the management plan outputs, becomes part of the
                    Integrated Change Control process that we'll discuss later in this chapter.

                    Buyer Conducted Performance Reviews
                    Buyer conducted performance reviews examine the seller's performance on the contract to date.
                    These reviews may be conducted at the end of the contract or at intervals during the contract
                    period. Buyer reviews examine the contract terms and seller performance for elements such as
                    these:
                          Meeting project scope
                          Meeting project quality
                          Staying within project budgets
                          Meeting the project schedule
                       The performance reviews themselves may take the form of quality audits or inspections of
                    documents as well as the work of the product itself. The point of the review is to determine
                    where the seller is succeeding at meeting scope, quality, cost, and schedule issues, for example,
                    or where they're not measuring up. If the seller is not in compliance, action must be taken to
                    either get them back into compliance or terminate the contract. The yardstick you're using to
                    measure their performance against is the contract SOW and the terms of the contract itself.
                    When the RFP is included as part of the contract (which it usually is), you may also use it to
                    determine contract compliance.

                    Inspections and Audits
                    We talked about quality audits as part of the Perform Quality Assurance process. The idea is the
                    same here. The buyer, or some designated third party, will physically inspect the work of the seller
                    and perform audits to determine if there are any deficiencies in the seller's product or service.

                    Performance Reporting
                    Performance reporting is a large part of project management. This tool and technique entails
                    providing your managers and stakeholders with information about the vendor's progress meet-
                    ing the contract objectives. This information is also part of the Performance Reporting process
                    that we'll discuss in depth later in this chapter.

                    Payment Systems
                    Vendors submit seller invoices as an input to this process, and the payment system is the tool
                    and technique used to issue payment. The organization may have a dedicated department, such
                    as accounts payable, that handles vendor payments, or it might fall to the project manager. In
                    either case, follow the policies and procedures the organization established regarding vendor
                    payments.

                                                                         Administering the Contract         367




             Claims Administration
             Claims administration involves documenting, monitoring, and managing changes to the con-
             tract. Changes that cannot be agreed upon are called contested changes. Contested changes usu-
             ally involve a disagreement about the compensation to the vendor for implementing the change.
             You might believe the change is not significant enough to justify additional compensation,
             whereas the vendor believes they'll lose money by implementing the change free of charge. Con-
             tested changes are also known as disputes, claims, or appeals. These can be settled directly
             between the parties themselves, through the court system, or by a process called arbitration.
             Arbitration involves bringing all parties to the table with a third, disinterested party who is not
             a participant in the contract to try to reach an agreement. The purpose of arbitration is to reach
             an agreement without having to go to court.

             Records Management System
             I think it's been a while since we've talked about documentation, but discussing records manage-
             ment systems reminds us of the importance of having an organized system for contract documenta-
             tion. A records management system involves not just documentation, but policies, control functions,
             and automated tools as part of the project management information system (which is both a part of
             the enterprise environmental factors and a tool and technique of several processes) used to manage
             project documents as well as contract documents. Records management systems typically index doc-
             uments for easy filing and retrieval.

             Information Technology
             Information technology, in this process, refers to the automated ways you can put some of the
             tools and techniques, outputs, processes, and so on to use. I don't know about you, but I've
             reached a point where I can't live without information technology. Having my e-mail, contacts,
             project documents, to-do lists, policy documents, and so on at my fingertips wherever I go is
             invaluable.
                As mentioned earlier, using a project management software tool to help build the project
             schedule and allocate resources is much easier than developing all this by hand. Contract infor-
             mation and general project information and processes can be much more efficient when you use
             information technology to help you out.


             Managing Contract Outputs
             The outputs to the Contract Administration process are as follows:
                  Contract documentation
                  Requested changes
                  Recommended corrective actions
                  Organizational process asset updates
                  Project management plan updates
3601.book Page 368 Tuesday, July 12, 2005 11:17 PM




                    368         Chapter 9         Measuring and Controlling Project Performance



                       These outputs relate to the tools and techniques just talked about and, in practice, work hand
                    in hand with them. We've talked about recommended corrective actions and project manage-
                    ment plan updates before and there's nothing new to add here. The remaining outputs are either
                    new or involve additional information you need to know.

                    Contract Documentation
                    Here's our favorite topic again. This output includes (but isn't limited to) all of the following:
                          Contract
                          Performance information
                          Warranties
                          Financial information (like invoices and payment records)
                          Inspection and audit results
                          Supporting schedules
                          Approved and unapproved changes
                      The records management system we talked about earlier is the perfect place to keep all these
                    documents.

                    Requested Changes
                    Requested contract changes are coordinated with the Direct and Manage Project Execution and
                    Integrated Change Control processes so that any changes impacting the project itself are com-
                    municated to the project team and appropriate actions are put into place to realign the objec-
                    tives. This might also mean the project management plan itself will require changes. That
                    requires you to jump back to the Planning process group to bring the project management plan
                    up-to-date. Once the plan is up-to-date, the Direct and Manage Project Execution process may
                    require changes as well to get the work of the project in line with the new plan. Remember that
                    project management is an iterative process and it's not unusual to revisit the Planning or Exe-
                    cuting processes, particularly as changes are made or corrective actions are put into place.
                       Contract changes will not always impact the project management plan, however. For exam-
                    ple, late delivery of key equipment probably would impact the project management plan, but
                    changes in the vendor payment schedule probably would not. It's important that you are kept
                    abreast of any changes to the contract so that you can evaluate whether the project management
                    plan needs adjusting.

                    Organizational Process Asset Updates
                    Organizational process assets consist of organizational policies, procedures, and so on. There
                    are three elements of this output that relate to contracts:
                    Correspondence Correspondence is information that needs to be communicated in writing to
                    either the seller or the buyer. Examples might be changes to the contract, clarification of con-
                    tract terms, and notification of performance issues. You would also use correspondence to

                                                                            Administering the Contract          369




             notify a vendor that you're terminating the contract because performance is below expectations
             and is not satisfying the requirements of the contract.
             Payment schedules and requests Many times, contracts are written such that payment is made
             based on a predefined performance schedule. For example, perhaps the first payment is made
             after 25 percent of the product or service is completed. Or maybe the payment schedule is based
             on milestone completion. In any case, as the project manager, you will verify that the vendor's
             work (or delivery) meets expectations before the payment is authorized. It's almost always your
             responsibility as the project manager to verify that the terms of the contract to date have or have
             not been satisfied. Depending on your organizational policies, someone from the accounting or
             procurement department may request written notification from you that the vendor has com-
             pleted a milestone or made a delivery. Monitoring the work of the vendor is as important as
             monitoring the work of your team members.
             A Guide to the PMBOK states that the payment schedules and requests element pertains to pay-
             ment systems that are external to the project. For example, if the procurement department is
             responsible for paying the contractor, the payment schedule (which is one of the terms of the
             contract) is managed by them. The seller submits a payment request, an inspection or review of
             their performance is conducted to make certain the terms of the contract were fulfilled, and the
             payment is made. If the contract payments are being managed by the project team, this output
             is called payments.
             Seller performance evaluation Seller performance evaluation is a written record of the seller's
             performance on the contract. It should include information about whether the seller successfully
             met contract dates, fulfilled the requirements of the contract and/or contract statement of work,
             whether the work was satisfactory and so on. Seller performance evaluations can be used as a
             basis for terminating the existing contract if performance is not satisfactory. They should also
             indicate whether this vendor should be allowed to bid on future work. Seller performance eval-
             uations can also be included as part of the qualified sellers lists.


                                   Don't confuse payment systems (a tool and technique of Contract Administration)
                                   with payment schedules and requests (an output of Contract Administration). Pay-
                                   ment systems include reviews and authorization to issue the check. The payment
                                   schedules and request output is where the check gets sent to the seller.




             Exam Spotlight

             I recommend remembering the inputs, tools and techniques, and outputs of the contracting pro-
             cesses, including Request Seller Responses, Select Sellers, and Contract Administration. Be certain
             you understand the purposes of these processes and don't simply memorize their components.

                    370         Chapter 9         Measuring and Controlling Project Performance




                    Managing Project Teams
                    The Manage Project Team process is concerned with tracking and reporting on the performance
                    of individual team members. During this process, performance appraisals are prepared and con-
                    ducted, issues are identified and resolved, and feedback is given to the team members. Some
                    team behavior is also observed during this process, but the main focus here is on individuals and
                    their performance.



                    Exam Spotlight

                    Take note that A Guide to the PMBOK states that one of the outcomes or results of the Manage
                    Project Team process is an update to the staffing management plan. However, staffing man-
                    agement plan updates are not listed as an output of this process.



                          We've seen all of the inputs to this process before:
                           Organizational process assets
                           Project staff assignments
                           Roles and responsibilities
                           Project organization charts
                           Staffing management plan
                           Team performance assessment
                           Work performance information
                           Performance reports


                    Tools and Techniques for Managing Teams
                    Most of the tools and techniques for this process are new
                           Observation and conversation
                           Project performance appraisal
                           Conflict management
                           Issue log
                          We'll take a closer look at each of these tools.

                    Observation and Conversation
                    Observation and conversation is another one of those obvious tools and techniques. In order to
                    assess team member performance, you have to observe it. Hopefully, you've also learned how
3601.book Page 371 Tuesday, July 12, 2005 11:17 PM




                                                                            Managing Project Teams            371




             important communication is to the success of the project. This includes communicating with
             your team members. I know project managers who are reticent to engage their teams in con-
             versation unless it's official project business. I've even known project managers who instructed
             their administrative assistant to give a specific direction to another team member. Surely you
             don't engage in these activities. It's difficult to understand a team member's attitude or view-
             point toward the project if you're communicating through someone else. Establish an open door
             policy with your team members and live up to it. The benefits are so great that it's worth a few
             minutes a day of chitchat to establish that feeling of trust and camaraderie.

             Project Performance Appraisal
             Project performance appraisals are typically annual or semiannual affairs where managers let
             their employees know what they think of their performance over the past year and rate them
             accordingly. These are usually manager-to-employee exchanges but can incorporate a 360-
             degree review, which takes in feedback from just about everyone the team member interacts
             with, including stakeholders, customers, project manager, peers, subordinates, and the delivery
             person if they have a significant amount of project interaction. I'm not a fan of 360-degree
             reviews because it makes most non-manager types uncomfortable. "I don't want to rate my
             peer," is a typical response. I also find 360-degree reviews are biased. At best you'll get a
             response like, "Oh, Ken is great, just great. No problems, good guy," or exactly the opposite if
             the person you're speaking with doesn't like the team member you're asking about. Perfor-
             mance appraisal should be a bit more constructive than this. Nonetheless, understand the 360-
             degree concept for the exam.
                No matter what type of appraisal is conducted, project managers should contribute to the
             performance appraisals of all project team members. You should be aware of potential loyalty
             issues when you're working in a matrix organizational structure. The team member in this
             structure reports to both you (as the project manager) and a functional manager. If the project
             manager does not have an equal say, or at least some say, in the employee's performance, it will
             cause the team member to be loyal to the functional manager and show little loyalty to the
             project or project manager. Managing these dual reporting relationships is often a critical suc-
             cess factor for the project and it is the project manager's responsibility to assure that these rela-
             tionships are managed effectively.
                Performance appraisal time is also a good time to explore training needs, to clarify roles and
             responsibilities, to set goals for the future, and so on.

             Conflict Management
             We talked about conflict management in the last chapter. Here it's important to note that, as
             in any situation, you'll want to deal with conflict as soon as it arises. During the Manage Project
             Team process, most conflicts come about as a result of schedule issues, availability of resources
             (usually the lack of availability), or personal work habits. When project team members are hav-
             ing a conflict, address them first in private with the person who has the issue. Work in a direct
             and collaborative manner but be prepared to escalate the issue into a more formalized proce-
             dure (potentially even disciplinary action) if needed.
3601.book Page 372 Tuesday, July 12, 2005 11:17 PM




                    372         Chapter 9         Measuring and Controlling Project Performance



                       If conflicts exist between two of the team members, encourage resolution between them
                    without intervention on your part. The best conflict resolution will come about when they can
                    work out the issues between them. When that isn't possible, you'll have to step in and help
                    resolve the matter.
                       Remember that solid ground rules and established policies and procedures will help mitigate
                    conflict before it arises.

                    Issue Log
                    The issue log is a place to document the issues that keep the project team from meeting project
                    goals. These can range from differences of opinion to newly surfaced responsibilities that need
                    assigned to a project team member. Each issue should be recorded in the log along with the per-
                    son responsible for resolving it. You should also note the date the resolution is needed.


                    Managing Project Team Outputs
                    The outputs of the Manage Project Team process are the result of the conversations, perfor-
                    mance appraisals, and conflict resolution we've talked about previously. There are five outputs
                    of this process:
                          Requested changes
                          Recommended corrective actions
                          Recommended preventive actions
                          Organizational process asset updates
                          Project management plan updates
                       Remember that the elements of these outputs pertain to human resources. For example,
                    requested changes may come about as a result of a change in staffing, corrective actions may
                    come about because of disciplinary actions or training needs, and preventive actions may be
                    needed to reduce the impact of potential human resource issues. Any of these actions may cause
                    changes to the staffing management plan which means the project management plan should also
                    be updated.
                       The organizational process asset updates output has two components: input to organiza-
                    tional performance appraisals and lessons learned documentation. Input to organizational per-
                    formance appraisals comes from team members with significant interactions with the project
                    and each other.
                       Lessons learned encompasses everything you've learned about the human resources aspect
                    during this project, including documentation that can be used as templates on future projects
                    (such as org charts and position descriptions), techniques used to resolve conflict, the types of
                    conflict that came up during the project, ground rules, when and how virtual teams were used
                    on the project and the procedures associated with them, special skills needed during the project
                    that weren't known about during the Planning processes, and the issues log.

             Managing Stakeholders
             In my experience, managing stakeholders is much more difficult than managing project team
             members. Stakeholders are often managers or directors in the organization who may be higher
             in the food chain than the project manager and aren't afraid to let you know it. Having said that,
             you can manage stakeholders and it's done using communication.


                                   If you need a refresher or on the definition and role of stakeholders, please see
                                   Chapter 1, "What Is a Project?"

                The Manage Stakeholders process is about satisfying the needs of the stakeholders by man-
             aging communications with them, resolving issues, and improving project performance by
             implementing requested changes.
                Stakeholders need lots of communication in every form you can provide. If you are actively
             engaged with your stakeholders and interacting with them, providing project status, and resolving
             issues, your chances of a successful project are much greater than if you don't do these things.
                The inputs of this process are the communications management plan and organizational pro-
             cess assets. We've seen both of these before. The tools and techniques include communication
             methods and issue logs. Keep in mind that face-to-face communications are the most effective
             with stakeholders. The issue log in this process is more like an action item log where you record
             the actions needed to resolve stakeholder concerns and project issues they raise. As with the
             issue log in the Manage Project Team process, you'll assign a responsible party and a due date
             for resolution.
                The outputs of the Manage Stakeholder process are resolved issues, approved change
             requests, approved corrective actions, organizational process assets updates, and project man-
             agement plan updates. Resolved issues are logged in the issues log.



             Establishing Performance
             Measurements
             As mentioned, the Monitoring and Controlling process group concentrates on monitoring and
             measuring project performance to identify variances from the project plan. Performance
             Reporting is the process where the collection of baseline data occurs and is documented and
             reported. Performance Reporting is part of the Communications Management knowledge area,
             as is the Manage Stakeholders process. Thus, it involves collecting information regarding
             project progress and project accomplishments and reporting it to the stakeholders. This infor-
             mation may also be reported to project team members, the management team, and other inter-
             ested parties. Reporting might include information concerning project quality, costs, scope,
             project schedules, procurement, and risk.

                    374         Chapter 9         Measuring and Controlling Project Performance




                    Performance Reporting Inputs
                    We've examined all the inputs to the Performance Reporting process. They are listed here:
                          Work performance information
                          Performance measurements
                          Forecasted completion
                          Quality control measurements
                          Project management plan
                          Approved change requests
                          Deliverables
                       One thing I should note about these inputs is that the project management plan contains the
                    project management baseline data (typically cost, schedule, and scope factors), which you'll use
                    to monitor and compare results. Deviations from this data are reported to management. Per-
                    formance measures are taken primarily during the Cost Control, Schedule Control, and Perform
                    Quality Control processes, which we'll look at in the next chapter.


                    Performance Reporting Tools and Techniques
                    The tools and techniques of this process are as follows:
                          Information presentation tools
                          Performance information gathering and compilation
                          Status review meetings
                          Time reporting systems
                          Cost reporting systems

                    Information Presentation Tools
                    Information presentation tools include automated tools like spreadsheet and presentation soft-
                    ware that help you create presentable reports and information regarding the progress and status
                    of the project for stakeholder review.

                    Performance Information Gathering and Compilation
                    If you and your team members have been diligently documenting your project's performance, you
                    need to gather all that information and keep it in one place. Performance information gathering
                    and compilation can occur manually, as in everyone turns in hard copy reports to the project man-
                    ager or other designated person, or you can gather information automatically from project man-
                    agement software systems, databases, or other systems. The important thing is the documentation
                    should be kept in one place and be easily accessible to anyone who needs it.

             Status Review Meetings
             Status review meetings are important functions during the course of the project. (We introduced
             status review meetings with the Information Distribution Process in the last chapter.) The pur-
             pose of the status meeting is to provide updated information regarding the progress of the
             project. These are not show-and-tell meetings. If you have a prototype to demo, set up a differ-
             ent time to do that. Status meetings are meant to exchange information and provide project
             updates. They are a way to formally exchange project information. I've worked on projects
             where it's not unusual to have three or four status meetings conducted for different audiences.
             They can occur between the project team and project manager, the project manager and stake-
             holders, the project manager and users or customers, the project manager and the management
             team, and so on.
                Notice that the project manager is always included in status review meetings. Take care that
             you don't overburden yourself with meetings that aren't necessary or could be combined with
             other meetings. Any more than three or four status meetings is unwieldy.


                                   Regular, timely status meetings prevent surprises down the road because you
                                   are keeping stakeholders and customers informed of what's happening. Team
                                   status meetings alert the project manager to potential risk events and provide
                                   the opportunity to discover and manage problems before they get to the
                                   uncontrollable stage.

                 The project manager is usually the expediter of the status meeting. As such, it's your job to
             use status meetings wisely. Don't waste your team's time or stakeholders' time either. Notify
             attendees in writing of the meeting time and place. Publish an agenda prior to the meeting and
             stick to the agenda during the meeting. Every so often, summarize what's been discussed during
             the meeting. Don't let side discussions lead you down rabbit trails, and keep irrelevant conver-
             sations to a minimum. It's also good to publish status meeting notes at the conclusion of the
             meeting, especially if any action items resulted from the meeting. This will give you a document
             trail and serves as a reminder to the meeting participants of what actions need to be resolved and
             who is responsible for the action item.
                 It's important that project team members are honest with the project manager and that the
             project manager is in turn honest about what they report. A few years ago, a department in my
             agency took on a project of gargantuan proportions and unfortunately didn't employ good project
             management techniques. One of the biggest problems with this project was that the project
             manager did not listen to their highly skilled project team members. The team members warned
             of problems and setbacks, but the project manager didn't want to hear of it. The project man-
             ager took their reports to be of the "Chicken Little" ilk and refused to believe the sky was fall-
             ing. Unfortunately, the sky was falling! The project manager, because they didn't believe it,
             refused to report the true status of the project to the stakeholders and oversight committees.
             Millions of dollars were wasted on a project that was doomed for failure, while the project man-
             ager continued to report that the project was on time and activities were completed when in fact
             they were not.

                    376         Chapter 9         Measuring and Controlling Project Performance



                       There are hundreds of project stories like this, and I'll bet you've got one or two from your
                    experiences as well. Don't let your project become the next bad example. Above all, be honest
                    in your reporting. No one likes bad news, but bad news delivered too late along with millions
                    of dollars wasted is a guaranteed career showstopper.

                       Time and Cost Reporting Systems
                    Time and cost reporting systems are used to, obviously, record time and cost information about
                    the project. Most specifically, these systems will report the time and cost that's been expended
                    on the project to date.


                    Performance Reporting Outputs
                    There are several outputs to the Performance Reporting process:
                          Performance reports
                          Forecasts
                          Requested changes
                          Organizational process assets updates
                        Performance reports is the primary output of this process. It's here that performance infor-
                    mation is gathered, documented, and reported to the stakeholders as outlined in the communi-
                    cation management plan. These reports might take many forms, including S curves (cost
                    baselines are recorded this way), bar charts, tables, and histograms. Earned value information
                    is often reported during this process as well. We'll examine this topic in the next chapter during
                    the discussion of the Cost Control process.
                        In the next chapter we'll explore the main change control processes and the measurement
                    tools you'll use to provide the variance measurements that are gathered and reported to the
                    stakeholder during the Performance Reporting process.



                    Project Case Study: New Kitchen Heaven Retail Store

                    Your regularly scheduled status meeting is coming up. Let's see how it's progressing.

                    "Thank you all for coming," you begin. You note those stakeholders who are present and pass
                    out the agendas. "First, we have a contract update. Jake, would you give us the update please?"

                    "Gomez Construction has submitted a seller payment request for the work completed through
                    November 30. Shelly in our contract management office manages the payment system and
                    handles all payment requests. She'll get a check cut and out to Gomez by the end of this month.
                    They are doing an outstanding job as always. As you know, I've also hired an independent
                    inspector, aside from the city and county types, so that we make sure we're up to code before
                    the city types get there. I don't want to get caught in that trap and end up delaying the project
                    because we can't get the city inspector back out to reinspect quickly enough."

                                                           Establishing Performance Measurements               377




             "Thank you, Jake. Any problems with those inspections so far?"

             Jake clears his throat. "It turned out to be a good move because the contractor did find some
             things that we were able to correct before bringing out the official inspectors."

             "Ricardo, do you have a contract update for us today?"

             "Yes. The contract management office used a fixed price contract on the hardware and IT sup-
             plies order. That contract is just now making its way through the sign-off processes. My group
             will manage the quality control and testing once all this equipment arrives."

             "Jill, can you give us the update on the store?" you ask.

             "I've ordered all the retail products, the cookware line, and have lined up the chef demos. The
             costs for the new gourmet supplier we're using are higher than our original vendor. This
             impacts ongoing operations, but the hit to the project budget is minimal. I should also mention
             that a change request was submitted.

             You point everyone's attention to the issues list. "Last meeting I reported that Gomez had an
             important crew member out on a family emergency. Gomez was able to replace the team mem-
             ber with no impact to the schedule. Next issue was the T1 connection--I reported that Ricardo
             was not receiving phone calls back. Good news--that issue has been cleared, the date has been
             set, and we can close this issue. Are there any new issues to be added this week?"

             One of the stakeholders from the marketing department speaks up, "I need someone from the
             project team to work with me on the website announcement. I haven't heard anything and I
             don't want to cut this so close that we put up something sub-par on the website. The 50th anni-
             versary deserves a little splash."

             "Okay," you reply. "I'll set up a meeting with you to get more information and then we'll deter-
             mine who is the best fit. I've noted we need to assign someone to this activity in the issues log.
             On another note, I have one more issue to report. Unfortunately, we lost a valuable team mem-
             ber last week. I don't want to go into all the details here but this employee violated our Internet
             acceptable use policy. This person was placed on disciplinary action on this very issue once
             before. This will cause an impact to the project schedule because his activities were on the crit-
             ical path. I've already interviewed two internal candidates who've expressed interest in work-
             ing on the project. I believe either one would work out nicely. However, there is some ramp-up
             time needed.

             "What's the forecast?" Dirk asks. "Are we on track for meeting the grand opening date given
             all these issues?

             "I'll have performance figures for you at the next status meeting and I have some ideas on how
             we can make up this time other ways so that we still meet the date."

             You thank everyone for coming and remind them of the next meeting time.

                                                                                           Summary         379




             Summary
             This chapter finished up the Executing process group and looked at the first process in the Mon-
             itoring and Controlling process group. We discussed Request Seller Responses, Select Sellers,
             Contract Administration, and Perform Quality Assurance from the Executing process group.
             We also covered several processes in the Monitoring and Controlling process group including
             Monitor and Control project Work, Contract Administration, Manage Project Team, Manage
             Stakeholders, and Performance Reporting. Request Seller Responses involves obtaining bids
             and responses from vendors. The tools and techniques of this process include bidder confer-
             ences, advertising, and develop qualified sellers list.
                Select Sellers involves receiving bids or proposals. In this process, the selection committee
             will use evaluation criteria to prioritize the bids and proposals and the outcome is that a seller
             (or sellers) is selected and contracts awarded.
                During the Perform Quality Assurance process, quality audits are performed to ensure that
             the project will meet and satisfy the project's quality standards set out in the quality plan.
                The Monitor and Control Project Work project concerns monitoring all the project process
             groups, collecting data, measuring results, reporting on performance information, and taking
             corrective action to keep the project in scope and on schedule.
                Contract Administration is the process where you'll monitor the vendor's performance and
             ensure that all the requirements of the contract are met. If there is more than one vendor work-
             ing on the project, Contract Administration entails coordinating the interfaces among all the
             vendors as well as administering each of the contracts.
                Contracts have cycles of their own, much like projects. Phases of the contracting life cycle
             include requirement, requisition, solicitation, and award. Changes to the contract are managed
             with change requests.
                Changes that cannot be agreed upon are called contested changes. These take the form of dis-
             putes, claims, or appeals. They might be settled among the parties directly, through a court of
             law, or through arbitration.
                Request Seller Responses and Select Sellers belong to the Executing process group and the
             Contract Administration belongs to the Monitoring and Controlling process group. In practice,
             you'll generally perform Request Seller Responses, Select Sellers, and Contract Administration
             in that order.
                Manage Project Teams involves tracking and reporting on project team member perfor-
             mance. Performance appraisals are performed during this process and feedback is provided to
             the team members.
                The Manage Stakeholders process concerns making certain communication needs of the
             stakeholders are met, managing any issues stakeholders might raise, and implementing change
             requests.
                The last process in this chapter, Performance Reporting, is one of the ways stakeholders (and
             others) are kept informed of project progress. Performance Reporting includes tools and tech-
             niques like information presentation tools and status reports to report performance, requested
             changes, forecast future project performance, and update organizational process assets.

                    Exam Essentials
                    Be able to describe the difference between the Request Seller Responses process and the Select
                    Sellers process. Request Seller Responses obtains bids and proposals from vendors. Select Sell-
                    ers is the receipt of bids and proposals and the selection of a vendor.
                    Be able to name the tools and techniques of the Select Sellers process. The tools and tech-
                    niques of the Select Sellers process are weighting systems, independent estimates, screening sys-
                    tems, contract negotiation, seller rating systems, expert judgment, and proposal evaluation
                    techniques.
                    Be able to describe the purpose of the Perform Quality Assurance process. The Perform
                    Quality Assurance process is concerned with making certain the project will meet and satisfy the
                    quality standards of the project.
                    Be able to describe the purpose of the Monitor and Control Project Work process. Monitor
                    and Control Project Work monitors the project process groups including Initiating, Planning,
                    Executing, and Closing. This process reports and compares project results with the project man-
                    agement plan, monitors approved change requests, and analyzes, documents, and records
                    project information.
                    Be able to name the contracting life cycle stages. Contracting life cycles include requirement,
                    requisition, solicitation, and award.
                    Be able to name the tools and techniques of the Manage Project Team process. The tools
                    and techniques of Manage Project Team are observation and conversation, project performance
                    appraisal, conflict management, and issue log.
                    Be able to describe the purpose of the Manage Stakeholders process Manage Stakeholders
                    concerns satisfying the needs of the stakeholders by managing communications with them.
                    Be able to define the purpose of the Performance Reporting process. The Performance
                    Reporting process collects and reports information regarding project progress and project
                    accomplishments. The technique used often to report on project performance is earned value
                    analysis.

                    382         Chapter 9         Measuring and Controlling Project Performance




                    Review Questions
                    1.    You are a project manager for Dakota Software Consulting Services. You're working with a
                          major retailer that offers its products through mail-order catalogs. The company is interested in
                          knowing customer characteristics, the amounts of first-time orders, and similar information. As
                          a potential bidder for this project, you worked on the RFP response and submitted the proposal.
                          When the selection committee received the RFP responses from all the vendors bidding on this
                          project, they used a weighted system to make a selection. Which process did this occur in?
                          A. Select Sellers

                          A. Bidder conferences are a tool and technique of the Select Sellers process.
                          B. Bidder conferences are an output of the Select Sellers process.
                          C. Bidder conferences are an output of the Request Seller Responses process.
                          D. Bidder conferences are a tool and technique of the Request Seller Responses process.

                    3.    You have been asked to submit a proposal for a project that has been put out for bid. Prior to
                          submitting the proposal, your company must register so that its firm is on the qualified seller list.
                          Which of the following statements is true?
                          A. The qualified seller list provides information about the sellers and is a tool and technique of

                             form this activity.
                          B. You should recommend a preventive action to reduce the possibility of future project per-
                             formance veering off track because of this employee's failure to perform this activity.
                          C. You've created a forecast, an output of the Monitor and Control Project Work process,
                             using past performance to predict what the project's future condition may look like.
                          D. You may have to request a change to the project schedule as a result of this missed activity.

                    Answers to Review Questions
                    1.    A. Select Sellers involves the receipt of bids and proposals. Weighted systems are one of the tools
                          and techniques of this process used to evaluate vendors based on selection criteria defined by the
                          organization.

                    2.    D. Bidder conferences are a tool and technique of the Request Seller Responses. Solicitation is
                          where proposals are submitted by vendors and obtained by the organization.

                    3.    D. Qualified seller lists are an output of the Request Seller Responses. Their purpose is to pro-
                          vide information about the sellers.

                    4.    C. Independent estimates, also called should cost estimates, are a way to check proposed pricing.

                    5.    C. Fait accompli is a tactic used during contract negotiations where one party convinces the
                          other that the particular issue is no longer relevant or cannot be changed. Option B is not correct
                          because Scope Verification does not generally occur during contract negotiations since the work
                          of the project has not yet been performed.

                    6.    B. Information technology is a tool and technique of the Contract Administration process.

                    7.    D. The tools and techniques of the Contract Administration process are contract change control
                          system, buyer conducted performance review, inspections and audits, performance reporting, pay-
                          ment system, claims administration, records management system, and information technology.

                    8.    C. The contract change control system describes the processes you'll use to make changes to the
                          contract, not as a means of communication. The changes might include contract term changes,
                          date changes, and termination of a contract.

                    9.    A. You have performed a quality audit, which is a structured, independent review of the either
                          the organizational or project processes, policies, or procedures. Process analysis examines the
                          root causes and follows steps in the process improvement plan.

                    10. B. The acceptance of work results happens later during the Scope Verification process, not dur-
                        ing Perform Quality Assurance.

                    11. A. The process analysis technique in the Perform Quality Assurance process includes root cause
                        analysis to analyze a problem and solution and to create preventive actions.

                    12. C. Continuous process improvements are a result of the Perform Quality Assurance process but
                        not a tool and technique.

                    13. A. Communication methods are not a tool and technique of the Manage Project Team process.

                    14. D. This technique is called 360-degree feedback. It's part of the performance appraisals tool and
                        technique of the Manage Project Team process.

                    15. C. The Monitor and Control Project Work process involves reporting and comparing
                        project results, gathering and recording data, recommending actions, and monitoring

             16. B. This question describes the Performance Reporting process (concerned with collecting and
                 reporting information regarding project progress and project accomplishments to the stakehold-
                 ers) and the Manage Stakeholders process (of which communications methods and issue logs are
                 tools and techniques).

             17. C. Face-to-face meetings are the most effective means for resolving stakeholder issues provided
                 these meetings are practical.

             18. B. You are in the Monitor and Control Project Work process. Preventive actions reduce the pos-
                 sibility of negative impacts from risk events and does not apply to this situation.

             19. A. The tools and techniques of the Performance Reporting process are information presentation
                 tools, performance information gathering and compilation, status review meetings, time report-
                 ing systems, and cost reporting systems.

             20. B. Status meetings are to report on the progress of the project. They are not for demos or show-
                 and-tell. Option C is not correct because stakeholders are not concerned about the content of the
                 technical documentation; they need to know that the technical documentation has been reviewed
                 by a qualified technician and that the documentation task is accurate and complete.

                                                    We started examining the Monitoring and Controlling processes
                                                    in the last chapter. This chapter will finish up the remaining pro-
                                                    cesses in the Monitoring and Controlling process group.
                       Performance reports, which are an output of the Performance Reporting process, serve as an
                    input to some of the Monitoring and Controlling processes we'll talk about in this chapter. Per-
                    formance reports are used during the Monitoring and Controlling processes, along with tools
                    and techniques, to measure project performance. These measurements and control tools allow
                    the project manager to take corrective action during the Monitoring and Controlling processes
                    to remedy wayward project results and realign future project results with the project manage-
                    ment plan.
                       We'll cover several processes in this chapter, including Integrated Change Control, Cost
                    Control, Schedule Control, and Risk Monitoring and Control.
                       Integrated Change Control lays the foundation for all of the change control processes. We'll
                    spend time during this process to explain how change control works. The Cost Control and
                    Schedule Control processes are very similar to Integrated Change Control. Remember when
                    you're reading these sections that the information from the Integrated Change Control process
                    applies to these areas as well. Risk Monitoring and Control monitors the project for risks and
                    monitors the risk response plans that have been put into action or may need to be put into action.
                       You've learned a lot about project management by this point and have just a few more things
                    to add to your study list. Keep up the good work. You're getting closer to exam day.



                    Managing Integrated Change Control
                    The Integrated Change Control process serves as an overseer, so to speak, of the Monitoring
                    and Controlling processes. This is where the project's change control process is established.
                    Changes, updates, and corrective actions are common outputs across all the Monitoring and
                    Controlling processes. (And don't forget that requested change requests are also an output of
                    the Direct and Manage Project Plan Execution process, which is an Executing process.) These
                    outputs often generate change requests that are managed through this process.
                       We've seen all of the inputs, tools and techniques, and outputs of this process before. There
                    isn't any new information to add to these. However, there are likely exam questions on several
                    topics that involve change and the Integrated Change Control process. Configuration manage-
                    ment, for example, isn't listed as a tool and technique of this process, but you really can't per-
                    form Integrated Change Control without it. We'll discuss this shortly. First, let's look at change,
                    what it is, and how it comes about.
3601.book Page 393 Tuesday, July 12, 2005 11:17 PM




                                                             Managing Integrated Change Control            393




                Changes come about on projects for many reasons. It's the project manager's responsibility
             to manage these changes and see to it that organizational policies regarding changes are imple-
             mented. Changes don't necessarily mean negative consequences. Changes can produce positive
             results as well. It's important that you manage this process carefully, because too many
             changes--even one significant change--will impact cost, schedule, scope, and/or quality. Once
             a change request has been submitted, you've got some decisions to make. Ask yourself questions
             such as, Should the change be implemented? If so, what's the cost to the project in terms of
             project constraints: cost, time, scope, and quality? Will the benefits gained by making the
             change increase or decrease the chances of project completion?
                Just because a change is requested doesn't mean you have to implement it. You'll always
             want to discover the reasons for the change and determine if they're justifiable, and you'll want
             to know the cost of the change. Remember that cost can take the form of increased time. Let's
             say the change you're considering increases the schedule completion date. That means you'll
             need human resources longer than expected. If you've leased equipment or project resources for
             the team members to use during the course of the project, a later completion date means your
             team needs the leased equipment for a longer period of time. All this translates to increased
             costs. Time equals money, as the saying goes, so manage time changes wisely and dig deep to
             find the impacts that time changes might make on the budget.


             How Change Occurs
             As the project progresses, the stakeholders or customers may request a change directly. Team
             members might also recommend changes as the project progresses. For example, once the
             project is under way, they may discover more efficient ways of performing tasks or producing
             the product of the project and recommend changes to accommodate the new efficiencies.
             Changes may also come about as a result of mistakes that were made earlier in the project (in
             the Planning or in the Executing processes. Hopefully, you've applied all the great practices and
             techniques we've talked about to date and didn't experience many of these.
                Changes to the project may occur indirectly as a result of contingency plans, other changes,
             or team members performing favors for the stakeholders by making that one little change with-
             out telling anyone about it. Many times, the project manager is the last to know about changes
             like this one. There's a fine line here because you don't want to discourage good working rela-
             tionships between team members and stakeholders, yet at the same time, you want to ensure
             that all changes come through the change control process. If a dozen little changes slip through
             like this, your project scope suddenly exits stage left.


             Change Control Concerns
             Integrated Change Control, according to A Guide to the PMBOK, is primarily concerned with
             the following:
                  Influencing the factors that cause change and reaching agreement on their resulting change
                  requests
                  Determining that change is needed or has happened

                    394         Chapter 10           Monitoring and Controlling Change



                          Managing approved changes
                          Updating the requirements that impact scope, quality, schedule, and budgets based on
                          approved changes
                          Documenting requested changes and their impacts
                       Factors that may cause change include project constraints, stakeholder requests, team mem-
                    ber recommendations, vendor issues, and many others. You'll want to understand the factors
                    that are influencing or bringing about change and how a proposed change may impact the
                    project if implemented. Performance measures and corrective actions may dictate that a project
                    change is needed as well.


                                           Modifications to the project are submitted in the form of change requests and
                                           managed through the change control process. Obviously, you'll want to imple-
                                           ment those changes that are most beneficial to the project. We'll talk more
                                           about change requests later in this chapter.

                       Managing changes may involve making changes to the project scope, schedule, or cost baseline,
                    also known as the performance measurement baseline. This baseline may also involve quality or
                    technical elements. The performance measurement baseline is the approved project management
                    plan that describes the work of the project. This is used through Executing and Monitoring and
                    Controlling to measure project performance and determine deviations from the plan. It's your
                    responsibility to maintain the reliability of the performance measurement baselines. If changes are
                    not appropriately reflected in the baselines, they become meaningless. Changes that impact a pre-
                    vious project management process will require updates to those processes, which might mean
                    additional passes through the appropriate Planning and Executing processes.
                       The management plans created during the Planning process group should reflect the changes
                    as well, which may require updates to the project management plan or the project scope state-
                    ment. This requires a close eye on coordination among all the processes that are impacted. For
                    example, changes may require updates to risk response alternatives, schedule, cost, resource
                    requirements, or other elements. Changes that impact product scope always require an update
                    to the project scope.



                    Exam Spotlight

                    Managing changes involves maintaining accurate and reliable performance measurement
                    baselines, coordinating all processes impacted as a result of the change, including revisiting
                    Planning and Executing processes where needed and updating project scope to reflect any
                    changes in product scope.



                       I caution you to not change baselines at the drop of a hat. Examine the changes, their justi-
                    fication, and their impacts thoroughly before making changes to the baselines.

             Configuration Management
             Configuration management is generally a subset of the project management information system.
             It describes the process for submitting change requests and includes processes for tracking the
             changes and their disposition, processes for defining the approval levels for approving and deny-
             ing changes, and a process for authorizing the changes. We'll talk about each of these topics later.
                 Let's take a look at what A Guide to the PMBOK notes are the activities associated with con-
             figuration change management in the Integrated Change Control process:
             Configuration identification Configuration identification describes the characteristics of the
             product of the project and makes sure the description is accurate and complete. This description
             is the basis that's used to verify when changes are made and how they're managed.
             Configuration status accounting This activity doesn't really have to do with financials as you
             might guess from its title. It's about accounting for the status of the changes by documenting and
             storing the configuration information needed to effectively manage the product information.
             Configuration verification and auditing Verification and audits are performed as part of config-
             uration management to determine if the performance and functional requirements have been met.



             Exam Spotlight

             Understand for the exam that configuration management involves identifying the physical
             characteristics of the product of the project (or of the individual components of the product),
             controlling changes to those characteristics, and documenting changes to verify that require-
             ments are met. It also includes the change management system and documents the process for
             requesting, tracking, and determining if change requests should be approved or denied.




             Change Control System
             If you were to allow changes to occur to the project whenever requested, you would probably
             never complete the project. Stakeholders, the customer, and end users would continually change
             the project requirements if given the opportunity to do so. That's why careful planning and
             scope definition are important in the beginning of the project. It's your job as project manager
             to drive out all the compelling needs and requirements of the project during the Planning pro-
             cess so that important requirements aren't suddenly "remembered" halfway through the
             project. However, we're all human, and sometimes things are not known, weren't thought
             about, or simply weren't discovered until a certain point during the project. Stakeholders will
             probably start thinking in a direction they weren't considering during the Planning process, and
             new requirements will come to light. This is where the change control system comes into play.
3601.book Page 396 Tuesday, July 12, 2005 11:17 PM




                    396         Chapter 10           Monitoring and Controlling Change



                    The Purpose of the Change Control System
                    Change control systems are documented procedures that describe how to submit change
                    requests, how to manage change requests, and the management impacts of the changes as they
                    pertain to project performance. They are usually subsystems of the configuration management
                    system. They can include preprinted change request forms that provide a place to record general
                    project information such as the name and project number, the date, and the details regarding the
                    change request.
                       The change control system also tracks the status of change requests, including their approval
                    status. Not all change requests will receive approval to be implemented. Those changes that are
                    not approved are also tracked and filed in the project notebook for future reference.
                       The change control system may define the level of authority needed to approve changes if it
                    wasn't previously defined in the configuration management system. Some change requests could
                    receive approval based on the project manager's decision; others may need more formal approval
                    or more levels of approval such as the project sponsor, executive management, and so on.
                       Procedures should be defined that detail how emergency changes are approved as well. For
                    example, you and your team might be putting in some weekend hours and are close to the com-
                    pletion of a deliverable when you discover that thing one will not talk to thing two no matter
                    what you do. The team brainstorms and comes up with a brilliant solution that requires a
                    change request. Do you stop work right then and wait until the change control board or com-
                    mittee can meet sometime next week and make a decision, or do you--the project manager--
                    make the decision to go forward with this solution and explain the change to the appropriate
                    parties later? That answer depends on the change procedures you have in place to handle situ-
                    ations like this and the authority you have to make emergency changes as outlined in the change
                    control system.
                       Many organizations have formal change control or change request systems in place. If that's
                    the case, you can easily adopt those procedures and use the existing system to manage project
                    change. But if no procedures exist, you'll have to define them.



                    Exam Spotlight

                    The change control system and configuration management system together identify, docu-
                    ment, and control the changes to the performance baseline.



                    Requirements for Change
                    There are two things you should require at the beginning of all projects regarding change. First,
                    require that all change requests be submitted in writing. This is to clarify the change and make
                    sure no confusion exists regarding what's requested. It also allows the project team to accurately
                    estimate the time it will take to incorporate the change. Keep in mind that you will get verbal
                    change requests as well.
3601.book Page 397 Tuesday, July 12, 2005 11:17 PM




                                                                Managing Integrated Change Control               397




                                   Change requests may be verbal or written, but it's good practice to require
                                   them in writing.

                Second, all change requests must come through the formal change control system. Make sure
             no one is allowed to go directly to team members and request changes without the project man-
             ager knowing about it. Also make certain your stakeholders understand that this can cause
             schedule delays, cost overruns, and sacrifices to quality and isn't good change management
             practice. Encourage them from the beginning of the project to use the formal procedures laid
             out in the change control system to request changes.

             Change Control Board
             In some organizations, a configuration control board (CCB) is established to review all change
             requests. The board is given the authority to approve or deny change requests as defined by the
             organization. It's important that its authority is clearly defined and that separate procedures exist
             for emergency changes. The CCB may meet only once a week, once every other week, or even once
             a month, depending on the project. When emergencies arise, the preestablished procedures allow
             the project manager to implement the change on the spot. This will always require a follow-up
             with the CCB and the completion of a formal change request even though it's after the fact.
                CCB members may include stakeholders, managers, project team members, and others who
             may not have any connection to the project at hand. Some organizations have permanent CCBs
             that are staffed by full-time employees dedicated to managing change for the entire organiza-
             tion, not just project change. You may want to consider establishing a CCB for your project if
             the organization does not have one.
                Some organizations use other types of review boards that have the same responsibilities as
             the CCB. Some other names you might see are technical assessment board (TAB), technical
             review board (TRB), engineering review board (ERB), and change control board (CCB).


             Integrated Change Control Inputs
             The inputs to the Integrated Change Control process are similar to its outputs. The inputs are
             "requested" or "recommended," while the outputs are "approved." For example, requested
             changes are inputs and approved or rejected change requests are outputs; recommended cor-
             rective actions are inputs and approved corrective actions are outputs. The inputs for the Inte-
             grated Change Control process are as follows:
                  Project management plan
                  Requested changes
                  Recommended preventive actions
                  Recommended corrective actions
                  Recommended defect repair

                    398         Chapter 10           Monitoring and Controlling Change



                       Remember that the project management plan includes all the documents together that make
                    up that plan--the project schedule, budget, scope statement, and so on.


                    Integrated Change Control Tools and Techniques
                    We've seen all the tools and techniques for Integrated Change Control in previous processes:
                          Project management methodology
                          Project management information system
                          Expert judgment
                       The project management methodology tool and technique really comes in handy with this
                    process because part of this methodology defines how you'll perform change control. The
                    project management information system is used to document and track change information and
                    expert judgment helps determine the disposition of change requests.


                    Integrated Change Control Outputs
                    The outputs of the Integrated Change Control process are as follows:
                          Approved change requests
                          Rejected change requests
                          Project management plan updates
                          Project scope management plan updates
                          Approved corrective actions
                          Approved preventive actions
                          Approved defect repair
                          Validated defect repair
                          Deliverables
                       Project management plan updates are typically required as a result of an approved change or
                    corrective action. These changes are noted in the change control system or the configuration
                    management system and stakeholders are informed at the status meetings of the changes that
                    have occurred, their impacts, and where the description of the changes can be found.
                       All of the actions taken in the Integrated Change Control process (whether implemented or
                    not) should be documented. You should also record the reason for the variance. In other words,
                    how did this particular change request come about? How did it change the original project man-
                    agement plan? Is this something you could or should have known about in the Planning processes?
                    The corrective action taken and the justification for choosing that particular corrective action
                    should be noted as part of lessons learned also. You can use the information you capture here in
                    your configuration management system as lessons learned for future projects. When you take on
                    a new project, it's a good idea to review the lessons learned of similar projects so that you can plan
                    appropriately and avoid, where possible, the variances that occurred in the first project.

             Exam Spotlight

             "Recommended" corrective action is an output of several of the change control processes,
             including Scope Change Control, Schedule Control, Cost Control, Risk Monitoring and Control,
             and Perform Quality Control. "Approved" corrective action is an output of the Integrated
             Change Control process. Remember that Integrated Change Control is where all change
             requests are processed and either approved or denied. Also note that corrective action is an
             output of the Monitoring and Controlling processes and an input to the Executing processes.




             Managing Cost Changes
             The Cost Control process manages changes to project costs as outlined in the cost management
             plan. It's concerned with monitoring project costs to prevent unauthorized or incorrect costs from
             getting included in the cost baseline. This means you're also using Cost Control to assure that the
             project budget isn't exceeded (resulting in cost overruns) and that changes to the budget are man-
             aged and agreed to, to assure that unapproved changes are not made, to inform stakeholders of
             changes, and to actively manage expected cost overruns so they stay within acceptable limits.

             Cost Control Inputs
             The Cost Control process includes the following inputs:
                  Cost baseline
                  Project funding requirements
                  Performance reports
                  Work performance information
                  Approved change requests
                  Project management plan
             These inputs are examined using the tools and techniques of this process to determine if revised cost
             estimates or budget updates are required. We've covered each of these inputs in previous chapters.

             Cost Control Tools and Techniques
             The tools and techniques of the Cost Control process are as follows:
                  Cost change control system
                  Performance measurement analysis
                  Forecasting

                    400         Chapter 10           Monitoring and Controlling Change




                    Mustang Enterprises's New Accounting System

                    You are a stakeholder of the New Accounting System project for Mustang Enterprises. The
                    existing accounting system lives on a mainframe, and some of the programs used to process
                    data on this system are over 15 years old. Your company decided to hire a contract software
                    services firm to write a thin-client, browser-based version of the accounting system so that the
                    mainframe programs could be retired.

                    The project is in the Monitoring and Controlling process group and the contract project man-
                    ager keeps reporting that everything is okay and on schedule. When you asked him detailed
                    questions and requested performance data, the project manager patted you on the back and
                    said, "Don't worry, I've got everything under control."

                    You are a little worried because some of the key project team members have come to you con-
                    fidentially to inform you of the progress of the project.

                    After further investigation, you discover that the project manager changed the database from
                    SQL to Oracle midway through the project and didn't tell anyone except the project team. The
                    project scope stated specifically that project development required a SQL database. The
                    change in database products changed the project scope and product scope without letting the
                    stakeholders know.

                    This change has caused schedule delays because the project team members have told you they
                    need training in the new database development tools before they can proceed. Additionally,
                    many of the programs have already been written to interface with SQL, not Oracle, and will
                    have to be modified. To add insult to injury, the database switch will impact the project budget
                    in two ways. First, purchasing the Oracle database involves substantially more money than the
                    SQL database and it requires the purchase of new development tools for the programming
                    team. Second, several members of the programming staff will have to attend multiple training
                    sessions on the new database product to fully integrate the programs and system. Training is
                    currently running $2,200 per session per person.

                    Since you're a key stakeholder, you decide to bring the information you've discovered out into
                    the open at the next project status meeting. Additionally, you plan to meet with the project
                    sponsor and the procurement department to determine what alternatives you have to request
                    that the contracting firm replace the current project manager with a new project manager. This
                    may cause further setback to the project, but the project management plan and project sched-
                    ule will require updates anyway as a result of the existing project manager's decisions. You
                    also determine to document all that's happened as a lesson learned and to set up a change con-
                    trol process to prevent this from happening in the future.

                                                                              Managing Cost Changes           401




             Cost Change Control System
             The cost change control system describes how changes are submitted, approved, and tracked
             and is closely linked with the integrated change control system. Cost variances (both positive and
             negative) are calculated using the performance measurement analysis tool (specifically earned
             value techniques). We'll look at this next.

             Performance Measurement Analysis
             Performance measurement analysis is accomplished using a technique called earned value tech-
             nique (EVT). Simply stated, EVT compares what you got to what you spent.
                The EVT continuously monitors the planned value, earned value, and actual costs expended
             to produce the work of the project (we'll cover the definition of these terms shortly). When vari-
             ances that result in cost changes are discovered (including schedule variances and cost vari-
             ances), those changes are managed using the cost change control system. The primary function
             of this analysis technique is to determine and document the cause of the variance, to determine
             the impact of the variance (we'll do this with the EVT formulas shortly), and to determine if a
             corrective action should be implemented as a result.
                EVT looks at schedule, cost, and scope project measurements together and compares them
             to the actual work completed to date. It is the most often used performance measurement
             method. To perform the EVT calculations, you need to first gather the three measurements
             we mentioned earlier: the planned value (PV), actual cost (AC), and earned value (EV).
                Let's look at a definition of each of these before we dive into the actual calculations.


                                   If you do any research on your own regarding these values, you may come
                                   across acronyms that are different than what you see here. I've included their
                                   alternate names and acronyms at the end of each description. I recommend
                                   you memorize planned value (PV), actual cost (AC), and earned value (EV) and
                                   make certain you understand the meaning of each before progressing.


             Planned value The planned value (PV) is the cost of work that's been budgeted for a schedule
             activity or WBS component to be completed during a given time period. These budgets are estab-
             lished during the Planning processes. PV is also called budgeted cost of work scheduled (BCWS).



             Exam Spotlight

             Remember to read exam questions carefully. PV might mean present value (like we talked
             about in Chapter 2) or planned value as defined here.



             Actual cost Actual cost (AC) is the cost of completing the work (a schedule activity or WBS
             component) in a given time period. Actual costs may include direct and indirect costs but must
             correspond to what was budgeted for the activity. If the budgeted amount did not include indirect

                    costs, do not include them here. Later you'll see how to compare this to PV to come up with vari-
                    ance calculation results. AC is also called actual cost of work performed (ACWP)
                    Earned value Earned value (EV) is the value of the work (schedule activity or WBS component)
                    completed to date as it compares to the budgeted amount assigned to the work component. EV
                    is also called budgeted cost of work performed (BCWP)



                    Exam Spotlight

                    PV, AC, and EV are really easy to mix up. In their simplest forms, here's what each means:

                          PV = The approved budget assigned to work to be completed during a given time period

                          AC = Money that's actually been expended to date (or during a given time period) for com-
                          pleted work

                          EV = The value of the work completed to date compared to the budget



                       According to our earlier definition, EV is the sum of the cumulative budgeted costs for com-
                    pleted work for all activities that have been accomplished as of the measurement date. For
                    example, if your total budget is $1,000 and 50 percent of the work has been completed as of the
                    measurement date, your EV would equal $500. The PV, AC, and EV measurements can be plot-
                    ted graphically to show the variances between them. If there are no variances in the measure-
                    ments, all the lines on the graph remain the same, which means the project is progressing as
                    planned. Figure 10.1 shows an example that plots these three measurements.

                                                                            Managing Cost Changes           403



                All of these measurements include a cost component. Costs are displayed in an S curve
             because spending is minimal in the beginning of the project, picks up steam toward the middle,
             and then tapers off at the end of the project. This means your earned value measurements will
             also take on the S curve shape.
                Now you can calculate whether the project is progressing as planned using a variety of for-
             mulas discussed in the following sections. Use Figure 10.1 as your example for the formulas that
             follow. Figure 10.1 totals are as follows: PV = 400; EV = 375; AC = 325.

             Cost Variance
             Cost variance is one of the most popular variances that project managers use, and it tells you
             if costs are higher than budgeted (with a resulting negative number) or lower than budgeted
             (with a resulting positive number).
                 The cost variance (CV) is calculated as follows:
                  CV = EV - AC
                Let's calculate the CV using the numbers from Figure 10.1:
                  50 = 375 - 325
                The CV is positive, which means you're spending less than what you planned as of July 1
             (which Figure 10.1 shows because AC is below EV).
                If you come up with a negative number as the answer to this formula, it means that costs are
             higher than what you'd planned as of July 1.

             Schedule Variance
             Schedule variance, also a popular variance, tells you if the schedule is ahead or behind what was
             planned for this period in time. The schedule variance (SV) is calculated as follows:
                  SV = EV - PV
                Let's plug in the numbers:
                  -25 = 375 - 400
               The resulting schedule variance is negative, which means you are behind schedule, or behind
             where you planned to be as of July 1.
               Together, the CV and SV are known as efficiency indicators for the project.

             Performance Indexes
             Cost and schedule performance indexes are primarily used to calculate performance efficiencies.
             They're often used in trend analysis to predict future performance. You'll need to know the cal-
             culations and what the results mean. If your result in either formula is greater than 1, you've got
             better than expected performance. If the result is less than 1, you've got poor performance. If
             it equals 1, you're right on target.
                 The cost performance index (CPI) is calculated this way:
                  CPI = EV / AC
                Let's plug in the numbers and see where you stand.
                  1.15 = 375 / 325

                       This means cost performance is better than expected. You get an A+ on this assignment!
                       Cumulative CPI (CPIC) is a commonly used calculation to predict project costs at the completion
                    of the project. It also represents the cumulative CPI of the project at the point the measurement is
                    taken. First, you need to sum the earned value calculations taken to date (EVC) and the actual costs
                    to date (ACC). The formula looks just like the CPI formula only it uses the sums as follows:
                           CPIC = EVC / ACC
                        The difference between this and the CPI formula earlier is that the CPI formula is used for
                    a single work component whereas the CPIC is calculated using the sum of all the costs of all the
                    work components. Additionally, you may also use CPI to calculate the total cost of a work com-
                    ponent like a deliverable for example. Let's say you have a deliverable with 75 schedule activ-
                    ities that need to be completed. You would total the EV and AC at the measurement date for
                    all 75 schedule activities to determine the cost performance index for the deliverable.
                        The schedule performance index (SPI) is calculated this way:
                           SPI = EV / PV
                          Again, let's see where you stand with this example:
                           .94 = 375 / 400
                          Uh oh, not so good. Schedule performance is not what you expected. Let's not grade this one.

                    Forecasting
                    Forecasting uses the information you've gathered to date and estimates the future conditions or per-
                    formance of the project based on what you know when the calculation is performed. Forecasts are
                    based on work performance information (an output from the Executing process group). There are
                    two types of forecasting techniques: estimate to complete and estimate at completion. Each has three
                    variations. Both of these formulas use a new parameter we haven't seen yet called budget at com-
                    pletion (BAC). BAC is the sum of all the budget values established for all the work of the project.
                       Let's look at each of the techniques.

                    Estimate to Complete
                    Estimate to complete (ETC) tells you how much it will cost to complete all the work remaining
                    for a schedule activity or WBS component or the project. There is one variation of ETC that
                    doesn't require a formula. It's called ETC based on a new estimate. This is simply a revised esti-
                    mate based on the performance of the resources to date. By examining how quickly or how pro-
                    ductively the resources have been utilized so far, the project team can determine a noncalculated
                    ETC by looking at the remaining work and determining a new estimate based on the compar-
                    ison to past work. This ETC, according to A Guide to the PMBOK, is the most accurate and
                    comprehensive ETC calculation.
                       The two remaining ETC calculations use earned value data. These are quick to perform but
                    not as accurate as the project team manually examining the remaining work and making a new
                    estimate based on past performance.
                       When you believe that future cost variances will be similar to the types of variances you've
                    seen to date, you'll use this formula to calculate ETC:
                           ETC = (BAC - EVC) / CPIC
3601.book Page 405 Tuesday, July 12, 2005 11:17 PM




                                                                          Managing Cost Changes            405




               Assuming our EVC value is 725, CPIC value is 1.12, and BAC is 1000, let's plug in the
             numbers:
                  245.5 = (1000 - 725) / 1.12
                Therefore, at the measurement date (July 1), we need $245.50 to complete all the remaining
             work of this work component (or project if you're using project totals) assuming variances in
             the future will be the same as they have been to date.
                When you believe that future cost variances will not be similar to the types of variances
             you've seen to date, you'll use this formula to calculate ETC:
                  ETC = (BAC - EVC)
                Let's calculate our value:
                  275 = (1000 - 725)
                In this case, we need $275 to complete all the remaining work of this work component
             assuming variances in the future are different than they have been to date.

             Estimate at Completion
             There are only a few calculations remaining that will help you finish up your analysis of project
             progress. Estimate at completion (EAC) estimates (or forecasts) the expected total cost of a
             work component, schedule activity, or the project at its completion. This is the probable final
             value for the work component (or project).
                There are three ways to calculate EAC. The first one is EAC using a new estimate. This
             assumes that the original assumptions used when estimating were flawed or that changes have
             occurred that have changed the original estimates. ETC in this calculation is provided by the
             performing organization (the ETC based on a new estimate figure.) The formula looks like this:
                  EAC = ACC + ETC
                Assuming our ACC is 650 and ETC is 275, we get this:
                  925 = 650 + 275
                This means the expected total value of the project $925.
                The last two methods for calculating EAC are the most common. The first EAC uses CPIC
             and the second calculates EAC using remaining budget. Let's look at EAC using CPIC first.
                EAC using CPIC is the second way to perform an ETC calculation. This formula is the ACC
             plus ETC (when variances are typical). It looks like this:
                  EAC = ACC + ((BAC - EV) / CPIC)
                Our numbers look like this:
                  1096.43 = 650 + ((1000 - 500) / 1.12)
                When using the CPIC efficiency indicator and ETC with typical variances, our expected final
             value for this work component (or project) is $1,096.43.
                EAC using remaining budget is the ACC plus the budget needed to finish the remaining work.
             This calculation is used when you expect variances to be atypical. The formula looks like this:
                  EAC = ACC + BAC - EV
3601.book Page 406 Tuesday, July 12, 2005 11:17 PM




                    406         Chapter 10           Monitoring and Controlling Change



                          Our example project estimates looks like this using an EV value of 500:
                           1150 = 650 + 1000 - 500
                       Based on our remaining budget, the expected final value for this work component assuming
                    variances are atypical is $1,150.
                       For study purposes, the three EAC calculations are shown together next:
                           EAC = ACC + ETC (Use when you have a new estimate or when original assumptions
                           were flawed.)
                           EAC = ACC + ((BAC - EV) / CPIC) (Use when variances are typical.)
                           EAC = ACC + BAC - EV (Use when variances are atypical.)

                    Project Performance Reviews
                    Project performance reviews are similar to status reviews. They examine milestones due and
                    those that have been met. They also look at the costs associated with performance and schedule
                    activities that are over and under budget. Typically, performance reviews take place as meetings
                    and their purpose is to examine schedule activities, work packages, or cost account status and
                    their progress to date. There are three types of analyses associated with performance reviews:
                    variance analysis, trend analysis, and earned value technique. We've already covered the earned
                    value technique, so let's look at the other two.

                    Variance at Completion
                    Variance at completion (VAC) calculates the difference between the budget at completion and
                    the estimate at completion. It looks like this:
                           VAC = BAC - EAC
                          Use the most optimistic EAC number:
                           -171.43 = 925 - 1096.43
                       The negative number means you're not doing as well with costs as you anticipated and that
                    variance exists. As the project progresses, variances will become smaller.
                       Remember that variance analysis is a tool and technique of both Schedule Control and Scope
                    Control and this formula can be used in conjunction with the variance analysis tool and tech-
                    nique of these processes.

                    Trend Analysis
                    According to A Guide to the PMBOK, trend analysis determines if project performance is
                    improving or worsening over time by periodically analyzing project results. These results are
                    measured with mathematical formulas that attempt to forecast project outcomes based on his-
                    torical information and results. There are several formulas you can use to predict project trends,
                    but it's outside the scope of this book to go into them. For the exam, you're expected to under-
                    stand the concept behind trend analysis, not the formulas used to calculate it. You'll want to
                    remember that the results you've analyzed using trend analysis formulas can be used to predict
                    future project behavior or trends.

                                   You'll be given some scratch paper when you go into the exam. I recommend
                                   that you write these formulas down on a piece of your scratch paper before you
                                   start the exam and keep it handy. That way, the formulas are off your mind and
                                   you've got them in front of you to reference when you get to the portion of the
                                   exam where these questions appear. You might want to use this tip for other
                                   items you've memorized as well. If you write them down before you begin, you
                                   don't have to jog your memory on every question. If you forget something,
                                   leave a blank space where it goes and as soon as you remember it or see a
                                   question that reminds you what it is, fill in the blank.



             Project Management Software and Variance Management
             I know you thought we were done, but there a couple of remaining tools and techniques of this
             process you should know: project management software and variance management.
                We've discussed project management software before. Obviously, many of these calculations
             can be performed and monitored using project management software.
                Variance management includes the processes for managing cost variances and appropriate
             responses based on the impact and level of variance. The cost management plan should describe
             the variance management.


             Cost Control Outputs
             There are eight outputs to the Cost Control process:
                  Cost estimate updates
                  Cost baseline updates
                  Performance measurements
                  Forecasted completion
                  Requested changes
                  Recommended corrective actions
                  Organizational process asset updates (lessons learned)
                  Project management plan updates
                We've discussed most of these before or they are self-explanatory. However, I'll point out a
             few things you should be aware of for the exam.
                Updated cost estimates include updating original cost estimates and other areas of the project
             management plan that these estimates may impact. As an example, perhaps the cost estimate for
             new hardware required for your project was recently revised. Suppose the cost estimate was
             needed because the equipment originally planned for in the project is no longer available and
             new equipment is ordered in its place. This may require revisions to other project activities,
             which will require you to revisit the project Planning and Executing processes.

                    408         Chapter 10           Monitoring and Controlling Change




                    Recap of Formulas

                    There are a lot of formulas to memorize. Keep in mind that you'll be given a calculator when you
                    take the exam, so you don't have to do the math manually. Remember that EVT is used with both
                    the performance analysis measurement tool and technique and the project performance reviews
                    tool and technique. Variance and trend analysis are part of the project performance reviews tool
                    and technique. Here are the formulas we've covered in this chapter:

                    Performance measurements Cost variance: CV = EV - AC
                    Schedule variance: SV = EV - PV

                    Performance indexes Cost performance index: CPI = EV / AC
                    Cumulative cost performance index: CPI C = EVC / ACC
                    Schedule performance index: SPI = EV / PV

                    Forecasting       Estimate to complete (cost to complete remaining work)

                              Based on new estimate: manual calculation by project team

                              ETC with typical variances: ETC = (BAC - EV C) / CPIC

                              ETC with atypical variances: ETC = (BAC - EV C)

                              Estimate at completion (expected total cost at completion)

                              Using new estimate when assumptions are flawed: EAC = AC C + ETC

                              EAC using CPIC (typical variances): EAC = ACC + ((BAC - EV) / CPIC)

                              EAC using remaining budget (atypical variances): EAC = AC C + BAC - EV

                    Variance Analysis         Variance analysis: VAC = BAC - EAC

                    Remember that there are 12 formulas total (one is simply a manual calculation by the project
                    team). You might want to devise an acronym or some other mnemonic to help you memorize
                    them. For example, the earned value and performance index formulas are (based on the first
                    letter of each formula): C-S-C-C-S. The forecasting formulas are: ETC new; ETC typical, ETC
                    atypical; EAC new, EAC atypical, EAC typical.




                                           Cost Control problems come about for many reasons, including incorrect esti-
                                           mating techniques, predetermined or fixed budgets with no flexibility, schedule
                                           overruns, inadequate WBS development, and so on. Good project management
                                           planning techniques during the Planning processes may prevent cost problems
                                           later in the project. At a minimum, proper planning will reduce the impact of
                                           these problems if they do occur.

                                                     Monitoring and Controlling Schedule Changes              409




                Always inform appropriate stakeholders of revised cost estimates and any changes of signif-
             icant impact to the project. Keep them updated on changes, status, and risk conditions during
             regularly scheduled project meetings.



             Monitoring and Controlling
             Schedule Changes
             The Schedule Control process involves determining the status of the project schedule, determin-
             ing if changes have occurred or should, and influencing and managing schedule changes. In the
             following sections, we will look at this process's inputs, tools and techniques, and outputs.


             Schedule Control Inputs
             Schedule Control inputs include the following:
                  Schedule management plan
                  Schedule baseline
                  Performance reports
                  Approved change requests
                We've covered each of these inputs previously. Keep in mind that the Schedule Control pro-
             cess works hand in hand with the Integrated Change Control process covered earlier (as all the
             change control processes do).


             Schedule and Control Tools and Techniques
             The tools and techniques of the Schedule Control process are as follows:
                  Progress reporting

                    410         Chapter 10           Monitoring and Controlling Change



                    Schedule Change Control System
                    As you've probably already guessed, the schedule change control system works just like the cost
                    change control system, except that it defines how changes to the schedule are made and man-
                    aged. It tracks and records change requests, describes the procedures to follow to implement
                    schedule changes, and details the authorization levels needed to approve the schedule changes.


                                           Schedule changes may be potential hot buttons with certain stakeholders and
                                           can burn you if you don't handle them correctly. No one likes to hear that the
                                           project is going to take longer than originally planned. That doesn't mean you
                                           should withhold this information, however. Always report the truth. If you've
                                           been keeping your stakeholders abreast of project status, they should already
                                           know that the potential for schedule changes exists. Nevertheless, be prepared
                                           to justify the reason for the schedule change, or start dusting off your resume--
                                           one or the other.



                    Performance Measurement
                    Performance measurements for schedule control include the schedule variance and schedule
                    performance index. Both of these should be used to determine if corrective action is needed to
                    get the schedule back on track.

                    Variance Analysis
                    Variance analysis is a key factor in monitoring and controlling project time because this tech-
                    nique helps determine variances in schedule start and end dates. Comparing the estimated dates
                    to the actual or forecasted dates will show you where variances have occurred--or may occur--
                    and will allow you to implement corrective actions to keep the schedule on track.


                                           Keeping the schedule on track means you're monitoring and controlling time--
                                           one of the triple constraints.

                       Make sure to examine the float variance of the critical path activities. Thinking back to the
                    Schedule Development process, you'll recall that float is the amount of time you can delay start-
                    ing an activity without increasing the amount of time it takes to complete the project. Because
                    the activities with the least amount of float have the potential to cause the biggest schedule
                    delay, examine float variance in ascending order of critical activities.
                       However, not all schedule variances will impact the schedule. For example, a delay to a noncrit-
                    ical path task will not delay the overall schedule and may not need corrective action. Use caution
                    here though--if a delay occurs on a noncritical path task or its duration is increased for some reason,
                    that task can actually become part of the critical path. Delays to critical path tasks will always cause
                    delays to the project completion date and do require corrective action. Careful watch of the vari-
                    ances in schedule start and end dates helps you control the total time element of the project.

                                                         Monitoring and Controlling Schedule Changes                   411




             Project Management Software
             Project management software is used to track the actual schedule dates against planned schedule
             dates. One particular use for project management software in the Schedule Control process is to
             forecast the impacts of schedule changes (both potential changes and actual changes) to the schedule.

             Schedule Comparison Bar Charts
             The last tool and technique is the schedule comparison bar charts. This is a standard bar chart
             that depicts two bars for each schedule activity--one bar for the approved schedule baseline and
             one bar for the actual status.


             Schedule Control Outputs
             The Schedule Control process has the following outputs:
                  Schedule model data updates
                  Schedule baseline updates
                  Performance measurements
                  Requested changes
                  Recommended corrective action
                  Organizational process asset updates (lessons learned)
                  Activity list updates
                  Activity attributes updates
                  Project management plan updates
                Schedule data model updates involve adjusting activities and dates to coincide with
             approved changes and/or corrective actions and updating any schedule model data used to
             manage the project.
                Often, project schedule network diagrams require updates as a result of schedule model data
             updates. Don't forget to document these changes and inform your stakeholders.
                Changes to approved schedule start and end dates (in the schedule baseline) are called revi-
             sions. These generally occur as a result of a project scope change or changes to activity estimates
             and may result in a schedule baseline update. Schedule baseline updates occur when significant
             changes to the project schedule are made like the changes just mentioned. This means a new
             schedule baseline is established that reflects the changed project activity dates. Once the new
             baseline is established, it is used as the basis for future performance measurements. Never
             rebaseline a schedule without first saving a copy of the original baseline and schedule.


                                   Take care when rebaselining a project schedule because you may lose the original
                                   baseline information. Why do you care? Because the original baseline serves as
                                   historical information to reference for future projects. Make a backup copy of the
                                   original schedule so that you have a record of the original baseline as a reference.
                                   Even though some project management software allows you to save several base-
                                   lines plus the original, it's still good practice to make a backup copy of the original.

                    412         Chapter 10           Monitoring and Controlling Change



                       The performance measurements for Schedule Control are the schedule variance and schedule
                    performance index. I know this sounds like a broken record, but make certain to document this
                    information and communicate it to the stakeholders.
                       Changes to the project schedule may or may not require updates to other elements of the
                    project plan. For example, extending a schedule activity involving a contractor may impact the
                    costs associated with that activity.
                       Recommended corrective actions, as with other processes we've looked at, require root cause
                    analysis. In the Schedule Control process, because you're dealing with time issues, it's impera-
                    tive that you act as quickly as possible to implement corrective actions so that the schedule is
                    brought back in line with the plan and the least amount of schedule delay as possible is expe-
                    rienced. The remaining Schedule Control outputs have been discussed previously.



                    Monitoring and Controlling Risk
                    Now we'll shift our attention to risk. The Risk Monitoring and Control process primarily
                    involves identifying and responding to new risks as they occur. The other functions of this pro-
                    cess are as follows:
                          Tracking and monitoring identified risks
                          Evaluating risk response plans that are put into action as a result of risk events
                          Monitoring the project for risk triggers
                          Reexamining existing risks
                          Monitoring residual risks
                          Ensuring that policies and procedures are followed
                          Ensuring that risk response plans and contingency plans are put into action appropriately
                          and are effective
                          Contingency reserves (for schedule and cost) are updated
                       Risk Monitoring and Control is a busy process. During the course of the project, risk
                    responses (developed during the Planning process group) have been implemented and hopefully
                    reduced or averted the impact of risk events.


                    Risk Monitoring and Control Inputs
                    There are five inputs to this process:
                          Risk management plan
                          Risk register
                          Approved change requests
                          Work performance information
                          Performance reports
3601.book Page 413 Tuesday, July 12, 2005 11:17 PM




                                                                    Monitoring and Controlling Risk          413




                 You'll recall that the risk management plan details how risk is managed and the risk response
             plan describes how you will implement plans and strategies in the event of an actual risk event.
             Keep in mind that some risk events identified in risk planning will happen and some will not.
             You will have to stay alert for risk event occurrences and be prepared to respond to them when
             they do occur. This means you should monitor the risk register regularly.
                 Approved change requests can introduce new risks to the project. It's good practice to review
             all approved change requests for the potential for new threats or opportunities or in light of pre-
             viously identified risks and opportunities. They may also alter previously identified risks, which
             can mean action is needed during this process to bring response plans into alignment with the
             changes.
                 Work performance information gathered during the Performance Reporting process, cost
             changes, schedule changes, and/or scope changes may identify new risks.
                 Performance reports include information such as status reports, performance measurements,
             and forecasts. These should also be examined from the perspective of risks or risk response
             plans that may need close monitoring or changes to the response plans to coincide with the per-
             formance reports data.
                 Additional risk response planning may be needed to deal with the new risks or with expected
             risks whose impact was greater than expected. This may require repeating the Risk Response
             Planning process to create new contingency plans or alternative plans to deal with the risk, or
             it may require modification to existing plans.


             Risk Monitoring and Control Tools and Techniques
             The tools and techniques of Risk Monitoring and Control are used to monitor risks throughout the
             life of the project. Periodic reviews, audits, and new earned value analyses should be performed to
             check the pulse of risk activity and to make certain risk management is enacted effectively.
                 The tools and techniques of this process are as follows:
                  Risk reassessment
                  Risk audits
                  Variance and trend analysis
                  Technical performance measurement
                  Reserve analysis
                  Status meetings
                Let's look at risk reassessment, risk audits, and technical performance measurements next. We've
             examined all the other tools and techniques of this process in discussions of previous processes.

             Risk Reassessment
             Periodic, scheduled reviews of identified risks, risk responses, and risk priorities should occur
             during the project. The idea here is to monitor risks and their status and determine if their con-
             sequences still have the same impact on the project objectives as when they were originally
             planned. Every status meeting (another output of this process) should have a time set aside to
             discuss and review risks and response plans.

                    414         Chapter 10           Monitoring and Controlling Change



                       Risk identification and monitoring is an ongoing process throughout the life of the project.
                    Risks can change, and previously identified risks may have greater impacts than originally
                    thought as more facts are discovered. Reassessment of risks should be a regular activity per-
                    formed by everyone involved on the project. Monitor the risk register, including those risks that
                    have low scores, and risk triggers. You should also monitor the risk responses that have been
                    implemented for their effectiveness in dealing with risk. You may have to revisit the Qualitative
                    and Quantitative Risk Analysis processes when new risk consequences are discovered or risk
                    impacts are found to be greater than what was originally planned.

                    Risk Audits
                    Risk audits are carried out during the entire life of the project by risk auditors. Risk auditors
                    are not typically project team members and are expertly trained in audit techniques and risk
                    assessment. These audits are specifically interested in looking at the implementation and the
                    effective use of risk strategies.

                    Technical Performance Measurements
                    This tool and technique compares the technical accomplishments of project milestones com-
                    pleted during the Executing processes to the technical milestones defined in the project Planning
                    processes. Variances may indicate that a project risk is looming, and you'll want to analyze and
                    prepare a response to it if appropriate. For example, a technical milestone for a new computer
                    software project might require that the forms printed from a particular module include a bar
                    code at the bottom of the page. If the bar code functionality does not work once the module is
                    coded, a technical deviation exists, which means you should reexamine project risks. In this par-
                    ticular example, project scope is likely at risk.


                    Risk Monitoring and Control Outputs
                    Risk Monitoring and Control should occur throughout the life of the project. Identified risks are
                    monitored and plans are reexamined to determine if they will adequately resolve the risk as it
                    approaches during this process. Several outputs may come about as a result of monitoring risks:
                          Risk register updates
                          Requested changes
                          Recommended corrective action
                          Recommended preventive action
                          Organizational process updates (lessons learned, risk templates)
                          Project management plan updates
                       We've discussed many of these outputs before, so I'll just bring to your attention the new
                    points you need to know here.
                       The risk register should be updated under two conditions. The first condition is when a risk
                    audit or risk reassessment concludes that some element of the original risk information has
                    changed. For example, the impact or probability scores are updated to reflect new conditions,
3601.book Page 415 Tuesday, July 12, 2005 11:17 PM




                                                                      Monitoring and Controlling Risk            415




             or the priority of the risk has changed, or the response plan has been updated, and so on. The
             second condition for updating the risk register is when the risk needs to be closed. If you have
             a risk event occur, you'll record that in the risk register along with the effectiveness of the
             response plan. This information becomes an input to the Close Project Process, which we'll
             cover in the next chapter.
                Requested changes must be processed through the Integrated Change Control process. You
             may find a workaround is needed when implementing a requested change or recommended cor-
             rective action. A workaround is an unplanned response to a negative risk event. It attempts to
             deal with the risk in a productive, efficient manner. If no risk response plan exists (this might
             be the case when you accept a risk event during the Planning process), or an unplanned risk
             occurs, workarounds are implemented to deal with the consequences of the risk.



             Project Case Study: New Kitchen Heaven Retail Store

             Stakeholders have asked for an updated status on the project schedule as well as a remaining
             cost projection. You decide to provide several cost and schedule performance figures for the
             project on the status report.

             "Build-out is behind schedule. They were scheduled to be completed by the 15th of January,
             but they aren't going to finish up until the 24th."

             "What's that do to my schedule?" Jill asks. "I'm starting interviews for the store positions on
             the 16th. I hope to have that wrapped up by the 19th. As long as I have the majority of the staff
             hired by the 20th, we can have them stocking shelves starting the 22nd."

             You tell Jill, "Let's finish up the status of the other items, and I'll come back to that.

             You've calculated some performance measurements, including earned value measures, and
             you show them to Jill and Dirk (all figures are in millions of dollars):

                  BAC = 2; PV = 1.86; EVC = 1.75; ACC = 1.70

                  CPIC is 1.03. (1.75 / 1.70)

                  SPI is .94 (1.75 / 1.86)

                  EAC is 1.94 (1.70 + ((2 - 1.75) / 1.03)))

                  ETC is .24 (1.94 - 1.70)

             "What is all this telling us?" Dirk asks.

             "The cost performance index tells us we're getting a good return for the money spent on the
             project so far. In other words, we've experienced a $1.03 value for every dollar spent to date.

             "The schedule performance index isn't as cheery, but it's not dreadful news either. This perfor-
             mance indicator says that work is progressing at 94 percent of what we anticipated by this point.

                    cost $1.94 million. That's coming in under the original $2 million we had budgeted for comple-
                    tion, so we're on track with the project budget.

                    "The last figure is the estimated cost of the remaining work."

                    "It looks like we're a little behind schedule based on what you have figured here," Dirk says.

                    "Yes, that's correct," you reply. "That brings us back to Jill's question. I have two alternatives
                    to propose. One, we overlap the schedule and allow Gomez's crew to complete their work while
                    Jill's staff starts stocking shelves."

                    Jill says, "I don't like this option. We'll be tripping over each other, and I don't want merchan-
                    dise damaged by workers who are still dragging equipment around inside the store. What's
                    your other option?"

                    "We could ask Gomez to increase the crew size so that they complete on time according to the
                    contract. We have a provision in the contract that stipulates they add crew members if it looks
                    as though they'll miss the scheduled completion date. I will instruct the contract management
                    department to inform Gomez that we're requiring additional crew members."

                    "That will do the trick," Jill says. "We need the storefront to ourselves when stocking and pre-
                    paring for opening. I'm glad you had that stipulation in the contract."

                    Your next agenda item is change requests. Ricardo submitted a change request regarding the
                    hardware installation at the new store site. A new, much anticipated operating system was just
                    released, and Ricardo has plans to upgrade the entire company to the new operating system.
                    Since he must purchase new equipment for this store anyway, he contends that it makes sense
                    to go ahead and purchase the hardware with the newest operating system already loaded. His
                    staff won't have to upgrade this store as part of the upgrade project because the store will
                    already have the new operating system.

                    Ricardo's change request was submitted in writing through the change control system. A CCB
                    was set up during the Planning stages of this project to handle change requests. At the CCB
                    meeting, the following questions come up regarding Ricardo's request: Has the new operating
                    system been tested with the existing system? Are there compatibility problems? If so, what
                    risks are associated with getting the problems resolved and the equipment installed by open-
                    ing day? Is the vendor ready to ship with the new operating system?

                    The CCB defers their decision for this request until Ricardo gives them answers to these questions.

                                                                    Monitoring and Controlling Risk              417




             During the next CCB meeting, the board reviews a change request from Jill Overstreet. The
             gourmet food supplier she used went out of business a month or so ago, and Jill contracted
             with a new vendor. She received a sample shipment from the new vendor and was very
             unhappy with the results. Upon inspecting the products, she found broken containers and dam-
             aged packaging. Meanwhile, Jill found another vendor, who has sent her a sample shipment.
             She is very pleased with the new vendor's products and service. However, this vendor's prices
             are even higher than the first replacement vendor she contracted with. Jill submitted a cost
             change request to the CCB because of the increased cost of the gourmet food product ship-
             ment. The change in cost does not have a significant impact on the budget because the new
             EAC with this change is $1.90 million. The original project budget estimate was $2 million, so
             the project is still coming in under budget.

             You hold a seat on the CCB and are aware of the change requests and their impacts to the
             project. Ricardo satisfactorily answered all the questions the CCB had, so his request and Jill's
             request were both approved during the meeting.

                    418         Chapter 10           Monitoring and Controlling Change




                    Summary
                    This chapter examined several change control processes starting with Integrated Change Control.
                    Change control is an important part of the project process. It's your responsibility as project man-
                    ager to manage change and implement corrective action where needed to keep the project on track
                    with the plan.
                       Integrated Change Control concerns influencing the things that cause change and managing
                    the change once it has occurred. One or more of the triple constraints are generally affected
                    when change occurs. Managing change may involve changes to the project plan, the project
                    schedule, or the project budget. Changes that impact processes you've already completed
                    require updates to those processes. Corrective action is often a result of change and ensures that
                    the future performance of the project lines up with the project management plan.
                       Configuration management systems typically include change control systems that document
                    the procedures to manage change and how change requests are implemented. Change requests
                    may come in written or verbal forms, but ideally you should ask for all your change requests in
                    writing. Change requests are processed through a formal change control system, and configu-
                    ration control boards have the authority to approve or deny change requests.
                       Lessons learned become part of the historical information used on future projects. They also
                    are used to document the causes of the variances that occur on the project. Lessons learned are
                    updated as part of the organizational process asset outputs of the change control processes.
                       Schedule Control involves determining the status of the project schedule, determining if
                    changes have occurred or should, and influencing and managing schedule changes.
                       Cost Control involves managing changes to project costs. It's also concerned with monitor-
                    ing project costs to prevent unauthorized or incorrect costs from getting included in the cost
                    baseline. Cost Control uses tools and techniques like performance measurement analysis (such
                    as CV, SV, CPI, SPI), forecasting (ETC and EAC), and project performance reviews (variance
                    analysis, trend analysis, and EVT) to monitor costs.
                       Risk Monitoring and Control responds to risks as they occur and implements workarounds
                    for unplanned risk events. Some risks planned for during the Risk Response Planning process
                    will occur, and some will not. Perhaps risks that were previously identified do occur, and their
                    impacts are much greater than anticipated during the Risk Response Planning process. These
                    will require updates to the risk management plan or workarounds.



                    Exam Essentials
                    Name the purpose of the Integrated Change Control process. Integrated Change Control is per-
                    formed throughout the life of the project and involves reviewing all the project change requests, estab-
                    lishing a configuration management and change control process, and approving or denying changes.
                    Be able to define the purpose of a configuration management system. Configuration man-
                    agement systems are documented procedures that describe the process for submitting change
                    requests, the processes for tracking changes and their disposition, and processes for defining the
                    approval levels for approving and denying changes, and it includes a process for authorizing the

             changes. Change control systems are generally a subset of the configuration management sys-
             tem. Configuration management also describes the characteristics of the product of the project
             and ensures accuracy and completeness of the description.
             Be able to describe a CCB. The configuration control board (CCB) has the authority to
             approve or deny change requests. Their authority is defined and outlined by the organization.
             Name the purpose of the Cost Control process. The Cost Control process is concerned with
             monitoring project costs to prevent unauthorized or incorrect costs from getting included in the
             cost baseline.
             Be able to describe performance measurement techniques. Performance measurement tech-
             niques use the earned value technique (EVT) to continuously monitor the planned value, earned
             value, and actual costs expended to produce the work of the project. There are performance
             measures, performance indexes, forecasting, and variance analysis techniques.
             Describe the purpose of Risk Monitoring and Control Risk Monitoring and Control
             involves identifying and responding to new risks as they occur. Risk monitoring and reassess-
             ment should occur throughout the life of the project.

                        is to develop a website for the company that allows retailers to place their flower orders online.
                        You will also provide a separate link for individual purchases that are ordered, packaged, and
                        mailed to the consumer directly from the grower's site. This project involves coordinating the
                        parent company, growers, and distributors. You are preparing a performance review and have
                        the following measurements at hand: PV = 300, AC = 200, and EV = 250. What do you know
                        about this project?
                          A. The EAC is a positive number, which means the project will finish under budget.
                          B. You do not have enough information to calculate CPI.
                          C. The CV is a negative number in this case, which means you've spent less than you planned
                             to spend as of the measurement date.
                          D. The CV is a positive number in this case, which means you're under budget as of the mea-
                             surement date.

                    13. A negative result from an SV calculation means which of the following?
                          A. PV is higher than EV.
                          B. PV equals 1.
                          C. EV is higher than PV.
                          D. EV is higher than AC.

                    14. You are a contract project manager for a wholesale flower distribution company. Your project
                        is to develop a website for the company that allows retailers to place their flower orders online.
                        You will also provide a separate link for individual purchases that are ordered, packaged, and
                        mailed to the consumer directly from the grower's site. This project involves coordinating the
                        parent company, growers, and distributors. You are preparing a performance review and have
                        the following measurements at hand: PV = 300, AC = 200, and EV = 250. What is the CPI of
                        this project?
                          A. 0.80
                          B. 1.25
                          C. 1.5

                    424         Chapter 10           Monitoring and Controlling Change




                    Answers to Review Questions
                    1.    B. Integrated Change Control, Schedule Control, and Cost Control are all concerned with three
                          things: influencing the things that cause change, determining that change is needed or has hap-
                          pened, and managing the change.

                    2.    D. Change control systems are documented procedures that describe how to submit change
                          requests. They track the status of the change requests, document the management impacts of
                          change, track the change approval status, and define the level of authority needed to approve
                          changes. Change control systems do not approve or deny the changes--that's the responsibility
                          of the configuration control board (CCB).

                    3.    C. The key to this question was that the characteristics of the product were documented with
                          this tool. Configuration management documents the physical characteristics and the function-
                          ality of the product of the project.

                    4.    C. Configuration control boards (CCBs) review change requests and have the authority to
                          approve or deny them. Their authority is defined by the organization.

                    5.    B. Schedule variances will sometimes--but not always--impact the schedule. Changes to non-
                          critical path tasks will not likely impact the schedule, but changes to critical path tasks will
                          always impact the schedule.

                    6.    C. Cost Control tracks project performance to detect variances and reflect them in the cost base-
                          line. It's also used to prevent inappropriate changes from getting into the cost baseline.

                    7.    D. Budget updates may require cost rebaselining.

                    8.    A. The three activities associated with configuration management include configuration identi-
                          fication, configuration status accounting, and configuration verification and auditing.

                    9.    B. Configuration identification involves identifying the products of the project, determining the
                          status of changes to the configuration, and verifying and auditing the configuration to determine
                          if the performance and functional requirements have been met.

                    10. Answer: A. Schedule variance is (EV - PV) and schedule performance index is (EV / PV).

                    11. C. Earned value is referred to as the value of the work that's been completed to date compared
                        to the budget.

                    12. D. The CV is a positive number and is calculated by subtracting AC from EV as follows: 250 -
                        200 = 50. A positive CV means the project is coming in under budget, meaning you've spent less
                        than you planned as of the measurement date.

                    13. A. The SV calculation is EV - PV. If PV is a higher number than EV, you'll get a negative number
                        as a result.

                    14. B. CPI is calculated as follows: EV / AC. In this case, 250 / 200 = 1.25.
3601.book Page 425 Tuesday, July 12, 2005 11:17 PM




                                                                       Answers to Review Questions             425




             15. B. When variances are not expected to continue, or are atypical in nature, EAC is calculated as
                 follows: ACC + BAC - EV. Therefore, the calculation for this question looks like this: (200 +
                 800) - 250 = 750.

             16. C. The correct formula for ETC for this question is as follows: BAC - EVC. Therefore, ETC is
                 as follows: 375 - 250 = 125.

             17. A. When variances are expected to continue, EAC is calculated as follows: ACC + ((BAC - EV)
                 / CPIC). Therefore, the calculation for this question looks like this: 200 + ((800 - 250) / 1.25)
                 = 640.

             18. D. You first have to calculate EAC in order to calculate VAC. EAC for variances that are atypical
                 is ACC + BAC - EV. So our numbers are 275 + 500 - 250 = 525. VAC is calculated this way: BAC
                 - EAC. Therefore, 500 - 525 = -25. Our costs are not doing as well as anticipated.

             19. C. You must first calculate CPIC in order to calculate ETC. CPIC is EVC / ACC. We have 250 /
                 275 = .91. ETC with typical variances is (BAC - EVC) / CPIC. Our numbers are (500 - 250) /
                 .91 = 274.7.

             20. B. Workarounds are unplanned responses. Workarounds deal with negative risk events as they
                 occur. As the name implies, workarounds were not previously known to the project team. The
                 risk event was unplanned, so no contingency plan existed to deal with the risk event, and thus
                 it required a workaround.

                                                     You've made it to the homestretch. This chapter covers the last
                                                     group of project processes. We'll close out the Monitoring and
                                                     Controlling process group and also discuss the Closing process
                    group. Most of the hard part is over, but you aren't quite done yet.
                        In the Monitoring and Controlling group, we'll cover Perform Quality Control, Scope Ver-
                    ification, and Scope Control. The Perform Quality Control process involves several new tools
                    and techniques that may show up on the exam. Take some time here to understand the tools and
                    techniques in the Perform Quality Control process and to differentiate them from the tools
                    and techniques associated with the Quality Planning and Perform Quality Control processes.
                    Remember that Perform Quality Control tools and techniques are listed as tools and tech-
                    niques for the Perform Quality Assurance process. Scope Verification involves verifying and
                    accepting work results. Scope Control is like the change control processes we discussed in
                    Chapter 10 and is concerned with controlling changes to project scope.
                        The Closing process group has two processes: Close Project and Contract Closure. The Close
                    Project process is concerned with verifying that the work of the project was completed correctly
                    and to the stakeholders' satisfaction. Contract Closure supports the Close Project process and
                    also verifies that the work of the project was completed correctly and the deliverables accepted.
                        Project closeout is the most often neglected process of all the project processes. Once the
                    project is over, it's easy to pack things up, throw some files in a drawer, and start moving right
                    into planning the next project. However, don't be so quick to chuck your project just yet. There
                    are a few things to take care of during this process that might make life easier for you on the next
                    project.
                        One of the most important functions of this process is obtaining formal acceptance of the
                    product of the project from stakeholders and customers. You'll want to get an official sign-off
                    from the stakeholders acknowledging acceptance of the product and then file this with the
                    project documents.

                    Control Techniques
                    Quality Planning, Perform Quality Assurance, and Perform Quality Control are part of the
                    project Quality Management Knowledge Area. These processes work together to define and
                    monitor the work of the project and to make certain the results meet the quality requirements
                    laid out in the plan.

                                                       Utilizing Perform Quality Control Techniques            429




                Perform Quality Control is specifically concerned with monitoring work results to see if they
             comply with the standards set out in the quality management plan. Perform Quality Control
             should be practiced and performed throughout the project to identify and remove the causes of
             unacceptable results. Remember that Perform Quality Control is concerned with project results
             both from a management perspective, such as schedule and cost performance, and from a prod-
             uct perspective. In other words, the end product should conform to the requirements and product
             description defined during the Planning processes.


             Perform Quality Control Inputs
             Perform Quality Control includes the following inputs:
                  Quality management plan
                  Quality metrics
                  Quality checklists
                  Organizational process assets
                  Work performance information
                  Approved change requests
                  Deliverables
                We've discussed each of these inputs previously, so let's move on to tools and techniques.


             Perform Quality Control Tools and Techniques
             This list of tools and techniques in the Perform Quality Control process includes several that
             haven't been discussed before:
                  Cause-and-effect diagram
                  Control charts
                  Flowcharting
                  Histogram
                  Pareto chart
                  Run chart
                  Scatter diagram
                  Statistical sampling
                  Inspection
                  Defect repair review
                The primary purpose of each of these tools is to examine the product and/or the project pro-
             cesses for conformity to standards. If the results fall within the tolerance range specified, the
             results are acceptable. Alternatively, if the results fall within the control limits set for the prod-
             uct (as defined by the various tools and techniques we'll discuss in the following sections), the

                    process is said to be in control. Spend time understanding these tools and techniques and their
                    individual uses because there may be exam questions on each of them.
                        We talked about cause-and-effect diagrams as a diagramming technique in the Risk Identification
                    process in Chapter 5, "Risk Planning." If you need a refresher, refer to Figure 5.2 in that chapter.
                        We also discussed flowcharts in the same section of Chapter 5. Flowcharts are diagrams that
                    show the logical steps that must be performed in order to accomplish an objective. They can also show
                    how the individual elements of a system interrelate. Flowcharting can help identify where qual-
                    ity problems might occur on the project and how problems happen. This is important because
                    it allows the project team the opportunity to develop alternative approaches for dealing with
                    anticipated quality problems identified with this tool and technique.
                        Histograms are typically bar charts that depict the distribution of variables over time. There is
                    an example histogram in Chapter 6, "Resource Planning." In Perform Quality Control, the his-
                    togram usually depicts the attributes of the problem or situation. (We'll discuss attributes shortly.)
                        We will look at the other tools and techniques in more detail in the following sections.

                    Control Charts
                    Control charts measure the results of processes over time and display the results in graph form.
                    Control charts are a way to measure variances to determine if process variances are in control
                    or out of control.
                        A control chart is based on sample variance measurements. From the samples chosen and
                    measured, the mean and standard deviation are determined. Perform Quality Control is usually
                    maintained--or said to be in control--within plus or minus three standard deviations. In other
                    words, Perform Quality Control says that if the process is in control (that is, the measurements
                    fall within the control limits), you know that 99.73 percent of the parts going through the pro-
                    cess will fall within an acceptable range of the mean. If you discover a part outside of this range,
                    you should investigate and determine if corrective action is needed.
                        Figure 11.1 illustrates an example control chart.

                                                        Utilizing Perform Quality Control Techniques             431



                 You've determined from your sample measurements that 5 mm is the mean in the example con-
             trol chart. One standard deviation equals 0.02. Three standard deviations on either side of the mean
             become your upper and lower control points on this chart. Therefore, if all control points fall within
             plus or minus three standard deviations on either side of the mean, the process is in control. If points
             fall outside of the acceptable limits, the process is not in control and corrective action is needed.
                 Control charts are used most often in manufacturing settings where repetitive activities are
             easily monitored. For example, the process that produces widgets by the case lot must meet cer-
             tain specifications and fall within certain variances to be considered in control. However, you
             aren't limited to using control charts only in the manufacturing industry. They can be used to
             monitor any output. You might consider using control charts to track and monitor project man-
             agement processes. You could plot cost variances, schedule variances, frequency or number of
             scope changes, and so on to help monitor variances in the project management process.

             Pareto Chart
             You have probably heard of the 80/20 rule. Vilfredo Pareto is the person credited with discov-
             ering this rule. He observed that 80 percent of the wealth and land ownership in Italy was held
             by 20 percent of the population. Over the years, others have shown that the 80/20 rule applies
             across many disciplines and areas. As an example, generally speaking, 80 percent of the deposits
             of any given financial institution are held by 20 percent of its customer base. Let's hope that rule
             doesn't apply to project managers though, with 20 percent of the project managers out there
             doing 80 percent of the work!
                According to Pareto, the 80/20 rule as it applies to quality says that a small number of causes
             (20 percent) create the majority of the problems (80 percent). Have you ever noticed that with
             your project or department staff? It always seems that just a few people cause the biggest head-
             aches. But we're getting off track.
                Pareto charts are displayed as histograms that rank-order the most important factors such as
             delays, costs, defects, or other factors by their frequency over time. His theory is that you get
             the most benefit if you spend the majority of your time fixing the most important problems. The
             information shown in Table 11.1 is plotted on an example Pareto chart shown in Figure 11.2.

                       The problems are rank-ordered according to their frequency and percentage of defects.
                    The defect frequencies in this figure are shown as black bars, and the cumulative percentages of
                    defects are plotted as circles. The rank-ordering of these problems shows you where corrective
                    action should be taken first. You can see in Figure 11.2 that problem A should receive priority
                    attention because the most benefit will come from fixing this problem.

                    Run Charts
                    Run charts are used to show variations in the process over time or to show trends (like improve-
                    ments or lack of improvements) in the process. Differences in results will occur in processes
                    because there is no such thing as a perfect process. When processes are considered in control,
                    differences in results may occur due to common causes of variances or special cause variances.
                       Common causes of variances come about as a result of circumstances or situations that are rel-
                    atively unique to the process you're using and are easily controlled at the operational level. Per-
                    haps a machine needs calibration or procedures for the process need refinement. Perhaps your
                    process is very detailed, with specific procedures that are carried out to produce the output. Not
                    following these detailed procedures could result in variances known as special cause variances.
                       For the exam, you should understand the three types of variances that make up common
                    causes of variances:
                    Random variances Random variations may be normal, depending on the processes you're using
                    to produce the product or service of the project, but they occur as the name implies, at random.
                    Known or predictable variances Known or predictable variances are variances that you know
                    exist in the process.
                    Variances that are always present in the process The process itself will have inherent variabil-
                    ity that is perhaps caused by human mistakes, machine variations or malfunctions, the environ-
                    ment, and so on, which are known as variances always present in the process.

                Common cause variances that do not fall within the acceptable range are difficult to correct
             and usually require a reorganization of the process. This has the potential for significant impact, and
             decisions to change the process always require management approval.



             Exam Spotlight

             According to A Guide to the PMBOK, when a process is in control, it should not be adjusted. It's
             okay to change the process to bring about improvements, but it should not be adjusted.



                Trend analysis is another technique that's carried out using run charts. Trend analysis in the Per-
             form Quality Control process is a mathematical technique that uses historical results to predict
             future outcomes. Trend analysis often tracks variances in cost and schedule performance by moni-
             toring the number of activities completed with significant variances within a certain time period.
             This information can then be used to forecast future performance. Trend analysis also tracks tech-
             nical performance by determining the number of defects observed and the number of defects not cor-
             rected. Technical performance measurements compare the technical accomplishments of project
             milestones completed to the technical milestones defined in the project Planning process group.

             Scatter Diagrams
             Scatter diagrams use two variables, one called an independent variable, which is an input, and
             one called a dependent variable, which is an output. Scatter diagrams display the relationship
             between these two elements as points on a graph. As an example, maybe your scatter diagram
             plots the ability of your employees to perform a certain task. Their experience performing this
             task in months is plotted as the independent variable on the X axis, and their score--the depen-
             dent variable--is plotted on the Y axis.
                The important thing to remember about scatter diagrams is that they plot the dependent and
             independent variables and the closer the points resemble a diagonal line, the closer these vari-
             ables are related. A sample scatter diagram is shown in Figure 11.3.

             Statistical Sampling
             Statistical sampling involves taking a sample number of parts from the whole population
             and examining them to determine if they fall within the variances outlined by the Perform
             Quality Control plan. Perhaps you determine to statistically sample 25 parts out of a lot or
             run. The quality plan outlines that the lot will pass if four parts or fewer fall outside the
             allowable variance.
                Statistical sampling may also involve determining the standard deviation for a process as dis-
             cussed in the control chart tool and technique. The quality plan determines if plus or minus two
             standard deviations--95.44 percent of the population--is adequate or if plus or minus three stan-
             dard deviations--99.73 percent--is adequate.

                    Inspection
                    Inspection involves physically looking at, measuring, or testing results to determine if they con-
                    form to the requirements or quality standards. It's a tool used to gather information and improve
                    results. Inspections might occur after the final product is produced or at intervals during the devel-
                    opment of the product to examine individual components. Acceptance decisions are made when
                    the work is inspected and the work is either accepted or rejected. When work is rejected, it might
                    have to go back through the process for rework.



                    Exam Spotlight

                    Don't confuse inspection with prevention; they're two different things. Inspection keeps errors
                    in the product from reaching the customer. Prevention keeps errors from occurring in the pro-
                    cess. It always costs less to prevent problems in the first place than it does to fix problems built
                    into the product after the fact. Rework, labor costs, material costs, and potential loss of cus-
                    tomers are all factors to consider when weighing prevention costs versus the cost of rework.
                    Philip Crosby developed the theory of zero defects, which deals with prevention costs. Loosely
                    translated, zero defects means doing it right the first time.



                       Inspection may take actual measurements of components to determine if they meet require-
                    ments. Maybe a component part for your product must be exactly 5 mm in length. In order to
                    pass inspection, the parts are measured and must meet the 5 mm length requirement. If they
                    measure 5 mm, they pass; if they do not, they fail.
3601.book Page 435 Wednesday, July 13, 2005 1:39 PM




                                                         Utilizing Perform Quality Control Techniques          435




                Measurements can vary even if the variances are not noticeable. Machines wear down, people
             make mistakes, the environment may cause variances, and so on. Measurements that fall within
             a specified range are called tolerable results. So, instead of 5 mm exactly, maybe a range between
             4.98 mm and 5.02 mm is an acceptable or tolerable measurement for our component. If the sam-
             ples that are measured fall within the tolerable range, they pass; otherwise, they fail inspection.
                One inspection technique uses measurements called attributes. The measurements taken dur-
             ing attribute sampling determine whether they meet one of two options, conforming or non-
             conforming. In other words, the measurements conform or meet the requirement, or they do not
             conform. This can also be considered a pass/fail or go/no-go decision.
                Attribute conformity and inspections are not necessarily performed on every component part
             or every end product that's produced. That's time consuming and inefficient when you're produc-
             ing numerous components. Inspection in cases like this is usually performed on a sampling of parts
             or products where every X number of parts is tested for conformity or measurement specifics.
                Inspection will tell you where problems exist and give you the opportunity to correct them,
             thus leading to quality improvements. The other tools and techniques we'll talk about in these
             sections also lead to quality improvements in the product or process, or both. Quality improve-
             ments are an output of the Perform Quality Control process.

             Defect Repair Review
             In this tool and technique, the quality control department will review the repairs that were made
             (as a result of quality audits) to make certain the repairs were made correctly and that the deliv-
             erable, or product of the project, is in compliance. You'll remember that approved defect repairs
             are a result of a quality audit performed during the Perform Quality Assurance process or an
             inspection as part of the Perform Quality Control process. (Approved defect repairs are an input
             to the Direct and Manage Project Execution process.) Defect repairs correct problems you find
             with the product of the project. Now you'll examine those repairs to make certain they cor-
             rected the problem.


             Perform Quality Control Outputs
             Quality improvements, as mentioned in the Perform Quality Assurance process discussed Chap-
             ter 9, are a primary goal of the quality processes. Failure to meet quality requirements can have
             a significant impact on the project and the project team and may result in rework. Rework will
             cause a project to take longer than originally planned because the project team has to repeat
             processes already completed to correct the work. You should try to keep rework to a minimum
             so as not to impact the project schedule. Rework has the potential to cause morale issues as well,
             especially if the team members thought they were doing a good job all along. Rework may
             require the project team to put in extra long hours, which in turn may cause more errors or other
             negative consequences. Monitor quality periodically so that rework is kept to a minimum.


                                   Perform Quality Assurance is concerned with assuring that the project is using
                                   the correct and most efficient processes to meet the project requirements while
                                   Perform Quality Control is concerned with the accuracy of the project results.

                    436         Chapter 11         Controlling Work Results and Closing Out the Project




                    The Never-Ending Bridge Project

                    One of the main thoroughfares into your city requires a bridge replacement. You were appointed
                    the project manager for the city and have managed this project since its initiation 15 months ago.

                    The project entailed hiring a contractor to build and construct the new bridge and then managing
                    the contract and the work of the contracting agency to bring the project to a successful completion.

                    Approximately 28,000 vehicles travel across this bridge on a daily basis, carrying commuters and col-
                    lege students back and forth to the downtown area. One of the requirements was the closure of no
                    more than three of the six lanes of traffic at one time during construction. Another requirement stated
                    that two coats of paint were to be applied to the steel before bringing it on-site, and a third coat of
                    paint was to be applied at the site after construction. The paint is guaranteed to last 25 to 30 years.

                    You assisted the Perform Quality Control department with a recent inspection. The inspection
                    revealed that some of the paint was peeling. After further investigation, you discovered that the
                    contractor did not allow the first coat of paint to cure properly, so when the second coat was
                    applied, it didn't stick correctly and peeled and flaked in places.

                    You've instructed the contractor that according to the terms of the contract and the SOW spec-
                    ifications, they're required to apply three coats of paint to the bridge as part of the work of the
                    project. Corrective action is needed to get this project back on track. As a result, the contract
                    company decides to subcontract out the paint work to another company while they finish up
                    their remaining tasks on the project.

                    Unfortunately, the subcontractor that was hired found they were in way over their heads and were
                    not able to complete the paint job. Several months have passed, and the original project comple-
                    tion date was missed long ago. Obviously, revisions to the project schedule were required when it
                    became clear that the subcontractor wasn't going to make the date. Now another revision to the
                    project schedule is necessary due to the subcontractor's failure to complete the painting task.

                    The original contractor did some searching and found another subcontractor capable of com-
                    pleting the painting job. It's now the middle of winter. Because the temperatures are cold, the
                    painting crew must hang insulated tarps between the bays on the bridge and use heaters to
                    warm up small areas of steel to the proper temperature to apply the paint. This process has
                    extended the completion date of this activity by over three times its original estimate and ulti-
                    mately delayed the completion of the project by two years.

                    Corrective action was taken as a result of the inspection, and eventually the project was com-
                    pleted, but not without schedule delays, schedule changes, scope changes, and rework--not to
                    mention the increased cost to the original contractor. Since the contract was a fixed-price con-
                    tract, the contractor's profit was eaten away paying for the painting job. The cost to correct the
                    quality issue did not impact the city, but it did impact the contractor. This is a case where an
                    ounce of prevention would have been worth a pound of cure, as the old saying goes.

                                                                             Verifying Project Scope        437




                Perform Quality Control has several outputs:
                  Quality control measurements
                  Validated defect repair
                  Quality baseline updates
                  Recommended corrective actions
                  Recommended preventive actions
                  Requested changes
                  Recommended defect repair
                  Organizational process asset updates (checklists, lessons learned)
                  Validated deliverables
                  Project management plan updates
                We've already discussed many of these outputs, but I'll add a few quick notes here.
                Validated defect repairs are the results of defects that have been corrected and examined.
             Recommended corrective and preventive actions may result in quality improvements. Remem-
             ber that processes that are in control can be changed to bring about improvements, but pro-
             cesses in control should not be adjusted. Processes out of control may require adjusting, but this
             should occur only as a result of a management decision.
                Recommended defect repairs may also result from this process. The quality control department
             or team will identify the defects using the tools and techniques of this process and the defects
             should be logged in a database or some other tracking tool to keep track of status and resolution.
                Completed checklists become part of the project's documentation and are included as part
             of the organizational process asset updates. Lessons learned should include the causes of vari-
             ances found during this process and why the corrective actions were recommended.
                Validated deliverables are the result of the work of the project. This output assures that the
             deliverables meet the quality standards outlined in the quality management plan.



             Verifying Project Scope
             Managing and reporting on project progress is the primary focus of the Monitoring and Con-
             trolling processes. One of the Monitoring and Controlling processes that helps manage and con-
             trol project progress is the Scope Verification process.
                The inputs of the Scope Verification are the project scope statement, WBS dictionary, project
             scope management plan, and deliverables. This process involves evaluating these inputs to
             determine if the work is complete and if it satisfies the project objectives. Evaluation is per-
             formed using inspection, which is the only tool and technique of this process. You should per-
             form Scope Verification--even if the project is canceled--to document the degree to which the
             project was completed. This serves as historical information, and if the project is ever started up
             again, you've got documentation that tells you what was completed and how far the project
             progressed.

                    438         Chapter 11         Controlling Work Results and Closing Out the Project




                    Exam Spotlight

                    The most important thing you should know about the Scope Verification process is that Scope
                    Verification formalizes the acceptance of the project scope and is primarily concerned with the
                    acceptance of work results. Don't confuse this process with the Perform Quality Control pro-
                    cess that we just discussed.

                    You can remember the difference between Scope Verification and Perform Quality Control this way:

                          Scope Verification = accepting work results

                          Perform Quality Control = checking for correct work results (assuring that the quality
                          requirements are met)



                       The outputs of Scope Verification are accepted deliverables, requested changes, and recom-
                    mended corrective actions. Accepted deliverables concern the formal acceptance of the work by
                    the stakeholders. Remember that stakeholders include customers, the project sponsor, the
                    project team, the management team, and so on. Document their acceptance with formal sign-
                    off and file it in your project notebook.



                    Controlling Scope Changes
                    The Scope Management Knowledge Area includes Scope Planning, Scope Definition, Create
                    WBS, Scope Verification, and Scope Control. You'll recall that project scope describes the work
                    required to produce the product or service of the project. This includes the requirements of the
                    product, which describe the features and functionality of the product or service. Product scope,
                    on the other hand, is the description of the product features. The product description is the doc-
                    ument that defines the characteristics of the product or service of the project.
                        You can conclude from this that the Scope Control process involves changes to the project
                    scope. Any modification to the agreed-upon WBS is considered a scope change. (It's been eons
                    ago that we looked at this so remember that the WBS, or work breakdown structure, is a
                    deliverables-oriented hierarchy that defines the total work of the project.) This means that the
                    addition or deletion of activities or modifications to the existing activities on the WBS con-
                    stitute a project scope change.
                        Changes in product scope will require changes to the project scope as well. Let's say one of
                    your project deliverables is the design of a piece of specialized equipment that's integrated into your
                    final product. Now let's say that due to engineering setbacks and some miscalculations, the spe-
                    cialized equipment requires design modifications. The redesign of this equipment impacts the
                    end product, or product scope. Since changes to the product scope impact the project require-
                    ments, which are detailed in the scope document, changes to project scope are also required.
3601.book Page 439 Wednesday, July 13, 2005 1:39 PM




                                                                       Controlling Scope Changes           439




             This change, along with recommended corrective actions, should be processed through the Inte-
             grated Change Control process.


             Scope Control Inputs
             There are seven inputs to the Scope Control process, all of which you've seen before:
                  Project scope statement
                  WBS
                  WBS dictionary
                  Project scope management plan
                  Performance reports
                  Approved change requests
                  Work performance information
                The first four inputs were covered in the Planning process group and the last three were dis-
             cussed in the Monitoring and Controlling process group.


             Scope Control Tools and Techniques
             There are four tools and techniques of the Scope Control process:
                  Change control system
                  Variance analysis
                  Replanning
                  Configuration management system
                 The change control system here is just like the one described in the discussion of the Inte-
             grated Change Control process. It tracks and records change requests, describes the procedures
             to follow to implement scope change, and details the authorization levels needed to approve the
             changes. When your project is performed under contract, scope changes will also require con-
             formance to the provisions of the contract and the contract change system.
                 Variance analysis includes reviewing project performance measurements to determine if
             there are variances in project scope. It's also important to determine the cause of variances and
             examine those against the scope baseline so that you can implement corrective actions if needed.
                 Replanning involves updating the WBS, WBS dictionary, project scope statement, and
             project management plan when a change in scope has occurred.
                 If you are using a configuration management system to control product scope, the change
             control system must also integrate with it. The configuration management system manages
             changes to product and project scope and assures that these changes are reasonable and make
             sense before they're processed through the Integrated Change Control process.

                    440         Chapter 11         Controlling Work Results and Closing Out the Project




                    Scope Control Outputs
                    The outputs of the Scope Control process are as follows:
                          Project scope statement updates
                          WBS updates
                          WBS dictionary updates
                          Scope baseline updates
                          Requested changes
                          Recommended corrective action
                          Organizational process assets update
                          Project management plan updates
                       Let's take a look at project scope statement changes and scope baseline updates. The remain-
                    ing outputs have all been discussed previously.
                       Changes to scope will likely require that you run back through the project Planning processes
                    and make any needed adjustments. This also means you'll need to update the project scope
                    statement so it accurately reflects the project work after the change.
                       Scope changes include any changes to the project scope as defined by the agreed-upon WBS.
                    This in turn may require changes or updates to project objectives, costs, quality measures or con-
                    trols, or time in the form of schedule revisions. Scope changes always require schedule revisions.


                                          Schedule revisions are always needed as a result of scope changes. But not
                                          all scope changes will necessarily cause increases to the project schedule.
                                          Some scope changes may reduce the number of hours needed to complete
                                          the project, which in turn may reduce the project budget.

                        When scope changes are requested, all areas of the project should be investigated to deter-
                    mine what the changes will impact. The project team should perform estimates of the impact
                    and of the amount of time needed to make the change. Sometimes, however, the change request
                    is so extensive that even the time to perform an estimate should be evaluated before proceeding.
                    In other words, if the project team is busy working on estimates, they aren't working on the
                    project. That means extensive change requests could impact the existing schedule because of the
                    time and effort needed just to evaluate the change. Cases like these require you to make a deter-
                    mination or ask the change control board (CCB) to decide if the change is important enough to
                    allow the project team time to work on the estimates.
                        Changes in scope will require an update to the project scope baseline. They may also require
                    updates to the schedule, cost, or performance measurement baselines established during the
                    Planning processes. When change is necessary, adjustments to the performance measurement
                    baselines are made, documented, and distributed to the stakeholders as needed.
                        Always remember to update your stakeholders regarding the changes you're implementing
                    and their impacts. They'll want to know how the changes impact the performance baselines,
                    including the project costs, project schedule, project scope, and quality.

                                                                       Formulating Project Closeout         441




               This process concludes the Monitoring and Controlling process groups. We'll look at the
             Closing processes in the next section.



             Formulating Project Closeout
             All good projects must come to an end, as the saying goes. Hopefully, you've practiced all the
             things we've talked about that have led up to this point, and you've delivered a successful
             project to the stakeholders and customers. You've also put some of the vital tools of project
             management into play--planning, executing, controlling, and communicating--to help you
             reach that goal.
                But how do you know when a project has ended successfully? Delivering the product or ser-
             vice of the project doesn't mean it's been completed satisfactorily. Remember back in the open-
             ing chapters that I said a project is completed successfully when it meets or exceeds
             stakeholders' expectations and satisfies the goals of the project. During the Closing processes--
             Close Project and Contract Closure--you'll document acceptance of the product of the project
             with a formal sign-off and file it with the project records for future reference. The formal sign-
             off is how the stakeholders will indicate that the goals have been met and that the project meets
             or exceeds their expectations so that the project ends.


             Characteristics of Closing
             There are a few characteristics common to all projects during the Closing processes. One is that
             the probability of completing the project is highest during this process and risk is lowest. You've
             already completed the majority of the work of the project--if not all of the work--so the prob-
             ability of not finishing the project is very low.
                Stakeholders have the least amount of influence during the Closing processes, while project
             managers have the greatest amount of influence. Costs are significantly lower during this pro-
             cess because the majority of the project work and spending has already occurred. Remember
             those cost S curves we talked about in the Cost Budgeting process? This is where they taper off
             as project spending comes to an end.
                One last common characteristic of projects during closing is that weak matrix organizations
             tend to experience the least amount of stress during the Closing processes.
                All projects do eventually come to an end. Let's examine a few of the reasons for project end-
             ings before getting into the Close Project and Contract Closure processes.


             Project Endings
             Projects come to an end for several reasons:
                  They're completed successfully.
                  They're canceled or killed prior to completion.
                  They evolve into ongoing operations and no longer exist as projects.

                    442         Chapter 11         Controlling Work Results and Closing Out the Project



                          There are four formal types of project endings you might need to know for the exam:
                           Addition
                           Starvation
                           Integration
                           Extinction
                    Let's look at each of these ending types in detail.

                    Addition
                    Projects that evolve into ongoing operations are considered projects that end due to addition;
                    in other words, they become their own ongoing business unit. An example of this is the instal-
                    lation of an enterprise resource planning system. These systems are business management sys-
                    tems that integrate all areas of a business, including marketing, planning, manufacturing, sales,
                    financials, and human resources. After the installation of the software, these systems can
                    develop into their own business unit because ongoing operations, maintenance, and monitoring
                    of the software require full-time staff. These systems usually evolve into an arm of the business
                    reporting system that no one can live without once it's installed.
                        A project is considered a project when it meets these criteria: It is unique, has a definite begin-
                    ning and ending date, and is temporary in nature. When a project becomes an ongoing opera-
                    tion, it is no longer a project.

                    Starvation
                    When resources are cut off from the project or are no longer provided to the project, it's starved
                    prior to completing all the requirements and you're left with an unfinished project on your
                    hands. Starvation can happen for any number of reasons:
                           Other projects come about and take precedence over the current project, thereby cutting
                           the funding or resources for your project.
                           The customer curtails an order.
                           The project budget is reduced.
                           A key resource quits.
                       Resource starving can include cutting back or withholding human resources, equipment and
                    supplies, or money. In any case, if you're not getting the people, equipment, or money you need
                    to complete the project, it's going to starve and probably end abruptly.
                       This is one of those cases where documentation becomes your best friend. Organizations
                    tend to have short memories. As you move on to bigger and better projects, your memory
                    regarding the specifics of the project will fade. Six months from now when someone important
                    wonders why that project was never completed and begins the finger-pointing routine, the
                    project documents will clearly outline the reasons why the project ended early. That's one of the
                    reasons why project documentation is such an important function. We'll talk more about doc-
                    umenting project details shortly.

                                                                          Formulating Project Closeout                443




             Integration
             Integration occurs when the resources of the project--people, equipment, property, and sup-
             plies--are distributed to other areas in the organization or are assigned to other projects. Per-
             haps your organization begins to focus on other areas or other projects and the next thing you
             know, functional managers come calling to retrieve their resources for other, more important
             things. Again, your project will come to an end due to lack of resources because they have been
             reassigned to other areas of the business or have been pulled from your project and assigned to
             another project.


                                   The difference between starvation and integration is that starvation results in
                                   funding or resource cuts while integration results in reassignment or redeploy-
                                   ment of the resources.

                Again, good documentation describing the circumstances that brought about the ending of
             a project due to integration should be archived with the project records for future reference.

             Extinction
             This is the best kind of project end because extinction means the project has been completed and
             accepted by the stakeholders. As such, it no longer exists because it had a definite ending date,
             the goals of the project were achieved, and the project was closed out.




             Pied Piper

             Jerome Reed is the project manager for Pied Piper's newest software project. His team is work-
             ing on a program that will integrate the organization's human resource information, including
             payroll records, leave time accruals, contact information, and so on. His top two programmers,
             Brett and Kathy, are heading up the coding team and are in charge of the programming and
             testing activities.

             Pied Piper recently hired a new CIO who started working with the company just a few weeks
             ago. Jerome is concerned about his human resources project. It was the former CIO's pet
             project, but he's not sure where it falls on the new CIO's radar screen.

             Jerome is in the computer room checking out the new hardware that just arrived for his project.
             Liz Horowitz, the director of network operations, approaches Jerome.

             "That's a nice piece of hardware," Liz comments.

             "It sure is. This baby is loaded. It's going to process and serve up data to the users so fast they'll
             be asking us to upgrade all the servers."

                    Liz replies, "You're right about that. I've asked Richard to burn it in and load the software."

                    "What software?" Jerome asks.

                    "You know, the new customer relationship management software. The CIO hired some vendor
                    she's worked with before to come in and install their CRM system here. She said it was our top
                    priority. I knew this new server was already on order, and it happens to be sized correctly for
                    the new CRM system."

                    "I purchased this server for the human resources project. What am I supposed to use for that?"

                    Liz answers, "I've got a server over there on the bottom of the third rack that might work, or
                    maybe you can order another one. But you should take this up with the CIO. All I know is she
                    authorized me to use this server. She understood I was taking it from your project, so maybe
                    she's thinking about going another direction with the human resources project.

                    "You probably should know I also asked to have Brett and Kathy assigned to the CRM project.
                    Even though it's a vendor project, it still requires some of our coders. The CIO wanted the best,
                    and they're the best we've got. It shouldn't take them long to make the changes I need, and then
                    you can have them back for your project. In the meantime, they can give directions to your
                    other programmers so they can keep working."

                    "I'm going to go see if the CIO is in," Jerome replies.

                    This is a case where Jerome's project ends by integration due to the reassignment of resources.
                    The new CIO came on board and changed the direction and focus of the project priorities, making
                    her new project a higher priority than the previous project. As a result, Jerome's hardware and
                    his top two resources were reassigned to the new project. Had the CIO cut the resources and
                    equipment on the original project altogether, it would have ended due to starvation.




                    Closing Out the Project
                    The key activity of the Close Project process is concerned with gathering project records and dis-
                    seminating information to formalize acceptance of the product, service, or project as well as to
                    perform project closure. You'll want to review the project documents to make certain they are up-
                    to-date. For example, perhaps some scope change requests were implemented that changed some
                    of the characteristics of the final product. The project information you're collecting during this
                    process should reflect the characteristics and specifications of the final product. Don't forget to
                    update your resource assignments as well. Some team members will have come and gone over the
                    course of the project; you need to double-check that all the resources and their roles and respon-
                    sibilities are noted.
3601.book Page 445 Wednesday, July 13, 2005 1:39 PM




                                                                             Closing Out the Project        445




                 Once the project outcomes are documented, you'll request formal acceptance from the stake-
             holders or the customer. (We'll look at formal acceptance later when we talk about the outputs.)
             They're also interested in knowing if the product or service of the project meets the goals the
             project set out to accomplish. If your documentation is up-to-date, you'll have the project
             results at hand to share with them.
                 The Close Project process is also concerned with analyzing the project management pro-
             cesses to determine their effectiveness and to document lessons learned concerning the project
             processes. And one of the other key functions of the Close Project process is the archiving of all
             project documents for historical reference. You can probably guess that Close Project belongs
             to the Project Integration Management knowledge area since this process touches so many areas
             of the project.
                 Every project requires closure. According to A Guide to the PMBOK, the completion of each
             project phase requires project closure as well.



             Exam Spotlight

             Project closure occurs at the end of each phase of the project in order to properly document
             project information and keep it safe for future reference. You shouldn't wait until project com-
             pletion to perform the Close Project process but rather perform it at the end of every phase, no
             matter if the project phase was completed successfully or was ended for some other reason.




             Close Project Inputs
             The Close Project process gathers all the project records and verifies that they are up-to-date
             and accurate. The project records must correctly identify the final specifications of the product
             or service the project set out to produce. Close Project is the place to ensure that this informa-
             tion accurately reflects the true results of the project.
                The six inputs to the Close Project process are as follows:
                  Project management plan
                  Contract documentation
                  Enterprise environmental factors
                  Organizational process assets
                  Work performance information
                  Deliverables
                We've talked about all of these inputs with the exception of contract documentation. Con-
             tract documentation includes the contract and any other information, like contract changes,
             product descriptions, technical specifications, and so on.

                    446         Chapter 11         Controlling Work Results and Closing Out the Project




                    Close Project Tools and Techniques
                    You've seen all of the tools and techniques of Close Project in other processes:
                           Project management methodology
                           Project management information system (PMIS)
                           Expert judgment
                        The project management methodology should outline processes for both project and admin-
                    istrative closeout. The PMIS and expert judgment are used to perform these processes.


                    Close Project Outputs
                    Sometimes you'll work on projects where everything just clicks. Your project team functions at
                    the performing stage, the customers and stakeholders are happy, and things just fall into place
                    according to plan. I often find it difficult to close projects that have progressed particularly well,
                    just because I don't want them to end. Believe it or not, the majority of your projects can fall
                    into this category if you practice good project management techniques and exercise those great
                    communication skills.
                       The Close Project process has the following outputs:
                           Administrative closure procedure
                           Contract closure procedure
                           Final product, service, or result
                           Organizational process assets updates
                          Let's take a brief look at each.

                    Administrative Closure Procedure
                    Administrative closure procedures involves collecting all the records associated with the project,
                    analyzing the project success (or failure), documenting and gathering lessons learned, and archiving
                    project records. Keep in mind that when projects are performed under contract, the archiving of
                    financial records is especially important. These records may need to be accessed if there are payment
                    disputes, so you need to know where they are and how they were filed. Projects with large financial
                    expenditures also require particular attention to the archiving of financial records for the same rea-
                    sons. Financial information is especially useful when estimating future projects, so again, make sure
                    to archive the information so it's easily accessible.
                       All of these documents should be indexed for reference and filed in a safe place. Don't forget
                    to include electronic databases and electronic documents as part of your project archives as
                    well. These records can be stored on a network drive or copied onto a CD that's kept with the
                    project binder.
                       Administrative closure procedures also document the project team members' and stakehold-
                    ers' roles and responsibilities in performing this process. According to A Guide to the PMBOK,
                    this should include the processes and methodologies for defining the following:
                           Approval requirements of the stakeholders for project deliverables and changes to deliverables.
3601.book Page 447 Wednesday, July 13, 2005 1:39 PM




                                                                                Closing Out the Project        447



                  Assuring and confirming that the project meets the requirements of the stakeholders, cus-
                  tomers, and sponsor. Documenting necessary actions to verify that the deliverables have
                  been accepted and exit criteria have been met.
                  Assuring and confirming that the exit criteria for the project is satisfied.

             Contract Closure Procedure
             Contract closure procedures, like the administrative closure procedures, document the roles and
             responsibilities of the project team members and stakeholders in closing out the contract. This pro-
             cedure details the methodology you use to assure that contract exit criteria and contract conditions
             have been satisfied. We'll talk more about contract closure in the section "Contract Closure."

             Final Product, Service, or Result
             The name of this output is somewhat misleading. This actually refers to the acceptance of the
             final product, service, or result and the turnover of the product to the organization. This usually
             requires a formal sign-off (we'll talk about that next) and, in the case of a project performed on
             contract, definitely requires a formal sign-off or receipt indicating acceptance of the project.
                Formal acceptance includes distributing notice of the acceptance of the product or service of
             the project by the stakeholders, customer, or project sponsor to stakeholders and customers. You
             should require formal sign-off indicating that those signing accept the product of the project.


                                   The final product, service, or result is concerned with obtaining formal accep-
                                   tance while organizational process assets involves documenting and archiving
                                   formal acceptance.



             Organizational Process Assets Updates
             The organizational process assets output is where the formal sign-off of the acceptance of the
             product is documented, collected, and archived for future reference. Documenting formal
             acceptance is important because it signals the official closure of the project and it is your proof
             that the project was completed satisfactorily.
                 Another function of sign-off is that it kicks off the beginning of the warranty period. Sometimes
             project managers or vendors will warranty their work for a certain time period after completing
             the project. Projects that produce software programs, for example, may be warranted from bugs
             for a 60- or 90-day time frame from the date of implementation or acceptance. Typically in the
             case of software projects, bugs are fixed for free during the warranty period. Watch out, because
             users will try to squeeze new requirements into the "bug" category mold. If you offer a warranty,
             it's critical that the warranty spells out exactly what is covered and what is not.
                 This is also where the other project records and files are collected and archived. This includes
             the project planning documents (project scope statement, budget, schedule, risk responses,
             quality plan and baselines, and so on), change records and logs, issue logs, and so on.
                 Project closure documents are included in this output. These include documentation showing
             the transfer of the product of the project to the organization (or department responsible for

                    ongoing maintenance and support). If your project is canceled or ends prematurely, you should
                    document the reasons for its premature end as well as the procedures for transferring the com-
                    pleted and uncompleted deliverables.
                       Lessons learned are used to document the successes and failures of the project. As an example,
                    lessons learned document the reasons why specific corrective actions were taken, their out-
                    comes, the causes of performance variances, unplanned risks that occurred, mistakes that were
                    made and could have been avoided, and so on.
                       Unfortunately, sometimes projects do fail. There are things that can be learned from failed
                    projects as well as from successful projects, and this information should be documented for
                    future reference. Most project managers, however, do not document lessons learned. The rea-
                    son for this is that employees don't want to admit to making mistakes or learning from mistakes
                    made during the project. And they do not want their name associated with failed projects or
                    even with mishaps on successful projects.


                                          Lessons learned can be some of the most valuable information you'll take away
                                          from a project. We can all learn from our experiences, and what better way to
                                          have even more success on your next project than to review a similar past
                                          project's lessons learned document? But lessons learned will only be there if
                                          you document them now. I strongly recommend you not skip this step.

                        You and your management team will have to work to create an atmosphere of trust and
                    assurance that lessons learned are not reasons for dismissing employees but are learning oppor-
                    tunities that benefit all those associated with the project. Lessons learned allow you to carry
                    knowledge gained on this project to other projects you'll work on going forward. They'll also
                    prevent repeat mistakes in the future if you take the time to review the project documents and
                    lessons learned prior to undertaking your new project.
                        Post-implementation audits aren't an official output, but they are a good idea. These go hand
                    in hand with lessons learned because they examine the project from beginning to end and look at
                    what went right and what went wrong. They evaluate the project goals and determine if the prod-
                    uct or service of the project satisfies the objectives. Post-implementation audits also examine the
                    activities and project processes to determine if improvements are possible on future projects.
                        Organizations that do not document lessons learned probably do conduct post-implementation
                    audits. Documenting and gathering information during this procedure can serve the same function
                    as lessons learned if you're honest and include all the good, the bad, and the ugly. Let's hope there's
                    very little ugly.



                    Contract Closure
                    Contracts have life cycles of their own--just like projects. We talked about the contract life
                    cycles in Chapter 9, "Measuring and Controlling Project Performance." As such, contracts
                    come to a close just as projects come to a close. As you might guess, there is a process that deals
                    with contract closings; it's called Contract Closure.

             Cimarron Research Group

             The Cimarron Research Group researches and develops organic pesticides for use on food
             crops. It is a medium-sized company and has established a project management office (PMO)
             to manage all aspects of project work. The PMO consists of project managers and administra-
             tive staff who assist with information handling, filing, and disbursement.

             Terri Roberts is the project manager for a project that has just closed. Terri diligently filed all
             the pertinent project documents as the project progressed and has requested the research files
             and engineering notes from the director of engineering to include them with the project
             archives as well. All information regarding the research on this project is included with the
             project archives. The engineering department chooses to keep their own set of research
             records as well, but it's important to keep a copy of these notes with the project archives so that
             all the information about the project is located in one place.

             Terri's assistant has indexed all the project documents and recently sent notice of formal
             acceptance and approval of this project to the stakeholders, project sponsor, and management
             team. This notice officially closes the project. The next step is to archive the files onto CDs and
             store them.



                The Contract Closure process is concerned with completing and settling the terms of the con-
             tract. It supports the Close Project process because the Contract Closure process determines if
             the work described in the contract was completed accurately and satisfactorily. This is called
             product verification. Projects that have multiple deliverables may have contracts for some of the
             deliverables but not all. Obviously, this process applies only to those phases, deliverables, or
             portions of the project that were performed under contract.
                Contract Closure updates records and archives the information for future reference. These
             records detail the final results of the work of the project. We'll look at the specifics of this when
             we examine the Contract Closure outputs.
                Contracts may have specific terms or conditions for completion and closeout. You should be
             aware of these terms or conditions so that project closure isn't held up because you missed an
             important detail. If you are not administering the contract yourself, be certain to ask your pro-
             curement department if there are any special conditions that you should know about so that
             your project team doesn't inadvertently delay contract or project closure.


                                   Close Project verifies and documents the project outcomes just like the Con-
                                   tract Closure process. Keep in mind that not all projects are performed under
                                   contract so not all projects require Contract Closure. However, all projects do
                                   require the Close Project process. Since verification and documentation of the
                                   project outcomes occur in both of these processes, projects that are performed
                                   under contract need to have project results verified only one time.

                    450         Chapter 11         Controlling Work Results and Closing Out the Project




                    Exam Spotlight

                    For the exam, remember that product verification performed during the Closing processes
                    determines if all of the work of the project was completed correctly according to the contract
                    terms and satisfactorily according to stakeholder expectations whereas product documenta-
                    tion is verified and accepted during the Scope Verification process. One more note: When
                    projects end prematurely, the Scope Verification process is where the level of detail concerning
                    the amount of work completed gets documented.



                    Contract Closure Inputs
                    The Contract Closure process has four inputs:
                          Procurement management plan
                          Contract management plan
                          Contract documentation
                          Contract Closure procedures
                       We've discussed all these inputs before, but there's a few more things you should know about
                    contract documentation for this process. Contract documentation includes the contract itself
                    and all the supporting documents that go along with it. These might include things such as the
                    WBS, the project schedule, change control documents, technical documents, financial and pay-
                    ment records, quality control inspection results, and so on. This information--along with all the
                    other information gathered during the project--is filed once the project is closed out so that
                    anyone considering a future project of similar scope can reference what was done.


                                          Contract documentation is an input to both the Close Project and Contract Clo-
                                          sure processes.




                    Contract Closure Tools and Techniques
                    The Contract Closure process has two tools and techniques: procurement audits and records
                    management system. The records management system here serves the same function as the
                    records management system we talked about in the discussion of the Contract Administration
                    process in Chapter 9. Procurement audits are reviews of procurement processes to determine if
                    they are meeting the right needs and are being performed correctly and according to standards.
                    A Guide to the PMBOK says procurement audits are concerned with reviewing the procure-
                    ment process, starting with the Plan Purchases and Acquisitions process all the way through
                    Contract Administration.
3601.book Page 451 Wednesday, July 13, 2005 1:39 PM




                                                                                         Contract Closure          451




                 The primary purpose of the procurement audit is to identify lessons learned during the pro-
             curement process. Procurement audits examine the procurement process to determine areas of
             improvement and to identify flawed processes or procedures. This allows you to reuse the suc-
             cessful processes on other procurement items for this project, on future projects, or elsewhere
             in the organization. It also alerts you to problems in the process so that you don't repeat them.
                 Procurement audits may be used by either the buyer or the vendor, or by both, as an oppor-
             tunity for improvement. Documenting the lessons learned--including the successes and failures
             that occurred--allows you to improve other procurement processes currently under way on this
             project or other projects. It also gives you the opportunity to improve the process for future
             projects.


             Contract Closure Outputs
             One of the purposes of the Contract Closure process is to provide formal notice to the seller--
             usually in written form--that the contract is complete. The output of Contract Closure that
             deals with this is called closed contracts. This is formal acceptance and closure of the contract.
             It's your responsibility as project manager to document the formal acceptance of the contract.
             Many times the provisions for formalizing acceptance and closing the contract are spelled out
             in the contract itself.
                 If you have a procurement department that handles contract administration, they will expect
             you to inform them when the contract is completed and will in turn follow the formal proce-
             dures to let the seller know the contract is complete. However, you'll still note the contract com-
             pletion in your copy of the project records.


                                   Depending on the terms of the contract, early termination (whether by agree-
                                   ment, default, or for cause) may result in additional charges to the buyer. Be cer-
                                   tain to note the reasons for early termination in your contract documentation.

                 The other output of Contract Closure is organizational process updates. This includes updat-
             ing the contract file, deliverables acceptance, and lessons learned. The contract file is simply a
             file of all the contract records and supporting documents. These records should be indexed for
             easy reference and included as part of the project files in the Close Project process.



             Exam Spotlight

             A Guide to the PMBOK shows the Close Project process being performed before the Contract
             Closure process. In practice, you will likely close out the contract before closing the project and
             archiving project documents. Note that the contract file (part of the organizational process
             assets update) output of the Contract Closure process is an input to the Close Project process
             (called contract documentation).

                    452         Chapter 11         Controlling Work Results and Closing Out the Project



                       This process is your organization's way of formally accepting the product of the project from
                    the vendor and closing out the contract. The deliverable acceptance portion of the organiza-
                    tional process updates includes the formal written notice from the buyer that the deliverables
                    are acceptable and satisfactory or have been rejected. If the product or service does not meet
                    expectations, the vendor will need to correct the problems before you issue a formal acceptance
                    notice. Hopefully, quality audits have been performed during the course of the project and the
                    vendor was given the opportunity to make corrections earlier in the process than the Closing
                    stage. It's not a good idea to wait until the very end of the project and then spring all the prob-
                    lems and issues on the vendor at once. It's much more efficient to discuss problems with your
                    vendor as the project progresses because it provides the opportunity for correction when the
                    problems occur.
                       Lessons learned include information and documentation about what worked well and what
                    didn't work well regarding the procurement processes. This information can be used on future
                    projects to improve performance and prevent inefficiencies.



                    Releasing Project Team Members
                    Releasing project team members is not an official process. However, it should be noted that at
                    the conclusion of the project, you will release your project team members, and they will go back
                    to their functional managers or get assigned to a new project if you're working in a matrix type
                    organization.
                       You will want to keep the functional managers or other project managers informed as you
                    get closer to project completion so that they have time to adequately plan for the return of their
                    employees. Start letting them know a few months ahead of time what the schedule looks like
                    and how soon they can plan on using their employees on new projects. This gives the other man-
                    agers the ability to start planning activities and scheduling activity dates.


                    Celebrate!
                    I think it's a good idea to hold a celebration at the conclusion of a successfully completed
                    project. The project team should celebrate their accomplishment, and you should officially rec-
                    ognize their efforts and thank them for their participation. Any number of ideas come to mind
                    here--a party, a trip to a ball game, pizza and sodas at lunch time, and so on. This shouldn't
                    be the only time you've recognized your team, as discussed during the Team Development pro-
                    cess, but now is the time to officially close the project and thank your team members.
                        A celebration helps team members formally recognize the project end and brings closure to
                    the work they've done. It also encourages them to remember what they've learned and to start
                    thinking about how their experiences will benefit them and the organization during the next
                    project.

             Project Case Study: New Kitchen Heaven Retail Store

             Dirk strolls into your office maintaining his formal and dignified manners as always and then
             sits down in the chair beside your desk.

             "I just want to congratulate you on a job well done," he says. "The grand opening was a suc-
             cess, and the store had a better-than-expected week the first week. I'm impressed you were
             able to pull this off and get the store opened prior to the Garden and Home Show. That was the
             key to the great opening week."

             "Thank you, Dirk. Lots of people put in a lot of hard work and extra hours to get this job done.
             I'm glad you're happy with the results."

             "I thought the banner with our logo, `Great Gadgets for People Interested in Great Food,' was
             a wonderful touch."

             "That was Jill's idea. She had some great ideas that made the festivities successful. As you
             know, though," you continue, "we did have some problems on this project. Fortunately, they
             weren't insurmountable, but I think we learned a thing or two during this project that we can
             carry forward to other projects."

             "Like what?" Dirk asks.

             "We should have contracted with Gomez Construction sooner so that we didn't have to pay
             overtime. We had a very generous budget, so the overtime expense didn't impact this project,
             but it might impact the next one.

             "And we came fairly close to having a hardware disaster on our hands. Next time, we should
             order the equipment sooner, test it here at headquarters first, and then ship it out to the site
             after we know everything is working correctly."

             "Good ideas. But that's old news. Now that this project is over, I'd like to get you started on the
             next project. We're going to introduce cooking classes in all of our retail stores. The focus is the
             home chef, and we might just call the classes the Home Chef Pro series. We'll offer basic
             classes all the way to professional series classes if the project's a hit. We'll bring in guest chefs
             from the local areas to give demos and teach some of the classes as well."

             "I'm very interested in taking on this project and can't wait to get started. I'm thrilled that you
             want me to head this up. But I do have a few things here to wrap up before I start work on the
             new project," you reply.

             Dirk says, "The project's over. The grand opening was a success. It's time to move on. Let Jill
             take over now; the retail stores are her responsibility."

                    "Jill has taken over the day-to-day operations. However, I've got to finish collecting the project
                    information, close out the contract with Gomez, and make the final payment. Jake verified that
                    all the work was completed correctly and to his satisfaction. Then I need to publish the formal
                    acceptance notice to all of the stakeholders via e-mail. I will also create a document that out-
                    lines those things I told you earlier about that we should remember and reference during the
                    next project; that document is called lessons learned. Then after all those things are completed,
                    all of the project records need to be indexed and archived. I can have all that done by the end
                    of the week and will be free starting Monday to work on requirements gathering and the charter
                    document for the new project."

                    "This is just like the planning process discussion we got into with the tree, the breakdown struc-
                    ture thing, and all the planning, I suspect. I do have to admit all the planning paid off. I'll give
                    you until the end of the week to close out this project. Come see me Monday to get started on
                    Home Chef Pro."

             Summary
             We closed out the Monitoring and Controlling process group with this chapter by covering the
             Perform Quality Control, Scope Verification, and Scope Control processes.
                 Perform Quality Control monitors work results to see if they fulfill the quality standards outlined
             in the quality management plan. Perform Quality Control should occur throughout the life of the
             project. It uses many tools and techniques. Inspection measures results to determine if the results con-
             form to the quality standards. Attributes are measurements that either conform or do not conform.
             Control charts measure the results of processes over time, and Pareto charts are histograms that rank-
             order the most important quality factors by their frequency over time. You should not adjust pro-
             cesses that are in control; however, you can change these processes to realize improvements.
                 Scope Verification involves verifying and accepting work results, while Scope Control is con-
             cerned with controlling changes to project scope.
                 Project closure is the most often neglected process of all the project management processes.
             The two processes in the Closing process group are Close Project and Contract Closure. The
             four most important tasks of closure are as follows:
                  Checking the work for completeness and accuracy
                  Documenting formal acceptance
                  Disseminating project closure information
                  Archiving records and lessons learned
                Close Project involves checking that the work of the project was completed correctly and to
             the satisfaction of the stakeholders. Documenting formal acceptance of the product of the
             project is an important aspect of project closure as well. This assures that the stakeholder or cus-
             tomer is satisfied with the work and that it meets their needs.
                Projects come to an end in one of four ways: addition, starvation, integration, or extinction.
             Addition is when projects evolve into their own business unit. Starvation happens because
             the project is starved of its resources. Integration occurs when resources are taken from the
             existing project and dispersed back into the organization or assigned to other projects. And
             extinction is the best end because the project was completed, accepted, and closed.
                Close Project is performed at the end of each phase of the project as well as at the end of the
             project. Close Project involves documenting formal acceptance and disseminating notice of accep-
             tance to the stakeholders, customer, and others. All documentation gathered during the project
             and collected during this process is archived and saved for reference purposes on future projects.
                Contract Closure is performed after Close Project and is concerned with settling the contract and
             completing the contract according to its terms. Its primary outputs include the contract file and for-
             mal acceptance and closure (both are components of the organizational process assets update).

                    456         Chapter 11         Controlling Work Results and Closing Out the Project



                       Lessons learned document the successes and failures of the project and of the procurement pro-
                    cesses. Many times lessons learned are not documented because staff members do not want to assign
                    their names to project errors or failures. You and your management team need to work together to
                    assure employees that lessons learned are not exercises used for disciplinary purposes but benefit both
                    the employee and the organization. Documenting what you've learned from past experiences lets you
                    carry this forward to new projects so that the same errors are not repeated. It also allows you to incor-
                    porate new methods of performing activities that you learned on past projects.



                    Exam Essentials
                    Be able to name the tools and techniques of Perform Quality Control. The tools and tech-
                    niques of the of Perform Quality Control process are cause-and-effect diagram, control charts,
                    flowcharting, histogram, Pareto chart, run chart, scatter diagram, statistical sampling, inspec-
                    tion, and defect repair review.
                    Name the purpose of the Scope Verification process. The purpose of Scope Verification is to
                    determine if the work is complete and if it satisfies the project objectives.
                    Be able to name the purpose of the Closing processes. The purpose of the Closing processes
                    is to verify that the work was satisfactorily completed, to disseminate information, to document
                    formal acceptance, to archive records, to close out the contract, and to document lessons
                    learned.
                    Be able to describe product verification. Product verification confirms that all the work of the
                    project performed on contract was completed accurately and to the satisfaction of the stakeholder.
                    Be able to name the primary activity of the Closing processes. The primary activity of the
                    Closing processes is to distribute information that formalizes project completion.
                    Be able to describe when the Close Project process is performed. Close Project is performed
                    at the close of each project phase and at the close of the project.
                    Be able to define the purpose for lessons learned. The purpose of lessons learned is to
                    describe the project successes and failures and to use the information learned on future projects.

             5.   You are the project manager for a top secret software project for an agency of the United States gov-
                  ernment. Your mission--should you choose to accept it--is to complete the project using internal
                  resources. The reason is that finding contractors with top secret clearances takes quite a bit of time
                  and waiting for clearances would jeopardize the implementation date. Your programmers are
                  80 percent of the way through the programming and testing work when your agency appoints a new
                  executive director. Slowly but surely your programmers are taken off this project and reassigned to
                  the executive director's hot new project. Which of the following type of project ending is this?
                  A. Starvation
                  B. Extinction
                  C. Addition
                  D. Integration

                  mers are 80 percent of the way through the programming and testing work when your agency
                  appoints a new executive director. Your programmers are siphoned off this project to work on
                  the executive director's hot new project. Which of the following addresses the purpose of Scope
                  Verification in this case?
                  A. Scope Verification determines the correctness and completion of all the work.
                  B. Scope Verification documents the level and degree of completion.
                  C. Scope Verification determines if the project results comply with quality standards.
                  D. Scope Verification documents the correctness of the work according to stakeholders'
                     expectations.

                  D. This project ended due to integration because the funding was cut off.

             8.   You are a project manager for Cinema Snicker Productions. Your company specializes in pro-
                  ducing comedy films for the big screen. Your latest project has just been completed and
                  accepted. You've been given your next project, which starts right away. Which of the following
                  statements is true?

                 delayed, causing cost overruns at the end of the project. This information might be useful on
                 future projects in all of the following activities except for which one?
                  A. Cost estimating
                  B. Allocating resources
                  C. Product verification
                  D. Activity estimating

             18. Your project was just completed, accepted, and closed. As is customary for your organization,
                 you conduct a post-implementation audit. The purpose of this audit includes all of the following
                 except for which one?
                  A. Evaluating project goals and comparing them to the project's product
                  B. Reviewing successes and failures
                  C. Documenting the acceptance of the work results
                  D. Documenting possible improvements for future projects

                    19. Contract documentation is an input to both the Close Project and Contract Closure pro-
                        cesses. Contract documentation might include all of the following except for which one?
                          A. Supporting documents
                          B. Contract changes

             Answers to Review Questions
             1.   A. Changes to product scope should be reflected in the project scope.

             2.   B. A project scope change affects the performance measurement baselines, which may include
                  schedule baselines and cost baselines.

             3.   C. WBS element changes are scope changes. Schedule revisions are often required as a result of
                  scope changes.

             4.   C. The Scope Verification process is concerned with the acceptance of work results. It also for-
                  malizes the acceptance of the project scope.

             5.   D. Integration occurs when resources, equipment, or property are reassigned or redeployed back
                  to the organization or to another project.

             6.   B. Scope Verification should document the level and degree of completion of the project. If you
                  come back at a later date and restart this project, Scope Verification will describe how far the
                  project progressed and give you an idea of where to start.

             7.   A. Starvation occurs because the project no longer receives the resources needed to continue.
                  Resources could include people, equipment, money, and the like.

             8.   A. Extinction is the best type of project end because it means the project was completed success-
                  fully and accepted by the sponsor or customer.

             9.   D. Close Project and Contract Closure are the processes in the Closing process group and are
                  performed in that order.

             10. C. The project manager is responsible for documenting the formal acceptance of the work of the
                 contract. This should be done during Contract Closure when projects are performed under con-
                 tract or during Close Project if no work was performed under contract. In cases where part of
                 the work was performed under contract and part with in-house staff, formal acceptance should
                 occur in both of these processes.

             11. C. Product verification examines all the work of the project and verifies that the work was com-
                 pleted correctly and satisfactorily.

             12. A. Procurement audits are used to review the procurement process and identify and document
                 any lessons learned during the procurement process for future reference.

             13. D. Enterprise environmental factors is an input to the Close Project process and wouldn't be
                 included in the documentation of the product of the project.

             14. D. Closed contracts are an output of the Contract Closure process. Formal acceptance is part of
                 the final product, service, or result output. Lessons learned are part of organizational process
                 assets updates.

             15. B. The work performance information is reviewed to determine the status of project activities and
                 make certain the project goals and objectives are met. This is an input to the Close Project process.

                    16. A. Lessons learned document the experiences, successes, and failures that occurred during this
                        project for future reference. There isn't enough information in the question to determine if
                        option B or D is correct. Option C is not correct because the project was completed.

                    17. C. Product verification involves examining the work of the project for completeness and cor-
                        rectness. This process occurs on the existing project and isn't of much benefit to future projects
                        because you'll perform product verification on future project work at the close of the project. By
                        definition, a project is unique and creates a unique product or service.

                    18. C. Post-implementation audits are similar to lessons learned in that they review and document
                        the project successes and failures, look for possible improvements for future projects, and eval-
                        uate the project goals and compare these to the end product.

                    19. D. Procurement audits are a tool and technique of Contract Closure and not an input. Contract
                        documentation might include all of the other options shown as well as the contract itself, tech-
                        nical documentation, quality inspection reports related to the contract, and so on.

                    20. A. According to A Guide to the PMBOK, the procurement audit examines the procurement process
                        from Procurement Planning through Contract Administration.

                                                    Congratulations! You've made terrific progress and are well
                                                    equipped to take the Project Management Professional (PMP)
                                                    exam. We've covered all of A Guide to the PMBOK process
                    groups, so the good news is you don't have any more inputs, tools and techniques, outputs, or
                    formulas to memorize. However, there is one final area that the PMP exam will include: pro-
                    fessional responsibility.
                        Once you've obtained the PMP designation, you have an obligation to maintain integrity,
                    apply your subject matter knowledge and project management knowledge, and maintain the code
                    of conduct published by PMI. You'll also be required to balance the interests and needs of stake-
                    holders with the organization's needs. The exam may include questions on any of these topics.
                        As a project manager, you'll find yourself in many unique situations, different organizations,
                    and possibly even different countries. Even if you never get involved in international project
                    management, you will still come in contact with people from different cultures and back-
                    grounds than yours. If you work as a contract project manager, you'll be exposed to many dif-
                    ferent organizations that each has its own cultures and ways of doing things. You should always
                    strive to act in a professional, nonoffensive manner in these situations.
                        We'll talk about each of these topics in this chapter.



                    Ensuring Integrity
                    As a project manager, one of your professional responsibilities is to ensure integrity of the project
                    management process, the product, and your own personal conduct. We've spent the majority of
                    this book discussing how to achieve project management integrity by following the project man-
                    agement processes. Now we'll turn our focus to accurately ensuring the integrity of the product.


                                           A product that has integrity is one that is complete and sound, or fit for use.



                       The correct application of the project management processes you've learned will ensure the
                    integrity of the product. The effective execution of the Planning, Executing, and Monitoring
                    and Controlling processes, including documenting scope, performing quality inspections, mea-
                    suring performance, and taking corrective actions, will ensure that a quality product is pro-
                    duced that satisfies the requirements of the stakeholders (and the project plan). And as you
                    learned in the Chapter 11, you will seek acceptance of the product from the stakeholders and
                    customer during the Closing process group.

                                                                                    Ensuring Integrity        467




                There are several facets of integrity including personal integrity, avoiding conflict of interest
             situations, and professionalism. We'll look at each of these next.


             Personal Integrity
             Personal integrity means sticking to an ethical code. As a certified Project Management Profes-
             sional, you are required to adhere to PMI's Project Management Professional Code of Profes-
             sional Conduct. You can find a copy of this code at the PMI website: www.pmi.org.
                You should read and understand this code because you will be agreeing to adhere to its terms
             as part of the certification process. One of the aspects of personal integrity includes your truth-
             fulness about your PMP application and certification, your qualifications, and the continuing
             reports you provide to PMI to maintain your certification.



             Exam Spotlight

             I recommend reading the PMP Code of Professional Conduct as part of your project manage-
             ment studies.



                Truthfulness and integrity involve not only information regarding your own background
             and experience, but information regarding the project circumstances as well. For example, let's
             say you're a project manager working on contract. Part of your compensation consists of a
             bonus based on total project billing. Now let's suppose your project is finishing sooner than
             anticipated, and this means your personal profit will decrease by $1,500. Should you stretch the
             work to meet the original contracted amount so that your personal bonus comes in at the full
             amount even though your project team is finished? I think you know the answer is of course not.
                Your personal gain should never be a consideration when billing a customer or completing
             a project. Personal gain should never be a factor in any project decision. If the project finishes
             sooner than planned, you should bill the customer for the work completed, not for the full con-
             tracted amount. Compromising the project for the sake of your personal gain shows a lack of
             integrity, which could ultimately cost you your PMP status and even your job.


             Conflict of Interest
             Another area the PMP Code of Professional Conduct discusses is your responsibility to report
             to the stakeholders, customers, or others any actions or circumstances that could be construed
             as a conflict of interest.
                A conflict of interest is when your personal interests are put above the interests of the project
             or when you use your influence to cause others to make decisions in your favor without regard
             for the project outcome. In other words, your personal interests take precedence over your pro-
             fessional obligations, and you make decisions that allow you to personally benefit regardless of
             the outcome of the project. Let's take a look at a few examples.
3601.book Page 468 Tuesday, July 12, 2005 11:17 PM




                    468         Chapter 12           Professional Responsibility



                    Associations and Affiliations
                    Conflicts of interest may include your associations or affiliations. For example, perhaps your
                    brother-in-law owns his own construction company and you are the project manager for a con-
                    struction project that's just published an RFP. Your brother-in-law bids on the project and ends
                    up winning the bid.
                        If you sat on the decision committee and didn't tell anyone about your association with the
                    winning bidder, that is clearly a conflict of interest. If you influenced the bid decision so that it
                    went to your brother-in-law, he benefited from your position. Therefore, you put your personal
                    interests, or in this case the interests of your associations, above the project outcome. Even if
                    you did not influence the decision in any way, when others on the project discover the winning
                    bidder is your brother-in-law, they will assume a conflict of interest occurred. This could jeop-
                    ardize the awarding of the bid and your own position as well.
                        The correct thing to do in this case would be to, first, inform the project sponsor and the deci-
                    sion committee that your brother-in-law intends to bid on the project. Second, refrain from par-
                    ticipating on the award decision committee so as not to unduly influence others in favor of your
                    brother-in-law. And last, if you've done all these things and your brother-in-law still wins the
                    bid, appoint someone else in your organization to administer the contract and make the pay-
                    ments for the work performed by him. Also, make certain you document the decisions you make
                    regarding the activities performed by him and keep them with the project files. The more doc-
                    umentation you have, the less likely someone can make a conflict of interest accusation stick.

                    Vendor Gifts
                    Many professionals work in situations in which they are not allowed to accept gifts in excess of
                    certain dollar amounts. This might be driven by company policy, the department manager's pol-
                    icy, and so on. In my organization, it's considered a conflict of interest to accept anything from a
                    vendor, including gifts (no matter how small), meals, even a cup of coffee. Vendors and suppliers
                    often provide their customers and potential customers with lunches, gifts, ballgame tickets, and
                    the like. It's your responsibility to know if a policy exists that forbids you from accepting these
                    gifts. It's also your responsibility to inform the vendor if they've gone over the limit and you are
                    unable to accept the gift.
                        The same situation can occur here as with the brother-in-law example earlier. If you accept
                    an expensive gift from a vendor and later award that vendor a contract or a piece of the project
                    work, it looks like and probably is a conflict of interest. This violates PMI guidelines and doesn't
                    look good for you personally either.


                                           Using the "I didn't know there was a policy" reasoning probably won't save you
                                           when there's a question of conflict of interest. Make it your business to find out
                                           if the organization has a conflict of interest policy and understand exactly what
                                           it says. Get a copy and keep it with your files. Review it periodically. Put a note
                                           on your calendar every six months to reread the policy to keep it fresh in your
                                           mind. This is a case where not knowing what you don't know can hurt you.
3601.book Page 469 Tuesday, July 12, 2005 11:17 PM




                                                                                    Ensuring Integrity        469




                 Don't accept gifts that might be construed as a conflict of interest. If your organization does
             not have a policy regarding vendor gifts, set limits for yourself depending on the situation, the
             history of gift acceptance by the organization in the past, and the complexity of the project. It's
             always better to decline a gift you're unsure about than to accept it and later lose your credi-
             bility, your reputation, or your PMP status because of bad judgment.

             Stakeholder Influence
             Another potential area for conflict of interest comes from stakeholders. Stakeholders are usually
             folks with a good deal of authority and an important position in the company. Make certain you
             are not putting your own personal interests above the interests of the project when you're deal-
             ing with powerful stakeholders. They may have the ability to promote you or reward you in
             other ways. That's not a bad thing, but if you let that get in the way of the project or let a stake-
             holder twist your arm with promises like this, you're getting mighty close to a conflict of inter-
             est. Always weigh your decisions with the objectives of the project and the organization in
             mind--not your own personal gain.
                Keep in mind that you may not always be on the receiving end of the spectrum. You should
             not offer inappropriate gifts or services or use confidential information you have at your dis-
             posal to assist others because this can also be considered a conflict of interest.


             Professional Demeanor
             Acting in a professional manner is required of most everyone who works in the business world.
             While you are not responsible for the actions of others, you are responsible for your own actions
             and reactions. Part of acting professionally involves controlling yourself and your reactions in
             questionable situations. For example, a stakeholder or customer may lash out at you but have
             no basis for their outburst. You can't control what they said or did, but you can control how
             you respond. As a professional, your concern for the project and the organization should take
             precedence over your concern for your own feelings. Therefore, lashing out in return would be
             unprofessional. Maintain your professional demeanor and don't succumb to shouting matches
             or ego competitions with others.
                As project manager, you have a good deal of influence over your project team members. One
             of the items on the agenda at the project team kickoff meeting should be a discussion of where
             the team members can find a copy of organizational policies regarding conflict of interest, cul-
             tural diversity, standards and regulations, and customer service and standards of performance.
             Better yet, have copies with you that you can hand out at the meeting or have available the
             addresses of website where they can find these documents.
                When you see project team members acting out of turn or with less-than-desirable customer
             service attitudes, coach and influence those team members to conform to the standards of con-
             duct expected by you and your organization. Your team members represent you and the project.
             As such, they should act professionally. It's your job as the project leader to ensure that they do.

                    470         Chapter 12           Professional Responsibility




                    The Golf Trip

                    Amanda Lewis is a project manager for a network upgrade project for her organization. This
                    project will be outsourced to a vendor. Amanda will manage the vendor's work. She also wrote
                    the RFP and is a member of the selection committee.

                    The project consists of converting the organization's network from 100MB Ethernet to Gigabit
                    Ethernet. This requires replacing all of the routers and switches. Some of the cabling in the
                    buildings will need to be replaced as well. The RFP requires that the vendor who wins the bid
                    install all the new equipment and replace the network interface cards in each of the servers with
                    Gigabit Ethernet cards. The grand total for this project is estimated at $1.2 million.

                    Don James is a vendor with whom Amanda has worked in the past. Don is very interested in
                    winning this bid. He drops in on Amanda one day shortly after the RFP is posted.

                    "Amanda, it's good to see you," Don says. "I was in the neighborhood and thought I'd stop in
                    to see how things are going."

                    "Just great, Don," Amanda replies. "I'll bet you're here to talk to me about that RFP. You know
                    I can't say anything until the whole process closes."

                    "You bet we bid on the project. I know you can't talk about the RFP, so I won't bring it up. I
                    wanted to chat with you about something else. My company is sending 15 lucky contestants
                    and one friend each to Scottsdale, Arizona, for a `conference.' The conference includes the use
                    of the Scottsdale Golf Club, green fees paid of course, and all hotel and meal expenses are on
                    us for the length of the trip. I know Scottsdale is one of your favorite places to golf, so I thought
                    of you. What do you say?"

                    Amanda sits forward in her chair and looks at Don for a minute. "That sounds fabulous, and I
                    do love Scottsdale. But you and I both know this isn't a conference. I wouldn't feel right about
                    accepting it."

                    "Come on, Amanda. Don't look a gift horse in the mouth. It is a conference. I'll be there and so
                    will the top brass from the company. We have some presentations and demonstrations we'd
                    like to show you while you're there, no obligation of course, and then you're free to spend the
                    rest of the time however you'd like."

                    "I appreciate the offer. Thanks for thinking of me, but no thanks. I'm on the selection com-
                    mittee for the RFP, and it would be a conflict of interest if I attended this conference. Besides,
                    the value of the conference is over the $100 limit our company sets for vendor gifts and
                    meals," Amanda says.

                    "Okay. We'll miss you. Maybe next time."

                                                                   Applying Professional Knowledge           471




                                   You probably remember something your mother always told you: Actions
                                   speak louder than words. Always remember that you lead by example. Your
                                   team members are watching. If you are driven by high personal ethics and a
                                   strong desire to produce excellent customer service, those who work for you
                                   will likely follow your lead.




             Applying Professional Knowledge
             Professional knowledge involves the knowledge of project management practices as well as spe-
             cific industry or technical knowledge required to complete an assignment.
                 As a PMP, you should apply project management knowledge to all your projects. Take the
             opportunity to educate others regarding project management practices by keeping others up-to-
             date on project management practices, training your team members to use the correct techniques,
             and informing stakeholders of the correct processes and then sticking to those processes through-
             out the course of the project. This isn't always easy, especially when the organization doesn't have
             any formal processes in place. But once the stakeholders see the benefits of good project manage-
             ment practices, they'll never go back to the "old" way of performing their projects.
                 One way to apply professional knowledge is to become and remain knowledgeable in project
             management best practices techniques. We'll look at this topic next along with a discussion of
             the PMP Code of Professional Conduct, becoming a PMI education provider, and the impor-
             tance of having industry knowledge.


             Project Management Knowledge
             Project management is a growing field. Part of your responsibility as a PMP is to stay abreast
             of project management practices, theories, and techniques. There are many ways to do this, one of
             which includes joining a local PMI chapter. There are hundreds of local chapters in every state
             and in other countries as well. You can check the PMI website (www.pmi.org) to find a chapter
             near you.
                 Chapter meetings give you the opportunity to meet other project managers, find out what
             techniques they're using, and seek advice regarding your project. Usually guest speakers appear
             at each chapter meeting and share their experiences and tips. Their stories are always interesting,
             and they give you the opportunity to learn from someone else's experiences and avoid making
             wrong turns on your next project. You may have a few stories of your own worth sharing with
             your local chapter. Volunteer to be a speaker at an upcoming meeting and let others learn
             from your experiences.
                 One of the things you'll get when you join the PMI organization and pay your yearly dues
             is their monthly magazine. This publication details real-life projects and the techniques and
             issues project managers have to deal with on those projects. Reading the magazine is a great way

                    472         Chapter 12           Professional Responsibility



                    to learn new project management techniques or reinforce the information you already know.
                    You might discover how to apply some of the knowledge you've already learned in more effi-
                    cient ways as well.
                       PMI offers educational courses through their local chapters and at the national level as well.
                    These are yet another way for you to learn about project management and meet others in your field.
                       Next we'll look your responsibility for accurately and honestly reporting the level of knowledge
                    and qualifications you possess, what an education provider is, and why industry knowledge is
                    important.

                    Professional Conduct
                    We talked about honesty earlier in this chapter, but it's worth repeating: Don't mislead others
                    regarding your experience in the project management field. The PMP Code of Professional
                    Conduct requires that you honestly report your qualifications, your experience, and your past
                    performance of services to potential employers, customers, PMI, and others.
                       Be honest about what you know and what you don't know. For example, the Quality
                    Control processes as described in A Guide to the PMBOK are used extensively in the man-
                    ufacturing industry. However, the information technology field looks at quality issues in
                    different ways. If you're a project manager in the information technology field, you've
                    probably never used control charts and cause-and-effect diagramming techniques. Don't
                    lead others to believe that you have used techniques you haven't used or that you have expe-
                    rience you don't have.
                       Emphasize the knowledge you do have and how you've used it in your specific industry and
                    don't try to fudge it with processes and techniques you've never used. Potential clients and
                    employers would much rather work with you and provide training where you might need it than
                    think they've got someone fully experienced with the project or industry techniques needed for
                    a project when they don't.
                       If you're working on contract or you're self-employed, you have a responsibility to ensure
                    that the estimates you provide potential customers are accurate and truthful. Make certain you
                    clearly spell out what services you're providing and let the customer know the results they can
                    expect at the end of the project. Accurately represent yourself, your qualifications, and your
                    estimates in your advertising and in person.

                    Education Providers
                    PMI has a program that allows you or your organization to become a Registered Education Pro-
                    vider (R.E.P.). This allows you--once you're certified--to conduct PMI-sanctioned project
                    management training, seminars, and conferences. The best part is that your attendees are
                    awarded professional development units (PDUs) for attending the training or seminar. As a
                    PMP, and especially as an R.E.P., you have a responsibility to the profession and to PMI to pro-
                    vide truthful information regarding the PMI certification process, the exam applications, PDU
                    requirements, and so on. Keep up-to-date on PMI's certification process by periodically check-
                    ing the website.

                                                                    Applying Professional Knowledge              473




             Industry Knowledge
             Contributing and applying professional knowledge goes beyond project management experi-
             ence. You likely have specific industry or technical experience as well. Part of applying your
             professional knowledge includes gaining knowledge of your particular industry and keeping
             others informed of advances in these areas.
                 Information technology has grown exponentially over the last several years. It used to be that if
             you specialized in network operations, for example, it was possible to learn and become proficient
             in all things related to networks. Today that is no longer the case. Each specialized area within infor-
             mation technology has grown to become a knowledge area in and of itself. Many other fields have
             either always had individual specialties or just recently experienced this phenomenon, including the
             medical field, bioengineering, manufacturing, pharmaceuticals, and so on. You need to stay up-to-
             date regarding your industry so that you can apply that knowledge effectively. Today's fast-paced
             advances can leave you behind fairly quickly if you don't stay on top of things.
                 I mentioned in the beginning of the book that as a project manager you are not required to
             be a technical expert, and that still holds true. But it doesn't hurt to stay abreast of industry
             trends and knowledge in your field and have a general understanding of the specifics of your
             business. Again, you can join industry associations and take educational classes to stay on top
             of breaking trends and technology in your industry.


             Truthful Reporting
             As a project manager, you are responsible for truthfully reporting all information in your pos-
             session to stakeholders, customers, the project sponsor, and the public. Always be up front
             regarding the project's progress.


                                   Nothing good will come of telling stakeholders or customers that the project is
                                   on track and everything looks great when in fact the project's behind schedule
                                   or several unplanned risks have occurred that have thrown the project team a
                                   curveball. I've personally witnessed the demise of the careers of project man-
                                   agers who chose this route.

                Tell the truth regarding project status, even when things don't look good. Stakeholders will
             likely go to great lengths to help you solve problems or brainstorm solutions. Sometimes,
             though, the call needs to be made to kill the project. This decision is usually made by the project
             sponsor and/or the stakeholders based on your recommendation and predictions of future
             project activities. Don't skew the reporting to prevent stakeholders from making this decision
             when it is the best solution based on the circumstances.
                Truthful reporting is required when working with the public as well. When working in sit-
             uations where the public is at risk, truthfully report the facts of the situation and what steps
             you're taking to counteract or reduce the threats. I recommend you get approval from the orga-
             nization regarding public announcements prior to reporting the facts. Many organizations have
             public relations departments that will handle this situation for you.

                    474         Chapter 12           Professional Responsibility




                    Laws and Regulations Compliance
                    This may seem obvious, but since it's part of the PMP Code of Professional Conduct, we'll men-
                    tion it here. As a professional, you're required to follow all applicable laws and rules and regula-
                    tions that apply to your industry, organization, or project. This includes PMI organizational rules
                    and policies as well. You should also follow any ethical standards and principles that may govern
                    your industry or the state or country you're working in. Remember that rules or regulations you're
                    used to in the United States may or may not apply to other countries and vice versa.
                        As a PMP, one of the responsibilities that falls into this category is the responsibility to report
                    violations of the PMP code of conduct. In order to maintain integrity of the profession, PMPs
                    must adhere to the code of conduct that makes all of us accountable to each other.
                        When you know a violation has occurred and you've verified the facts, notify PMI. Part of
                    this process--and a requirement of the code of conduct--is that you'll comply with ethics vio-
                    lations and will assist PMI in the investigation by supplying information, confirming facts and
                    dates, and so on. Violations include anything listed in the PMP Code of Professional Conduct,
                    such as conflicts of interest, untruthful advertising and reporting of PMP experience and cre-
                    dentials, and so on, as well as appearances of impropriety. This one calls for some judgment on
                    your part, but it's mostly based on common sense. For example, a PMP in most situations
                    should not have a family member working on the project team reporting to them (unless they
                    own and run a family business).


                    Confidential Information
                    Many project managers work for consulting firms where their services are contracted out to
                    organizations that need their expertise for particular projects. If you work in a situation like
                    this, you will likely come across information that is sensitive or confidential. Again, this may
                    seem obvious, but as part of the PMP Code of Professional Conduct, you agree not to disclose
                    sensitive or confidential information or use it in any way for personal gain.
                       Often when you work under contract, you'll be required to sign a nondisclosure agreement.
                    This agreement simply says that you will not share information regarding the project or the
                    organization with anyone--including the organization's competitors--or use the information
                    for your personal gain.
                       However, you don't have to work on contract to come into contact with sensitive or private
                    information. You may work full-time for an organization or a government agency that deals with
                    information regarding its customer base or citizens. For example, if you work for a bank, you may
                    have access to personal account information. If you work for a government agency, you may have
                    access to personal tax records or other sensitive material. It would be highly unethical and maybe
                    even illegal to look up the account information of individuals not associated with the project at
                    hand just to satisfy your own curiosity. In my organization, that is grounds for dismissal.


                                           Don't compromise your ethics or your organization's reputation by sharing
                                           information that is confidential to the organization or would jeopardize an indi-
                                           vidual's privacy.

             Company Data
             While it may seem obvious that you should not use personal information or an organization's
             trade secrets for personal gain, sometimes the organization has a legitimate need to share infor-
             mation with vendors, governmental agencies, or others. You need to determine which vendors
             or organizations are allowed to see sensitive company data. In some cases, you may even need
             to determine which individuals can have access to the data. When in doubt, ask.
                Here are some examples. Maybe the company you're working with has periodic mailings it
             sends to its customer base. If one of your project activities includes finding a new vendor to print
             the mailing labels, your organization may require the vendor to sign a nondisclosure agreement
             to guard the contents of the customer lists. Discovering just who should have access to this
             information might be tricky.
                Another example involves data on citizens that is maintained by the government. You might
             think that because the data belongs to one agency of the government--say the Internal Revenue
             Service--any other agency of the government can have access to it. This isn't the case. Some
             agencies are refused access to the data even though they may have good reason to use it. Others
             may have restricted access, depending on the data and the agency policy regarding it. Don't
             assume that others should have access to data because it seems logical.
                Most organizations require vendors or other organizations to sign nondisclosure agreements
             when the vendors or others will have access to sensitive company data. It's your responsibility
             to ensure that the proper nondisclosure agreements are signed prior to releasing the data. This
             function is often handled by the procurement department.

             Intellectual Property
             You are likely to come into contact with intellectual property during the course of your project
             management career. Intellectual property includes items developed by an organization that have
             commercial value but are not tangible and copyrighted material such as books, software, and
             artistic works. It may also include ideas or processes that are patented. Or it might involve an
             industrial process, business process, or manufacturing process that was developed by the orga-
             nization for a specific purpose.
                Intellectual property is owned by the business or person that created it. You may have to pay
             royalties or ask for written permission to use the property. Intellectual property should be
             treated just like sensitive or confidential data. It should not be used for personal gain or shared
             with others who should not have access to it.



             Balancing Stakeholders' Interests
             Projects are undertaken at the request of customers, project sponsors, executive managers, and
             others. Stakeholders are those who have something to gain or lose by implementing the project.
             As such, stakeholders have different interests and needs, and one of your jobs is to balance the
             needs of the stakeholders.

                    476         Chapter 12           Professional Responsibility



                       Customer satisfaction is probably the primary goal you're striving for in any project. If your
                    customer is satisfied, it means you've met or exceeded their expectations and delivered the product
                    or service they were expecting. You've got a winning combination when the customer is satisfied
                    with the product, and you've also provided excellent customer service along the way. Satisfied cus-
                    tomers tell others about your success and will most likely use your services in the future.
                       One of the key ways to assure that customer satisfaction is achieved is to apply appropriate
                    project management techniques to your project. This includes taking the time to discover all the
                    requirements of the project and documenting them in the scope statement. You will find that
                    stakeholders who have a clear understanding of the requirements and have signed off on them
                    won't suffer from faulty memory and pull the ever famous "I thought that was included" tech-
                    nique. Take the time to define your requirements and get stakeholder sign-off. You can't forget
                    or fudge what's written down.
                       In the following sections we'll discuss juggling the competing needs of stakeholders, how to
                    handle the issues and problems with stakeholders, and finally how to balance project con-
                    straints against stakeholder needs.


                    Competing Needs
                    Stakeholders come from all areas of the organization and include your customer as well. Because
                    stakeholders do not all work in the same areas, they have competing needs and interests. One
                    stakeholder's concern on a typical IT project might take the form of system security issues, while
                    another stakeholder is concerned about ease of use. As the project manager, you will have situa-
                    tions in which stakeholder needs compete with each other, and you'll have to decide between them
                    and set priorities. Sometimes you'll be able to accommodate their needs, and sometimes you'll
                    have to choose. You need to examine the needs against the project objectives and then use your
                    negotiation and communication skills to convince the stakeholders of priorities.
                       Individual stakeholders may or may not have good working relationships with other stake-
                    holders. Because of this, office politics will come into play. I advise you to stay away from the
                    politics game but get to know your stakeholders. You'll need to understand their business pro-
                    cesses and needs in order to make decisions about stakeholder requirements.


                    Dealing with Issues and Problems
                    Problems will occur on your project--it's part of the process. We've talked throughout this
                    book about how to deal with problems and risks and how to use conflict resolution techniques
                    in handling problems. Balancing stakeholder needs comes into play here also.
                       You'll have to determine alternatives that will meet the key requirements of the project with-
                    out jeopardizing the competing needs of stakeholders. Once you're into the Executing processes
                    of the project and beyond, redefining scope becomes less and less of an option. So your respon-
                    sibility is to resolve issues and determine alternative solutions to problems as they occur without
                    changing the original objectives of the project. Enlist the help of your project team members and
                    stakeholders during these times. Use some of the techniques we talked about in Chapter 5,
                    "Risk Planning," like brainstorming and the Delphi technique, to find solutions.
3601.book Page 477 Tuesday, July 12, 2005 11:17 PM




                                                                   Balancing Stakeholders' Interests              477




                You may also have difficulty trying to make stakeholders understand your decision or the
             technical nature of a problem. Again, this is where communication skills help you immensely.
             Take the case of a technical problem that's cropped up on your project. You should not expect
             your stakeholder to understand the technical aspects of rocket science if they work in the
             finance department, for example. It's up to you to keep the explanation at a level they can
             understand without loading them down with technical jargon and specifications. Keep your
             explanations simple, yet don't skip important details they'll need to make decisions.


             Balancing Constraints
             Your toughest issues will almost always center on the triple constraints: time, cost, and quality.
             Because of the very nature of the constraints, one of these is the primary driver and one is the
             least important. Keep a close eye on stakeholders who want to switch the priority of the con-
             straints for their own purposes. Let's say the project sponsor already told you that time is the
             primary constraint. Another stakeholder tells you that a requirement of the project is being
             overlooked and quality is suffering. Be careful that the stakeholder isn't trying to divert the pri-
             mary constraint from time to quality to suit their own objectives.




             The Geographic Information System

             Ryan Loveland is a project manager for a multinational company. He's working on a complex
             software project that involves rewriting the organization's mainframe accounting system to
             become a browser-based system running on thin-client architecture. A major problem with the
             existing system occurs when new accounts are entered into the system or account information
             changes. The accounts are tied to geographic areas, which are assigned to individual sales asso-
             ciates. Sales commissions are paid based on where the account resides. To date, the process of
             determining which territory an account belongs to has been done manually by looking at a map.

             The project sponsor, Victor, requested a geographic information system (GIS) as part of the
             requirements of this project. The hope is that errors will be eliminated and commissions will
             get processed correctly. The sponsor is hoping that Ryan's internal team can write the GIS sys-
             tem that will tie to the accounting system. Let's drop in on Ryan and Victor's conversation.

             "I just don't understand," Victor says. "I can go onto that Internet site and plug in an address
             and get directions and a map detailing those directions from my house to anywhere in the
             country. It seems easy enough to me. Why can't your team write code like that?"

              "It isn't that we can't write a program to do that. But there are several issues surrounding this
             request that I'd like to explain to you. I'd like you to understand why I'm asking to purchase a
             software product from an external vendor that will take care of these functions for us."

             "Let's hear it," Victor says.
3601.book Page 478 Tuesday, July 12, 2005 11:17 PM




                    478         Chapter 12           Professional Responsibility




                    "One of the first problems is that our sales force is multinational. It would take us months just
                    to obtain address information to populate the program. The second issue is that our sales dis-
                    tricts are not divided by any known boundaries. Most GIS systems work off of latitude and lon-
                    gitude or geographic boundaries like county borders or zip code boundaries."

                    Victor interrupts, "Well, here's what we do. You give me a set of maps and I'll hand-draw in the
                    sales districts and then you can scan it into the system."

                    "Unfortunately, it's not that easy. Our sales district boundaries are not consistent with known
                    boundaries, and our existing address database is not standardized. For example, some addresses
                    use the word Street spelled out; some use the abbreviation St. All of the addresses need to be stan-
                    dardized, and then we have to figure out which addresses belong to which territory.

                    "This process could take a great deal of time. There are vendors that specialize in GIS systems
                    that could have us operational in a matter of weeks. I've already checked on a couple of the top
                    vendors, and there aren't any problems interfacing with our new system. The time we'd save
                    in the long run far outweighs the cost associated with purchasing this system from a vendor.
                    And one last point: If I were to build this system internally, I'd have to take our top program-
                    ming team off of existing project priorities to put them on this. GIS systems are extremely com-
                    plicated. We're talking several months--if not a year or more delay--to get our programmers
                    up to speed on GIS techniques and then write the programs."

                    Victor says, "If we're talking about a major delay in the schedule as you say, we can at least look
                    at what these vendors have to offer. It's important that this system is accurate as well, and I
                    think I hear you saying, `Why reinvent the wheel.' Let's have a look at the costs."




                    Respecting Differences in Diverse Cultures
                    You have probably taken diversity or cultural differences training classes sometime during your
                    career. Most organizations today require diversity training for all employees and contractors.
                    Project managers who work on contract may find themselves taking these classes multiple
                    times, as companies want to ensure that every employee and contractor has taken their own ver-
                    sion of the class.
                       I won't attempt to repeat diversity training here, but I will point out some of the things you
                    should know about working in other countries and about working with people who have back-
                    grounds and belief systems that are different than yours. I'll also touch on training as a diversity
                    awareness tool and discuss how people's perceptions influence their reactions.


                    Global Competition
                    More and more companies compete in the global marketplace. As a result, project managers
                    with multinational experience are increasingly in demand. This requires a heightened awareness
                    of cultural influences and customary practices of the country where you're temporarily residing.
3601.book Page 479 Tuesday, July 12, 2005 11:17 PM




                                                         Respecting Differences in Diverse Cultures           479




                 If you are used to working in the U.S., for example, you know that our culture tends to value
             accomplishments and individualism. We tend to be informal and call each other by our first
             names, even if we've just met. Europeans tend to be more formal, using surnames instead of first
             names in a business setting, even when they know each other well. Their communication style
             is more formal than in the U.S., and while they tend to value individualism, they also value his-
             tory, hierarchy, and loyalty. The Japanese, on the other hand, tend to communicate indirectly
             and consider themselves part of a group, not as individuals. The Japanese value hard work and
             success, as most of us do.
                 One thing I've witnessed when working in foreign countries is U.S. citizens who try to force
             their own culture or customs on those with whom they're visiting or working. That isn't rec-
             ommended, and it generally offends those you're trying to impress. Don't expect others to con-
             form to your way of doing things, especially when you're in their country. You know the saying
             "When in Rome, do as the Romans do"? While you may not want to take that literally, the
             intent is good. For example, a quick kiss on both cheeks is a customary greeting in many coun-
             tries. If that is the case and it's how you're greeted, respond with the same.


             Culture Shock
             Working in a foreign country can bring about an experience called culture shock. When you've
             spent years acting certain ways and expecting normal, everyday events to follow a specific
             course of action, you might find yourself disoriented when things don't go as you expected. This
             is known as culture shock.
                 One of the ways you can avoid this is to read about the country you're going to work in
             before getting there. The Internet is a great resource for information like this. Your local library
             is another place to research customs and acceptable practices in foreign countries.
                 When in doubt about a custom or what you should do in a given situation, ask your hosts
             or a trusted contact from the company you'll be working with to help you out. People are people
             all over the world, and they love to talk about themselves and their culture. They're also gen-
             erally helpful, and they will respect you more for asking what's expected rather than acting as
             though you know what to do when you clearly do not.


             Respecting Your Neighbors
             Americans tend to run their lives at high speed and get right down to business when working
             with vendors or customers. It isn't unusual for a business person to board a plane in the morn-
             ing, show up at the client site and take care of business, and hop another flight to the next client
             site that night.
                 You'll find that this is not that common in many other countries. People in other countries
             will expect you to take time to get to know them first, building an atmosphere of trust and
             respect. Some cultures build relationships first and then proceed to business. And don't expect
             to do that relationship building in a few hours. It could take several days, depending on the cul-
             ture. They may even want you to meet their family and spend time getting to know them. Resist
             the urge to get right down to business if that's not customary in the culture because you'll likely
             spoil the deal or damage relationships past the point of repair.
3601.book Page 480 Tuesday, July 12, 2005 11:17 PM




                    480         Chapter 12           Professional Responsibility




                                           Spend time building relationships with others. Once an atmosphere of
                                           mutual trust and cooperation is established, all aspects of project planning
                                           and management--including negotiating and problem solving--are much
                                           easier to navigate.




                    Training
                    Sometimes you may find yourself working with teams of people from different countries or cul-
                    tures. Some team members might be from one country and some from another. The best way
                    to ensure that cultural or ethical differences do not hinder your project is to provide training for
                    all team members.
                        Team-building activities are ways to build mutual trust and respect and bond team members
                    with differing backgrounds. Choose activities that are nonoffensive and ones in which everyone
                    can participate.
                        Diversity training makes people aware of differences between cultures and ethnic groups,
                    and it helps them to gain respect and trust for those on their team. Provide training regarding
                    the project objectives and the company culture as well.


                                           Project objectives are why you are all together in the first place. Project objec-
                                           tives cut across cultural boundaries and keep everyone focused on the project
                                           and tasks at hand.




                    Perceiving Experiences
                    All of us see the world through our own experiences. Your experiences are not someone else's
                    experiences, and therefore what you perceive about a situation might be very different from
                    what others believe. Keep this in mind when it appears that a misunderstanding has occurred
                    or that someone you're working with didn't respond as you expected. This is especially true
                    when you're working with someone from another country. Always give others the benefit of
                    the doubt and ask for clarification if you think there is a problem. Put your feelings in check
                    temporarily and remember that what you think the other person means is not necessarily as
                    it appears.

             Project Case Study: New Kitchen Heaven Retail Store

             Jill Overstreet thought you did such a great job of managing this project that she's offered to
             buy you lunch at one of those upscale, white tablecloth-type French restaurants. The iced teas
             have just been delivered, and you and Jill are chatting about business.

             "I'm impressed with your project management skills. This store opening was the best on
             record. And you really kept Dirk in line--I admire that. He can be headstrong, but you had a way
             of convincing him what needed doing and then sticking to it."

             "Thanks," you reply. "I've got a few years of project management experience, so many of those
             lessons learned on previous projects helped me out with this project. I enjoy project manage-
             ment and read books and articles on the subject whenever I get the chance. It's nice when you
             can learn from others' mistakes and avoid making them yourself."

             Jill takes a long drink of tea. She glances at you over the top of her glass and pauses before set-
             ting it down. The look on her face implies she's sizing you up and deciding whether to tell you
             what's on her mind.

             "You know," Jill starts, "we almost didn't hire anyone for your position. Dirk wanted to do
             away with the project management role altogether. He had a real distaste for project manage-
             ment after our last project."

             "Why is that?"

             Jill explains, "The last project manager got involved in a conflict of interest situation. She was
             working on a project that involved updating and remodeling all the existing stores. Things like
             new fixtures, signs, shelving, display cases, and such were up for bid. And it was a very sizable
             bid. Not only did she accept an all-expenses-paid weekend visit to a resort town from one of the
             vendors bidding on the contract, she also revealed company secrets to them, some of which
             leaked to our competitors."

             Your mouth drops open. "I can't believe she would accept gifts like that from a vendor. And
             revealing company secrets is almost worse. Conflict of interest situations and not protecting
             intellectual property violate the code of professional conduct that certified PMPs agree to
             adhere to. I can understand why Dirk didn't want to hire another project manager. Behavior like
             that makes all project managers look bad."

             "I'm glad you kept things above board and won Dirk back over. The project management role
             is important to Kitchen Heaven, and I know your skills in this discipline are what made this
             project such a success."

                    "Jill, not only would I never compromise my own integrity through a conflict of interest situa-
                    tion, I would report the situation and the vendor to the project sponsor and to PMI as an ethics
                    violation. It's better to be honest and let the project sponsor or key stakeholders know what's
                    happening than to hide the situation or, even worse, compromise your own integrity by getting
                    involved in it in the first place. You have my word that I'll keep business interests above my own
                    personal interests. I'll report anything that even looks like it would call my actions into question
                    just to keep things honest and out in the open."

                    "That's good to hear," Jill replies. "Congratulations on your new assignment. Dirk and I were
                    discussing the new Home Chef Pro project yesterday. We're venturing into new territory with
                    this project, and I'm confident you'll do an excellent job heading it up. Dirk made a good
                    choice."

                    Summary
                    Project Management Professionals are responsible for reporting truthful information about
                    their PMP status and project management experience to prospective customers, clients, and
                    employers and to PMI. As a project manager, you're responsible for the integrity of the project
                    management process and the product. In all situations, you are responsible for your own per-
                    sonal integrity.
                       Personal integrity means adhering to an ethical standard. As a PMP, you'll be required to
                    adhere to the PMP Code of Professional Conduct established by PMI. Part of this code involves
                    avoiding putting your own personal gain above the project objectives.
                       As a professional, you should strive to maintain honesty in project reporting. You're
                    required to abide by laws, rules, and regulations regarding your industry and project manage-
                    ment practices. You should also report any instances that might appear to be a conflict of inter-
                    est. It's always better to inform others of an apparent conflict than to have it discovered by
                    others and have your methods called into question after the fact.

                You will very likely come across confidential information or intellectual property during
             your project management experiences. Respect the use of this information and always verify
             who may have permission to access the information and when disclosures are required.
                Stakeholders have competing needs and business issues and as such will sometimes cause
             conflict on your project. You will be required to balance the needs and interests of the stake-
             holders with the project objectives.
                Many project managers today are working in a global environment. It's important to respect
             and understand the cultural differences that exist and not try to impose your cultural beliefs on
             others. Culture shock is an experience that occurs when you find yourself in a different cultural
             environment than you're familiar with. Training is a good way to provide project team members
             with relationship management techniques regarding cultural and ethnic differences.



             Exam Essentials
             Be able to define integrity. Integrity means adhering to an ethical standard.
             Be able to name the ethical standard PMPs are required to adhere to. The ethical standard
             PMPs are required to adhere to is described in the PMP Code of Professional Conduct.
             Describe the areas in which PMPs must apply professional knowledge. PMPs must apply
             professional knowledge in the areas of project management practices, industry practices, and
             technical areas.
             Know the key activity that ensures customer satisfaction. The key activity that ensures cus-
             tomer satisfaction is documenting project requirements.
             Define how multinational project managers must manage relationships. Multinational
             project managers manage relationships by building relationships based on mutual trust and
             acceptance and recognizing and respecting diverse cultures and ethnic beliefs.



             Key Terms
             You've learned a lot of new key words in this chapter. PMI has worked hard to develop and
             define standard project management terms that apply across industries. Here is a list of some of
             the terms you came across in this chapter:

                     ceptable in your country.
                  D. Thank them and accept since you know that it would be considered offensive to decline the
                     gift in their culture. Immediately report the acceptance of the gift to the appropriate parties

                          D. Your friend doesn't see a problem with accepting these gifts at all. You know this is a conflict

                        project. She's discovered that one of her favorite superstars lives in the State of Bliss and there-
                        fore must file income tax returns in that state. She asks you to look up the account of this movie

                             company data.
                          C. Look up the information she's requested. Since the data is considered part of the project,
                             there is no conflict of interest.
                          D. You believe that tax records are public information, so you comply with the request.

                 of software is handled through the marketing department. A friend of yours is a certified soft-
                 ware instructor. They have asked you for a copy of the software prior to the beta release so they
                 can get familiar with it. What is the most appropriate response?
                  A. Since your friend is certified to teach your company's brand of software, provide them with
                     a copy of the software.
                  B. Ask them to sign a nondisclosure agreement before releasing a copy of the software.
                  C. Decline the request since you stand to gain from this transaction by receiving free training.
                  D. Decline the request because the software is the intellectual property of the company.

                    16. Your upcoming project includes project team members from a foreign country. In order to make
                        certain that cultural differences don't interfere with team performance, thereby affecting the suc-
                        cess of the project, your first course of action is to do which of the following?
                          A. Provide diversity training to all the team members.
                          B. Collocate the project team.
                          C. Perform team-building exercises.
                          D. Inform the team members of the organization's rules and standards.

                    17. You are a project manager for Pizza Direct, which is a retail pizza delivery store. Your company
                        is competing with another retail store for the option of opening two new stores in a foreign coun-
                        try. You have been invited to dinner with the prospective foreign business partners and their
                        spouses upon your arrival. You know that all of the following statements are generally true
                        except for which one?
                          A. You should spend time building relationships with your prospective foreign business part-
                             ners before getting down to business.
                          B. You should explain your company's rules, standards, and operating policies at your first
                             meeting with the prospective foreign business partners.
                          C. You should build an atmosphere of mutual trust and cooperation.
                          D. You should respect the cultural differences you'll encounter when working with your pro-
                             spective foreign business partners.

                    18. You are a project manager for Pizza Direct, which is a retail pizza delivery store. Your company
                        is competing with another retail store for the option of opening two new stores in a foreign coun-
                        try. You've been told that it is culturally unacceptable to eat certain foods in this country. You
                        know that one of these foods happens to be a secret ingredient in the pizza sauce. What is the
                        most appropriate response?
                          A. Inform the potential partners that your sauce recipe is secret but you're certain there are no
                             forbidden ingredients in it.
                          B. Inform the potential partners that you suspect there might be a forbidden ingredient in the
                             sauce and you'll request an investigation to determine if it exists in the sauce.
                          C. Inform the potential partners that a forbidden ingredient exists in the sauce and determine
                             to work with them to come up with another ingredient to replace that one.
                          D. Don't tell the potential partners about the ingredient because the sauce they'll be using in the
                             stores is shipped to them already prepared in cans. They won't know the ingredient is in the
                             sauce.

             19. You are a project manager for Pizza Direct, which is a retail pizza delivery store. Your company
                 is competing with another retail store for the option of opening two new stores in a foreign coun-
                 try. You know, but have not yet informed your company, that you are going to go to work for
                 the competitor, which happens to be bidding for this same opportunity. What is the most appro-
                 priate response?
                  A. You decline to participate in the initial meetings with the foreign business partners due to a
                     conflict of interest.
                  B. You've not yet received an official offer from the competing company for your new job
                     opportunity, so you choose to participate in the initial meetings with the foreign business
                     partners.
                  C. You decide to participate in the initial meetings with the foreign business partners because
                     any information you gain now will help you when you make the move to the new company.
                  D. You inform the foreign business partners that you're going to be working with a new com-
                     pany and that you know the deal they'll receive from the competing company is better than
                     the one this company is proposing.

             20. You are the project manager for a new construction project in your city. Your longtime personal
                 friend is bidding on the project. They've asked you to give them an indication of the budget for
                 this project so that they do not overbid and lose the deal. What is the most appropriate response?
                  A. Give the information to your friend. You know their character and can trust that they won't
                     tell anyone.
                  B. Tell your friend that after all this time, they should know you better than to think you'd put
                     your personal integrity on the line or compromise your job due to a conflict of interest.
                     Decline to give them the information.
                  C. Tell your friend you'll give them the information if they'll promise not to tell anyone and if
                     they'll agree to help you out with some materials on your basement-refinishing project.
                  D. Give the information to your friend and inform the project sponsor so that the information
                     can be shared with the other bidders as well.

                    490         Chapter 12           Professional Responsibility




                    Answers to Review Questions
                    1.    A. You are not responsible for the personal integrity of others, but as project manager you do
                          have influence over others, such as your project team members.

                    2.    C. Integrity means you'll honestly report project outcomes and status. Your personal gain
                          should not be placed above the satisfaction of the customer.

                    3.    A. Diversity training is used to help you manage project teams that are made up of people from
                          other countries or cultures. Integrity is accomplished by following an ethical code and applying
                          project management practices.

                    4.    D. The best answer to this problem is to develop alternative solutions to address design error.
                          Reducing technical requirements might be an alternative solution, but it's not one you'd imple-
                          ment without looking at all the alternatives. Ignoring the error and going forward with produc-
                          tion will result in an unsatisfactory product for the customer.

                    5.    A. A luncheon date could be considered a conflict of interest prior to awarding a contract to a
                          vendor. Consider what a competitor of this vendor would think if they spotted you having lunch
                          together.

                    6.    B. The best response to this situation is to thank the vendor and decline based on the fact that
                          this could be considered personal gain on your part. Answer D may seem correct, but remember,
                          you're not responsible for the integrity of others. And it's often common business practice for
                          vendors to offer gifts to potential customers.

                    7.    D. The best response in this case is to accept the gift because it would cause great offense to the
                          other party if you were to decline. Report the gift and the circumstances as soon as possible to
                          the appropriate parties at your company.

                    8.    D. This is a conflict of interest situation and should be reported as a violation of the PMP Code
                          of Professional Conduct.

                    9.    A. Documenting the requirements is one of the key things you can do to ensure customer satis-
                          faction. The requirements describe what the customer is looking for, and the final product is
                          compared against them to determine if all of the requirements were met.

                    10. C. Stakeholder requirements are needed to determine if the project is successful and are not a
                        part of the professional code.

                    11. B. The situation presented here requires you to put the interest of the company and the confi-
                        dentiality of the data above your own personal interests or those of your stakeholders. Option
                        D is not the most correct response because it says you believe the information is public. This
                        implies you haven't verified whether the data is private or public. Until you know, treat the data
                        as confidential. In this case, the information is confidential and should be shared only with those
                        who have a valid reason for using it.

                                                                         Answers to Review Questions              491




             12. C. As project manager, it's your responsibility to make sure the people you will be sharing data
                 with have the proper permissions to see the data; this question indicated that you did that. In this
                 case, option D is not correct because it implies that you did not verify ahead of time that the
                 stakeholder had the proper level of approvals to use the data.

             13. A. Applying professional knowledge involves staying abreast of project management practices,
                 industry trends, and new technology and honestly reporting your experiences.

             14. D. Culture shock is the disoriented feeling that people may experience when working in a for-
                 eign country.

             15. D. The most appropriate response is to deny the request. Software is considered intellectual
                 property and should not be used for personal gain or given to others without prior consent from
                 the organization. This question states that the release of the beta software is handled through the
                 marketing department, so you should not give your friend a copy of the software outside of this
                 process.

             16. A. The most correct response is to first provide training to your team members to teach them
                 how to respect and work with others from different cultures. Collocation may not be possible
                 when you're working with team members from two different countries. Team-building exercises
                 are a good idea as well but are not your first course of action.

             17. B. Your first meeting with foreign partners should be spent getting to know them on a personal
                 basis. Many cultures like to spend time building relationships first and then talking business.
                 Since you've been invited to dinner upon your arrival and the dinner includes the spouses of your
                 prospective partners, chances are they want to spend some time getting to know you personally
                 first. Discussion of the company's rules, standards, and operating policies should occur at the
                 second or third meeting.

             18. C. The most appropriate response is to inform the potential partners that an ingredient exists in
                 the sauce that is not acceptable and determine to come up with a solution to the problem. As a
                 professional, you're required to be honest in your reporting. Not telling them, or stalling by
                 promising an investigation, is not an honest response.

             19. A. The most appropriate response is to decline to participate due to a conflict of interest.

             20. B. This situation is clearly a conflict of interest and should be avoided. Decline to provide your
                 friend this information.

             Close Project This process is concerned with gathering and disseminating information to for-
             malize project closure. The completion of each project phase requires administrative closure also.
             Closing The last of the five project management process groups. Closing brings a formal,
             orderly end to the activities of a project phase or to the project itself. All the project information
             is gathered and archived for future reference. Contract closeout occurs here, and formal accep-
             tance and approval are obtained from project stakeholders.

             configuration management Documented procedures that describe how to submit change
             requests and how to manage change requests. Configuration management tracks the status of
             change requests and defines the level of authority needed to approve changes. It describes the
             characteristics of the product of the project and ensures that the description is accurate and
             complete. Configuration management controls changes to the characteristics of an item and
             tracks the changes made or requested and their status.

                    other party from attaining their goals.
                    conflict of interest Conflict of interest occurs when personal interests are put above the inter-
                    ests of the project. It also occurs when personal influence is used to cause others to make deci-
                    sions in favor of the influencer without regard for the project outcome.
                    confrontation Confrontation is a conflict resolution technique also known as problem
                    solving. This technique involves discovering all the facts related to the conflict. Once all the facts
                    are known, a solution will become clear. This is the preferred method of conflict resolution.

             fixed price contract This type of contract sets a specific, firm price for the goods or services
             rendered based on a well-defined deliverable agreed upon by the buyer and seller. The biggest
             risk is borne by the seller with a fixed price contract.
             fixed price plus incentive contract This type of contract sets a specific, firm price for the
             goods or services rendered (like the fixed price contract) and includes an extra incentive for
             exceeding agreed-upon performance criteria.
             float The amount of time you can delay the early start of a task without delaying the finish
             date of the project. This is also known as slack time.
             float time See float.

             force majeure Catastrophic risks that are outside the scope of risk management planning
             such as earthquakes, meteorites, volcanoes, floods, civil unrest, and terrorism. This is referenced
             in the risk categories section of the Risk Identification process.
             forcing A conflict resolution technique where one person forces a solution on the other parties.

             formal acceptance and closure Formal acceptance and closure involves providing formal
             notice to the seller--usually in written form--that the contract is complete. It's the organiza-
             tion's way of formally accepting the product of the project from the vendor and closing out the
             contract. This is an element of both the Close Project and Contract Closure processes.

             start of a successor task.
             functional organization A form of organizational structure. Functional organizations are tra-
             ditional organizations with hierarchical reporting structures. The functional manager tradition-
             ally has more authority in this type of organization than the project manager has.

             ative lessons.
             logical relationships Dependencies between two project activities whereby one activity must
             do something (finish or start) before another activity can do something (start or finish). Logical
             relationships can also exist between an activity and a milestone. These are also known as pre-
             cedence relationships. The four types of logical relationships are finish-to-start, finish-to-finish,
             start-to-start, start-to-finish.

             tive action. These are inputs to the Direct and Manage Project Execution process.
             probability The likelihood that an event will occur.

             probability and impact matrix The probability and impact matrix defines the combination of
             probability and impact that helps determine which risks need detailed risk response plans. It's
             defined during the Risk Management Planning process and included in the risk management plan.
             The matrix is used in the Qualitative Risk Analysis process to assign an overall risk rating to each
             of the project's identified risks. The combination of probability and impact results in a classification
             usually expressed as high, medium, or low. High risks are considered a red condition, medium risks
             are considered a yellow condition, and low risks are considered a green condition.

                    procurement audits A tool and technique of the Contract Closure process that examines the
                    procurement processes to determine the effectiveness of the processes. Procurement audits are
                    performed on all the Project Procurement Management Knowledge Area processes except the
                    Contract Closure process.
                    procurement documents Procurement documents are prepared in the Plan Contracting pro-
                    cess and are used to solicit vendors and suppliers to bid on project procurement needs. They
                    might be called request for proposal (RFP), request for information (RFI), invitation for bid
                    (IFB), or request for quotation (RFQ).

                    value analysis, function analysis, quality function deployment, product breakdown analysis,
                    systems engineering techniques, value engineering, and function deployment techniques to fur-
                    ther define and better understand the product or service of the project. This is a tool and tech-
                    nique of the Scope Definition process.

                    accurately and satisfactorily. It's one of the purposes of the Contract Closure process.
                    Program Evaluation and Review Technique (PERT) PERT uses expected value--or
                    weighted average--of critical path tasks to determine project duration by establishing three esti-
                    mates: most likely, pessimistic, and optimistic. PERT is used when activity duration estimates
                    are highly uncertain.

             ities and assigns resources to the activities.
             project scope The project scope describes the work required to produce the product or the
             service of the project. This includes the requirements of the product, which describe the features
             and functionality of the product or service.
             Project Scope Management One of the nine knowledge areas of project management.
             Project Scope Management is concerned with the work of the project and only the work that is
             required to complete the project. Its processes include Scope Planning, Scope Definition, Create
             WBS, Scope Verification, and Scope Control.
             project scope management plan The project scope management plan has a direct influence
             on the project's success and describes the process for defining project scope and verifying the
             work of the project. It facilitates the creations of the WBS, describes how the product or service
             of the project is verified and accepted, and documents how changes to scope will be handled.
             It is an output of the Scope Planning process.
             project scope statement The project scope statement documents the project objectives,
             deliverables, and requirements, which are used as a basis for future project decisions. It also
             includes other elements, such product scope description, project boundaries, product accep-
             tance criteria, constraints, assumptions, project organization, risks, milestones, fund limita-
             tions, cost estimate, configuration management requirements, project specifications, and
             approval requirements.

                    Qualitative Risk Analysis This process determines what impact the identified risks will have on
                    the project and the probability that they'll occur and puts the risks in priority order according to
                    their effect on the project objectives.
                    quality audits Quality audits are independent reviews performed by trained auditors or third-
                    party reviewers. The purpose of a quality audit is to identify ineffective and inefficient processes
                    used on the project. Audits may also examine and uncover inefficient processes and procedures.
                    Quantitative Risk Analysis This process assigns numeric probabilities to each identified risk
                    and examines their potential impact to the project objectives.

                    RACI chart A matrix-based chart that shows the type of resource and their responsibility on
                    the project. RACI stands for responsible, accountable, consult, and inform. This is a tool and
                    technique of the Human Resource Planning process.
                    recognition and rewards A tool and technique of the Develop Project Team process, recog-
                    nition and rewards systems are formal ways for the management team and the project manager
                    to recognize and promote desirable behavior.
                    records management system A records management system is a tool and technique of the
                    Contract Administration process and involves documenting policies, control functions, and
                    automated tools used to manage project documents and contract documents. A records man-
                    agement system is part of the project management information system.
                    Request Seller Responses This process involves obtaining bids and proposals from vendors
                    in response to RFPs and similar documents prepared during the Plan Contracting process.
                    requirements The specifications of the objective or deliverable that must be met in order to
                    satisfy the needs of the project. Requirements may also describe results or outcomes that must
                    be produced in order to satisfy a contract, specification, standard, or other project document
                    (typically the scope statement). Requirements quantify and prioritize the wants, needs, and

             resource calendars Calendars are an input to the Schedule Development process. Resource
             calendars refer to specific resources--or categories of resources--and their individual (or
             group) availability.
             resource leveling Resource leveling attempts to smooth out the resource assignments so that
             tasks are completed without overloading the individual and without negatively affecting the
             project schedule. Some ways to perform resource leveling include delaying the start of a task to
             match the availability of a key team member or giving more tasks to underallocated team mem-
             bers. Resource leveling is also known as resource-based method.
             resource-based method See resource leveling.

             resources The people, equipment, and materials needed to complete the work of the project.

             Responsibility Assignment Matrix (RAM) The RAM ties roles and responsibilities with the
             WBS elements to ensure that each element has a resource assigned.
             reverse resource allocation scheduling A resource-leveling technique used when key
             resources are required at a specific point in the project and they are the only resources available
             to perform these activities. Reverse resource allocation scheduling requires that the resources be
             scheduled in reverse order, that is, from the end date of the project rather than from the begin-
             ning, in order to assign key resources at the correct time.
             revisions Adjustments to approved schedule start and end dates for activities to coincide with
             approved changes and/or corrective actions. This is another term for schedule updates.
             rework Failing to meet quality requirements or standards may result in rework (performing
             the work again to make it conform). Rework may increase the project schedule.
             risk breakdown structure (RBS) An RBS is a graphical way to display risk categories and
             their subcategories. The RBS is an element of the risk management plan.
             risk categories Risk categories systematically identify risks and provide a foundation for
             understanding. The use of risk categories helps improve the Risk Identification process by
             giving everyone involved a common language or basis for describing risk. Risk categories are an
             element of the risk management plan.
             risk identification This process identifies the potential project risks and documents their
             characteristics.
             risk management plan Describes how risks are defined, monitored, and controlled
             throughout the project. The risk management plan is a subsidiary of the project management
             plan and it's the only output of the Risk Management Planning process.
             Risk Management Planning This process determines how risks will be managed for a project.

             Risk Monitoring and Control This process involves responding to risks as they occur. The
             risk management plan details how risk is managed, and the risk response plan details how risk
             response strategies are implemented in the event of an actual risk event. This process imple-
             ments risk response according to the plan.

                    risk register The output of the Risk Identification process that contains the list of identified
                    risks. The risk register is updated and its update becomes an output of every remaining Risk pro-
                    cess. At the end of the Risk Response Planning process, the risk register contains these elements:
                    list of identified and prioritized risks, risk owners and their responsibilities, risk triggers,

                    Risk Response Planning This process defines what steps to take to reduce threats and take
                    advantage of opportunities and assigns departments or individual staff members the responsi-
                    bility of carrying out the risk response plans developed in this process.
                    risk tolerance Risk tolerance is the level at which stakeholders are comfortable taking a risk
                    because the benefits to be gained outweigh what could be lost or at which risks are avoided because
                    the cost is too great.

                    variable, which is an output, to display the relationship between these two elements as points
                    on a graph.
                    schedule baseline The approved project schedule serves as the schedule baseline that will be
                    used in the Executing and Monitoring and Controlling processes to measure schedule process.
                    schedule change control system Defines how changes to the schedule are made and man-

                    schedule without changing the project scope. Compression is simply shortening the project schedule
                    to accomplish all the activities sooner than estimated. Crashing and fast tracking are two examples
                    of schedule compressions.
                    Schedule Control This process involves documenting and managing changes to the project
                    schedule.
                    Schedule Development This process calculates and prepares the schedule of project activi-
                    ties, which becomes the schedule baseline. It determines activity start and finish dates, finalizes
                    activity sequences and durations, and assigns resources to activities.

             schedule network analysis This technique of Schedule Development creates the project
             schedule. It uses a schedule model and other analytical techniques such as critical path and crit-
             ical chain method, what-if analysis, and resource leveling (all of which are other tools and tech-
             niques in this process) to help calculate these dates and the project schedule.
             schedule performance index (SPI) A performance index that calculates schedule perfor-
             mance efficiencies. SPI = EV / PV
             schedule updates Schedule updates are an output of the Schedule Control process and
             involve adjusting activities and dates to coincide with approved changes and/or corrective
             actions.
             schedule variance (SV) An earned value analysis technique that determines if the project
             schedule is ahead or behind what was planned for a given period of time. SV = EV - PV
             scope All of the components that make up the product or service of the project and the results
             the project intends to produce.
             Scope Control This process involves documenting and managing changes to project scope.
             Any modification to the agreed-upon WBS is considered a scope change. Changes in product
             scope will require changes to the project scope. (See also product scope and project scope.)
             Scope Definition This Planning process further elaborates the objectives and deliverables of
             the project into a project scope statement that's used as a basis for future project decisions.
             scope management plan See project scope management plan.

             Scope Planning The primary purpose of the Scope Planning process is to document the scope
             management plan. This is a planning tool that documents how the project team will go about
             defining project scope, how the work breakdown structure will be developed, how changes to
             scope will be controlled, and how project scope will be verified.
             scope statement See project scope statement.

             Scope Verification This process formalizes the acceptance of the project scope and is prima-
             rily concerned with the acceptance of work results.
             scoring model A project selection method used to score and rank project proposals. Project
             selection methods are a tool and technique of the Develop Project Charter process. Scoring
             models may also be used in the Select Seller process.
             screening systems A set of predetermined performance criteria used to screen vendors.
             Screening systems are a tool and technique of the Select Sellers process.
             secondary risks A risk that comes about as a result of implementing a risk response.

             Select Sellers This process involves the receipt of bids or proposals and choosing a vendor to
             perform the work or supply the goods or services.

                    seller invoices A request for payment of goods or services that should describe the work that
                    was completed or the materials that were delivered. Seller invoices are part of the Contract
                    Administration process.
                    seller rating systems Seller rating systems are a tool and technique of the Select Sellers pro-
                    cess. These systems use information about the sellers--such as past performance, delivery, con-
                    tract compliance, and quality ratings--to determine seller performance.
                    sensitivity analysis A quantitative method of analyzing the potential impact of risk events on
                    the project and determining which risk events have the greatest potential for impact by exam-
                    ining all the uncertain elements at their baseline values. This is a Quantitative Risk Analysis
                    modeling technique.
                    share Share is a Risk Response Planning strategy for risks that pose an opportunity to
                    the project.
                    should cost estimates See independent estimates.

                    slack time The amount of time you can delay the early start of a task without delaying the
                    finish date of the project. This is also known as float time.
                    smoothing Smoothing is a conflict resolution technique that is a temporary way to resolve
                    conflict where someone attempts to make the conflict appear less important than it is. This is
                    a temporary solution.
                    soft logic See discretionary dependencies.

                    stakeholder A person or organization who has a vested interest in the project and stands to
                    gain or lose something as a result of the project.
                    starvation A type of project ending where financial or human resources are cut off from
                    the project.
                    statistical sampling Taking a sample number of parts from the whole population and exam-
                    ining them to determine if they fall within the variances outlined by the quality control plan. Sta-
                    tistical sampling is a tool and technique of the Perform Quality Control process.
                    status review meetings Status meetings are a tool and technique of the Project Plan Execu-
                    tion process. The purpose of status meetings is to provide updated information regarding the
                    progress of the project. They are not show-and-tell meetings.
                    steering committee A group of high-level managers or executives in the organization who
                    manage project prioritization and various project decisions. The steering committee typically
                    represents functional areas or departments within the organization.

             T
             tailoring Determining which processes and process groups should be performed for the
             project. The project manager and project team should take into consideration the size and com-
             plexity of the project and the various inputs and outputs of each of the processes when deter-
             mining which ones to perform. It's generally accepted that performing all five process groups is
             good practice for any project.
             team building Team building activities are a tool and technique of the Develop Project Team
             process. They involve getting a diverse group of people to work together in the most efficient
             and effective manner possible.
             technical performance measurements These measurements are usually determined during
             trend analysis (which is used with the run chart tool and technique of the Perform Quality Con-
             trol process) to compare the technical accomplishments of project milestones completed to the
             technical milestones defined in the project Planning processes.
             Theory X A motivational management theory that proposes that most people do not like
             work and will try to steer clear of it. It postulates that people have little to no ambition, need
             constant supervision, and won't actually perform the duties of their job unless threatened.
             Theory Y A motivational management theory that proposes that people are interested in per-
             forming their best given the right motivation and proper expectations.
             three-point estimates Three-point estimates are a tool and technique of the Activity Dura-
             tion Estimating process used to determine activity estimates. The three estimates are the most
             likely estimate, an optimistic estimate, and a pessimistic estimate.
             time and materials (T&M) contract A type of contract that is a cross between the fixed price
             contract and the cost reimbursable contract. Preset unit rates are agreed to at contract signing,
             but costs are charged to the buyer as they're incurred.
             tolerable results Quality measurements that fall within a specified range. Tolerable results
             are a concern of the Perform Quality Control process. These are also known as tolerances.
             top-down estimating See analogous estimating.

             tornado diagram This is a diagramming method for sensitivity analysis data. The variables
             with the greatest effect on the project are displayed as horizontal bars at the top of the graph
             and decrease in impact as they progress down through the graph. This gives a quick overview
             of how much the project can be affected by uncertainty in the various elements and which risks
             have the greatest impact on the project.
             total float The amount of time the earliest start of a task can be delayed without delaying the
             ending of the project.
             training A tool and technique of the Develop Project Team process that improves the compe-
             tencies of the project team members.

                    transfer Transference is a strategy for negative risks or threats, which is a tool and technique
                    of the Risk Response Planning process. This strategy transfers the consequences of a risk to a
                    third party. Insurance is an example of transference.
                    triggers Risk symptoms that imply a risk event is about to occur.



                    V
                    variance at completion (VAC) An earned value analysis technique that calculates the differ-
                    ence between the budget at completion (BAC) and the estimate at completion (EAC).
                    VAC = BAC - EAC
                    virtual teams Virtual teams are teams that don't necessarily work in the same location but all
                    share the goals of the project and have a role on the project. This type of team allows the inclu-
                    sion of resources from different geographic locations, those who work different hours or shifts
                    from the other team members, those with mobility limitations, and so on.



                    W
                    weighted scoring model See weighting system.

                    weighting system A way to rank and score vendor proposals or project proposals. Weighting
                    systems assign numerical weights to evaluation criteria and then multiply this by the weight of
                    each criteria factor to come up with total scores for each project or vendor. These systems keep
                    personal biases to a minimum. Weighting systems are a tool and technique of the Selecting
                    Sellers process and a project selection method, which is a tool and technique of the Develop
                    Project Charter process.
                    withdrawal This conflict resolution technique occurs when one of the parties gets up and
                    leaves and refuses to discuss the conflict. This never results in resolution.
                    work authorization systems Work authorization systems clarify and initiate the work of
                    each work package or activity. This is a formal procedure that authorizes work to begin in the
                    correct sequence and at the right time. Work authorization systems are usually written proce-
                    dures defined by the organization. These are used in the Executing processes of the project.
                    work performance information Work performance information is an input to the Contract
                    Administration process. Work performance information is used to monitor work results and
                    examine the vendor's deliverables and compares their work results against the project manage-
                    ment plan. It also makes certain activities are performed correctly and in sequence.
                    workaround An unplanned response to a risk event that was unknown and unidentified or an
                    unplanned response to a risk that was previously accepted. Workaround plans are an element
                    of the Risk Monitoring and Control process.
